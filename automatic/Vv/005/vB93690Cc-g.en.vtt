00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.360 

in<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.800> lesson<00:00:02.010> we'll<00:00:02.190> learn<00:00:02.250> how

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
in this lesson we'll learn how

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.070 
in this lesson we'll learn how
fracturing<00:00:03.060> can<00:00:03.240> be<00:00:03.330> used<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.570> break<00:00:03.899> apart

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
fracturing can be used to break apart

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.030 
fracturing can be used to break apart
and<00:00:04.440> shatter<00:00:04.890> our<00:00:05.009> realflow<00:00:05.580> objects<00:00:06.980> okay<00:00:07.980> so

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
and shatter our realflow objects okay so

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.379 
and shatter our realflow objects okay so
for<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.370> example<00:00:08.429> I'm<00:00:08.940> just<00:00:09.090> going<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.269> start

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
for this example I'm just going to start

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.959 
for this example I'm just going to start
with<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.570> blank<00:00:09.780> scene<00:00:10.200> here<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:11.700> let's<00:00:11.880> go

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
with a blank scene here so let's go

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.610 
with a blank scene here so let's go
ahead<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.120> just<00:00:12.269> set<00:00:12.420> up<00:00:12.540> something<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:13.139> be

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
ahead and just set up something to be

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.470 
ahead and just set up something to be
able<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.830> use<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.519> we'll<00:00:14.670> start<00:00:14.849> with<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.030> basic

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
able to use so we'll start with a basic

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.109 
able to use so we'll start with a basic
plain<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.520> we'll<00:00:17.520> start<00:00:17.730> off<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:18.090> something

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
plain and we'll start off with something

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.300 
plain and we'll start off with something
like<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> cross<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:19.500> as<00:00:19.650> well<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.160> will

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
like a cross here as well so this will

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.920 
like a cross here as well so this will
be<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.550> actual<00:00:20.699> piece<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.060> geometry<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.779> we

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
be the actual piece of geometry that we

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.099 
be the actual piece of geometry that we
shatter<00:00:22.760> so<00:00:23.760> let's<00:00:24.029> go<00:00:24.150> ahead<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.390> we'll<00:00:24.840> take

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
shatter so let's go ahead and we'll take

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.630 
shatter so let's go ahead and we'll take
this<00:00:25.260> piece<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.529> geometry<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.369> move

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
this piece of geometry and just move

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.970 
this piece of geometry and just move
this<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:27.960> where<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.170> sitting<00:00:28.289> just<00:00:28.800> above

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
this up to where it's sitting just above

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.280 
this up to where it's sitting just above
this<00:00:29.310> ground<00:00:29.640> plane<00:00:29.929> so<00:00:30.949> something<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.000> 1.5

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
this ground plane so something like 1.5

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
this ground plane so something like 1.5
one<00:00:34.290> maybe<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.520> above<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.090> plane

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
one maybe so it's just above that plane

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.330 
one maybe so it's just above that plane
so<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.350> way<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.590> won't<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.890> very<00:00:38.100> far<00:00:38.309> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
so that way it won't have very far to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.650 
so that way it won't have very far to
fall<00:00:38.600> before<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.750> actually<00:00:39.809> makes<00:00:40.110> contact<00:00:41.660> so

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
fall before it actually makes contact so

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.549 
fall before it actually makes contact so
we<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.770> main<00:00:44.370> object<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.030> now<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
we have this main object here now to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.590 
we have this main object here now to
take<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:47.700> fracture<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
take this and actually fracture it it's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.330 
take this and actually fracture it it's
a<00:00:48.690> very<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.200> simple<00:00:49.379> process<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.100> just

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
a very very simple process so just

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.950 
a very very simple process so just
select<00:00:50.430> your<00:00:50.670> object<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.719> come<00:00:51.930> right

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
select your object and then come right

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.279 
select your object and then come right
up<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> fracture<00:00:53.309> command<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> click

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
up here to the fracture command so click

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.439 
up here to the fracture command so click
on<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.579> we<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> option<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.210> choose

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
on this we have the option to choose

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
on this we have the option to choose
just<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:57.960> many<00:00:58.020> pieces<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.770> actually<00:00:59.100> want<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
just how many pieces we actually want to

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.180 
just how many pieces we actually want to
have<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.910> shatter<00:01:00.719> apart<00:01:01.109> into<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.920> default

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
have this shatter apart into the default

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.830 
have this shatter apart into the default
is<00:01:02.370> 20<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.030> find<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.390> works<00:01:03.629> pretty

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
is 20 and I find that that works pretty

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.780 
is 20 and I find that that works pretty
well<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.110> most<00:01:04.409> situations<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.670> it's

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
well for most situations but really it's

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.330 
well for most situations but really it's
just<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.570> far<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.869> how<00:01:07.080> many<00:01:07.340> actual

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
just up to you as far as how many actual

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.890 
just up to you as far as how many actual
chunks<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.909> want<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.240> object<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.750> break

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
chunks you want your object to break

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.200 
chunks you want your object to break
apart<00:01:10.049> into<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> seed

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
apart into and then we have the seed

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.289 
apart into and then we have the seed
which<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.780> seed<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
which the seed is really just the

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.429 
which the seed is really just the
randomization<00:01:15.299> algorithm<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.930> uses<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
randomization algorithm that it uses to

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.770 
randomization algorithm that it uses to
break<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.670> apart<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.180> you'll<00:01:18.299> get<00:01:18.450> different

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
break this apart so you'll get different

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.760 
break this apart so you'll get different
shapes<00:01:19.200> depending<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:19.890> seed<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.790> use

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
shapes depending on which seed you use

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.630 
shapes depending on which seed you use
so<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.040> let's<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.340> ahead<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.490> just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
so with that let's go ahead and just

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.130 
so with that let's go ahead and just
press<00:01:23.820> ok<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.470> now<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.740> see<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.280> our

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
press ok and now you can see we have our

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.600 
press ok and now you can see we have our
fractured<00:01:28.140> object<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.460> actually

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
fractured object here so we actually

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.969 
fractured object here so we actually
have<00:01:29.850> two<00:01:30.119> versions<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.259> cross<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.829> have

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
have two versions of this cross we have

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.100 
have two versions of this cross we have
the<00:01:32.070> original<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.930> one

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the original and now we have this one

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.530 
the original and now we have this one
that's<00:01:34.229> been<00:01:34.409> fractured<00:01:34.710> apart<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.450> we

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that's been fractured apart so what we

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.480 
that's been fractured apart so what we
could<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.049> take<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.500> original<00:01:38.009> maybe

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
could do is take this original maybe

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.069 
could do is take this original maybe
just<00:01:38.700> hide<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
just hide that to get that out of the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.730 
just hide that to get that out of the
way<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.970> we<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.000> take<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.450> new<00:01:43.110> fractured

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
way and we can take this new fractured

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.100 
way and we can take this new fractured
one<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.820> maybe<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.450> give<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.780> slightly

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
one and maybe just give that a slightly

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.179 
one and maybe just give that a slightly
different<00:01:46.380> color<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.100> bit

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
different color so it's a little bit

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.789 
different color so it's a little bit
easier<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.290> now<00:01:49.290> at<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.500> point<00:01:49.710> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
easier to see and now at this point it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.069 
easier to see and now at this point it
really<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.100> behaves<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.670> normal<00:01:51.119> rigid

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
really just behaves like a normal rigid

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.830 
really just behaves like a normal rigid
body<00:01:52.259> object<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.149> drop<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.509> something

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
body object so we can drop in something

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.859 
body object so we can drop in something
like<00:01:54.990> gravity<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.450> make<00:01:57.450> sure<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.750> this

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
like gravity and make sure that this

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.770 
like gravity and make sure that this
floor<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.409> set<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> be<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.340> passive<00:02:00.060> rigid<00:02:00.630> body

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
floor is set to be a passive rigid body

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.020 
floor is set to be a passive rigid body
because<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.860> actually<00:02:02.100> catch<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
because we want to actually catch the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.179 
because we want to actually catch the
fragments<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.659> they<00:02:03.780> start<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.020> fall<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.439> then

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
fragments as they start to fall and then

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.230 
fragments as they start to fall and then
the<00:02:05.280> last<00:02:05.399> thing<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.759> need<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.939> do<00:02:06.090> is

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the last thing you need to do is

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.660 
the last thing you need to do is
actually<00:02:06.840> take<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.619> fracture<00:02:08.129> object<00:02:08.489> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
actually take this fracture object and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.180 
actually take this fracture object and
make<00:02:09.360> sure<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.170> set<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.590> an<00:02:10.709> active

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
make sure that it is set to be an active

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.460 
make sure that it is set to be an active
rigid<00:02:11.760> body

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
rigid body

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.710 
rigid body
and<00:02:13.560> now<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.340> set<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.510> go<00:02:15.630> ahead

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and now with that set we can go ahead

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.170 
and now with that set we can go ahead
and<00:02:15.870> reset<00:02:16.650> our<00:02:16.740> timeline<00:02:17.190> press<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> key

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
and reset our timeline press the a key

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.910 
and reset our timeline press the a key
on<00:02:18.510> our<00:02:18.540> keyboard<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:19.170> start<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.500> simulation

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
on our keyboard to start this simulation

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.630 
on our keyboard to start this simulation
process<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:21.410> now<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.650> see<00:02:22.800> our<00:02:23.040> object

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
process and now you can see our object

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.850 
process and now you can see our object
is<00:02:23.760> starting<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.480> fall<00:02:24.630> apart<00:02:27.230> okay<00:02:28.230> so

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
is starting to fall apart okay so

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.800 
is starting to fall apart okay so
letting<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.310> play<00:02:30.150> through<00:02:30.420> we'll<00:02:30.600> go<00:02:30.690> ahead

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
letting that play through we'll go ahead

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.870 
letting that play through we'll go ahead
and<00:02:30.930> stop<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.860> simulation<00:02:32.040> at<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.550> point<00:02:32.790> so

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
and stop the simulation at that point so

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.490 
and stop the simulation at that point so
we'll<00:02:33.120> call<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:33.770> good<00:02:34.770> at<00:02:35.040> about<00:02:36.050> 160<00:02:37.050> frames

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
we'll call this good at about 160 frames

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.000 
we'll call this good at about 160 frames
should<00:02:38.570> work<00:02:39.570> just<00:02:39.600> fine<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:40.050> my<00:02:40.140> case<00:02:40.350> let

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
should work just fine in my case let

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.140 
should work just fine in my case let
that<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.340> simulate<00:02:41.610> for<00:02:41.760> those<00:02:41.850> last<00:02:42.060> couple

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
that just simulate for those last couple

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.400 
that just simulate for those last couple
frames<00:02:42.540> here<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.250> now<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.310> can<00:02:44.520> see<00:02:44.670> our

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
frames here and now you can see our

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.290 
frames here and now you can see our
object<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:47.490> just<00:02:47.640> sort<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.940> falling

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
object is really just sort of falling

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.990 
object is really just sort of falling
and<00:02:48.450> breaking<00:02:48.750> apart<00:02:49.550> now<00:02:50.550> as<00:02:50.670> far<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
and breaking apart now as far as the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.520 
and breaking apart now as far as the
overall<00:02:51.209> controls<00:02:51.690> for<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.380> see

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
overall controls for this you can see

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.290 
overall controls for this you can see
that<00:02:52.650> they<00:02:52.770> are<00:02:52.800> very<00:02:53.400> very<00:02:53.610> similar<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:54.150> our

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
that they are very very similar to our

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.020 
that they are very very similar to our
normal<00:02:54.600> rigidbody<00:02:55.320> parameters<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.760> things

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
normal rigidbody parameters so things

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.810 
normal rigidbody parameters so things
like<00:02:57.150> density<00:02:57.660> how<00:02:58.500> dense<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.400> object<00:02:59.760> is

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
like density how dense this object is

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.050 
like density how dense this object is
basically<00:03:00.390> how<00:03:00.540> much<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.810> weighs<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.880> can

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
basically how much it weighs this can

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.850 
basically how much it weighs this can
also<00:03:03.180> determine<00:03:03.570> if<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.410> start<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.709> have

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
also determine if you start to have

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.530 
also determine if you start to have
fluids<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.580> things<00:03:06.030> like<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.480> are

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
fluids and things like that that are

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.240 
fluids and things like that that are
interacting<00:03:06.840> with<00:03:07.350> these<00:03:07.560> different

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
interacting with these different

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.130 
interacting with these different
fragments<00:03:08.459> whether<00:03:09.330> or<00:03:09.480> not<00:03:09.570> those<00:03:09.780> fragments

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
fragments whether or not those fragments

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.230 
fragments whether or not those fragments
are<00:03:10.500> actually<00:03:10.860> going<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.130> float<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.640> top<00:03:11.670> of

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
are actually going to float on top of

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.730 
are actually going to float on top of
the<00:03:12.300> water<00:03:12.420> or<00:03:12.720> if<00:03:13.200> they're<00:03:13.320> going<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.500> sink

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
the water or if they're going to sink

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.290 
the water or if they're going to sink
down<00:03:13.920> below<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.340> water's<00:03:14.610> surface<00:03:14.640> again

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
down below the water's surface again

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.820 
down below the water's surface again
these<00:03:15.570> are<00:03:15.630> things<00:03:15.990> are<00:03:16.170> controlled<00:03:16.590> by<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
these are things are controlled by the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.520 
these are things are controlled by the
density<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.630> then<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:18.930> also<00:03:19.080> have<00:03:19.230> things

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
density and then we also have things

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.670 
density and then we also have things
like<00:03:19.680> velocity<00:03:20.519> rotation<00:03:21.260> object<00:03:22.260> friction

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
like velocity rotation object friction

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.560 
like velocity rotation object friction
again<00:03:23.640> these<00:03:23.760> are<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.000> exact<00:03:24.420> same

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
again these are the exact same

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.449 
again these are the exact same
attributes<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.019> we<00:03:25.170> saw<00:03:25.350> earlier<00:03:25.560> whenever

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
attributes that we saw earlier whenever

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.920 
attributes that we saw earlier whenever
we<00:03:26.610> were<00:03:26.730> talking<00:03:27.060> about<00:03:27.150> our<00:03:27.390> rigid<00:03:27.780> body

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
we were talking about our rigid body

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.370 
we were talking about our rigid body
objects<00:03:29.180> now<00:03:30.180> you'll<00:03:30.420> notice<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.750> as<00:03:31.170> we

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
objects now you'll notice that as we

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.930 
objects now you'll notice that as we
start<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.739> play<00:03:32.130> through<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.670> can<00:03:32.790> see

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
start to play through this you can see

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.580 
start to play through this you can see
that<00:03:33.090> pretty<00:03:33.239> much<00:03:33.450> from<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.690> exact<00:03:34.350> moment

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
that pretty much from the exact moment

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.830 
that pretty much from the exact moment
our<00:03:34.830> simulation<00:03:35.340> starts<00:03:35.640> our<00:03:35.910> object<00:03:36.690> starts

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
our simulation starts our object starts

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.070 
our simulation starts our object starts
to<00:03:37.050> crumble<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.530> fall<00:03:37.800> apart<00:03:38.580> now<00:03:38.900> what<00:03:39.900> if<00:03:39.989> we

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
to crumble and fall apart now what if we

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.810 
to crumble and fall apart now what if we
actually<00:03:40.440> didn't<00:03:40.800> want<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.250> crumble

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
actually didn't want this to crumble

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.640 
actually didn't want this to crumble
immediately<00:03:42.720> what<00:03:42.900> if<00:03:42.989> we<00:03:43.080> actually<00:03:43.230> wanted

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
immediately what if we actually wanted

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.970 
immediately what if we actually wanted
this<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:44.100> be<00:03:44.959> crumbled<00:03:45.959> or<00:03:46.049> shattered<00:03:46.650> by<00:03:46.769> some

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
this to be crumbled or shattered by some

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.520 
this to be crumbled or shattered by some
other<00:03:47.070> object<00:03:47.310> that's<00:03:47.670> coming<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:49.200> what<00:03:49.440> we

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
other object that's coming in so what we

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.320 
other object that's coming in so what we
can<00:03:49.650> actually<00:03:49.739> do<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.220> use<00:03:50.610> this<00:03:50.760> passive

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
can actually do is use this passive

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.410 
can actually do is use this passive
switch<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.620> with<00:03:52.799> this<00:03:52.920> set<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.790> know<00:03:54.000> that

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
switch so with this set to know that

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.670 
switch so with this set to know that
basically<00:03:54.750> means<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.140> this<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.380> going<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.590> be

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
basically means that this is going to be

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.440 
basically means that this is going to be
an<00:03:55.769> active<00:03:56.310> object<00:03:56.549> which<00:03:57.030> mean<00:03:57.209> just<00:03:57.330> going

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
an active object which mean just going

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.550 
an active object which mean just going
to<00:03:57.510> start<00:03:57.690> falling<00:03:58.019> apart<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.470> start

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
to start falling apart and start

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.250 
to start falling apart and start
reacting<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:59.100> forces<00:03:59.519> if<00:03:59.670> we<00:04:00.600> set<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.870> passive

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
reacting to forces if we set the passive

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.100 
reacting to forces if we set the passive
option<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.709> yes<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.630> come<00:04:03.630> in<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.840> Reese

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
option to yes and come in and Reese

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.920 
option to yes and come in and Reese
immolate<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:05.880> can<00:04:06.030> see<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.330> really<00:04:06.480> nothing

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
immolate you can see that really nothing

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.960 
immolate you can see that really nothing
is<00:04:07.049> happening<00:04:07.230> it's<00:04:07.590> at<00:04:08.250> this<00:04:08.489> point<00:04:08.760> just

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
is happening it's at this point just

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.650 
is happening it's at this point just
waiting<00:04:09.450> for<00:04:10.110> something<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.590> collide<00:04:11.190> with<00:04:11.370> it

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
waiting for something to collide with it

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.479 
waiting for something to collide with it
so<00:04:12.660> we<00:04:12.900> could<00:04:13.019> actually<00:04:13.049> do<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.620> just<00:04:13.950> keyframe

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
so we could actually do is just keyframe

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.610 
so we could actually do is just keyframe
this<00:04:14.880> passive<00:04:15.420> option<00:04:15.750> on<00:04:15.959> or<00:04:16.169> off<00:04:16.350> whenever

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
this passive option on or off whenever

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.800 
this passive option on or off whenever
an<00:04:16.950> object<00:04:17.310> starts<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.760> come<00:04:18.450> close<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.780> it

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
an object starts to come close to it

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.620 
an object starts to come close to it
that<00:04:18.959> we<00:04:19.049> actually<00:04:19.290> want<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.560> break<00:04:20.070> apart

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
that we actually want it to break apart

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.719 
that we actually want it to break apart
so<00:04:21.630> for<00:04:21.810> example<00:04:21.840> we<00:04:22.320> had<00:04:23.220> something<00:04:23.460> like<00:04:23.700> a

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
so for example we had something like a

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.140 
so for example we had something like a
sphere

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
sphere

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.170 
sphere
and<00:04:26.270> if<00:04:26.389> I<00:04:26.479> were<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.630> pull<00:04:26.810> this<00:04:26.930> over<00:04:27.139> and

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
and if I were to pull this over and

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.189 
and if I were to pull this over and
let's<00:04:29.180> just<00:04:29.330> try<00:04:29.449> to<00:04:29.479> set<00:04:29.690> this<00:04:29.780> up<00:04:29.840> for<00:04:30.169> a

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
let's just try to set this up for a

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.700 
let's just try to set this up for a
rigid<00:04:30.650> body<00:04:30.680> simulation<00:04:31.160> so<00:04:31.610> take<00:04:32.000> my<00:04:32.180> sphere

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
rigid body simulation so take my sphere

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.580 
rigid body simulation so take my sphere
make<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.830> into<00:04:34.070> an<00:04:34.160> active<00:04:34.400> rigid<00:04:35.210> body<00:04:35.590> go

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
make this into an active rigid body go

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.820 
make this into an active rigid body go
into<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.830> rigidbody<00:04:37.240> parameters<00:04:38.240> here<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:38.830> I

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
into the rigidbody parameters here and I

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.730 
into the rigidbody parameters here and I
want<00:04:40.039> it<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.280> move<00:04:40.520> along<00:04:40.820> this<00:04:41.139> x-axis<00:04:42.139> so

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
want it to move along this x-axis so

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.550 
want it to move along this x-axis so
let's<00:04:42.949> give<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.720> little<00:04:44.720> bit<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.020> a<00:04:45.110> velocity

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
let's give it a little bit of a velocity

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.020 
let's give it a little bit of a velocity
here<00:04:45.800> let's<00:04:46.130> start<00:04:46.250> with<00:04:46.490> maybe<00:04:46.669> something

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
here let's start with maybe something

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.279 
here let's start with maybe something
like<00:04:47.180> eight<00:04:49.360> there<00:04:50.360> we<00:04:50.479> go<00:04:50.630> it's<00:04:50.990> a<00:04:51.050> little<00:04:51.169> bit

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
like eight there we go it's a little bit

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:52.570 
like eight there we go it's a little bit
better<00:04:51.530> let's<00:04:51.860> maybe<00:04:52.009> give<00:04:52.100> it<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.310> little<00:04:52.430> bit

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
better let's maybe give it a little bit

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.670 
better let's maybe give it a little bit
of<00:04:52.669> upward<00:04:53.060> motion<00:04:53.419> here<00:04:53.600> as<00:04:53.690> well<00:04:53.840> maybe<00:04:54.560> an

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
of upward motion here as well maybe an

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.129 
of upward motion here as well maybe an
upward<00:04:54.979> motion<00:04:55.009> of<00:04:55.370> five<00:04:55.610> there<00:04:56.539> we<00:04:56.660> go<00:04:56.780> so

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
upward motion of five there we go so

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.980 
upward motion of five there we go so
let's<00:04:57.229> start<00:04:57.410> with<00:04:57.500> something<00:04:57.680> like<00:04:57.889> that<00:04:58.990> now

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
let's start with something like that now

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.689 
let's start with something like that now
let's<00:05:00.380> take<00:05:00.590> our<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:01.510> little<00:05:02.510> cross<00:05:02.810> here<00:05:03.110> and

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
let's take our of little cross here and

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.830 
let's take our of little cross here and
let's<00:05:04.699> try<00:05:04.850> to<00:05:04.880> find<00:05:05.060> about<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.449> point<00:05:05.660> where

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
let's try to find about the point where

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.969 
let's try to find about the point where
the<00:05:05.990> sphere<00:05:06.740> gets<00:05:06.979> closed<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:07.460> about<00:05:07.699> frame<00:05:08.000> 24

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
the sphere gets closed so about frame 24

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.620 
the sphere gets closed so about frame 24
now<00:05:09.979> let's<00:05:10.160> go<00:05:10.310> back<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.520> our<00:05:10.669> cross<00:05:11.240> here<00:05:11.479> not

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
now let's go back to our cross here not

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.140 
now let's go back to our cross here not
about<00:05:11.780> frame<00:05:12.050> 24<00:05:12.560> go<00:05:13.430> ahead<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:13.669> add<00:05:13.789> a<00:05:13.820> key

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
about frame 24 go ahead and add a key

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.140 
about frame 24 go ahead and add a key
for<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.930> passive<00:05:15.289> set<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.560> yes<00:05:16.000> we'll<00:05:17.000> move

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
for the passive set to yes we'll move

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.240 
for the passive set to yes we'll move
forward<00:05:17.419> one<00:05:17.750> frame<00:05:17.900> 225<00:05:18.500> just<00:05:18.919> using<00:05:19.160> the

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
forward one frame 225 just using the

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.230 
forward one frame 225 just using the
left<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.669> right<00:05:19.699> arrow<00:05:20.660> keys<00:05:20.780> on<00:05:20.990> my<00:05:21.229> keyboard

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
left and right arrow keys on my keyboard

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.960 
left and right arrow keys on my keyboard
go<00:05:23.240> over<00:05:23.599> here<00:05:24.460> let's<00:05:25.460> go<00:05:25.580> ahead<00:05:25.729> and<00:05:25.820> set<00:05:25.910> the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
go over here let's go ahead and set the

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.749 
go over here let's go ahead and set the
passive<00:05:26.300> to<00:05:26.419> know<00:05:26.599> and<00:05:27.410> now<00:05:27.949> keyframe<00:05:28.370> that<00:05:28.550> so

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
passive to know and now keyframe that so

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.450 
passive to know and now keyframe that so
now<00:05:28.970> at<00:05:29.090> frame<00:05:29.300> 24<00:05:29.750> it's<00:05:30.680> set<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:30.889> be<00:05:31.070> passive

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
now at frame 24 it's set to be passive

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.909 
now at frame 24 it's set to be passive
but<00:05:31.910> as<00:05:32.060> soon<00:05:32.180> as<00:05:32.270> it<00:05:32.389> gets<00:05:32.539> to<00:05:32.660> frame<00:05:32.810> 25<00:05:33.199> now

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
but as soon as it gets to frame 25 now

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.650 
but as soon as it gets to frame 25 now
it's<00:05:34.070> going<00:05:34.160> to<00:05:34.220> start<00:05:34.430> falling<00:05:34.760> apart<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:36.400> now

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
it's going to start falling apart so now

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.080 
it's going to start falling apart so now
set<00:05:38.660> the<00:05:38.690> simulation<00:05:39.289> off<00:05:39.380> again<00:05:39.940> you<00:05:40.940> can<00:05:41.060> see

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
set the simulation off again you can see

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.409 
set the simulation off again you can see
now<00:05:41.389> it's<00:05:41.539> starting<00:05:41.750> to<00:05:41.810> think<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.229> now<00:05:43.419> you

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
now it's starting to think and now you

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.750 
now it's starting to think and now you
can<00:05:44.599> see<00:05:44.720> our<00:05:44.750> object<00:05:45.229> is<00:05:45.289> being<00:05:45.560> shattered<00:05:45.860> by

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
can see our object is being shattered by

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.580 
can see our object is being shattered by
our<00:05:46.909> other<00:05:47.090> active<00:05:47.659> rigidbody<00:05:47.990> we<00:05:48.440> can

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
our other active rigidbody we can

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.980 
our other active rigidbody we can
actually<00:05:48.740> come<00:05:49.010> in<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.310> maybe<00:05:50.270> set<00:05:50.570> this<00:05:50.720> mass

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
actually come in and maybe set this mass

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.080 
actually come in and maybe set this mass
up<00:05:51.199> a<00:05:51.289> little<00:05:51.470> bit<00:05:51.560> higher<00:05:51.800> for<00:05:52.370> this<00:05:52.550> little

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
up a little bit higher for this little

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.149 
up a little bit higher for this little
sphere<00:05:53.740> so<00:05:54.740> maybe<00:05:54.979> give<00:05:55.220> that<00:05:55.370> a<00:05:56.949> much<00:05:57.949> higher

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
sphere so maybe give that a much higher

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.920 
sphere so maybe give that a much higher
mass<00:05:59.770> in<00:06:00.770> rear<00:06:00.949> so<00:06:01.159> now<00:06:01.280> that<00:06:01.430> should<00:06:01.840> start<00:06:02.840> to

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
mass in rear so now that should start to

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.240 
mass in rear so now that should start to
break<00:06:03.139> this<00:06:03.260> object<00:06:03.620> apart<00:06:03.860> with<00:06:03.979> a<00:06:04.010> lot<00:06:04.220> more

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
break this object apart with a lot more

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.129 
break this object apart with a lot more
force<00:06:04.639> and<00:06:04.729> you<00:06:04.820> can<00:06:04.970> see<00:06:05.120> now<00:06:05.240> that's<00:06:05.449> what's

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
force and you can see now that's what's

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.320 
force and you can see now that's what's
starting<00:06:06.229> to<00:06:06.470> happen<00:06:09.669> all<00:06:10.669> right<00:06:10.760> very<00:06:11.090> nice

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
starting to happen all right very nice

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.800 
starting to happen all right very nice
so<00:06:12.110> you<00:06:12.560> can<00:06:12.710> start<00:06:12.919> to<00:06:12.979> see<00:06:13.070> where<00:06:13.370> these

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
so you can start to see where these

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.390 
so you can start to see where these
fracture<00:06:14.979> techniques<00:06:15.979> start<00:06:16.190> to<00:06:16.280> become

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
fracture techniques start to become

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.279 
fracture techniques start to become
really<00:06:16.729> really<00:06:16.880> useful<00:06:17.180> for<00:06:17.630> just<00:06:17.930> being<00:06:18.110> able

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
really really useful for just being able

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.170 
really really useful for just being able
to<00:06:18.380> come<00:06:18.500> in<00:06:18.650> break<00:06:19.370> our<00:06:19.520> objects<00:06:19.880> apart

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
to come in break our objects apart

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.450 
to come in break our objects apart
either<00:06:20.419> based<00:06:20.720> on<00:06:21.020> gravity<00:06:21.919> or<00:06:22.159> other

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
either based on gravity or other

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.580 
either based on gravity or other
rigidbody<00:06:22.880> objects<00:06:23.449> we<00:06:23.960> can<00:06:24.110> actually<00:06:24.440> even

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
rigidbody objects we can actually even

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.560 
rigidbody objects we can actually even
have<00:06:24.710> things<00:06:25.190> like<00:06:25.280> fluids<00:06:25.909> and<00:06:26.180> other

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
have things like fluids and other

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.110 
have things like fluids and other
emitter<00:06:26.960> 'he's<00:06:27.080> start<00:06:27.740> to<00:06:27.949> react<00:06:28.340> and<00:06:28.550> push

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
emitter 'he's start to react and push

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.580 
emitter 'he's start to react and push
these<00:06:29.800> fracture<00:06:30.800> objects<00:06:31.130> apart<00:06:31.430> as<00:06:31.610> well<00:06:32.590> so

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
these fracture objects apart as well so

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.959 
these fracture objects apart as well so
let's<00:06:33.800> a<00:06:33.889> look<00:06:33.919> at<00:06:34.159> how<00:06:34.250> we<00:06:34.310> can<00:06:34.400> start<00:06:34.669> to<00:06:34.789> set

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
let's a look at how we can start to set

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.430 
let's a look at how we can start to set
up<00:06:35.060> these<00:06:35.210> types<00:06:35.479> of<00:06:35.659> shattering<00:06:36.050> effects

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
up these types of shattering effects

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.450 
up these types of shattering effects
within<00:06:36.919> real<00:06:37.219> flow

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.520
