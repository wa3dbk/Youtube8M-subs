00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
frustrating but maybe they might release

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.420

configuration<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> things<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.869> that

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
configuration and things like that

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.649 
configuration and things like that
anyway<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.729> guys<00:01:44.880> are<00:01:45.000> watching<00:01:45.299> some<00:01:45.630> of

anyway so you guys are watching some of

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.710 
anyway so you guys are watching some of
the<00:01:45.780> gameplay<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.340> Spain<00:01:47.340> vs.<00:01:47.939> Germany<00:01:48.299> game

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.450 
the gameplay of Spain vs. Germany game
and<00:01:49.939> first<00:01:50.939> off<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.899> colors<00:01:52.290> simple<00:01:53.159> as<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and first off the colors simple as that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490 
and first off the colors simple as that
I<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:54.030> noticed<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.570> vibrant<00:01:54.990> colors<00:01:55.320> in

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
I really noticed the vibrant colors in

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.039 
I really noticed the vibrant colors in
this<00:01:55.649> game<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> saw<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.329> was<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.570> wow

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this game when I saw that I was like wow

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.530 
this game when I saw that I was like wow
you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.880> don't<00:02:00.240> want<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.420> say

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you know the I don't want to say

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.569 
you know the I don't want to say
graphics<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> prefer<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.340> put<00:02:02.490> it

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
graphics but I I prefer just to put it

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.209 
graphics but I I prefer just to put it
as<00:02:02.670> colors<00:02:03.090> all<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.899> have<00:02:04.170> been<00:02:04.219> much

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
as colors all of it have been much

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.310 
as colors all of it have been much
improved<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.969> mean<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.299> lot<00:02:06.600> nicer<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.140> look

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
improved I mean it's a lot nicer to look

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.350 
improved I mean it's a lot nicer to look
at<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.099> think<00:02:08.340> most<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.879> people<00:02:09.149> who<00:02:09.239> have

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.479 
at and I think most of people who have
played<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.780> or<00:02:09.929> even<00:02:10.170> got<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> trial<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
played it or even got the trial the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.940 
played it or even got the trial the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
go and give that go before and you

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.710

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
reason but I think you guys will all

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.920 
reason but I think you guys will all
agree<00:02:20.790> with<00:02:21.060> me<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.450> colors<00:02:21.780> are

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
agree with me that the colors are

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.710 
agree with me that the colors are
certainly<00:02:22.290> really<00:02:23.220> vibrant<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.849> they<00:02:24.510> look

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
certainly really vibrant and they look

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.020 
certainly really vibrant and they look
really<00:02:24.750> nice<00:02:25.220> another<00:02:26.220> thing<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.640> you

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
really nice another thing is like you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.309 
really nice another thing is like you
look<00:02:27.209> at<00:02:27.269> this<00:02:27.390> sort<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.690> camera<00:02:28.019> lat<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
look at this sort of camera lat the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.660 
look at this sort of camera lat the
camera<00:02:28.620> angle<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:28.980> don't<00:02:29.220> know<00:02:29.310> if<00:02:29.430> it's<00:02:29.580> just

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
camera angle I don't know if it's just

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.720 
camera angle I don't know if it's just
this<00:02:30.000> stadium<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.470> just<00:02:31.769> seemed<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.370> lot

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
this stadium but it just seemed a lot

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.820 
this stadium but it just seemed a lot
nicer<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.180> play<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.230> watch<00:02:34.410> whether<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.709> got

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
nicer to play and watch whether it got

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.190 
nicer to play and watch whether it got
weird<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.700> little<00:02:36.330> weird<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.569> begin<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:36.989> but<00:02:37.170> I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
weird a little weird to begin with but I

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.110 
weird a little weird to begin with but I
certainly<00:02:37.470> got<00:02:37.650> used<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.819> halfway

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
certainly got used to a you know halfway

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.420 
certainly got used to a you know halfway
into<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.630> game<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.930> suppose<00:02:40.220> but<00:02:41.220> it's

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
into the game I suppose but it's

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.220 
into the game I suppose but it's
certainly<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:42.180> certainly<00:02:42.540> something<00:02:42.840> nice

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
certainly it's certainly something nice

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.100 
certainly it's certainly something nice
and<00:02:43.470> something<00:02:43.650> slightly<00:02:43.980> more<00:02:44.099> refreshing

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
and something slightly more refreshing

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.770 
and something slightly more refreshing
unfortunately<00:02:46.110> with<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.799> game<00:02:47.330> they<00:02:48.330> didn't

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
on a very regular basis and so those are

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.030 
on a very regular basis and so those are
the<00:06:07.600> two<00:06:07.750> main<00:06:07.930> factors<00:06:08.110> I<00:06:08.320> mean<00:06:08.620> if<00:06:08.710> I<00:06:08.830> was<00:06:08.950> an

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
offline player and I did those other two

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.320 
offline player and I did those other two
things<00:06:11.770> as<00:06:11.950> well<00:06:12.100> this<00:06:12.790> would<00:06:12.970> be<00:06:13.090> an

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
things as well this would be an

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.610
