00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.900
 [Road to Mars] 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.900
 [Deep Space Journey] 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.870
 Today, and somewhere in the world in the classroom, for example, 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.900
 There is someone between the ages of 10 and 20 years 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.750
 The first person to put his feet on Mars, 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.550
 He is currently studying mathematics or science most likely. 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 It's really exciting to imagine how his life will be there 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.770
 And how he and his people will live after the success of this great journey. 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.920
 The trip to Mars will be in the mid-1930s. 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.370
 What we have to do now is to pave the way for these flights 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.450
 Which will make us ready to go to Mars. 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.210
 We need six pieces to go to Mars. 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.990
 Where Boeing is now working on a space launch system. 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.560
 NASA's current plan for the Mars space launch system and the Orion spacecraft, 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.920
 The two pieces that will enter and extricate us from the field of gravity. 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.650
 If you are going to the moon or beyond, you will need a huge rocket to do so. 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.740
 This is what the space launch system was designed for, 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.450
 Its goal is to take you to a high orbit. 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.760
 We will have to conduct 5 or 6 releases of the space launch system 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 So that we can make our trip to Mars a success. 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.970
 So, we have to make sure everything is checked 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.220
 It is a priority to make a trip before going to Mars, 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.930
 Because if we embark on our trip, we will not come back again at least two years ago. 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.870
 The reason for this is how the planets are arranged. 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.330
 The rotation of the planets around the sun, 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.500
 Give us an appropriate window 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.520
 To launch from Earth to Mars, once every two years. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.800
 To go to Mars only, 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.390
 Before we travel, we will take about 7 or 8 months. 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.560
 The truth is that we will stay there for a whole year 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.580
 During which we wait for the window to be opened so that we can get back. 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.790
 As we will take about 7 or 8 months on the return trip. 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.600
 We will also need two more pieces to move between Earth and Mars - 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.770
 The force of pulling the depths of the space of a certain kind and we will also need a settlement. 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.090
 Deep space mobility depends on the power of solar electric clouds, 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.330
 Using large solar cells, 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.170
 And using solar energy to stimulate the docking system. 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.700
 So it will look like a huge sailing ship. 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.040
 The settlement will also be attached to the sailing ship 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.040
 Where will the flight team live? 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.070
 They will board the settlement on their journey to Mars 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.240
 Then we will leave the settlement in orbit 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.400
 When the flight team descends on the roof. 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.790
 The two remaining pieces that we will need are the spacecraft. 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.520
 Where the vehicle will contain an extensible thermal arm 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.260
 The flight team will take the atmosphere down. 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.920
 The vehicle will be removed from the thermal sludge before landing on the surface, 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.110
 It is the same as the spacecraft that landed on the moon before. 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.520
 Then we will need a small rocket to help them get out of 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.610
 Martian gravity again. 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.730
 I think we can settle Mars one day. 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.360
 It will take a long time. It may take centuries, 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.770
 But it is something we have become used to as human beings. 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.920
 It is about setting our foothold on that planet. 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.820
 Our acceptance of this challenge is a natural development of humankind. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.500
 [Two of the other six pieces we need to go to Mars, the NASA space launch system and the Orion vehicle, are under construction.] 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.000
 [The rest of the four pieces will also be announced at a later date.]
