00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.400
 hi to all these iphone titles and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.490
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.139
 new video tutorials videos that will 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.790
 let you know how to remove 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.270
 the g-drive without needing 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.039
 computer or itunes software 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.180
 staying under the same version ios 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.830
 current this tutorial works on all 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.740
 jailbroken devices under version 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:35.940
 ancestors 18.3 and 8.4 the ipod touch if I 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.320
 will be the only one not to be compatible 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.540
 make sure you have done a 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.920
 backup of pully cloud if you 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.430
 want to resume all your data 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.590
 of your device for reasons of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.020
 security i suggest you have a 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.399
 percentage of batteries above 50% 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.170
 then you must have obligatorily 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.210
 an Internet connection 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.910
 so the 3g the 4g or the wifi we go 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.689
 to start 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:10.159
 open cydia then do a search 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.619
 so press the corresponding tab 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.750
 description of the tweak 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.310
 you have an explanation like what 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.530
 this installation will destroy all your 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.759
 data is therefore normal since the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.810
 jailbreak can be envy 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.460
 obligatorily by a restoration in 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.270
 top right you have a button 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.690
 edit press on it you're going to have 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.130
 three options pressed install then 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.350
 finally on confirm you're going to have a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.560
 line of code that will appear that's 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.179
 normal let scroll 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.640
 when you get this message you go 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.640
 able to press back to cydia 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.890
 you can then return to the menu 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.909
 if you have the impact icon gold this 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.130
 means that you are ready for 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.130
 remove g break your device 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.680
 launched the application a line 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.410
 of explanation you write what it takes 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.910
 do it before launch 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.060
 have a backup have internet 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.590
 have some battery but of course to no 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.820
 nothing to touch during its operation 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.640
 when you are ready you can 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.090
 press letters to data enjoy 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.750
 break of corn a new confirmation 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.090
 leaning on hall letters 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.190
 loading get started they should 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.770
 download a file so according to your 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.430
 connection the loading can be long 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.310
 or short 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.290
 of course I repeat to you again no 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.470
 touch anything as long as these lines of 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.030
 son I mean by that home buttons &amp; 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.830
 power 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.670
 so after the finance lines you 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.350
 are going to have that kind of loading there 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.780
 that means that the tweak did well 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.490
 his work 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.500
 let the loading take place and this 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:16.380
 can last an average of 10 to 20 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:21.600
 minutes and after that you're going to have 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.440
 this you have the language the country and 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.440

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.459
 you will end up falling on this 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.170

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.709

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.400

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.720
