00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.540
 decimal numbers the signal numbers 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.639
 are those numbers that have a comma 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.830
 these numbers have some 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.940
 characteristics that deserve our 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.790
 attention 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.940
 they are formed by an entire part 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.199
 and another of itself being bad that the numbers 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.710
 which are on the left side of the comma 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:31.369
 make up the whole part and those who are 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.369
 represent the part of this evil. 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:38.340
 look at the table on the right 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.300
 we find the tenth hundredths and 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.410
 thousandths on the left 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.780
 units tens of hundreds of units of 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.660
 thousands and so on 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.649
 to know how much is the tenth we should 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.280
 divide the unit into ten equal parts 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.010
 look at a unit that we divided into ten 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.960
 equal parts 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.159
 this cake is cut into 10 slices 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.460
 equals 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.909
 the pole represents one unit and each 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.840
 slice is one-tenth of the cake 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:20.310
 note the representation on each slice of the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.430
 hundredths when we divide the unit into 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.250
 100 equal parts 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.759
 Let's get the hundredths each 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.079
 represents one-hundredth of the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.340
 whole figure this ruler has a meter 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.979
 of lenght 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.310
 we can divide the meter into 100 parts 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.119
 equal each part is one-hundredth of 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.189
 meter or one centimeter is something 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.880
 similar to money 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.280
 this is a real one 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.189
 we can divide the real into 100 parts 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.399
 equal only that this is not done getting 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.930
 currency of a certain real the hundredth of the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.329
 real is the penny to understand the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.160
 representation of decimal numbers is 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.370
 very important for our day to day 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.790
 because we deal with the money and unity of 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.090
 constant measure 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.659
 mind perform activity on your notebook 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.109
 for the next math class 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.109
 bye
