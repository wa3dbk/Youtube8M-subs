we<00:00:08.639> are<00:00:08.700> talking<00:00:09.210> about<00:00:09.300> fasted<00:00:10.019> cardio<00:00:10.050> and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
we are talking about fasted cardio and

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.459 
we are talking about fasted cardio and
is<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:11.010> beneficial<00:00:11.519> for<00:00:11.849> fat<00:00:12.090> loss<00:00:12.259> roll<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
is it beneficial for fat loss roll the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:22.220 
is it beneficial for fat loss roll the
damn<00:00:13.650> intro<00:00:20.090> okay<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.150> firstly<00:00:21.750> let's<00:00:22.020> talk

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
damn intro okay so firstly let's talk

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.380 
damn intro okay so firstly let's talk
about<00:00:22.439> fat<00:00:22.710> loss<00:00:22.949> fat<00:00:23.490> loss<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.910> made<00:00:24.119> energy

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
about fat loss fat loss is made energy

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.480 
about fat loss fat loss is made energy
bounce<00:00:24.840> that's<00:00:25.199> essentially<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.070> fat<00:00:26.310> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
bounce that's essentially what fat is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.849 
bounce that's essentially what fat is
it's<00:00:26.789> stored<00:00:27.119> energy<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:28.050> burn<00:00:28.080> fat<00:00:28.619> when

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
it's stored energy we burn fat when

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.519 
it's stored energy we burn fat when
we're<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> caloric<00:00:29.640> /<00:00:29.970> energy<00:00:30.539> deficit<00:00:31.109> this

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
we're in a caloric / energy deficit this

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.860 
we're in a caloric / energy deficit this
is<00:00:31.679> when<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.630> expending<00:00:33.630> more<00:00:33.809> energy

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
is when we are expending more energy

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.860 
is when we are expending more energy
than<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.710> consuming<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.510> achieve<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
than we are consuming we can achieve a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.049 
than we are consuming we can achieve a
caloric<00:00:37.410> deficit<00:00:37.860> from<00:00:38.190> diet<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.850> exercise

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
caloric deficit from diet or exercise

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.950 
caloric deficit from diet or exercise
but<00:00:39.899> preferably<00:00:40.230> true<00:00:40.920> both<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.660> also

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
but preferably true both it is also

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.319 
but preferably true both it is also
important<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.739> note<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.010> fat<00:00:44.430> loss<00:00:44.640> /<00:00:45.000> gain

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
important to note that fat loss / gain

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.529 
important to note that fat loss / gain
is<00:00:45.539> about<00:00:45.989> your<00:00:46.170> total<00:00:46.800> net<00:00:47.160> balance<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.270> would

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
is about your total net balance so would

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.970 
is about your total net balance so would
your<00:00:48.690> left<00:00:48.930> would<00:00:49.170> at<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> end<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.739> day

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
your left would at the end of the day

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.250 
your left would at the end of the day
for<00:00:50.520> anyone<00:00:50.760> else<00:00:50.940> who<00:00:51.120> study<00:00:51.449> business<00:00:52.020> think

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
for anyone else who study business think

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.310 
for anyone else who study business think
about<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.860> assets<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.879> liabilities<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.870> your

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
about as assets and liabilities and your

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.430 
about as assets and liabilities and your
total<00:00:55.680> net<00:00:55.829> worth<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:57.629> let's<00:00:57.960> look<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.350> an

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
total net worth so now let's look at an

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.740 
total net worth so now let's look at an
example<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:59.340> number<00:00:59.699> sake<00:00:59.969> let's<00:01:00.270> say<00:01:00.390> our

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
example for number sake let's say our

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.680 
example for number sake let's say our
individual<00:01:01.649> needs<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.250> consume<00:01:02.690> 1800

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
individual needs to consume 1800

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.520 
individual needs to consume 1800
calories<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.710> lose<00:01:04.739> fat<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.600> wake<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.200> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
calories to lose fat so they wake up and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.469 
calories to lose fat so they wake up and
they<00:01:08.159> don't<00:01:08.310> eat<00:01:08.520> anything<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.270> go

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
they don't eat anything and they go

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.370 
they don't eat anything and they go
through<00:01:09.750> their<00:01:10.229> cardio<00:01:10.770> they<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:12.150> burn<00:01:12.720> 200

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
through their cardio they can burn 200

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.020 
through their cardio they can burn 200
calories<00:01:13.799> while<00:01:14.070> doing<00:01:14.340> their<00:01:14.460> cardio<00:01:14.850> then

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
calories while doing their cardio then

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.789 
calories while doing their cardio then
they<00:01:15.180> go<00:01:15.390> back<00:01:15.630> today<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.650> their

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
they go back today they have all their

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.850 
they go back today they have all their
meals<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:17.580> eat<00:01:17.820> 2,000<00:01:18.630> calories<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.530> at<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
meals they eat 2,000 calories so at the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
meals they eat 2,000 calories so at the
end<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> day<00:01:20.580> their<00:01:20.909> total<00:01:21.420> net<00:01:21.689> balance

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
end of the day their total net balance

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.010 
end of the day their total net balance
is<00:01:22.670> 1800<00:01:23.670> calories<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.420> let's<00:01:24.630> look<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
is 1800 calories now let's look at the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
is 1800 calories now let's look at the
opposite<00:01:25.590> someone<00:01:26.220> wakes<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.939> have

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
opposite someone wakes up they have

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.120 
opposite someone wakes up they have
breakfast<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.960> they<00:01:28.380> go<00:01:28.530> back<00:01:28.740> their<00:01:28.890> day

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
breakfast and they go back their day

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.010 
breakfast and they go back their day
they<00:01:29.340> eat<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.700> their<00:01:29.880> meals<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.390> they

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
they eat all their meals and they

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.770 
they eat all their meals and they
consume<00:01:31.560> 2,000<00:01:32.430> calories<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.720> do

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
consume 2,000 calories then they do

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.109 
consume 2,000 calories then they do
their<00:01:34.200> cardio<00:01:34.680> they<00:01:34.890> burned<00:01:35.159> 200<00:01:35.400> calories

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
their cardio they burned 200 calories

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.850 
their cardio they burned 200 calories
again<00:01:37.070> their<00:01:38.070> total<00:01:38.700> net<00:01:39.000> balance<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.860> 1800

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
again their total net balance is 1800

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.630 
again their total net balance is 1800
calories<00:01:41.280> fat<00:01:41.790> loss<00:01:42.030> will<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:43.020> same<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
calories fat loss will be the same and

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.609 
calories fat loss will be the same and
as<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:45.030> I'm<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> man<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.899> scientific

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
as you know I'm a man of scientific

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.679 
as you know I'm a man of scientific
literature<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.579> what<00:01:47.790> does<00:01:47.970> research<00:01:48.240> say

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
literature so what does research say

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.840 
literature so what does research say
about<00:01:48.930> fasted<00:01:49.409> cardio<00:01:49.439> well<00:01:50.189> pretty<00:01:50.490> much<00:01:50.640> all

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
about fasted cardio well pretty much all

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.819 
about fasted cardio well pretty much all
the<00:01:51.030> studies<00:01:51.390> done<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.630> fasted<00:01:52.170> cardio<00:01:52.200> show

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the studies done on fasted cardio show

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.880 
the studies done on fasted cardio show
that<00:01:53.159> when<00:01:53.399> cardio<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.780> calories<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
that when cardio and calories are the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.819 
that when cardio and calories are the
same<00:01:56.159> body<00:01:57.030> composition<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.960> always<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.619> same

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
same body composition is always the same

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.190 
same body composition is always the same
but<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.759> even<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> story<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:00.810> I'll<00:02:00.960> of
