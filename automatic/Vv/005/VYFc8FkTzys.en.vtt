00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.789 
and the internet drivers don't work that
is<00:04:14.299> just<00:04:14.480> because<00:04:14.780> i<00:04:14.810> just<00:04:15.290> did<00:04:15.440> this<00:04:15.560> now<00:04:15.769> i

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
is just because i just did this now i

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.560 
is just because i just did this now i
did<00:04:16.100> not<00:04:16.250> spend<00:04:16.880> any<00:04:16.909> time<00:04:17.060> finding<00:04:17.479> the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
did not spend any time finding the

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.000 
did not spend any time finding the
drivers<00:04:17.959> for<00:04:18.109> either<00:04:18.229> those<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:18.799> they<00:04:18.919> are

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
drivers for either those and they are

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.400 
drivers for either those and they are
available<00:04:19.130> if<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.760> search<00:04:19.940> for<00:04:19.970> them

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
available if you search for them

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.130 
available if you search for them
the<00:04:22.410> reason<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:22.950> put<00:04:23.190> on<00:04:23.280> this<00:04:23.660> aspire<00:04:24.660> one<00:04:24.930> is

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
the reason I put on this aspire one is

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.530 
the reason I put on this aspire one is
because<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.560> hardware<00:04:25.920> is<00:04:26.040> almost<00:04:26.220> perfect

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
because the hardware is almost perfect

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.000 
because the hardware is almost perfect
it<00:04:27.540> has<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:28.410> after<00:04:29.370> o's<00:04:29.720> internet<00:04:30.720> for<00:04:31.410> Wi-Fi

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
it has a after o's internet for Wi-Fi

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.840 
it has a after o's internet for Wi-Fi
and<00:04:32.310> ethernet<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:34.530> also<00:04:34.680> has<00:04:34.830> an<00:04:35.460> intel

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
and ethernet and it also has an intel
