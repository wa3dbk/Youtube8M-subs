00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.589
 enable the trunk opening function 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.469
 remote with the trunk button of the key 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.179
 and we keep it applied 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.570
 Only the record shows that before 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.570
 could do 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.020
 what we could do was 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.060
 with the sap 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.789
 nice 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.550
 and have the possibility to open it 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.050
 i 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.800
 unlocking no but neither did 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.800
 yes 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.280
 one 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:47.280
 Well, let's use the cane 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 we have to have the version in this 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.530
 case I have the a 11 11 3 that used it 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.610
 for the 2012 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.550
 the wire 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.000
 that we connect the cracked interface 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.000
 ease 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.239
 and we are going to open those 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.280
 let's put the vehicle in contact 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.689
 let's do lic 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.830
 let's go to module 46 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.830
 the central com 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.450
 and let's go to the code on 07 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.270
 here I put the value I is not 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.020
 come to see 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.619
 is 34 57 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.209
 by default it comes 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.159
 the 55 05 I have a picture that I take 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.510
 before modifying once what 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.510
 modify we are going to tweet 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.000
 we save the data will give us the ok 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.959
 and we closed the program 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.040
 we get the contact 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.040
 we are going to disconnect between fas 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.099
 using this version 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.130
 all right 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.510
 and we see how it is 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.130
 action 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.690
 this is also useful for the one who wants 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.420
 change the springs these put one more 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.420
 strong then when opening 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.049
 glory this favorite work just 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.590
 well this was 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.800
 a contribution that Cyrus took my friend and 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.460
 even that he put me the code to be able to 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.460
 do this
