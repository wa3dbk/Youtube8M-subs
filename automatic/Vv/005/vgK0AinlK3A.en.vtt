in<00:00:00.420> this<00:00:01.199> video<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.800> will<00:00:01.860> show<00:00:02.129> you<00:00:02.340> what<00:00:02.550> I

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
in this video I will show you what I

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.640 
in this video I will show you what I
think<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.330> best<00:00:03.570> way<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.870> find<00:00:04.140> materials

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
think is the best way to find materials

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.280 
think is the best way to find materials
and<00:00:04.890> karma<00:00:05.339> also<00:00:06.299> on<00:00:06.359> top<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.839> you'll<00:00:07.049> get

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
and karma also on top of that you'll get

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.410 
and karma also on top of that you'll get
a<00:00:07.350> huge<00:00:07.680> amount<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.130> look<00:00:08.340> so<00:00:08.790> get<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.059> magic

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
a huge amount of look so get that magic

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.720 
a huge amount of look so get that magic
find<00:00:09.809> percentage<00:00:10.349> up<00:00:10.559> don't<00:00:11.370> get<00:00:11.550> me<00:00:11.700> wrong

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
find percentage up don't get me wrong

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.669 
find percentage up don't get me wrong
there<00:00:12.150> better<00:00:12.389> ways<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.690> farm<00:00:13.110> karma

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
there better ways to farm karma

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.140 
there better ways to farm karma
materials<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:14.370> you'll<00:00:14.519> have<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> do<00:00:14.969> them

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
materials but you'll have to do them

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.510 
materials but you'll have to do them
separately<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.560> way<00:00:16.830> you'll<00:00:17.039> save<00:00:17.279> some

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
separately so this way you'll save some

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.849 
separately so this way you'll save some
time<00:00:17.730> let's<00:00:18.240> start<00:00:18.600> off<00:00:18.750> with<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.020> location

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
time let's start off with the location

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.250 
time let's start off with the location
it<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.460> located<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> silver<00:00:21.689> wastes<00:00:22.080> if

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
it is located in the silver wastes if

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.929 
it is located in the silver wastes if
you<00:00:22.500> don't<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.070> area<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.730> walk

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
you don't have this area you can walk

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.550 
you don't have this area you can walk
through<00:00:23.970> Brisbane<00:00:24.750> wild<00:00:25.080> lands<00:00:25.260> from<00:00:25.500> the

Vandals claim once you're in you would
want<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> find<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.890> map<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.460> doing<00:00:29.730> the

want to find a map that are doing the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.609 
want to find a map that are doing the
foothold<00:00:30.269> event<00:00:30.630> if<00:00:30.810> you're<00:00:31.050> not<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.410> one

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
foothold event if you're not in one

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.340 
foothold event if you're not in one
already<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.940> by<00:00:33.000> opening<00:00:33.350> lfg

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
already you can do that by opening lfg

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.290 
already you can do that by opening lfg
which<00:00:34.559> stands<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:34.950> looking<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> group<00:00:35.790> the

to<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> end<00:00:44.730> boss<00:00:44.969> once<00:00:45.690> you're<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.260> map

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
to the end boss once you're in the map

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.770 
to the end boss once you're in the map
you<00:00:46.680> would<00:00:46.829> want<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.129> find<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.760> events<00:00:48.239> there

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you would want to find the events there

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.450 
you would want to find the events there
are<00:00:48.870> plenty<00:00:49.079> all<00:00:49.320> around<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> map<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.190> start

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
are plenty all around the map so start

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700 
are plenty all around the map so start
doing<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.120> would<00:00:51.510> recommend<00:00:51.840> even<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.620> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
doing them I would recommend even if you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.290 
doing them I would recommend even if you
don't<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> whole<00:00:53.340> event<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
don't do the whole event just do a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.810 
don't do the whole event just do a
little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> award<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.579> that
