to get these and these also are so
comfortable<00:04:16.400> like<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:17.150> reason<00:04:17.449> why<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:17.599> got

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.350 
all these even though some of you may
think<00:04:19.250> it's<00:04:19.579> unnecessary<00:04:19.729> is<00:04:20.859> because<00:04:22.360> these

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
think it's unnecessary is because these

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.210 
think it's unnecessary is because these
are<00:04:23.539> so<00:04:23.690> comfortable<00:04:23.960> walking<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.740> I
