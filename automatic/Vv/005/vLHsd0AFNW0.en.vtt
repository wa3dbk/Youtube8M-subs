again the sweet maltiness - it

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.370 
again the sweet maltiness - it
definitely<00:04:00.640> helps<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.090> flavor<00:04:01.330> but<00:04:02.230> it

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
definitely helps the flavor but it

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.650 
definitely helps the flavor but it
doesn't<00:04:02.650> really<00:04:02.739> add<00:04:02.860> that<00:04:03.250> much<00:04:03.520> to<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:03.910> but

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
doesn't really add that much to it but

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.060 
doesn't really add that much to it but
