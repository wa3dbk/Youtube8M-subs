hey YouTube you doing had a couple

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.120 
hey YouTube you doing had a couple
screw-ups<00:00:03.330> on<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:04.040> log<00:00:05.040> splitter<00:00:05.430> one<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:07.130> the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
screw-ups on the log splitter one is the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.120 
screw-ups on the log splitter one is the
plasma<00:00:08.639> cutter<00:00:08.790> which<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.870> needed<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.889> still

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
plasma cutter which I needed and still

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.190 
plasma cutter which I needed and still
need<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.550> cut<00:00:11.730> some<00:00:11.910> steel

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
need to cut some steel

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.240 
need to cut some steel
I<00:00:13.230> wanna<00:00:14.330> over-tightening<00:00:16.070> one<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
I wanna over-tightening one of the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.279 
I wanna over-tightening one of the
electrodes<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:19.020> really<00:00:19.380> cranked<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.859> down

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
electrodes and I really cranked it down

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.650 
electrodes and I really cranked it down
that<00:00:22.289> won't<00:00:22.590> work<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:22.859> I've<00:00:23.490> got<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.090> I'm

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
that won't work so I've got to I'm

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.540 
that won't work so I've got to I'm
getting<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.019> fixed<00:00:25.289> right<00:00:25.590> now<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.070> sent<00:00:26.430> that

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
getting that fixed right now I sent that

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.019 
getting that fixed right now I sent that
out<00:00:26.699> today<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.840> other<00:00:27.960> problem<00:00:28.880> which<00:00:29.880> was

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
out today the other problem which was

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.970 
out today the other problem which was
really<00:00:30.240> kind<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.689> stupid<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.230> my<00:00:31.410> part<00:00:31.439> I

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
really kind of stupid on my part I

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.330 
really kind of stupid on my part I
welded<00:00:32.989> this<00:00:34.670> bracket<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.680> cylinder<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
welded this bracket for the cylinder and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.490 
welded this bracket for the cylinder and
I<00:00:38.670> welded<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:40.079> supposed<00:00:40.410> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
I welded it like that I was supposed to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.139 
I welded it like that I was supposed to
weld<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.250> whole<00:00:41.460> piece<00:00:41.870> like<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.760> yes<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
weld this whole piece like this yes and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.229 
weld this whole piece like this yes and
instead<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> had<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.320> reversed<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
instead I had it reversed and then the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.439 
instead I had it reversed and then the
third<00:00:48.480> screw-up<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.980> saved<00:00:50.940> all<00:00:51.239> this

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
third screw-up was I saved all this

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.950 
third screw-up was I saved all this
great<00:00:52.350> video<00:00:52.680> coverage<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.760> my<00:00:53.820> computer<00:00:54.780> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
great video coverage on my computer and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.450 
great video coverage on my computer and
then<00:00:55.340> somehow<00:00:56.340> over<00:00:56.760> wrote<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.920> lost<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
then somehow over wrote it so I lost it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:30.810 
then somehow over wrote it so I lost it
all<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.500> anyway<00:01:01.640> let's<00:01:02.640> get<00:01:02.820> back<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.270> work

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.679 

okay<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:31.880> I've<00:01:32.299> got<00:01:32.329> that<00:01:34.479> cylinder<00:01:35.479> holder

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
okay so I've got that cylinder holder

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.529 
okay so I've got that cylinder holder
the<00:01:36.320> rear<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.829> welded<00:01:37.610> back<00:01:37.759> on<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.329> in<00:01:38.420> the

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
the rear of it welded back on and in the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.160 
the rear of it welded back on and in the
correct<00:01:38.810> position<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:39.860> that's<00:01:40.009> all<00:01:40.310> set

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
correct position so that's all set

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.429 
correct position so that's all set
that's<00:01:42.170> what<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.649> good<00:01:45.799> side<00:01:46.070> looks<00:01:46.310> like

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
that's what it's a good side looks like

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.139 
that's what it's a good side looks like
so<00:01:48.439> that's<00:01:48.560> all<00:01:48.829> set<00:01:48.860> that's<00:01:49.310> all<00:01:49.460> done<00:01:49.670> now<00:01:50.090> we

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
so that's all set that's all done now we

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.859 
so that's all set that's all done now we
need<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.990> do<00:01:51.170> is<00:01:51.820> we<00:01:52.820> need<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:54.340> fabricate<00:01:55.869> these

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
need to do is we need to fabricate these

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.050 
need to do is we need to fabricate these
so<00:01:57.860> that<00:01:57.890> these<00:01:58.340> will<00:01:59.890> pin<00:02:00.890> on<00:02:01.100> like<00:02:01.399> that<00:02:01.670> and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
so that these will pin on like that and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.330 
so that these will pin on like that and
attach<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.350> rear<00:02:03.530> of<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.740> cylinder<00:02:03.979> but<00:02:04.310> I

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
attach the rear of the cylinder but I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.070 
attach the rear of the cylinder but I
want<00:02:04.549> this<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.850> cool<00:02:05.030> first<00:02:05.420> because<00:02:05.869> it's

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
want this to cool first because it's

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:17.089 
want this to cool first because it's
really<00:02:06.409> hot

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.569 

all<00:02:18.099> right<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.489> we<00:02:18.730> have<00:02:19.000> now<00:02:19.239> welded<00:02:20.579> the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
all right so we have now welded the

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.059 
all right so we have now welded the
outside<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.480> bracket<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.110> we've<00:02:23.620> got<00:02:23.829> that

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
outside of the bracket so we've got that

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.729 
outside of the bracket so we've got that
and<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.030> pin<00:02:25.329> is<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.980> place<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.700> don't<00:02:28.180> want<00:02:28.299> to

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
and the pin is in place I don't want to

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.289 
and the pin is in place I don't want to
really<00:02:29.739> do<00:02:29.890> too<00:02:30.159> much<00:02:30.400> on<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.670> because<00:02:31.090> it's

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
really do too much on it because it's

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.530 
really do too much on it because it's
going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.510> get<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:31.989> hot<00:02:32.319> that<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.760> might<00:02:34.299> not<00:02:34.480> be

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
going to get so hot that I might not be

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.210 
going to get so hot that I might not be
able<00:02:34.689> to<00:02:34.780> get<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.019> pin<00:02:35.319> out<00:02:35.349> I'm<00:02:35.859> using<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
able to get that pin out I'm using the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.099 
able to get that pin out I'm using the
pin<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.790> there<00:02:37.780> as<00:02:38.079> a<00:02:38.109> heat<00:02:38.500> sink<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.810> draw

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
pin in there as a heat sink to to draw

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.869 
pin in there as a heat sink to to draw
some<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.739> that<00:02:42.659> heat<00:02:43.659> from<00:02:43.870> welding<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:44.879> what

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
some of that heat from welding and what

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.819 
some of that heat from welding and what
I'll<00:02:46.000> do<00:02:46.299> is<00:02:46.540> then<00:02:46.689> I'll<00:02:46.840> pull<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.319> pin<00:02:47.560> once

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
I'll do is then I'll pull the pin once

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.839 
I'll do is then I'll pull the pin once
it<00:02:47.980> cools<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.780> then<00:02:49.780> I'll<00:02:49.900> be<00:02:50.019> able<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.379> get

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
it cools and then I'll be able to get

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.440 
it cools and then I'll be able to get
inside<00:02:51.849> here<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.920> tops<00:02:54.220> those<00:02:55.209> are<00:02:55.359> just

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
inside here the tops those are just

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.089 
inside here the tops those are just
tacked<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.930> bottom<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.379> tacked<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.829> then<00:02:56.920> I

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
tacked the bottom is tacked and then I

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.240 
tacked the bottom is tacked and then I
got<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.280> weld<00:02:57.760> beads<00:02:58.060> on<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.389> inside<00:02:58.750> there<00:02:59.250> so

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
got a weld beads on the inside there so

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.770 
got a weld beads on the inside there so
that's<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.549> next<00:03:00.730> step

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
that's the next step

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.390 
that's the next step
pull<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.200> o-ring<00:03:02.680> out<00:03:03.159> of<00:03:03.400> there<00:03:04.200> first<00:03:05.400> and

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
pull the o-ring out of there first and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.339
