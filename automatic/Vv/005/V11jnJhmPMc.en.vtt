00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
glitch is right there so to get there

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.320 
glitch is right there so to get there

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
open the door but for you can do the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.370 
open the door but for you can do the
grit<00:01:30.850> you'll<00:01:31.149> need<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.450> kill<00:01:31.659> these<00:01:31.840> hostile

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
grit you'll need to kill these hostile

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.200 
grit you'll need to kill these hostile
so<00:01:32.680> they<00:01:32.860> don't<00:01:33.070> shoot<00:01:33.310> at<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.700> while<00:01:34.000> you're

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
so they don't shoot at you while you're

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.910 
so they don't shoot at you while you're
trying<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.659> do<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.930> because<00:01:35.470> you'll<00:01:35.799> get

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
trying to do it because you'll get

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.980 
trying to do it because you'll get
compromised<00:01:36.549> if<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:37.240> jump<00:01:37.479> around<00:01:37.840> the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
compromised if you just jump around the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.859 
compromised if you just jump around the
map<00:01:38.170> fin<00:01:38.409> so<00:01:39.159> just<00:01:39.520> run<00:01:39.670> out<00:01:39.880> kill<00:01:40.179> these<00:01:42.869> try

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
map fin so just run out kill these try

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.149 
map fin so just run out kill these try
not<00:01:44.050> to<00:01:44.140> shoot<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.380> hostiles<00:01:44.830> because<00:01:45.130> I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
not to shoot the hostiles because I

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.130 
not to shoot the hostiles because I
think<00:01:45.460> if<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.729> kill<00:01:45.940> one<00:01:46.390> of<00:01:46.450> them<00:01:46.720> then<00:01:46.960> it

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
think if you kill one of them then it

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.859 
think if you kill one of them then it
will<00:01:47.640> it'll<00:01:48.640> take<00:01:49.179> you<00:01:49.300> back<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.659> last

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
will it'll take you back to the last

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.840 
will it'll take you back to the last
checkpoint<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.560> just<00:01:51.100> get<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.610> bit

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
checkpoint and just get to that bit

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.730 
checkpoint and just get to that bit
right<00:01:52.000> there<00:01:52.149> then<00:01:52.929> you<00:01:53.110> want<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.350> run<00:01:53.590> and

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
right there then you want to run and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.130 
right there then you want to run and
jump<00:01:53.950> up<00:01:54.190> this<00:01:54.520> wall<00:01:54.819> here<00:01:55.060> then<00:01:55.720> you'll<00:01:55.929> land

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
jump up this wall here then you'll land

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.930 
jump up this wall here then you'll land
on<00:01:56.319> the<00:01:56.440> wall<00:01:56.619> but<00:01:56.950> if<00:01:57.039> you<00:01:57.159> do<00:01:57.280> fall<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.729> you'll

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
and just drop outside the map so it's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.950 
and just drop outside the map so it's
quite<00:02:31.370> easy<00:02:31.430> it's<00:02:32.120> just<00:02:32.330> getting<00:02:32.510> up<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> wall

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
quite easy it's just getting up the wall

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.140 
quite easy it's just getting up the wall
that's<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.320> habit<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:33.890> try<00:02:34.490> not<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.700> fall<00:02:34.880> off

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
that's the habit and try not to fall off

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.390
