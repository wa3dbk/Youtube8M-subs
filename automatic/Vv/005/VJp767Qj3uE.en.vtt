 Gladys Dream 1 Gotei is thank you is the local Okayama Setsuko Taguchi politics you wish 

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:13.180
 To do 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:16.150
 By the way, first of all it is the motor 41 which has a genius, but the winning rate is 51%, but how is it feeling 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.810
 I think that the foot is good 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.360
 It is a part of the foot, but how about the flow of the day on the contrary 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.630
 Time is usually 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.630
 So how do you think of it as an adjustment aspect for this dream game? 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:40.190
 I would like to put the rotation together and make me feel comfortable 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.190
 And it is the first day, but how was the start feeling when you race 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.360
 Now 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.000

 Hey most 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.700
 I feel the feeling is off 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:57.720
 Well then even the correction part of that start mother 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:02.790
 I wonder where you want to make adjustments? 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.990
 I was told until the last 50 and also in the Edgar of the previous section that I won, but the emergency rhythm is 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.830
 What do you think 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.580
 I think yes 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:14.500
 Then, lastly, please give a message to your fans 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.820

 Say thank you number one boat is Tomoka Hirayama players 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:30.110
 The displayed motor 37 has a 27% chance to win, but how is it felt? 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.720
 I really can not fit together at all 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.080
 Not very good 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:42.970
 You'd like to see also that body Nde there one day adjustment plane was Mashi What are your thoughts 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:49.360
 Would you want to determine the top up per what in the body adjustment in 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:52.850
 Well Well overall a little raise is not and that than a little severe leg 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.880
 I think I want to be a little even 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.820
 So how did you start fighting when you started on the first day ? 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.990
 Because the start has not arrived before I thought 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.170
 A little 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.410
 I still haven't got a start 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:13.420
 Then please give a message to your fans 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.290

 I am Yukari Ueno, No. 3 boat Thank you. 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.090
 It was the motor 54 which was acquired , but the winning rate was 26% 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.680
 Or 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.380
 Not good 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.580
 I wonder where there was a particular area of ​​concern 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.350
 Well and it is the overall appearance 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.900
 It may be necessary to raise the whole level 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:47.060
 Is How does the adjustment surface as you think 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:50.650
 I ran too much but I still haven't caught it a little 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.310
 So what do you want to see from now on? 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.850
 Well time 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:01.870
 Yes, neither propeller nor brackets have been decided 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.610
 It's such a place called I'll give it carried out various adjustments in the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.940
 Yes 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:13.270
 Ze whether it was decorated it the number of Futaba won before in Shimonoseki is the recent Yoshitsuma How about 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.930
 I think So is this rhythm and good 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.989
 It is a place that I want to do my best also Section 5 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.939
 Finally, please give a message to your fans 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:26.540

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.540
 Please support 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:37.350
 4 Gotei is Miura EiMakoto players thank you 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:39.410
 Although still it is the motor 22 Unit is a 35% probability of winning How about the other other feeling 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.530
 Hey ! 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.840
 It is normal 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.750
 The first day is recommended as doing the propeller adjustment after one race beneath 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.190
 At first it will be a place such as propeller adjustment 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.800
 Yes yes 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.270
 So what kind of place do you want to seek 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.170
 I want a little more overall 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.810
 Yes 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:07.980
 So, it was adjustment aiming at the overall bottom up 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:12.480
 But it became a gush of two pieces in the all-women's game of the islets in February 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:16.720
 How is your impression of Kojima I like Kozimo 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.930
 Then, lastly, please give a message to your fans 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.699
 8 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.699
 Thank you for thinking 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:30.030
 No. 5 is Kaori Uotani. Thank you . 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:37.319
 A tenacious run was noticeable on the first day, but how is the boat now ? 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:43.620
 Well um I first day it was a butter putter into a real nest 11 race in five races 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:45.880
 I felt better in the second layer than the first win in Hayano, and then I adjusted the propeller in trial operation 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.020
 I tried from the beginning but 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.009
 So I think the boat is getting better 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:05:00.539
 Do you feel especially good for a little bit ? 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:05:04.060
 That's right I think that overall balance is taken, and the feeling after the foot and the ride etc. 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:09.490
 I think that I think that later people do not have such a valve 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.420
 I think that one really overall balance is Haicho Tore 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.160
 Yes 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.760
 Then it's a dream game, but if you look at the members, how is the work statement 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.100
 Or 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:25.450
 I think that it will probably be 5 courses of Hair Maa, so I decided to start from 5 courses firmly 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:30.440
 It's nice but I hope you can do it, please give a message to your fans 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:33.950
 Yes Well firm that good because we finally our request Elect Dream 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:38.020
 Please support you want to race 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:42.220
 6 Gotei will wish you thank you is Kamakuraryo players 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:46.449
 It is said that the 48th motor acquired has a 30% chance of winning 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:50.110
 I think it is generally weak as to feel 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:54.819
 On the first day, it seemed that propeller adjustment was busy. 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.310
 I'm thinking about how to make a propeller adjustment , but I'm still trying to make a big change 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:01.030
 So high 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:07.370
 How about the main body I think maybe maybe full of temples 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:11.449
 Then I would like to try up the whole area or challenge it 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:14.849
 So how was it that you started fighting after the first day ? 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:18.990
 The start was good for plumbing 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:22.760
 It's a small island, but I here came in Wow great eaves the first time in emergence will do there is any impression 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:26.600
 It is not very favorite water surface but is 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:30.770
 Then it is a dream game, but it will be No. 6 boat too 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:33.580
 Please give a message to all of the fans . 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.580
