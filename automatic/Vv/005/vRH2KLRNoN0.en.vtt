00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
and finish up the run all right route 3

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.720 
and finish up the run all right route 3
is<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.580> bomb<00:04:30.150> route<00:04:30.860> by<00:04:31.860> running<00:04:32.190> over<00:04:32.430> here

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
is a bomb route by running over here

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.790 
is a bomb route by running over here
most<00:04:33.720> of<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.900> time<00:04:33.990> that<00:04:34.260> will<00:04:34.350> spawn<00:04:34.530> power

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
most of the time that will spawn power

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.050 
most of the time that will spawn power
stations<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.910> small<00:04:36.480> blue<00:04:36.720> warehouse<00:04:37.200> so

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
stations and the small blue warehouse so

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.690 
stations and the small blue warehouse so
you<00:04:39.060> always<00:04:39.240> got<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.570> keep<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:41.340> always<00:04:41.550> got<00:04:41.670> to

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
you always got to keep you always got to

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.840 
you always got to keep you always got to
keep<00:04:41.850> an<00:04:41.970> eye<00:04:42.060> on<00:04:42.360> way<00:04:42.570> run<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:42.870> so<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:44.520> always

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
keep an eye on way run and so you always

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.880 
keep an eye on way run and so you always
spawn<00:04:45.180> as<00:04:45.600> far<00:04:46.050> away<00:04:46.140> as<00:04:46.290> they<00:04:46.500> can<00:04:46.710> in<00:04:46.740> the

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
spawn as far away as they can in the

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.650 
spawn as far away as they can in the
game<00:04:47.040> that's<00:04:47.310> what<00:04:47.460> if<00:04:47.730> any<00:04:47.970> more<00:04:48.150> tried<00:04:48.390> to<00:04:48.480> do

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
game that's what if any more tried to do

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.110 
game that's what if any more tried to do
so<00:04:49.020> i<00:04:49.260> can<00:04:50.250> say<00:04:50.400> if<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:50.610> were<00:04:50.730> going<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:50.910> run

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
so i can say if you were going to run

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.480 
so i can say if you were going to run
this<00:04:51.240> route<00:04:51.540> keep<00:04:52.530> an<00:04:52.680> eye<00:04:52.800> on<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.040> other<00:04:53.220> side

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
this route keep an eye on the other side

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.440 
this route keep an eye on the other side
of<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.610> map<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.000> they're<00:04:54.180> going<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.360> be

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
of the map and they're going to be

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.120 
of the map and they're going to be
pushing<00:04:54.690> up<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:54.960> stop<00:04:55.200> you<00:04:55.440> so<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.800> would<00:04:55.950> look

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
pushing up to stop you so you would look

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.890 
pushing up to stop you so you would look
a<00:04:56.310> little<00:04:56.580> bit<00:04:56.820> head<00:04:57.120> towards<00:04:57.450> respond<00:04:57.720> so

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
a little bit head towards respond so

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.810 
a little bit head towards respond so
they'll<00:04:58.050> probably<00:04:58.260> be<00:04:58.500> up<00:04:58.620> by<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.310> flaming

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
they'll probably be up by the flaming

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.700 
they'll probably be up by the flaming
red<00:05:00.150> truck<00:05:00.420> trying<00:05:00.720> to<00:05:00.780> cut<00:05:00.960> in<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.260> stop<00:05:01.500> you

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
red truck trying to cut in and stop you

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.440 
red truck trying to cut in and stop you
so<00:05:02.580> you<00:05:02.670> always<00:05:02.790> just<00:05:03.000> got<00:05:03.180> to<00:05:03.240> be<00:05:03.300> thinking

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
so you always just got to be thinking

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.990 
so you always just got to be thinking
ahead<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:04.020> stuff<00:05:04.260> all<00:05:05.070> right<00:05:05.220> room<00:05:05.460> for<00:05:05.760> is

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
ahead and stuff all right room for is

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.950 
ahead and stuff all right room for is
just<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.450> opposite<00:05:06.990> way<00:05:07.170> how<00:05:07.920> to<00:05:07.950> get<00:05:08.840> in<00:05:09.840> the

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
just the opposite way how to get in the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.300 
just the opposite way how to get in the
office<00:05:10.110> side<00:05:10.410> of<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.560> map<00:05:10.850> and<00:05:12.950> this<00:05:13.950> one<00:05:14.130> this

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
office side of the map and this one this

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.210 
office side of the map and this one this
is<00:05:14.370> probably<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.880> longest<00:05:15.060> one<00:05:15.480> I<00:05:16.190> want<00:05:17.190> to

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
is probably the longest one I want to

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.490 
is probably the longest one I want to
use<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.210> normally<00:05:19.140> unless<00:05:19.910> you<00:05:21.080> unless<00:05:22.080> the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
use this normally unless you unless the

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.440 
use this normally unless you unless the
Middle's<00:05:23.310> blocked<00:05:23.670> off<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:23.910> you're<00:05:24.240> having

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
Middle's blocked off and you're having

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.910 
Middle's blocked off and you're having
trouble<00:05:24.780> getting<00:05:24.900> through<00:05:25.140> the<00:05:25.230> middle<00:05:25.560> and

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
trouble getting through the middle and

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.760 
trouble getting through the middle and
you<00:05:25.980> can't<00:05:26.430> get<00:05:26.550> through<00:05:26.760> big<00:05:26.970> blue<00:05:27.150> warehouse

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
you can't get through big blue warehouse

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.230 
you can't get through big blue warehouse
take<00:05:28.770> it<00:05:28.950> the<00:05:29.040> long<00:05:29.220> way<00:05:29.250> around<00:05:29.970> sneak<00:05:30.540> around

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
take it the long way around sneak around

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.350 
take it the long way around sneak around
so<00:05:33.470> so<00:05:34.470> running<00:05:35.040> through<00:05:35.250> here<00:05:35.430> keep<00:05:35.700> it<00:05:35.790> I<00:05:36.060> on

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
so so running through here keep it I on

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.880 
so so running through here keep it I on
big<00:05:36.540> warehouse<00:05:36.900> keep<00:05:37.230> an<00:05:37.350> eye<00:05:37.410> on<00:05:37.440> them<00:05:37.680> trying

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
fourth root some key spot to keep an eye

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.390 
fourth root some key spot to keep an eye
on<00:05:45.810> our<00:05:46.260> el<00:05:46.440> plane<00:05:46.890> and<00:05:47.160> that<00:05:47.340> broken<00:05:47.820> I<00:05:48.030> plane

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.060 
on our el plane and that broken I plane
you<00:05:50.400> can<00:05:50.640> use<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.330> nice<00:05:51.600> spot<00:05:51.870> in<00:05:52.020> I<00:05:52.200> plane<00:05:52.500> to

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
you can use a nice spot in I plane to
