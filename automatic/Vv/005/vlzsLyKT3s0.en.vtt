00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.880
 who there is no mass dear comrades or 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.549
 Good day and you probably already 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.920
 understand what kind of game we have today like 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.490
 did not understand then take off your dude 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.710
 monocle 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.690
 otherwise it runs the risk of melting 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.670
 crack and crumble into a thousand 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.040
 splinters each one turn into 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.230
 in a copy of the book 50 shades of gray 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.270
 and you intellectuals will need them 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.070
 read so i offer you less 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.739
 painful way to fill your brain 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.730
 vulgar and insane saints row 4 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.089
 have developed 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.129
 from afar well, and now the game is difficult now 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.980
 find someone who wouldn't know what 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.960
 saints row 4 grew out of dlc and huge 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.550
 crowds of people on the Internet say it is not 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.559
 you must take it that way because 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.960
 full game but i stick 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.089
 a little different opinion in my eyes new 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.199
 the saints were divided into two parts 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.420
 this story part 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.559
 and the open world so here if the plot 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.440
 the piece really looks like 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.449
 full-fledged new open world game 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.519
 perceived solely as dili 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.010
 the reason for this was the minimum 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.079
 the number of changes in it for that city 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.149
 same added a pair of buildings present 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.130
 new technique and slightly modified 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.320
 tests clean dil se 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.299
 but what the hell are you asking where are you from 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.119
 generally took such a separation of two 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.430
 components of one game I will answer I do not know 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.009
 but when you start further saints 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.079
 row I personally did not leave feeling that 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.610
 in addition to the actual game I was sold 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.439
 also large-scale dlc 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.180
 there is actually nothing in it 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.950
 criminal yes on the one hand 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.500
 disrupted perception integrity 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.750
 product but with a different story campaign 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.609
 looks like a single monolithic creation 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.740
 according to the plot the main character becomes not 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.840
 anyone but the US president but 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.880
 presidential concerns of cancer treatment 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.490
 a long time we are not worried and on land 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.710
 attack aliens led by 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.210
 a certain zinyak willa smith unfortunately 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.219
 girlfriend is not ours 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.679
 protagonist places virtual copy 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.679
 the city of steve further tell anything 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.570
 I will not for spoilers but I will say that the plot 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.549
 since the time pass parts evolved 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.590
 in earnest the number of parodies and 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.750
 ridicule grew just by some 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.150
 incredible amount of yes and no parodies 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.459
 aby which everywhere climb ears creation 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.950
 Wachowski brothers have a stealth episode 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.720
 zakosy under mgs in breaks between 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.420
 missions you roam the cosmic 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.640
 ship and invites all well than for sex 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.190
 not mass effect and stylized level 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.200
 under the archers the raj is simply divine 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.940
 she has also improved before 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.340
 was pretty good but now from 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.890
 acrobatics and some angles goosebumps 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.500
 still run on the inter rejoice like a child 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.540
 the title of the main change claims 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.980
 local special abilities accelerated type 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.650
 running opportunities to jump to a height 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.670
 skyscraper in telekinesis freezing in general 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.890
 the list is decent 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.230
 all this is intended to reshape the mechanics 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.510
 unrecognizable saints turn into 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.480
 hybrid mad parody action movie and 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.120
 legends about the more power the more and 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.610
 responsible kidding what morality and even 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.829
 Saints Row is now a game of parody 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.780
 gta is more like a prototype 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.269
 the feeling of omnipotence is felt here 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.459
 much better besides this main 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.099
 the rod has a smaller size change 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.170
 but on no less pleasant is the weapon 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.549
 felt much better plus 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.620
 it can be completely free here 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.130
 customize turning cis into 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.650
 tommi-gan 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.019
 And uzi in robocop pistol well and pumping 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.940
 weapons, too, have not gone away right here 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.280
 you will still be stressful money 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.170
 the weapons themselves are different now too 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.420
 the main interest is the same 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.280
 advertised dub step gun weapons 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.130
 not only is that interesting but also 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.810
 pretty imbuantly invest in it 80,000 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.150
 and use on his health even 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.130
 cartridges do not end also improved 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.079
 car physics difference now 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.180
 felt not only between cars 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.340
 and trucks but also inside these 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.440
 categories and changing the physics of machines 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.329
 delivers even more fun where 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.549
 eventually realize that the cars themselves here 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.530
 will be needed only if you get tired of wearing 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.569
 walk through the city mean less 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.549
 need for radio transport now 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.829
 can listen without entering the funds 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.410
 movement press the button choose 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.209
 station and go take out the enemies coming out 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.769
 almost ready frag movie even 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.840
 no need to mount if you want 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.239
 show your friends how beautifully scattered 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.739
 a thousand alien aliens do it yourself 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.480
 tests steel sharpened under 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.459
 special abilities like kim person in 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.380
 ring using telekinesis or run 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.989
 half the city on your own two minutes 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.120
 but the tests have not gone away 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.070
 there are also all tanks air cover 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.060
 plus a new opportunity to smash 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.710
 city ​​in the shoes of a huge robot 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.630
 graphics in general remained unchanged from 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.640
 since the third part of a bit fixed 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.920
 lighting and in some places redrawn 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.400
 textures but with sound worked on 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.290
 fame 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.900
 surrounded by the sounds of weapons felt 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.400
 Much juicier sound design and selection 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.470
 songs just on top 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.660
 the only thing that radio stations have become 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.880
 slightly poorer in terms of tracks and yes 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.040
 traces of incredible desire are visible everywhere 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.210
 please modern or relatively 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.510
 modern trends 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.840
 to step dapstep dub step but what in 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.910
 the result 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.070
 I repeat once again about the dissociation of the two 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.140
 constituent projects of the word in since rose 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.540
 the forts felt whole but because 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.730
 story campaign and that incredible 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.980
 the number of parodies I advise everyone to play 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.990
 sure, but swami was a council of watts 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.090
 whatever the morpheus says choose 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.580
 red pill and still sign up for 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.140
 channel put your thumbs up all 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.760
 it is natural provided that you 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.760
 liked this video before the meeting 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.059
 him and 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.059
 once a day 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.380
 she is
