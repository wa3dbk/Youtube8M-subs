00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.030
 country 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.630
 as always the then head of government l贸pez obrador instead of 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.630

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.690
 he responded by mocking us 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.000
 through an indignan comic 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.210

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.300
 importance 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.060
 to the second floors 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.210
 and our security 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.460
 l贸pez 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.030
 boasts brave honesty 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.560
 more than a year ago 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.799
 and before the wave of crimes against women of the third age 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.220
 the citizens sued the head of government to capture the cpi 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.930
 before this l贸pez obrador hid information I deny any possibility 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.030
 of a serial killer as is his custom the fifth trying a new 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.100
 plot 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.210
 26 dead after 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.540
 a brave citizen and that what we do all the citizens 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.050
 everyday 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.170
 defend ourselves from optimism 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.200
 He boasts brave honesty but I ask you 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.970
 it's such a story 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.940
 the one that makes a problem a background 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.550
 I was protesting a plot 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 decade please, a hero 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.400
 your alternative plan 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.289
 with these people he wants to govern us 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.889
 that's not brave honesty 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.989
 it's just cowardice 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.509
 as well as he has gathered 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.039
 face their multiple errors 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:24.029
 his incapacities and lies so he wants to avoid giving his face to society 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.809
 you will always be several others in a debate 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.809
 that is the requirement of a kingdom 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.819
 this time that sr 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.079
 the presidency of the republic is not 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.029
 place to play 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:44.749
 do not let what we live in Afghanistan today become the kind of 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:45.900
 life for everything
