00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
too much ground where I just find 66 is

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.520 
too much ground where I just find 66 is
a<00:01:17.880> lot<00:01:18.150> easier<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.509> control<00:01:18.750> especially<00:01:19.200> when

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
a lot easier to control especially when

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.719 
a lot easier to control especially when
you're<00:01:19.619> playing<00:01:19.770> solo<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.640> only

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
you're playing solo I think I was only

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.039 
you're playing solo I think I was only
playing<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.299> person<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.840> game

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
playing with one person in this game

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.690 
playing with one person in this game
play<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> thought<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.400> pretty<00:01:23.580> good

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
play so I thought it was a pretty good

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.830 
play so I thought it was a pretty good
game<00:01:23.820> i<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.270> ended<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.509> getting<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.109 
game i actually ended up getting a
double<00:01:25.170> more<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.680> p90<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.820> i<00:01:26.850> hope

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
whatever reason the bass down there they

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.720 
whatever reason the bass down there they
really<00:02:34.690> like<00:02:34.870> Cheetos<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.530> what<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.400> would<00:02:36.580> do

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
really like Cheetos and what I would do

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.309 
really like Cheetos and what I would do
I<00:02:36.760> would<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.180> throw<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.510> out<00:02:37.569> on<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.870> surface

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
I would just throw it out on the surface

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.260 
I would just throw it out on the surface
and<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.160> best<00:02:39.370> they<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:39.730> would<00:02:39.850> come<00:02:40.000> up<00:02:40.120> and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
and the best they just would come up and

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.550 
and the best they just would come up and
eat<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.569> which<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:40.810> really<00:02:41.020> fun<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.410> could

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
eat it which is really fun you could

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.170 
eat it which is really fun you could
catch<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.830> ton<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.040> bass<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.459> way<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.880> think

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
catch a ton of bass that way and I think

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.910 
catch a ton of bass that way and I think
they<00:02:43.300> like<00:02:43.450> stock<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.989> river<00:02:44.200> every<00:02:44.500> single

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
they like stock the river every single

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.949 
they like stock the river every single
year<00:02:45.160> but<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.670> one<00:02:46.330> thing<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.780> actually

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
year but a one thing that I actually

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.080 
year but a one thing that I actually
ended<00:02:47.170> up<00:02:47.380> happening<00:02:47.620> was<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.160> seagull<00:02:48.850> came

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
ended up happening was a seagull came

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.330 
ended up happening was a seagull came
down<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.510> swooped<00:02:49.900> up<00:02:50.110> my<00:02:50.290> cheeto<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:50.950> I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
down and swooped up my cheeto and I

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.400 
down and swooped up my cheeto and I
hooked<00:02:51.610> him<00:02:51.730> actually<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.450> what<00:02:52.930> happened<00:02:53.290> was

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
hooked him actually so what happened was

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.870 
hooked him actually so what happened was
he<00:02:53.470> kind<00:02:53.800> of<00:02:53.830> like<00:02:54.010> ripped<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.400> pole<00:02:54.610> out<00:02:54.790> of

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
he kind of like ripped the pole out of

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.820 
he kind of like ripped the pole out of
my<00:02:54.970> hand<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.239> he<00:02:55.330> took<00:02:55.540> off<00:02:55.750> with<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.380> I

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
my hand and he took off with it and I

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.080 
my hand and he took off with it and I
didn't<00:02:57.010> really<00:02:57.100> know<00:02:57.280> what<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.430> do<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:57.819> I<00:02:57.850> was

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
didn't really know what to do so I was

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.790 
didn't really know what to do so I was
in<00:02:58.209> like<00:02:58.330> my<00:02:58.510> hoodie<00:02:58.750> with<00:02:59.140> sweatpants<00:02:59.620> all

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
in like my hoodie with sweatpants all

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800 
in like my hoodie with sweatpants all
that<00:02:59.920> stuff<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.670> I'm<00:03:00.790> just<00:03:00.940> Dobin<00:03:01.360> after<00:03:01.690> it

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
that stuff so I'm just Dobin after it

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.509 
that stuff so I'm just Dobin after it
swam<00:03:02.140> after<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.530> fishing<00:03:02.830> pole<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.130> reel<00:03:03.190> the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
swam after the fishing pole and reel the

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.460 
swam after the fishing pole and reel the
thing<00:03:03.700> in<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.600> was<00:03:04.720> really<00:03:04.959> challenging

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
thing in and it was really challenging

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.199 
thing in and it was really challenging
to<00:03:05.980> actually<00:03:06.340> get<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:06.580> off<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.880> hook<00:03:07.060> or

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
to actually get it off the hook or

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.090 
to actually get it off the hook or
whatever<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.690> I'm<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.440> wondering<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.950> mean

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
whatever and I'm just wondering I mean

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.100 
whatever and I'm just wondering I mean
is<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.310> even<00:03:09.670> legal<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:10.060> catch<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.510> seagull<00:03:10.900> and

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
is it even legal to catch a seagull and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.630 
is it even legal to catch a seagull and
I<00:03:11.440> couldn't<00:03:11.769> really<00:03:11.920> do<00:03:12.100> anything<00:03:12.160> about<00:03:12.489> it

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
I couldn't really do anything about it

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.130 
I couldn't really do anything about it
the<00:03:12.880> seagull<00:03:13.180> don't<00:03:13.390> worry<00:03:13.540> guys<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.930> was<00:03:14.050> all

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
the seagull don't worry guys it was all

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.509 
the seagull don't worry guys it was all
right<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.410> everything<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:14.830> made<00:03:15.040> sure<00:03:15.069> to

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
right and everything I made sure to

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.430 
right and everything I made sure to
handle<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.030> carefully<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:17.049> wasn't<00:03:17.290> like

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
handle it carefully and I wasn't like

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.810 
handle it carefully and I wasn't like
jerking<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.980> around<00:03:18.190> with<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.430> hook<00:03:18.579> in<00:03:18.700> its
