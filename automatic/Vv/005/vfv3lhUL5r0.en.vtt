in<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> fields<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.250> cannot<00:01:44.640> attack<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.329> all

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
in the fields they cannot attack at all

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.590 
in the fields they cannot attack at all
so<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.500> broken<00:01:46.710> effective<00:01:47.390> that<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so it's really broken effective that and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.450 
so it's really broken effective that and

with<00:02:11.240> intimate<00:02:11.540> stirlingshire<00:02:12.080> one<00:02:12.230> frog<00:02:12.500> in

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
with intimate stirlingshire one frog in

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.250 
with intimate stirlingshire one frog in
a<00:02:12.890> second<00:02:13.250> here<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:14.300> roz's<00:02:14.690> everybody<00:02:15.020> know<00:02:15.110> he

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
a second here to roz's everybody know he

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.080 
a second here to roz's everybody know he
does<00:02:15.470> two<00:02:16.040> substitutes<00:02:16.580> now<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> lot<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:16.970> people

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
does two substitutes now a lot of people

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.350 
does two substitutes now a lot of people
might<00:02:17.390> think<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.870> three<00:02:18.530> substitutes<00:02:19.010> is

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
might think that three substitutes is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.000 
might think that three substitutes is
important<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:20.930> think<00:02:21.200> two<00:02:21.320> is<00:02:21.350> because<00:02:21.920> you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
important but I think two is because you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.830 
important but I think two is because you
have<00:02:22.070> five<00:02:22.310> chances<00:02:22.700> get<00:02:22.970> them<00:02:23.060> out<00:02:23.209> with<00:02:23.390> 141

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
have five chances get them out with 141

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.320 
have five chances get them out with 141
and<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.980> know<00:02:25.100> that's<00:02:25.280> why<00:02:25.459> there's<00:02:25.700> 31<00:02:25.940> for

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
and you know that's why there's 31 for

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.880 
and you know that's why there's 31 for
once<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:26.750> just<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.050> get<00:02:27.200> him<00:02:27.350> out<00:02:27.470> early<00:02:27.620> in

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
once it's just to get him out early in

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.920 
once it's just to get him out early in
the<00:02:27.980> game<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.459> get<00:02:28.970> your<00:02:29.090> setup<00:02:29.420> like<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.660> said

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
the game to get your setup like I said

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.260 
the game to get your setup like I said
to<00:02:30.110> do<00:02:30.290> frogs<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.010> slip<00:02:31.160> slop<00:02:31.340> frog<00:02:31.670> they
