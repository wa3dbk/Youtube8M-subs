00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
about 60 grams about 200 grams of these

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.729 
about 60 grams about 200 grams of these
and<00:00:51.800> about<00:00:52.800> 30<00:00:53.039> grams<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:54.260> about<00:00:55.260> 85

and about 30 grams of these about 85

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.650 
and about 30 grams of these about 85
grams<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.399> which<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.820> almost<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.420> entire

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
grams of this which is almost the entire

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.430 
grams of this which is almost the entire
thing<00:00:58.070> this<00:00:59.070> thing<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.670> 90<00:01:00.030> grams

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
thing this thing right here is 90 grams

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.950 
thing this thing right here is 90 grams
so<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.980> reasoning<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:02.910> me<00:01:03.149> he's<00:01:03.359> doing<00:01:03.780> that

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
so the reasoning for me he's doing that

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.780 
so the reasoning for me he's doing that
is<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.170> i<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.739> macros<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.400> exact

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
is because i like my macros to be exact

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.450 
is because i like my macros to be exact
so<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.680> put<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> whole<00:01:08.189> thing<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
so but you can put the whole thing you

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.480 
so but you can put the whole thing you
don't<00:01:08.610> live<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:11.040> course<00:01:11.130> we're

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
don't live here and of course we're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.070 
don't live here and of course we're
going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> need<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.180> these<00:01:12.390> things<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.930> can

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
going to need one of these things we can

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.870 
going to need one of these things we can
measure<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.520> are<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> weights<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.880> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
measure up are the weights for the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.289 
measure up are the weights for the
individual<00:01:18.509> ingredients<00:01:19.220> it's<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.310> scale<00:01:20.570> so

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
individual ingredients it's a scale so

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.390 
individual ingredients it's a scale so
well<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> first<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.229> chop<00:01:25.530> these<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.830> into

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
well I first do is I chop these up into

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.600 
well I first do is I chop these up into
small<00:01:27.150> pieces<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.890> then<00:01:28.890> after<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.549> just

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
small pieces and then after that I just

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.780 
small pieces and then after that I just
mix<00:01:30.000> everything<00:01:30.150> up<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> big<00:01:30.869> bowl<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.490> here

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
mix everything up in a big bowl so here

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.260 
mix everything up in a big bowl so here
this<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:35.130> once<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.909> big<00:01:36.090> bowl

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this right here so once in a big bowl

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.859 
this right here so once in a big bowl
like<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:37.159> just<00:01:38.159> use<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> spoon<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
like this I just use a spoon and it

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
like this I just use a spoon and it
makes<00:01:40.049> everything<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> first<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
makes everything up like that first and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.080 
makes everything up like that first and
then<00:01:43.460> after<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> while<00:01:44.610> um<00:01:45.229> once<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.380> makes<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
then after a while um once it makes a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.469 
then after a while um once it makes a
bit<00:01:48.090> better<00:01:48.240> I'm<00:01:49.229> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> use<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:51.119> plastic

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
bit better I'm going to use this plastic

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.469 
bit better I'm going to use this plastic
right<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.310> saran<00:01:53.310> wrap<00:01:53.490> use<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.060> hands<00:01:54.420> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
right here saran wrap use my hands to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.719 
right here saran wrap use my hands to
mix<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.320> eventually<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:58.229> turns<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.729> do

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
mix it and eventually it turns to do

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.990 
mix it and eventually it turns to do
like<00:02:00.000> consistency<00:02:00.829> much<00:02:01.829> like<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.460> quest<00:02:02.729> bar

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
like consistency much like the quest bar

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.289 
like consistency much like the quest bar
so<00:02:03.240> I'll<00:02:03.329> show<00:02:03.390> right<00:02:03.719> now

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.199 

so<00:02:07.299> it<00:02:07.420> turns<00:02:07.659> out<00:02:07.899> just<00:02:08.110> like<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.470> quest<00:02:08.709> bar

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
so it turns out just like the quest bar

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.970 
so it turns out just like the quest bar
just<00:02:10.209> like<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:11.849> then<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:13.620> would<00:02:14.620> weigh

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
just like that then I would weigh

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.520 
just like that then I would weigh
everything<00:02:15.370> out<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.910> i<00:02:16.569> will<00:02:16.750> divide<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.290> in

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
everything out and i will divide this in

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.509 
everything out and i will divide this in
eight<00:02:18.129> pieces<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.680> for<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.769> macros<00:02:21.220> here

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
eight pieces and for the macros here

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.570 
eight pieces and for the macros here
it's<00:02:21.670> about<00:02:21.970> 195<00:02:22.599> calories<00:02:23.110> six<00:02:23.920> grams<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.400> fat

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
it's about 195 calories six grams of fat

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.759 
it's about 195 calories six grams of fat
two<00:02:24.879> and<00:02:25.000> three<00:02:25.150> grams<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.769> carbs<00:02:28.410> 18<00:02:29.410> grams<00:02:29.560> of
