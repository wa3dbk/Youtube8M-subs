00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
the vertex three in the top right corner

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.379 
the vertex three in the top right corner
but<00:01:19.259> look<00:01:19.409> at<00:01:19.499> all<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.939> gadgetry<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.210> that

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:21.389 
but look at all that gadgetry all that

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:23.779 
but look at all that gadgetry all that
goodness<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.499> interior<00:01:23.069> there<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.549> yes

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
goodness on the interior there but yes

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.809 
goodness on the interior there but yes
I've<00:01:24.179> got<00:01:24.359> the<00:01:24.509> vertex<00:01:24.990> three<00:01:25.380> SSD<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.249> the

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
I've got the vertex three SSD in the

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.419 
I've got the vertex three SSD in the
regular<00:01:27.240> drive<00:01:27.539> bay<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.079> my<00:01:28.679> Mac<00:01:28.859> Pro<00:01:28.889> Pro<00:01:29.219> and

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
regular drive bay of my Mac Pro Pro and

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.699 
regular drive bay of my Mac Pro Pro and
then<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.149> optical<00:01:30.869> drive<00:01:30.959> bay<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> swapped

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
then in the optical drive bay I swapped

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.639 
then in the optical drive bay I swapped
out<00:01:31.889> the<00:01:32.100> optical<00:01:32.429> drive<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:33.060> my<00:01:34.020> traditional

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
out the optical drive for my traditional

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.649 
out the optical drive for my traditional
hard<00:01:34.889> drive<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.340> guess<00:01:35.459> it<00:01:35.579> was<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> 750<00:01:36.479> gigabyte

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
hard drive I guess it was a 750 gigabyte

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.599 
hard drive I guess it was a 750 gigabyte
drive<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.439> lives<00:01:37.649> in<00:01:37.799> there<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.249> extra

drive that lives in there for extra

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.520 
drive that lives in there for extra
storage<00:01:38.819> because<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.329> don't<00:01:39.689> need<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.170> optical

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
storage because I don't need the optical

storage because I don't need the optical
drive<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:41.280> RAM<00:01:41.579> lives<00:01:41.939> over<00:01:42.389> in<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.840> center

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319

right now and to get it out all you got
to<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> pull<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:48.899> little<00:01:49.170> tabs<00:01:49.499> to<00:01:49.859> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
to do is pull these little tabs to the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.949 
to do is pull these little tabs to the
side<00:01:50.219> here's<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:50.909> closer<00:01:51.209> look<00:01:51.479> at<00:01:51.630> what<00:01:51.840> they

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
side here's a closer look at what they

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.809 
side here's a closer look at what they
look<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.200> there's<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.889> the<00:01:52.979> left<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.789> on

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
look like there's one on the left one on

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.819 
look like there's one on the left one on
the<00:01:53.939> right<00:01:54.029> you<00:01:54.389> pull<00:01:54.689> them<00:01:54.899> away<00:01:55.409> from<00:01:55.679> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the right you pull them away from the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.099 
the right you pull them away from the
RAM<00:01:56.039> chip<00:01:56.069> and<00:01:56.579> since<00:01:57.179> it's<00:01:57.359> spring<00:01:57.659> loaded<00:01:57.689> it

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
RAM chip and since it's spring loaded it

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.169 
RAM chip and since it's spring loaded it
should<00:01:58.289> pop<00:01:58.529> up<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.979> then<00:01:59.069> you<00:01:59.189> just<00:01:59.219> pull<00:02:00.060> it

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
should pop up and then you just pull it

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.209 
should pop up and then you just pull it
out<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.719> should<00:02:00.899> be<00:02:00.990> ready<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.469> then

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
out and you should be ready to go then

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.249 
out and you should be ready to go then
you've<00:02:02.399> got<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.759> open<00:02:02.999> up<00:02:03.299> your<00:02:03.479> new<00:02:03.719> RAM<00:02:03.959> of

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
you've got to open up your new RAM of

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.649 
you've got to open up your new RAM of
course<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.859> get<00:02:05.429> that<00:02:05.639> inserted<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.270> insert

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
course and get that inserted you insert

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.900 
course and get that inserted you insert
it<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.020> manner<00:02:07.469> opposite<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
it in the manner opposite of the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.690 
it in the manner opposite of the
extraction<00:02:09.690> process<00:02:09.900> as<00:02:10.440> you'd<00:02:10.830> expect<00:02:11.400> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
extraction process as you'd expect and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.970 
extraction process as you'd expect and
it's<00:02:12.510> really<00:02:12.780> easy<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.080> do<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.320> just<00:02:13.350> line<00:02:13.800> up

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
it's really easy to do you just line up

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.510 
it's really easy to do you just line up
the<00:02:14.130> pin

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
the pin

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.920 
the pin
that's<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.850> main<00:02:15.030> thing<00:02:15.240> make<00:02:15.450> sure<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.720> line

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
that's the main thing make sure you line

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.650 
that's the main thing make sure you line
up<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.110> pin<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.740> correct<00:02:17.130> side<00:02:17.510> slide<00:02:18.510> it

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
up the pin on the correct side slide it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.910 
up the pin on the correct side slide it
in<00:02:18.780> there<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.080> bottom<00:02:19.290> one<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.710> little

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
in there the bottom one is a little

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.950 
in there the bottom one is a little
tougher<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.520> line<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.910> then<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.270> top<00:02:21.480> one<00:02:21.750> and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
tougher to line up then the top one and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.350 
tougher to line up then the top one and
then<00:02:22.500> press<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.980> down<00:02:23.190> you'll<00:02:23.790> sort<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.180> feel

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
then press it down you'll sort of feel

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.800 
then press it down you'll sort of feel
it<00:02:24.390> slide<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.230> then<00:02:25.500> click<00:02:25.830> down<00:02:26.810> towards
