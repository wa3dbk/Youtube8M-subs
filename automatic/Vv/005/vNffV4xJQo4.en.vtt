00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
everything is linguine because it's like

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.729 
everything is linguine because it's like
spaghetti<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.460> bit<00:00:47.460> flatter<00:00:51.350> sort<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> cross

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
spaghetti a bit flatter sort of a cross

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.729 
spaghetti a bit flatter sort of a cross
between<00:00:52.850> spaghetti<00:00:53.850> attactive<00:00:54.420> telly<00:00:54.739> so

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
between spaghetti attactive telly so

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.830 
between spaghetti attactive telly so
it's<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.220> bit<00:00:56.400> it's<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.420> got<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> flat

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's just a bit it's just got a flat

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.600 
it's just a bit it's just got a flat
side<00:00:58.110> it's<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.500> round<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.100> actually<00:00:59.340> prefer

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
side it's not round up I actually prefer

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.020 
side it's not round up I actually prefer
this<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.390> spaghetti<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.190> seems<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.610> take

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
this to spaghetti it just seems to take

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.420 
this to spaghetti it just seems to take
the<00:01:03.270> source<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.199> take<00:01:04.439> flavors<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> bit<00:01:05.220> better

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the source and take flavors a bit better

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.749 
the source and take flavors a bit better
because<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.210> surface<00:01:06.810> area<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.759> so

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
because of the surface area I think so

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.289 
because of the surface area I think so
yeah<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.079> just<00:01:10.789> use<00:01:11.789> some<00:01:12.060> lemon

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
yeah that's it and just use some lemon

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.139 
yeah that's it and just use some lemon
juice<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.780> well<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:14.159> will<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
juice as well and that will be that

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.730 
juice as well and that will be that
would<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.329> all<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.539> need<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.079> this<00:01:16.139> sauce<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:29.239 
to prepare the stuff for their sauce
okay<00:01:26.999> so<00:01:27.060> I've<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.270> put<00:01:27.420> me<00:01:27.749> linguine<00:01:28.619> into<00:01:29.219> a

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
okay so I've just put me linguine into a

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.779 
okay so I've just put me linguine into a
pan<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.700> boiling<00:01:30.090> salted<00:01:30.689> water<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:32.340> now<00:01:32.520> all

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
pan of boiling salted water and now all

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.059 
pan of boiling salted water and now all
I<00:01:32.819> need<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.389> is<00:01:33.899> I'll<00:01:34.229> start<00:01:34.469> with<00:01:34.709> a<00:01:34.799> chili

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
I need to do is I'll start with a chili

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.269 
I need to do is I'll start with a chili
so<00:01:35.310> I'll<00:01:35.369> probably<00:01:35.490> use<00:01:35.670> about<00:01:36.509> half<00:01:36.899> of<00:01:37.079> this

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:37.279 
so I'll probably use about half of this

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:41.419 
so I'll probably use about half of this
chili<00:01:38.279> and<00:01:38.609> then<00:01:39.209> I've<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:39.899> want<00:01:40.319> to<00:01:40.649> look

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
chili and then I've just want to look

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.999 
chili and then I've just want to look
roughly<00:01:41.819> cuts<00:01:42.179> it<00:01:42.359> fairly<00:01:42.689> very<00:01:43.319> small<00:01:43.709> so<00:01:43.950> you

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
roughly cuts it fairly very small so you

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.639 
roughly cuts it fairly very small so you
can<00:01:44.249> just<00:01:44.459> cut<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.880> half<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:45.560> cut<00:01:46.560> across

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
can just cut it in half then cut across

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.399 
can just cut it in half then cut across
that<00:01:46.889> and<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:47.539> turn<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:48.569> round<00:01:48.840> sort<00:01:49.319> of

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that and then turn it round sort of

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.249 
that and then turn it round sort of
thing<00:01:49.560> cuts<00:01:50.099> it<00:01:50.219> again<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
thing cuts it again so it's just like a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.730 
thing cuts it again so it's just like a
fine<00:01:52.889> dice

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:15.520 

and<00:01:58.370> same<00:01:58.670> with<00:01:58.850> this<00:02:08.050> again<00:02:09.050> same<00:02:09.530> thing<00:02:14.530> okay

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
and same with this again same thing okay

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.370 
and same with this again same thing okay
so<00:02:15.980> that's<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.880> then<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.630> garlic<00:02:17.900> I'll

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
so that's that and then the garlic I'll

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.430 
so that's that and then the garlic I'll
use<00:02:19.060> three<00:02:20.060> cloves<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.720> think<00:02:20.930> I'm<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.290> going

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
use three cloves I think I'm just going

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.890 
use three cloves I think I'm just going
to<00:02:21.500> crush<00:02:21.709> those<00:02:21.950> when<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.540> when<00:02:23.540> it's<00:02:23.569> ready

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
to crush those when it's when it's ready

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:39.640 
to crush those when it's when it's ready
say<00:02:30.489> these<00:02:31.489> folks<00:02:31.850> they're<00:02:32.180> quite<00:02:32.390> small<00:02:38.650> then

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
say these folks they're quite small then

out<00:04:52.240> we<00:04:52.360> have<00:04:52.449> invited<00:04:52.690> me<00:04:52.870> so<00:04:53.139> I'm<00:04:53.289> gonna<00:04:53.500> just

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
out we have invited me so I'm gonna just

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:03.480 
out we have invited me so I'm gonna just
use<00:04:54.039> a<00:04:54.070> bit<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.340> water<00:04:54.539> from<00:04:55.539> the<00:04:55.660> pasta<00:05:02.490> really

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
use a bit of water from the pasta really

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.719 
use a bit of water from the pasta really
is<00:05:03.699> it<00:05:03.910> so<00:05:04.919> ideally<00:05:05.919> would<00:05:06.070> have<00:05:06.220> some<00:05:06.430> lemon

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
is it so ideally would have some lemon

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:22.480 
is it so ideally would have some lemon
zesting<00:05:07.690> juice<00:05:07.930> going<00:05:08.680> in<00:05:08.949> there

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:30.810 

but<00:05:23.420> I<00:05:23.660> thought<00:05:23.870> that<00:05:24.080> sound

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.590 

and<00:05:31.820> that's<00:05:31.970> it<00:05:32.180> that's<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.450> sauce<00:05:32.720> done<00:05:34.600> just

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
and that's it that's the sauce done just

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.890 
and that's it that's the sauce done just
check<00:05:35.780> this<00:05:35.930> pasta<00:05:37.240> so<00:05:38.240> it's<00:05:38.360> not<00:05:38.480> quite<00:05:38.720> there

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
check this pasta so it's not quite there

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.870 
check this pasta so it's not quite there
yet<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.410> I'll<00:05:39.530> just<00:05:39.740> turn<00:05:40.220> the<00:05:40.400> sauce<00:05:40.610> right

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
yet so I'll just turn the sauce right

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.020 
yet so I'll just turn the sauce right
down<00:05:41.710> I'll<00:05:42.710> just<00:05:42.889> give<00:05:43.070> it<00:05:43.190> another<00:05:43.280> 30

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
down I'll just give it another 30

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.790 
down I'll just give it another 30
seconds<00:05:44.450> or<00:05:44.570> so<00:05:44.600> and<00:05:44.780> I<00:05:44.930> turn<00:05:45.139> it<00:05:45.290> off

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
seconds or so and I turn it off
