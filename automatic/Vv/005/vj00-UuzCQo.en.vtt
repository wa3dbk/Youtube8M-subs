00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.180
 hello, maidens, today, I am mine 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.660
 friend david we wanted to tell you about nail 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.380
 art and we wanted to apply these with you 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.079
 which are the new stickers to debora it 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.300
 There are so many adhesive glazes 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:32.320
 companies now and I did not yet 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.790
 approved and I said ok let's try that 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.750
 let 's try the indirect with mine 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.040
 I have already applied maidens on my hand 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.410
 right 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.390
 here is just to see to see if 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.600
 it's a complicated thing and if I could 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.269
 do it without having ever done it 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.519
 first in a very simple way and now 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.579
 I will apply this instead on the hand 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.589
 left so I will be much simpler 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.390
 and I'll show you the process that 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.420
 what we need ie runs before 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.740
 all an adhesive glaze just like 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.540
 this one I chose this one here 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:12.280
 you see everything silver and it's transparent 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.990
 we can show it where you are 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.170
 here the transparent with these rows in 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.350
 in silver and are in relief and if not or 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.880
 also this one always debora so 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.360
 made to pizza 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.149
 as you see every row shows it to understand 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.890
 how to move every finger is done in 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.570
 different way that it seems 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:42.509
 all placed however the fantasies are 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.820
 all these are so straight here 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.929
 I have to figure out how to frame these here 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.500
 punctuate this one that I'm wearing 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.509
 this with pitbulls this type net so 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.409
 Scottish lace what I have 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:02.280
 showed another of lace all of gold 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:05.549
 zebra and spotted come 7 euros and 90 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.020
 but it depends on where it is 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.360
 went to buy them will cost 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.510
 certainly 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.700
 the less you do this poses always do 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.590
 from the great price offers 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.780
 much lower than the others 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.310
 then what we need we need 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.640
 tell a sticker and an ops 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.610
 I file this one here a lime that 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.420
 scratch a lot and put them in one 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.230
 scratch 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.840
 a little less if I'm very hm up here 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.910
 pc steam is very simple which one 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.580
 I take the cheapest because anyway 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.880
 I use very little so let's see if I can 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.530
 to turn beckham 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:53.520
 on the other side so at least look at me 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:03:06.769
 so remember yes here is sorry this 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:11.819
 you want to see it all then david 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:16.250
 help me you distract me david distracts me e 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:19.739
 let's show some more ideas like that 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:24.209
 here it is who we like we like this 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:27.780
 tattoo here then we take the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.290
 sticker then you must first of all 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.850
 understand the size of your fingers 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.100
 so you have to do tests for 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.650
 see just how big yours is 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.350
 finger to take the bald look 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.930
 I understood from this yes that I have some 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.150
 pretty big nails and therefore for the 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.150
 little finger for example I don't take this 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.950
 here the smallest but I have to take the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.750
 second 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.859
 so what i do is this part 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.450
 some more round ops there is this part 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.579
 more round copies than the one that will go 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.109
 just at the end of the nails this does 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.410
 straightest pleasure that will go precisely 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:07.320
 from the inside of the thousand li 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.780
 I take this sticker of course worth it 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.549
 from the part that then go has removed the 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.090
 I was thinking that if you have nails 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.160
 corte has cut itself in two 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.930
 I think you can also use two 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.330
 times 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.490
 I apply let's get a little closer 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.139
 he managed to see 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.139
 I apply the sticker on the nail 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:40.500
 here it was my mom 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.500
 here I fold it 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:55.739
 and I crush a lot of pressure 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:59.369
 long because it adheres really well 

00:04:55.739 --> 00:05:01.259
 rather if there is, you are undecided between two 

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:02.249
 size one larger than one more 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.989
 little 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:07.259
 take with the youngest because 

00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:10.439
 the smallest, okay, there is no typical problem 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:13.559
 here in this case you will have a space 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:16.889
 empty but the larger one will stick 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:21.029
 the skin ops will stick to the skin and 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:23.339
 therefore you will have no way of yes will rise 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:25.830
 immediately because it was not sticky 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:28.429
 the skin and therefore probably those 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.689
 long and then off via mattock 

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:42.409
 once you've done a lot 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:42.409
 pressure on the nail folded here is here 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.980
 your nails ready and do so for 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.980
 all nails 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.630
 ends 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:19.090
 now I take a file 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:25.889
 which deals with more is very much 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:33.610
 abrasive and begins to file 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:38.620
 gently until you see it is not 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:40.810
 take away for these little bits 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:46.270
 I think I'm scared to file underneath 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:51.130
 the nail I use the file the 4 part 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:55.509
 that first of all here is yours 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:59.620
 nails we can see it here they are 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:00.849
 your grease the groups the effect is 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.599
 very nice 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:09.069
 the feeling just now 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:12.789
 omitted it is as if I had false nails 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:16.539
 that is, I feel something substantial 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:18.909
 on the nail I feel a bit I feel a 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:21.460
 a bit strange if you have indeed put them 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:23.889
 fake nails you know the feeling that 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:28.330
 you have to feel something on your nail 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:30.190
 if you want to give it more brilliance e 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.669
 greater resistance 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:36.520
 just put him with top coat nothing 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:40.090
 this is how much in the information box vi 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:42.789
 I will put the duration as long as I have 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:45.250
 so if you want even more duration 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:46.050
 even more brilliance will suffice to put 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:50.889
 a top coat 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:53.710
 for today it's all and david beckham cute 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:55.090
 we tell you that we see each other 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.620
 video 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.620
 hello worse the reasons
