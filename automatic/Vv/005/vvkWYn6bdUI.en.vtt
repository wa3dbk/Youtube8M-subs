harder<00:01:36.009> so<00:01:36.549> far<00:01:36.880> it's<00:01:37.030> worth<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:38.110> know<00:01:38.229> you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
harder so far it's worth you know you

might want to keep into this for a good

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.859 
might want to keep into this for a good
long<00:01:41.500> time<00:01:41.770> until<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.250> gets<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:43.030> change<00:01:43.479> is

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
long time until it gets that change is
