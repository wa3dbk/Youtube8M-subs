00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
teams that compete with these teams

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.439

there are a lot of teams that are really

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.420 
there are a lot of teams that are really
close<00:00:24.689> some<00:00:25.619> players<00:00:25.830> might<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.160> better<00:00:26.310> than

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
close some players might be better than

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.220 
close some players might be better than
other<00:00:26.580> teams<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:27.269> choose<00:00:27.510> not<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:28.050> in

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
other teams and just choose not to be in

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.650 
other teams and just choose not to be in
the<00:00:28.410> top<00:00:28.590> three<00:00:28.880> but<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.060> my<00:00:30.179> opinion<00:00:30.330> i<00:00:30.630> think

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the top three but in my opinion i think

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.020 
the top three but in my opinion i think
the<00:00:30.869> top<00:00:31.019> two<00:00:31.170> teams<00:00:31.380> are<00:00:31.740> sorry<00:00:32.369> obey<00:00:32.669> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the top two teams are sorry obey and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.729 
the top two teams are sorry obey and
face<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.690> no<00:00:33.809> order<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.410> was<00:00:34.530> not<00:00:34.649> an

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
face and no order that that was not an

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.810
