duty<00:01:10.260> series<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:11.540> found<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.200> becoming<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
duty series I found that it's becoming a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.789 
duty series I found that it's becoming a
lot<00:01:14.070> more<00:01:14.100> noobish<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.619> really

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
lot more noobish like you really

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.060

because<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:22.020> rate<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> fire<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.340> was<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
because the rate of fire was it was a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.590 
because the rate of fire was it was a
lot<00:01:24.390> slower<00:01:24.720> than<00:01:24.869> any<00:01:25.200> SMG<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.400> date<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:27.090> the

started putting the top crosshair the
top<00:01:55.680> line<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> your<00:01:56.280> crosshair<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:57.170> the

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
top line of your crosshair on the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.999 
top line of your crosshair on the
person's<00:01:59.490> head<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.560> reason<00:02:01.860> I've<00:02:01.979> been

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
person's head and the reason I've been

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.450 
person's head and the reason I've been
doing<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:04.100> when<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
doing this is because when you do that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.920 
doing this is because when you do that
you<00:02:05.759> control<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> recoil

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you control the recoil

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.630 
you control the recoil
I<00:02:07.049> noticed<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.619> let's<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.129> say<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.610> a

like pb9 t is perfect hip firing is

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.450 
like pb9 t is perfect hip firing is
amazing<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:03.150> MP<00:03:03.500> mp7<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> hip<00:03:04.710> fires<00:03:04.920> amazing

amazing the MP mp7 the hip fires amazing

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.030 
amazing the MP mp7 the hip fires amazing
the<00:03:05.550> UMP<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:05.910> hip<00:03:06.180> fires<00:03:06.390> amazing<00:03:06.900> ACR<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.920> hip

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
the UMP is hip fires amazing ACR the hip

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.880 
the UMP is hip fires amazing ACR the hip
fire<00:03:08.250> could<00:03:08.580> be<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:09.140> 50/50<00:03:10.140> mainly<00:03:10.590> because<00:03:10.740> of

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
fire could be a 50/50 mainly because of

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.100 
fire could be a 50/50 mainly because of
the<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.310> rate<00:03:11.460> of<00:03:11.580> fire<00:03:11.760> on<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.120> not<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:12.480> fast

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
the the rate of fire on is not so fast

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.840 
the the rate of fire on is not so fast
Mesa<00:03:13.740> cailli<00:03:13.950> if<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> gun<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:14.670> has<00:03:14.820> a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
Mesa cailli if you have a gun that has a

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.880 
Mesa cailli if you have a gun that has a
fast<00:03:15.390> rate<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.630> fire<00:03:15.750> hipfire<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.470> gonna<00:03:16.740> be

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
fast rate of fire hipfire is gonna be

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.550 
fast rate of fire hipfire is gonna be
fantastic<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.730> that's<00:03:18.660> why<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.320> lot<00:03:19.530> of

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
fantastic so that's why I do a lot of

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.190 
fantastic so that's why I do a lot of
the<00:03:19.680> hip<00:03:19.800> firing<00:03:20.040> with<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.310> pp<00:03:20.520> 90<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.840> one

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
the hip firing with the pp 90 but one

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.420 
the hip firing with the pp 90 but one
thing<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.500> doesn't<00:03:22.710> change<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
thing that doesn't change is the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.740 
thing that doesn't change is the
technique<00:03:23.790> on<00:03:23.940> how<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.150> control<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.600> recoil

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
technique on how to control the recoil

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.620 
technique on how to control the recoil
by<00:03:25.170> aiming<00:03:26.040> down<00:03:26.340> putting<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.330> crosshair

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
by aiming down putting that crosshair

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.180 
by aiming down putting that crosshair
the<00:03:27.990> top<00:03:28.170> crosshair<00:03:28.560> on<00:03:28.710> somebody's<00:03:29.160> head

guy<00:03:36.720> in<00:03:36.750> mid<00:03:37.020> fire<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.530> do<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.710> left<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.070> right

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
guy in mid fire I do a left and right

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.240 
guy in mid fire I do a left and right
jib<00:03:38.460> maneuver<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.090> I'm<00:03:39.840> gonna<00:03:40.080> zoom<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.830> but<00:03:41.220> I

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
jib maneuver and I'm gonna zoom in but I

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.770 
jib maneuver and I'm gonna zoom in but I
didn't<00:03:41.580> feel<00:03:41.730> comfortable<00:03:41.910> aiming<00:03:42.510> down<00:03:42.630> my

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
didn't feel comfortable aiming down my

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.270 
didn't feel comfortable aiming down my
side<00:03:43.020> so<00:03:43.230> what<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.380> do<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.710> just<00:03:43.890> decided<00:03:44.160> to

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
side so what I do is I just decided to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.340 
side so what I do is I just decided to
hipfire<00:03:44.670> as<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.270> guys<00:03:45.390> noticed<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.930> didn't<00:03:46.140> aim

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
anywhere near the guy's head but I put

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.510 
anywhere near the guy's head but I put
my<00:03:48.750> crosshair<00:03:49.260> on<00:03:49.290> top<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.830> his<00:03:49.950> head<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.280> the

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520
