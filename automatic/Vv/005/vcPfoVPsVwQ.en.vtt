00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.699
 quite curious enough let's do 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.570
 a good attack more than curious 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.430
 entertaining 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.470
 let's see an attack these that you 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.699
 we can be pretty let's take it 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.020
 the trunk that I do not like how it looks 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.029
 here and we're going to remove the tree that I do not 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.340
 like how it is here we are going to review 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.469
 guys an attack with 5 goals if not 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.260
 I remember bad we go here good sorry 6 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:35.180
 goals the utility 6 goals and 10 breaks 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.230
 walls that is still pretty fast and good 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.090
 guys the truth that I really want 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.590
 to realize this face that since few 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.180
 I've tried it sometimes and I do not know how 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.190
 it will work and also what I have 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.720
 thought about his life now they are going to be the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.660
 theme of the balloons because they have told me 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.460
 that the balloons at level 6 petan enough 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.750
 quite pretty then then guys 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.550
 if this video comes enough likes 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.110
 let's put 300 lights I'm going to make a 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.030
 attack with balloons is worth yes for the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.130
 next video, I can improve 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.260
 the troops and that week already 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.579
 I have what it is balloons with 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.320
 those comments and that without any 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.059
 I'll upload it then guys 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.229
 we can give cane we are going to repair a 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.630
 moment this we have it enough 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.570
 spare is not going to do much effect 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.420
 we take it off and well guys we have 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.180
 in the cauldron also that I do not remember 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.619
 we have a healing spell and 12 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.320
 spells of anger to see how we 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.330
 it works always I 'll tell you by 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.500
 please the comments you want 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.930
 what you do in a video is worth it if you want 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.570
 make a taco curiosities two looting 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.340
 any nonsense or a 2.0 even if 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.080
 you want a 2.0 with my sister too 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.479
 Well, not in the comments, I told them 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.560
 that if the videos were happening and it's going 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.479
 growing the channel that already also 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.310
 having much later 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.780
 we're probably going to leave it a little 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.000
 band that has to do their stories 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:48.990
 and I just entertain myself guys I'm going to 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.990
 make the attack or we will see 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.479
 the truth is how very well I do not know the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.069
 goals but how are they going to develop 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.810
 sounds because the truth is that the 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.940
 goals will take a long time to tighten 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.920
 the whole village if I do not imagine it wrong 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.840
 then we are going to look for a village that does not 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.159
 have many compartments ie 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.720
 that the whole center is like this one 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.299
 here well for example I think it can 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.130
 be pretty pretty cool then 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:18.120
 let's put break walls that go 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.460
 and this looks like before the balls 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.380
 here brava 123 to the best since bravo 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.270
 not then I think I 'm going to go by 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.830
 this area guys we are going to put a young 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.100
 around here a button around here are worth 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.110
 here a golem here we are going to throw 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.090
 We break manrique well in this area 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.610
 ok to see what if they come in that 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.810
 what petan is worth what tight we go 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.200
 to throw 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.020
 the king and the queen around here we are 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.420
 22 goals around here gonna throw break 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.920
 walls okay guys let's throw the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.580
 spell of rage when I can towards 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.610
 in throw it 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.440
 here we are going to throw it to see if really 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.350
 works well or is not here the truth 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:04.980
 it's a pretty random healing thing 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:06.930
 because it is in the center and Well 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.550
 is being totally wrong we are going to 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.560
 try to go for the town hall that does not 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.850
 I know if to go directly then I do not know 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.720
 will try guys to try what is it 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.280
 important 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.540
 it seems that the goals are that are 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.590
 suffering the guys are suffering 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.840
 we have enough mini goals right now 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.550
 while we get 50% I'm satisfied 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.410
 then we will try to get what 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.900
 that is worth more the ability of the king 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.980
 Well, you are seeing, they are already 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.680
 approaching inside the goals or 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.060
 we have the free bar in front of 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.380
 queen archer is getting out of hand 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.630
 what he is doing is leaving 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.250
 dv assisted runs in front that the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.959
 golems are challenging the entire area of 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.040
 center ok we have to create that was that 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.290
 always comes to hit a wall when 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.090
 put the polycenter I'm freaking 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.440
 good to see if we are very entertained by 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.020
 giant rubber that here also life 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.640
 to associate the skill we are worth 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.200
 tighten this because it's not in the middle 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.739
 Queen remains is that because it is not going 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.220
 to do is not going to die is going to die 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.220
 for stupid 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.310
 47% 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.579
 47% guys you can not write has been left 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:10.829
 47% can not be child can not be 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.629
 my mother, the boys, simply the 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.909
 do this video is because it has been 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.220
 this attack with goals was truly a 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.229
 pretty pretty hard attack of 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.180
 perform since you already know that the goals 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.970
 they only go through defenses 12 that's 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.440
 a little disgusted you know 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.770
 electrolytes us but a greeting and 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.770
 see you later
