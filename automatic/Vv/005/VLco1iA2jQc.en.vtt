00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.140
 Speaker: Class 5A of the Bürgfeld School in Welzheim engaged in a three-month project 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.624
 with the topic "drinking water consumption in Germany compared to developing countries". , 

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:29.660
 As a documentation of the project, the film "8 liters of drinking water" was filmed 

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:32.576
 Steffen Rentschler, teacher math, WZG, technology, computer science: The original idea was yes: 

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:39.216
 The contents of a cistern - a Klospülkastens - which we use constantly and 

00:00:39.336 --> 00:00:45.336
 which is usually filled with drinking water. And we flush drinking water and 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.000
 in many other areas of the world, eight liters of drinking water would do the trick. 

00:00:52.313 --> 00:00:55.753
 Speaker: From this thought arose the idea that the fifth graders 

00:00:55.793 --> 00:01:01.093
 In a 24-hour marathon, you can experience for yourself what the procurement of drinking water for children in others 

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:05.593
 Means countries. Hard work. The topic "drinking water" was included 

00:01:05.593 --> 00:01:07.593
 interdisciplinary. 

00:01:09.093 --> 00:01:13.473
 Steffen Rentschler: One week before we carried out the project with the 24-hour water carrier, 

00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:17.433
 We have tried in all subjects, if possible, to integrate this into the lessons. 

00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:22.293
 In English, emails were written in English to various aid organizations. 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.980
 In math, we have calculated: How hard and how far does such a girl carry water? 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.980
 And how much does a family need? 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.344
 In art, the posters were created, which later on the way 

00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:34.724
 - by the waterway - were hung up. 

00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:39.244
 Speaker: At various markings along the route delivered these posters 

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:42.680
 Information on drinking water problems in different countries. 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.360
 During the 24-hour Wassertragens the students experienced the class 5A 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.360
 the change of perspective on your own body. 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.920
 Speaker: The marathon was documented in the project-accompanying film "8 liters of drinking water". 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.160
 Gökce, 11, student: We spent one night at school. 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:08.800
 And we also carried water all night, so from 07:45 to another school day 07:45. 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.480
 Since we had such a stick and there were always eight, so four liters on each side. 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.900
 And then we had to wear it that way. And yes, we just wanted to feel how the children feel. 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.640
 Julia, 10, student: In the beginning it was just fun. 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.040
 And in the end, the shoulders hurt completely. The neck was red. 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.640
 And when you wanted to sleep, you had back pain. 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.700
 You could not fall asleep and so on. 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.020
 Steffen Rentschler: The wearing project had two reasons. 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.920
 The one thing, of course, was to clarify community and dependence. 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.400
 Just as in the Third World the family is dependent on the one bringing water 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.700
 we were now also dependent on each other in the project - if one could not 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.360
 the other had to step in. That should be easy to experience. 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.520
 And then, quite obviously, how is it really to wear something like that? 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.460
 Narrator: By the dragging of the heavy water canisters, the fifth graders have 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.460
 the basic and Werkrealschule in Welzheim 

00:03:04.471 --> 00:03:09.520
 physically and mentally translated into the situation of many children in developing countries. 

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.671
 Steffen Rentschler: The change of perspective did not actually happen 

00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:16.251
 mediated by me or my colleagues, but by the action itself. 

00:03:16.251 --> 00:03:20.471
 The carrying frame with the water left and right has automatically led to 

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:24.091
 that the students could rather put themselves in the situation. 

00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:27.691
 All: All for ONE WORLD for all.
