the device you can see how much bigger
the<00:00:29.340> original<00:00:29.760> bolt<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:31.380> had

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the original bolt was so this one had

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.340 
the original bolt was so this one had
about<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.460> quarter<00:00:33.090> inch<00:00:33.120> more<00:00:33.540> thickness<00:00:33.899> or

wise<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.730> 480<00:00:39.090> x<00:00:39.210> 320<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:40.440> one's<00:00:40.649> 480<00:00:41.040> x

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
wise this is 480 x 320 this one's 480 x

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.670 
wise this is 480 x 320 this one's 480 x
360<00:00:42.050> but<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.590> actually

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
360 but you can see this one actually

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.950 
360 but you can see this one actually
has<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> little<00:00:44.010> bit<00:00:44.250> wider<00:00:44.489> screen<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.149> look

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
has a little bit wider screen and look

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.709 
has a little bit wider screen and look
at<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.110> difference<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.530> keyboard<00:00:47.039> sighs<00:00:47.719> so

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
at the difference in keyboard sighs so

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.360 
at the difference in keyboard sighs so
the<00:00:48.840> first<00:00:48.989> bolt<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.800> bigger<00:00:50.010> device

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the first bolt was just a bigger device

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.600 
the first bolt was just a bigger device
all<00:00:50.610> around<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.539> necessarily<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.289> heavy

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
all around not necessarily that heavy

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.060 
all around not necessarily that heavy
but<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.789> took<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> lot<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.420> space<00:00:54.890> if<00:00:55.890> we

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
but it just took up a lot of space if we

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.619 
but it just took up a lot of space if we
start<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.520> around<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> device<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.360> can

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
start to go around the device you can

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.970 
start to go around the device you can
see<00:00:57.809> some<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> big<00:00:58.320> changes<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.770> have

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
see some of the big changes that have

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.189 
see some of the big changes that have
happened<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.730> we<00:01:00.449> keep<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> same<00:01:00.930> speaker

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
happened so we keep the same speaker

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.039 
happened so we keep the same speaker

accessible microstates lot which was
okay<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.420> annoying<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.990> kind<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
okay but a little annoying it's kind of

nice<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> put<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:18.240> new<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.900> pop

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
nice to put it here the new one if I pop

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
nice to put it here the new one if I pop
this<00:01:19.470> battery<00:01:20.250> door<00:01:20.400> off<00:01:20.610> which<00:01:20.850> tends<00:01:21.119> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
this battery door off which tends to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.450 
this battery door off which tends to
give<00:01:21.360> me<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.600> trouble<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.130> see

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
give me a little trouble you can see

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.960 
give me a little trouble you can see
they've<00:01:24.150> actually<00:01:24.390> stuck<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.340> there<00:01:26.340> so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
they've actually stuck it right there so

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.810 
they've actually stuck it right there so
it<00:01:27.030> pushes<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.340> slide<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
it pushes in and then you can slide it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.550 
it pushes in and then you can slide it
out<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.439> push<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.009> again<00:01:33.560> works

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
out and you can push it in again works

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.679 
out and you can push it in again works
pretty<00:01:34.710> well<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.220> kind<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.610> tricky<00:01:36.090> behind

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
pretty well just kind of tricky behind

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.550 
pretty well just kind of tricky behind
the<00:01:36.750> camera<00:01:38.180> close<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.420> door<00:01:39.689> shuts<00:01:40.170> which

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the camera close that door shuts which

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.240 
the camera close that door shuts which
is<00:01:40.740> still<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> little<00:01:41.220> tight<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.880> works<00:01:42.270> okay

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
is still a little tight but works okay

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.219 
is still a little tight but works okay
around<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.460> side<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> device

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
around the right side of the device

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.249 
around the right side of the device
again<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.590> what's<00:01:47.579> going<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.259> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
again you can see what's going on on the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.380 
again you can see what's going on on the
back<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> 2<00:01:50.189> megapixel<00:01:50.340> camera<00:01:51.240> now

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
back you got a 2 megapixel camera now

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.950 
back you got a 2 megapixel camera now
you<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.930> 3.2<00:01:52.890> megapixel<00:01:53.520> camera<00:01:53.970> with

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you have a 3.2 megapixel camera with

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
you have a 3.2 megapixel camera with
better<00:01:55.920> focus<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:57.740> what<00:01:58.740> else<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.100> key

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430

which<00:02:22.290> leaves<00:02:22.650> much<00:02:23.640> less<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.020> have<00:02:25.110> much

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
which leaves much less so you have much

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.110 
which leaves much less so you have much
more<00:02:25.350> working<00:02:26.010> memory<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.460> this<00:02:26.580> device<00:02:26.880> it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
more working memory on this device it

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.220 
more working memory on this device it
should<00:02:27.270> run<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.480> lot<00:02:27.630> smoother<00:02:28.020> over<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
should run a lot smoother over the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
should run a lot smoother over the
course<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> day<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.040> weeks<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.910> months

so<00:02:32.250> that's<00:02:32.430> that's<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.880> big<00:02:33.060> thing<00:02:33.090> obviously

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
so that's that's the big thing obviously

so that's that's the big thing obviously

five-point update this is shipping with
five<00:02:47.670> point<00:02:48.000> oh<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.920> you've<00:02:50.130> got<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.790> same

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
five point oh so you've got the same

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.450 
five point oh so you've got the same
operating<00:02:51.450> system<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.650> just<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.190> better

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
operating system it's just a better

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.820 
operating system it's just a better
blackberry<00:02:54.180> bold<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.050> might<00:02:55.200> actually<00:02:55.410> say

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
blackberry bold you might actually say

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.390 
blackberry bold you might actually say
to<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.940> know<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.810> nearly<00:02:58.260> more<00:02:58.860> curved

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
to that you know it's nearly more curved

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400 
to that you know it's nearly more curved
like<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.790> terms<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.180> size<00:03:00.420> if<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.110> grabbed

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
like in terms of size if I just grabbed

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.010 
like in terms of size if I just grabbed
a<00:03:02.750> 8900<00:03:03.750> here<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.940> can<00:03:06.120> see<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.540> actual

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
a 8900 here you can see that the actual

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.750 
a 8900 here you can see that the actual
size<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.500> much<00:03:07.680> less<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.220> original<00:03:08.580> bold

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
size is much less like the original bold

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.150 
size is much less like the original bold
and<00:03:08.970> much<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:10.410> newer<00:03:10.560> curved<00:03:10.920> form

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
and much like the newer curved form

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.060 
and much like the newer curved form
factor<00:03:11.990> if<00:03:12.990> I<00:03:13.080> compare<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.800> tour

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
factor if I compare it to the tour

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:27.300 
factor if I compare it to the tour
quickly<00:03:18.440> get<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> sense<00:03:19.800> for<00:03:20.840> what's<00:03:21.840> going<00:03:22.140> on

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.890 

so<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.970> guess<00:03:28.120> these<00:03:28.300> days<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:28.750> the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
so I guess these days it's the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.110 
so I guess these days it's the
leatherback<00:03:29.349> and<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:30.489> word<00:03:30.670> bolt<00:03:30.910> that

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
leatherback and the word bolt that

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.000 
leatherback and the word bolt that
really<00:03:31.330> make<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.690> bold<00:03:31.930> but<00:03:32.260> they're<00:03:32.890> really

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
really make it a bold but they're really

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.510 
really make it a bold but they're really
very<00:03:33.489> curve<00:03:33.849> like<00:03:35.010> interesting<00:03:36.010> look<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.370> if

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
very curve like interesting look to if

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.920 
very curve like interesting look to if
we<00:03:36.610> want<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.819> see<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.150> progression<00:03:37.720> the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
we want to see it the progression the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.880 
we want to see it the progression the
the<00:03:38.520> bold<00:03:39.520> 9700<00:03:40.300> made<00:03:40.510> on<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:41.440> right<00:03:41.620> was<00:03:41.860> the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
the bold 9700 made on the right was the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.009 
the bold 9700 made on the right was the
original<00:03:42.430> onyx<00:03:42.910> prototype<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:43.660> we<00:03:43.750> had<00:03:43.900> this

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
original onyx prototype so we had this

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.930 
original onyx prototype so we had this
plastic<00:03:44.530> battery<00:03:44.830> door<00:03:44.980> by<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.640> way<00:03:45.819> was

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
plastic battery door by the way was

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.400 
plastic battery door by the way was
really<00:03:45.970> easy<00:03:46.330> to<00:03:46.480> put<00:03:46.630> on<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.780> off<00:03:46.989> versus

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
really easy to put on and off versus

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.610 
really easy to put on and off versus
this<00:03:47.650> one's<00:03:47.860> much<00:03:48.010> more<00:03:48.250> tight<00:03:49.470> but<00:03:50.470> also

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
this one's much more tight but also

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.800 
this one's much more tight but also
trackball<00:03:51.250> but<00:03:51.849> the<00:03:51.940> final<00:03:52.269> version<00:03:52.390> got<00:03:52.690> the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
trackball but the final version got the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.660 
trackball but the final version got the
trackpad<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:54.430> leather<00:03:54.640> back<00:03:54.910> on<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:56.670> what

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
trackpad and the leather back on it what

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.509 
trackpad and the leather back on it what
else<00:03:57.819> we<00:03:58.120> have<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.360> look<00:03:58.540> at<00:03:58.750> here<00:03:59.340> this<00:04:00.340> would

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
else we have to look at here this would

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.000 
else we have to look at here this would
be<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:01.000> tour<00:04:01.480> two<00:04:01.840> on<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.319> right<00:04:02.500> so

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
be the tour two on the right so

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.979 
be the tour two on the right so
basically<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.519> tour<00:04:03.910> but<00:04:04.269> with<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.720> trackpad

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
basically a tour but with the trackpad

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.479 
basically a tour but with the trackpad
and<00:04:05.519> Wi-Fi<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.319> can<00:04:08.440> see<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.890> these

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
and Wi-Fi so you can see that these

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.509 
and Wi-Fi so you can see that these
devices<00:04:09.880> become<00:04:10.299> much<00:04:10.480> more<00:04:10.750> on<00:04:11.049> par<00:04:11.860> when<00:04:12.310> the

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
devices become much more on par when the
