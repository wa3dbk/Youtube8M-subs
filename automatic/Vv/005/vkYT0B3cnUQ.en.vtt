00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
this one is also another kind of one of

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.009 
this one is also another kind of one of
those<00:02:28.069> deep<00:02:28.489> cleansing<00:02:29.209> masks<00:02:29.659> that<00:02:29.720> really

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
those deep cleansing masks that really

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.149 
those deep cleansing masks that really
gets<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.409> there<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.590> drop<00:02:30.890> out<00:02:31.099> the

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
gets in there and drop out the

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.830 
gets in there and drop out the
impurities<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.940> only<00:02:32.209> thing<00:02:32.360> with<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.629> one

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
impurities the only thing with this one

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.780 
impurities the only thing with this one
I<00:02:32.870> would<00:02:33.049> say<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:34.010> apply<00:02:34.159> moisturizer

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
I would say is to apply moisturizer

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.759 
I would say is to apply moisturizer
right<00:02:35.120> after<00:02:35.540> because<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.019> does<00:02:36.170> tend<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.440> dry

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
right after because it does tend to dry

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.619 
right after because it does tend to dry
out<00:02:36.799> your<00:02:36.950> skin<00:02:37.099> a<00:02:37.370> little<00:02:37.549> bit<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:38.030> that's

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
out your skin a little bit but that's

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.059 
out your skin a little bit but that's
just<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.930> side<00:02:39.170> effect<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.620> one<00:02:39.829> of<00:02:39.950> these

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
just a side effect of one of these

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.800 
just a side effect of one of these
awesome<00:02:40.340> masks<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.150> this<00:02:41.450> one<00:02:41.629> definitely

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
awesome masks and this one definitely

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.750 
awesome masks and this one definitely
makes<00:02:42.530> my<00:02:42.650> face<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.829> little<00:02:43.010> bit<00:02:43.129> red<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.400> think

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
makes my face a little bit red I think

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.240 
makes my face a little bit red I think
just<00:02:43.970> because<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.390> does<00:02:44.629> clear<00:02:45.590> my<00:02:45.829> skin<00:02:46.099> of

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
just because it does clear my skin of

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.099 
everything and it's just an excellent
kind<00:02:48.889> of<00:02:48.950> detoxifying<00:02:49.670> one<00:02:50.090> as<00:02:50.299> well<00:02:50.780> as<00:02:50.959> the
