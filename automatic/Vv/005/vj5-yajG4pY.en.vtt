00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
have so many miles and you know I call

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.960 
have so many miles and you know I call
it<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.590> elite<00:00:25.800> status<00:00:26.039> hamsterwheel<00:00:26.670> we

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
it the the elite status hamsterwheel we

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.179 
it the the elite status hamsterwheel we
continue<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.810> pay<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.140> tickets<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.650> rack<00:00:28.980> up

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
continue to pay for tickets and rack up

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.160 
continue to pay for tickets and rack up
all<00:00:29.310> these<00:00:29.460> miles<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.119> then<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.869> don't<00:00:31.019> want

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
all these miles and then you don't want

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.569 
all these miles and then you don't want
to<00:00:31.230> redeem<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.619> miles<00:00:31.800> because<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.309> need<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
to redeem the miles because you need the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.110 
to redeem the miles because you need the
points<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.989> think<00:00:34.469> last<00:00:35.130> year<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:35.670> status

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
points so I think last year I got status

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.610 
points so I think last year I got status
a<00:00:36.239> couple<00:00:36.540> different<00:00:36.809> ways<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.260> mostly

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
a couple different ways it was mostly

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.770 
a couple different ways it was mostly
through<00:00:37.920> Airlines<00:00:38.489> statuses<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.239> challenges

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
through Airlines statuses and challenges

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.229 
through Airlines statuses and challenges
so<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.920> had<00:00:41.690> Delta<00:00:42.800> diamond<00:00:43.800> two<00:00:44.190> years<00:00:44.430> ago<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
so I had Delta diamond two years ago and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.310 
so I had Delta diamond two years ago and
I<00:00:45.390> knew<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.690> was<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> drop<00:00:46.110> down<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I knew I was going to drop down the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.040 
I knew I was going to drop down the
platinum<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.250> January<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.090> last<00:00:48.180> year<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.870> did<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
platinum so January of last year I did a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.400 
platinum so January of last year I did a
challenge<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.890> American<00:00:50.809> if<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.199> flew<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
challenge with American if I flew a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.590 
challenge with American if I flew a
certain<00:00:52.739> number<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.980> miles<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.699> 90<00:00:54.059> days<00:00:54.239> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
certain number of miles in 90 days I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660 
certain number of miles in 90 days I
would<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.079> an<00:00:55.170> executive<00:00:55.410> platinum<00:00:55.860> they

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
would get an executive platinum they

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
would get an executive platinum they
generally<00:00:57.180> don't<00:00:57.360> challenge<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.930> executive

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
generally don't challenge to executive

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.260 
generally don't challenge to executive
platinum<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.190> because<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> was<00:00:59.969> doing<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
platinum but because I was doing the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.049 
platinum but because I was doing the
oneworld<00:01:00.480> Megan<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.109> last<00:01:01.440> January<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
oneworld Megan do last January it was a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.750 
oneworld Megan do last January it was a
special<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.750> deal<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.739> they<00:01:05.339> also<00:01:05.519> had

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
special kind of deal so they also had

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.480 
special kind of deal so they also had
double<00:01:06.119> e<00:01:06.360> qm<00:01:06.900> /<00:01:07.110> january<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> was<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
double e qm / january and it was the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.370 
double e qm / january and it was the
many<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.909> i<00:01:08.939> had<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.600> San<00:01:09.780> Francisco<00:01:10.350> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
many do i had to go to San Francisco I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.429 
many do i had to go to San Francisco I
ended<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:10.979> London<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.360> had<00:01:12.990> executive

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
ended up with London so I had executive

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.550 
ended up with London so I had executive
platinum<00:01:13.619> locked<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.310> by<00:01:14.610> March<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> last<00:01:15.299> year

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
platinum locked in by March of last year

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.950 
platinum locked in by March of last year
so<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.189> continued<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.909> build<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.630> was

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so I then continued to build up I was

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.600 
so I then continued to build up I was
flying<00:01:19.140> Delta<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> lot<00:01:19.799> domestically<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.549> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
flying Delta a lot domestically so I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.539 
flying Delta a lot domestically so I
retain<00:01:21.090> Delta<00:01:21.750> Platinum<00:01:22.470> which<00:01:23.070> also<00:01:23.250> helped

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
retain Delta Platinum which also helped

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.130 
retain Delta Platinum which also helped
because<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.820> rolled<00:01:24.090> over<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.420> bunch<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> miles

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
because I rolled over a bunch of miles

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.950 
because I rolled over a bunch of miles
since<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.830> dropped<00:01:26.070> from<00:01:26.490> diamond--<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.780> then

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
since I dropped from diamond-- and then

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
since I dropped from diamond-- and then
later<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> year<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.280> status

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
later in the year I status

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
later in the year I status
matched<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.780> United<00:01:31.290> generally<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.220> only<00:01:32.369> do

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
matched to United generally they only do

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.490 
matched to United generally they only do
challenges<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.720> my<00:01:33.840> case<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.229> kind<00:01:34.439> of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
challenges but in my case they kind of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.100 
challenges but in my case they kind of
messed<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:36.150> promised<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.780> give<00:01:36.900> me<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
messed up and and promised to give me a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.270 
messed up and and promised to give me a
