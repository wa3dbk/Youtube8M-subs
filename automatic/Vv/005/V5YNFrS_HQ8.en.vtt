00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.920
 Although it has with some shochu 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.289

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.909
 Double-click on this icon 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:27.079
 When you start the software 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:29.980
 There is the ag desktop recorder at the shochu of 9 ta inn bar 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:36.070

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:46.440
 When you click on the female tree, the meeting menu will appear. 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.060
 Set to that 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.180

 You're not changing the settings but visited from time to time 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:12.800
 There are times when the sound is misplaced 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:17.220

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:21.930
