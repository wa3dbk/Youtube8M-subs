00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:10.160
 below here we have a closet of 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:12.950
 pvc in this case from wall to wall like 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.129
 you can see observing you in this 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:21.019
 case here is the entrance the access here 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.730
 to the room and then we have manufactured 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.070
 a closet 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.330
 in this case obviously from floor to 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:33.840
 roof however the particularity here 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.090
 in this case since what are the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.310
 trunk doors pass over the top of the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.410
 of the access door here from the 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.280
 room 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.120
 this closet that we call closet 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.680
 foldable right now they will see you the 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.230
 the advantages and therefore in a personal way 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.449
 I'm going to show you how the closet works 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.420
 in the lower part we see four 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.670
 drawers 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.949
 two folding doors in the part of in 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.610
 medium and on the top two 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.850
 doors this garage type open to 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.420
 up in this case then I will proceed to 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.600
 open 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:19.330
 yes open this one of the doors if in 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.729
 this case is on this side precisely 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.180
 so that it breaks in this 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.250
 If what is it what is the door 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.649
 folding like you as you 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.940
 could they could see open themselves 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.940
 opened in pairs yes here they can 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.330
 observe what 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:44.190
 so here is an area 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.320
 of shoes yes of pee inside more 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.780
 or less about two meters 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.900
 and here is the area then for 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:58.380
 pants books or any kind of 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.140
 for things that one wants to store 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.260
 in the in this type of closet it is 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.130
 welcome is at the bottom 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.440
 we can observe what light is what 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.570
 with rails by extension here we have what 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.710
 what are these are the risks that the 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.830
 in double stage extension in drawers 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.850
 20 millimeter floor only strong and 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.700
 resistant and holds a lot of weight here 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.640
 Well, on the other side, we have him 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.060
 in this case with the with the tubes 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.590
 hangers would proceed that open the other 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.940
 the other door yes here they can 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.959
 observe, then, all that is the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:52.510
 wardrobe we have double tube if double 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.610
 tube in this case this this support for 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.870
 the trunk so that precisely to give them 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.940
 strength as it had as the trunk 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.350
 on the other side we have a wall 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.319
 of pvc 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.780
 Well, what gives 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.099
 well also that it supports the whole 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:16.200
 what is the trunk in this case then 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:18.239
 we will proceed to make a one shot 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.640
 little by little so that you can 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.950
 observe exactly what is the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.300
 distribution of this closet 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.610
 and then how is it this way then what 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:34.300
 can appreciate better like this 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.420
 and then the white color in this closet 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:42.570
 for it is plain white with a single tone 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.820
 Well, it gives you a lot of this 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.430
 so elegance the closet here I will proceed 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.250
 to see what is the door of the part 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.140
 from above what is the door type 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.680
 garage how can you then 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.770
 has a couple of pistons yes they can 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.740
 accommodate then the entire area of ​​everything 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.050
 that are the door all that are the 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.450
 suitcases cited etcetera it is necessary to open the 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.700
 another door also yes 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.400
 here we have a support in the part 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.280
 central I will pass on this side 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.750
 precisely so that they can see all the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.750
 what is the distribution 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.120
 Well, I hope with this 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.880
 with this explanation then it has been 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.520
 Of course, this closet has the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.490
 sight and elegance in the frame type 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.110
 board has some profiles 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.680
 practically you do not notice the 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.289
 unions is extremely are profiles a lot 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.449
 wider and more elegant than the 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.599
 traditional pvc profiles 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.879
 well worth the investment in this 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:53.110
 case the distribution then here as 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:57.919
 you can observe then everything that is 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.469
 the visibility is 100% that against 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.210
 sliding doors then extremely well 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:04.759
 would have a visibility of 30 per 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.069
 hundred percent less and visibility is the 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.740
 top in the boot area 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:12.439
 of the trunk doors, it is 100% 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.749
 As you can see, I hope so 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:19.660
 that with this explanation then there 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:22.330
 Thus, the concept of 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.870
 of this type of closet 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.370
 if functionality elegance see 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.830
 you this is the framework that 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.310
 he was talking maximum he will have a voice 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:36.819
 union is extremely elegant clean the 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.520
 work against other profiling compared 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:42.610
 with another profiling of pérez he made 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.370
 is that your union is therefore much more 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.440
 unions that this kind of pvc that is 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.280
 more elegant 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.140
 Well let's wait with this explanation 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.860
 has become clear and well hopefully 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.720
 so we can count on it if you like in 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.230
 any kind of 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.230
 well, how to distribute in this 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:09.050
 case then your wardrobe then with everything 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:12.730
 we support them here in art without more 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:16.010
 so far as we are we are 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:18.490
 pending for the next videos 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.490
 Thank you
