nowadays I think they stopped producing
it<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:46.430> 1959<00:02:47.430> but<00:02:48.060> these<00:02:48.299> guns<00:02:48.690> are<00:02:48.900> still

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.340 
cheap and reliable and that's basically
what<00:03:18.870> they<00:03:19.049> promise<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:21.060> ak-47<00:03:21.600> will<00:03:22.230> be

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
what they promise the ak-47 will be

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.520 
what they promise the ak-47 will be
firing<00:03:22.799> at<00:03:22.950> 600<00:03:23.760> rpm<00:03:23.940> which<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:24.810> basically<00:03:25.319> the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
firing at 600 rpm which is basically the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.470 
firing at 600 rpm which is basically the
fire<00:03:25.769> rate<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.220> all<00:03:26.459> previous<00:03:26.819> college<00:03:27.299> edie

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
fire rate that all previous college edie

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.740 
fire rate that all previous college edie
used<00:03:27.810> as<00:03:28.049> well<00:03:28.350> as<00:03:28.620> real<00:03:28.889> life<00:03:29.190> so<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.540> will

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
used as well as real life so on it will

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.650 
used as well as real life so on it will
be<00:03:31.019> remaining<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.010> same<00:03:32.090> I'm<00:03:33.090> guessing<00:03:33.510> that

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
be remaining the same I'm guessing that

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.349 
be remaining the same I'm guessing that
with<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.170> low<00:03:34.410> fire<00:03:34.739> rate<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:35.280> low<00:03:35.850> ish<00:03:36.090> fire

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
with this low fire rate a low ish fire

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.960 
with this low fire rate a low ish fire
rate<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.620> bullet<00:03:38.010> damage<00:03:38.430> will<00:03:38.700> be

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
rate that the bullet damage will be

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.270 
rate that the bullet damage will be
quite<00:03:39.359> high<00:03:39.599> and<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.200> will<00:03:40.470> be<00:03:40.709> around<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:41.099> two

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
quite high and it will be around the two

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.339 
quite high and it will be around the two
to<00:03:41.400> three<00:03:41.609> bullet<00:03:41.910> kill<00:03:42.090> from<00:03:42.269> any<00:03:42.510> range<00:03:42.870> and

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
to three bullet kill from any range and

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.849 
to three bullet kill from any range and
that's<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:43.950> my<00:03:44.069> prediction<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:45.660> ak-47<00:03:46.260> will

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
that's just my prediction the ak-47 will

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.309 
that's just my prediction the ak-47 will
be<00:03:47.010> barring<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.639> 7.62<00:03:48.630> by<00:03:48.780> 39<00:03:49.049> mill<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.340> 43

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
be barring a 7.62 by 39 mill and 43

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.349 
be barring a 7.62 by 39 mill and 43
bullet<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:52.650> basically<00:03:53.099> this<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:54.030> longer

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
bullet and basically this is a longer

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.210 
bullet and basically this is a longer
bullet<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:54.930> has<00:03:55.410> incredibly<00:03:56.099> high

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
bullet and has incredibly high

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.610 
bullet and has incredibly high
penetration<00:03:56.970> rate<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.780> now<00:03:57.959> basically<00:03:58.410> these

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
penetration rate and now basically these

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.069 
penetration rate and now basically these

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
the very first cod4 when it introduced

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
the very first cod4 when it introduced
it<00:04:28.770> properly

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
it properly

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.640 
it properly
it<00:04:29.760> was<00:04:30.120> an<00:04:30.240> amazing<00:04:30.480> gun<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.140> loved<00:04:31.470> using

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
it was an amazing gun that I loved using

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.690 
it was an amazing gun that I loved using
it's<00:04:31.950> powerful<00:04:32.280> it's<00:04:32.610> got<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:33.000> decent<00:04:33.780> accuracy

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
it's powerful it's got a decent accuracy

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.220 
it's powerful it's got a decent accuracy
although<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.850> has<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.060> low<00:04:36.450> rate<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:36.690> fire<00:04:36.810> the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
although it has a low rate of fire the

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.060 
although it has a low rate of fire the
bullet<00:04:37.680> damage<00:04:37.890> does<00:04:38.430> kill<00:04:39.030> incredibly<00:04:39.750> fast

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
bullet damage does kill incredibly fast

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.890 
bullet damage does kill incredibly fast
with<00:04:41.070> 600<00:04:41.640> rounds<00:04:41.700> per<00:04:41.850> minute<00:04:42.060> I'll<00:04:42.390> expect

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
with 600 rounds per minute I'll expect

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.280 
with 600 rounds per minute I'll expect
the<00:04:43.560> Ricoh<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.190> be<00:04:44.460> quite<00:04:44.790> high<00:04:45.090> as<00:04:45.300> well<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:46.170> in

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
the Ricoh to be quite high as well so in

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.770 
the Ricoh to be quite high as well so in
the<00:04:46.440> medium<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:47.010> high<00:04:47.220> range<00:04:47.450> just<00:04:48.450> like<00:04:48.630> in

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
the medium to high range just like in

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.600 
the medium to high range just like in
real<00:04:48.930> life<00:04:48.990> so<00:04:49.410> I'll<00:04:49.680> expect<00:04:50.100> it<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.430> be

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
real life so I'll expect it to be

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.250 
real life so I'll expect it to be
similar<00:04:50.940> properties<00:04:51.510> that<00:04:51.750> we've<00:04:51.900> seen<00:04:52.140> in
