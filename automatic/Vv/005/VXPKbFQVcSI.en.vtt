with<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.920> light<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.670> we're<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.480> going<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
with this light and we're just going to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.350 
with this light and we're just going to
go<00:00:39.870> through<00:00:39.899> all<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> features<00:00:41.090> there's<00:00:42.090> just

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
go through all the features there's just

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.950 
go through all the features there's just
one<00:00:42.870> button<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.980> light<00:00:44.219> on/off<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.420> this

one button on this light on/off and this

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.229 
one button on this light on/off and this
is<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.320> button<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.649> also<00:00:47.070> dims<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.820> light
