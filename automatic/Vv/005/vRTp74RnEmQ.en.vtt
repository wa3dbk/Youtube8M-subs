00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the wet toxic gas plenty of that been

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.970 
the wet toxic gas plenty of that been
through<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.200> especially<00:00:46.200> after<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.770> good

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
through here especially after a good

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.650 
through here especially after a good
motor<00:00:47.219> burnout<00:00:49.670> yeah<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:50.969> pretty<00:00:51.120> true<00:00:51.390> as

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
motor burnout yeah that's pretty true as

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.029 
motor burnout yeah that's pretty true as
well<00:00:53.090> Australia<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.149> based<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.600> industry<00:00:55.039> even

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
well Australia is based on industry even

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.590 
well Australia is based on industry even
though<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.309> Gillard<00:00:56.910> government's<00:00:57.449> trying

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to murder it with the carbon tax is

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.849 
to murder it with the carbon tax is
another<00:00:59.760> ship<00:01:00.289> this<00:01:01.289> isn't<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
another ship this isn't going to be a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.719 
another ship this isn't going to be a
political<00:01:02.039> video<00:01:03.379> corrosive<00:01:04.379> got<00:01:05.369> plenty<00:01:05.580> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
political video corrosive got plenty of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.550 
political video corrosive got plenty of
that<00:01:05.850> around<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.869> batteries<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.619> things

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
that around here on batteries and things

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.730 
that around here on batteries and things
what's<00:01:10.560> next<00:01:13.220> flammable<00:01:14.220> solids<00:01:15.200> yeah<00:01:16.200> pretty

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
what's next flammable solids yeah pretty

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.469 
what's next flammable solids yeah pretty
much<00:01:16.890> most<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.549> what<00:01:17.700> I've<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:17.970> around<00:01:18.180> healed

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
much most of what I've got around healed

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.830 
much most of what I've got around healed
catch<00:01:18.720> fire<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.710> pretty<00:01:19.920> solid<00:01:20.780> but<00:01:21.780> I

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
catch fire and it's pretty solid but I

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.060 
catch fire and it's pretty solid but I
think<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.200> actually<00:01:22.500> referring<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
think that's actually referring to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.030 
think that's actually referring to
things<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.780> naphthalene<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:25.290> moth<00:01:25.710> Blake's

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
things like naphthalene on moth Blake's

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.560 
things like naphthalene on moth Blake's
and<00:01:26.900> other<00:01:27.900> stuff<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:29.570> organic

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and other stuff like that organic

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.770 
and other stuff like that organic
peroxides<00:01:31.430> break<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> curing<00:01:33.000> epoxies<00:01:33.540> and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
peroxides break the curing epoxies and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.609 
peroxides break the curing epoxies and
blowing<00:01:34.409> up<00:01:35.360> acetone<00:01:36.360> peroxide<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.140> Mak

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
blowing up acetone peroxide and Mak

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.789 
blowing up acetone peroxide and Mak
peroxide<00:01:38.250> are<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:39.060> good<00:01:39.840> childhood<00:01:40.259> friend<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
peroxide are a good childhood friend of

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.649 
peroxide are a good childhood friend of
mine<00:01:40.979> which<00:01:41.189> I've<00:01:41.460> made<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.210> last<00:01:42.360> 10

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
mine which I've made for the last 10

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.480 
mine which I've made for the last 10
years<00:01:42.689> because<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.350> are<00:01:43.560> simply<00:01:43.920> retardedly

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
years because they are simply retardedly

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.420 
years because they are simply retardedly
dangerous<00:01:45.409> but<00:01:46.409> peroxides<00:01:47.070> are<00:01:47.070> fun

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
dangerous but peroxides are fun

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.980 
dangerous but peroxides are fun
nonetheless<00:01:49.159> flammable<00:01:50.159> gas<00:01:50.399> well<00:01:50.990> everyone

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
of sums me up in a word two words what

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.900 
of sums me up in a word two words what
are<00:02:38.880> these<00:02:38.970> two<00:02:39.240> stuck<00:02:39.510> together

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
are these two stuck together

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.150 
are these two stuck together
non-flammable<00:02:41.910> non-toxic<00:02:42.180> gas<00:02:43.080> well<00:02:43.470> that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
non-flammable non-toxic gas well that

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.940 
non-flammable non-toxic gas well that
ain't<00:02:44.310> much<00:02:44.490> fun<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:45.500> think<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.620> referring

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
ain't much fun I think that's referring

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.820 
ain't much fun I think that's referring
to<00:02:47.130> welding<00:02:47.520> gases<00:02:47.970> co2<00:02:48.600> argon<00:02:49.460> mixture<00:02:50.460> gases

to welding gases co2 argon mixture gases

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.190 
to welding gases co2 argon mixture gases
flammable<00:02:52.830> liquids<00:02:53.280> will<00:02:53.780> without<00:02:54.780> that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
flammable liquids will without that

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.020 
flammable liquids will without that
engines<00:02:55.650> like<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:55.890> would<00:02:56.220> never<00:02:56.340> work<00:02:56.460> so

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
engines like this would never work so

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.130 
engines like this would never work so
gotta<00:02:57.270> have<00:02:57.360> some<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.220> that's<00:02:59.220> it

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
gotta have some of that and that's it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.300 
gotta have some of that and that's it
only<00:03:01.140> thing<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.350> can<00:03:01.410> think<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.830> that's<00:03:01.950> missing

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
only thing I can think of that's missing

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.690 
only thing I can think of that's missing
is<00:03:02.580> radioactive<00:03:03.450> which<00:03:04.050> is<00:03:04.200> kind<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.530> odd<00:03:04.710> but

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
is radioactive which is kind of odd but

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.920 
is radioactive which is kind of odd but
then<00:03:05.850> again<00:03:05.880> not<00:03:06.210> many<00:03:06.390> people<00:03:06.720> hold

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
then again not many people hold

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.590 
then again not many people hold
radioactive<00:03:07.560> materials<00:03:07.980> around<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.610> there

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
radioactive materials around so there

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.330 
radioactive materials around so there
you<00:03:09.690> have<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:10.310> it's<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.490> proper<00:03:12.890> hazmat<00:03:13.890> placard
