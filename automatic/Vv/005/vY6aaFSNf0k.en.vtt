00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 rebecca eisenegger opens on thursday 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.140
 The charity ball efficiency is enormous 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.870
 be the gates 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.370
 you yourself are the owner and 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.059
 Ideas for this project 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.760
 together with renato if li what exactly 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.910
 is behind this concept 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.060
 charity ball so with us it is us 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.980
 are a non-profit that is the one 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.560
 complete net profit donation times 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 non profit organizations to what 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.570
 Organizations will then use this money 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.550
 So in the end, now go for the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.300
 first two months I it Voralberger 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.520
 child grave and let's have a look 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.030
 to do everything in one but two 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.250
 month's rhythm and not only 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 human but also 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.780
 animal welfare organizations sometimes too 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.670
 Of course, how can you take into consideration 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.530
 to guarantee the visitor that everyone 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.780
 cent is spent here 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.719
 indeed also to these organizations 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.719
 does not flow in a bag for sinks 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.740
 so everyone all are wrong now 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.070
 because the fixed costs must be covered 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.350
 These are all the wages of the lease 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.790
 Everything has to be covered and purchases 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.530
 But that is really definite 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.330
 what remains is that is given and 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.729
 Good, of course, a basis of trust 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.090
 Of course we also have skeptics 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.729
 But so much on transparency 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.670
 respect, think highly of 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.710
 we are open for inquiring somehow 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.650
 if someone is a little unclear why 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.600
 so no problem we can like 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.820
 room printer and the over the books 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.060
 go show and everything is transparent 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.780
 show where this idea comes from 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.930
 Charity was the idea itself 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.040
 mr Bernd Leno 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.220
 we are then saying he said that 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.170
 he would like to help then cherokee choice 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.740
 I had to fall very hard 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.840
 like the non profit net profit 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.310
 will be donated 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.110
 And that was the idea and the idea was 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.890
 About half a year ago 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.130
 what awaits the visitor or the 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.070
 Visitor in the efficiency so we 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.959
 have a nice offer a nice one 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.420
 Selection of different cocktails and 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.790

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.620
 we will offer snacks and that 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.980
 especially those me that the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.580

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.420
