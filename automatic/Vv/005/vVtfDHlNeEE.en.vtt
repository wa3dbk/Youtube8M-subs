it's a long season ago we could play the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.910 
it's a long season ago we could play the
scene<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:36.660> we're<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.590> play<00:01:37.770> them<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
scene but we're going to play them a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.200 
scene but we're going to play them a
little<00:01:38.040> time<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.400> home<00:01:38.730> but<00:01:38.910> we<00:01:38.970> could<00:01:39.090> play

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
little time at home but we could play

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.790 
little time at home but we could play
them<00:01:39.330> three<00:01:39.510> or<00:01:39.570> four<00:01:39.750> more<00:01:39.930> times<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.770> we

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
them three or four more times so we

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.160 
them three or four more times so we
don't<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.160> we're<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.210> go<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
don't know we're just going to go at the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.390 
don't know we're just going to go at the
momentum<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.650> we<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.890> right<00:01:44.040> now<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
momentum that we have right now and

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.920 
momentum that we have right now and
hopefully<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.030> plays<00:01:45.330> out<00:01:45.480> so<00:01:45.660> we<00:01:45.750> could<00:01:45.840> get

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
hopefully it plays out so we could get

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.780 
hopefully it plays out so we could get
this<00:01:46.080> ring<00:01:46.290> many<00:01:46.680> times<00:01:46.980> in<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.250> game<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.580> can<00:01:47.640> be

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
this ring many times in a game it can be

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.670 
this ring many times in a game it can be
one<00:01:48.060> play<00:01:48.360> whether<00:01:48.600> offensively<00:01:49.380> or
