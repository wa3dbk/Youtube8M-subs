00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:03.339
 the theme of our today's 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.630
 no unstable 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.630
 and parents can't 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.689
 but in the winter by chance 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.010
 today we have two 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.210
 car one of them 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.310
 the system is being created 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.130
 anti-lock brakes 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.050
 not equipped with such a system 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.750
 and we will try 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.330
 see what we had 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.490
 on cars 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.010
 anti-lock brakes 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.890
 need to learn how to slow down 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.830
 build up effort on the brake pedal 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.800
 so the system is about going by computer 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.260
 not included 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.150
 then it will be more efficient 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.150
 braking 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.530
 now we will try to do the same 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.710
 most cars that don't 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.390
 equipped 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.160
 in the end it turned out not quite wrong 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.690
 overclock its relevance 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.350
 speed 60 kilometers 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.950
 now 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.070
 we will try 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.820
 stop using it 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.820
 pedal selection 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.970
 The next option is braking however 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.810
 smooth braking 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.439
 i.e. brake pedal effort needed 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.580
 build up very gradually 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.580
 so that the wheels are not locked 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.060
 my next braking system is 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.190
 impulse to brake but are considered 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.450
 most promising braking in 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.890
 emergency cases 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.829
 that is, we pressed the brake pedal 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.789
 not very short 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:14.679
 short short pedals 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.589
 gas 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.139
 box lock 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.519
 wheels then wheels again 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.790
 it turns around and again 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.169
 locked cranks 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:26.869
 locked cranks 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:28.649
 considered one of the most effective 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.649
 braking 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.459
 brought a course of inhibition 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.469
 constantly running fresh part 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.409
 prospectus 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.429
 he cleaned himself 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:54.119
 jeeps and worked 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.159
 to quality 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.159
 cooperative their work stale place 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:01.069
 doing what you understand 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.299
 in particular 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.199
 press times 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.649
 cannot use other braking 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:09.689
 need to slow down and advertising or 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.429
 intermittently 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:13.509
 when locking wheels 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:15.059
 your car 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.059
 move straight lines 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.679
 today we once again emphasized my husband 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:23.569
 demand for cars equipped 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.929
 anti-lock system 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:29.389
 driving on the road of themselves more stably 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.299
 pushing the pedal to the floor 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.089
 the most important advantage of this 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.859
 systems 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.519
 when you press the brake pedal to control 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.129
 by car 53 5 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.179
 cars not equipped 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.459
 and unblocked by the brake system 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.429
 and I don't want it anymore 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:49.759
 with him he pressed the pedal tour 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.759
 car may turn out 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:56.469
 or on the opposite lane and forward 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.469
 performing the maneuver 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.299
 using braking defamation and happens 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.699
 they are overpriced 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.269
 the streets paid the day
