00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.619
 regards 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.630
 I'm going to talk about how to prepare good 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.210
 how do some get into the water 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.210
 for when they will get fish fry 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:50.980
 some so that they are ready 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.090
 the female then this but there is some data 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 from before and natural stressors 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.380
 who use the heteros after port 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.870
 Ordaz, I am also talking to my friend 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.150
 better untied another one that studies 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.619
 quite these the vétals like a lot 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.690
 Mr. Jorge uses algae the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.770
 Aloe claws of a thick penis is 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.160
 ávila 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.560
 an appendix if you take everything green 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.270
 all things that nothing is left nothing 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.580
 of that this and use the crystal and what 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.729
 they put them back and put it to 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.740
 dissolve or that will become a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.550
 bandit or something like that inside 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 of a few days they put it in a colander 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.229
 fine and the gel comes out will keep the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.750
 thickest games 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.070
 that's why we voted them this you can put it 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.260
 to the fridge that cover 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.250
 and several weeks 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.700
 it seems more and we can take five or 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.770
 six or one tablespoon for every five 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.620
 liters that listen to 210s something for the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.450
 style that will make the athlete cs3 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.880
 the water will be conditioned is going to 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.280
 improve the ph remember that the skillful 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.980
 good input to improve the queues for 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.980
 many things another way 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.610
 in putting a colander for example a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.520
 strainer here 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.190
 here something like that but of course thicker than 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.300
 the one that makes you laugh 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.130
 and the tongue and in an empty boat because 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.870
 that side and this is going to fall 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:42.060
 alone the drool is falling this already there 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.060
 once and once filtered perez 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.260
 we can also liquefy it there are many 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.730
 ways to do it the important thing is good 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.840
 the amount that we are going to put in the water 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:57.020
 and well this is do not be afraid of this 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.770
 does not cloud the water does not affect it at all 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:05.480
 does not affect that is not only what 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:08.300
 better is stressful and has no effect 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.040
 secondary think that water also 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.360
 they prepared it I also recommend 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:20.570
 put algae plants in this case 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:24.850
 only because beware of doing this 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.850
 to prepare a sun 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.739
 and my pets 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:40.390
 with a bolivar offspring 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.390
 also that greeted me thank you very much 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.040
 health also to castle and that soon 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.350
 will bring your new litter of weights 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.360
 imported and well I hope you serve them this 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.450
 of the council but always prepare the 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.510
 water put the ripe ones before a 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.150
 grip directly from the tuy 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.280
 and release and it 's like that because it can bring 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.280
 many assets and things that affect 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.280
