00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.710 

ah<00:03:05.330> there<00:03:06.330> we<00:03:06.420> go

ah there we go

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.780 
ah there we go
some<00:03:07.170> wheat<00:03:07.350> grill<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.400> see<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.640> down

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
some wheat grill you can see it down

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.990 
some wheat grill you can see it down
there<00:03:09.650> let's<00:03:10.650> go<00:03:10.770> get<00:03:10.920> it

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.310 

just<00:03:18.000> punch<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.360> block<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.900> you'll<00:03:19.200> get

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
just punch this block and you'll get

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.310 
just punch this block and you'll get
some<00:03:19.440> wheat<00:03:19.590> boom<00:03:20.780> actually<00:03:21.780> also<00:03:22.080> dropped

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
some wheat boom actually also dropped

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.050 
some wheat boom actually also dropped
some<00:03:22.500> seeds<00:03:22.709> for<00:03:22.890> me<00:03:23.040> too<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.610> can<00:03:23.760> replant

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
some seeds for me too so I can replant

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.310 
some seeds for me too so I can replant
those<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:30.000> obviously<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.840> takes<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.050> while<00:03:31.260> for

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
those so obviously it takes a while for

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.620 
those so obviously it takes a while for
weed<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.890> grow<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.209> speed<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.480> process

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
weed to grow you can speed this process

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.650 
weed to grow you can speed this process
up<00:03:33.930> actually<00:03:34.380> using<00:03:34.920> bone<00:03:35.220> meal<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.570> for<00:03:36.570> that

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
up actually using bone meal and for that

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:47.590 
up actually using bone meal and for that
we're<00:03:36.959> gonna<00:03:37.020> need<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.290> kill<00:03:37.440> some<00:03:37.560> skeletons

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.580 

there<00:03:48.600> we<00:03:48.780> go<00:03:48.870> there<00:03:49.020> we<00:03:49.080> go<00:03:49.110> there<00:03:49.200> we<00:03:49.350> go

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
there we go there we go there we go

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.340 
there we go there we go there we go

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
to my crafting block here and they turn

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.020 
to my crafting block here and they turn
into<00:04:12.540> bone<00:04:12.720> meal<00:04:12.900> immediately<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:17.850> it's<00:04:17.970> a
