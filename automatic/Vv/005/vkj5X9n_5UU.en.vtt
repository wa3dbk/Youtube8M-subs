to play them because it's something I

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.529

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
think the worst message is for music

think the worst message is for music
strong<00:06:12.810> and<00:06:12.990> I<00:06:13.050> think<00:06:13.260> it's<00:06:13.680> something<00:06:13.919> that

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340

that<00:06:25.110> sense<00:06:25.380> it<00:06:25.620> has<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:25.979> feeling<00:06:26.599> it<00:06:27.599> doesn't

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
that sense it has the feeling it doesn't

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.589 
that sense it has the feeling it doesn't
