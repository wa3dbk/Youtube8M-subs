00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
third of an inch long you can roll this

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.030 
third of an inch long you can roll this
between<00:03:24.450> your<00:03:24.599> palm<00:03:24.840> or<00:03:25.139> between<00:03:25.680> your<00:03:25.859> palm

between your palm or between your palm
and<00:03:26.219> the<00:03:26.310> countertop<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.239> might<00:03:27.420> need<00:03:27.569> a

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
and the countertop you might need a

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.209 
and the countertop you might need a
little<00:03:27.810> bit<00:03:27.900> more<00:03:28.079> practice<00:03:28.530> but<00:03:28.859> it's<00:03:29.010> not

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:29.219 
little bit more practice but it's not

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:30.349 
little bit more practice but it's not
difficult

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
difficult

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:41.080

and<00:03:31.250> these<00:03:32.250> oblong<00:03:32.730> pieces<00:03:33.150> are<00:03:33.329> called<00:03:33.510> sushi

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.729 

now<00:03:42.090> you'll<00:03:42.239> boil<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.659> milk<00:03:42.870> by<00:03:43.139> constantly

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
now you'll boil the milk by constantly

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.379 
now you'll boil the milk by constantly
stirring<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.219> so<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.669> milk<00:03:44.849> doesn't<00:03:45.269> get
