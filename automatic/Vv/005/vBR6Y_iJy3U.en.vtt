00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
rather than have that happen we have a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.120 
rather than have that happen we have a
blow-off<00:01:08.700> valve<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.750> we'll<00:01:10.350> know<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:11.070> soon

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
blow-off valve that we'll know as soon

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
blow-off valve that we'll know as soon
as<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.580> throttle<00:01:11.850> closes<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.780> got<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
as that throttle closes it's got a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.600 
as that throttle closes it's got a
little<00:01:13.140> vacuum<00:01:13.530> line<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> senses<00:01:14.400> an

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
little vacuum line that senses an

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.910 
little vacuum line that senses an
increase<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.479> pressure<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.530> will<00:01:16.560> purge

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
increase in pressure and it will purge

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.910 
increase in pressure and it will purge
off<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.360> extra<00:01:18.689> boost<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
off the the extra boost so that the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.160 
off the the extra boost so that the
turbo<00:01:20.280> stays<00:01:20.580> spooled<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.930> when<00:01:22.080> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
turbo stays spooled up so that when you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.480 
turbo stays spooled up so that when you
open<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.560> throttle<00:01:22.590> again<00:01:23.159> you've<00:01:23.460> got

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
open the throttle again you've got

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
open the throttle again you've got
immediate<00:01:24.030> boost<00:01:24.180> coming<00:01:24.570> back<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
immediate boost coming back in and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.990 
immediate boost coming back in and
that's<00:01:25.770> another<00:01:26.009> trick<00:01:26.280> piece<00:01:26.490> from<00:01:26.670> turbo

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
that's another trick piece from turbo

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.609 
that's another trick piece from turbo

boost<00:03:36.480> up<00:03:36.690> real<00:03:36.870> high<00:03:37.079> on<00:03:37.110> this<00:03:37.410> olds<00:03:37.860> we

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
boost up real high on this olds we

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.319 
boost up real high on this olds we
certainly<00:03:38.489> shouldn't<00:03:38.760> have<00:03:38.910> any<00:03:39.030> problem

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
certainly shouldn't have any problem

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.920 
certainly shouldn't have any problem
doing<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:40.400> then<00:03:41.400> we<00:03:41.579> engineered<00:03:42.390> the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
doing that and then we engineered the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.470 
doing that and then we engineered the
upper<00:03:43.620> radiator<00:03:43.950> shroud<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.940> sides<00:03:45.209> of<00:03:45.390> the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
upper radiator shroud and sides of the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.140 
upper radiator shroud and sides of the
core<00:03:45.690> support<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.650> funnel<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.100> air<00:03:47.250> through

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
core support to funnel the air through

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.569 
core support to funnel the air through
the<00:03:48.750> radiator<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.590> go<00:03:49.829> around<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.370> and

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
the radiator and that go around it and

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.599 
the radiator and that go around it and
we<00:03:51.060> did<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.359> by<00:03:51.540> modifying<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:52.440> original

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
we did that by modifying the original

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.880 
we did that by modifying the original
oldsmobile<00:03:53.609> top<00:03:53.970> radiator<00:03:54.420> cover<00:03:54.890> and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
oldsmobile top radiator cover and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.250 
oldsmobile top radiator cover and
shortened<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.060> added<00:03:57.420> some<00:03:57.630> curved<00:03:57.930> sides

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
shortened it and added some curved sides

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.099 
shortened it and added some curved sides
that<00:03:58.620> roll<00:03:58.829> down<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.510> manage<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.660> air<00:04:00.780> flow

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
that roll down to manage the air flow

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.560 
that roll down to manage the air flow
but<00:04:01.140> at<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.799> same<00:04:01.980> time<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.549> still<00:04:03.060> looks<00:04:03.329> like

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
but at the same time it still looks like

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.819 
but at the same time it still looks like
it<00:04:03.690> might<00:04:03.900> be<00:04:04.109> a<00:04:04.350> stock<00:04:04.739> original<00:04:05.400> piece<00:04:06.829> so

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
it might be a stock original piece so

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.729 
it might be a stock original piece so
after<00:04:08.070> we<00:04:08.160> had<00:04:08.280> all<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.579> our<00:04:08.730> parts<00:04:09.180> made<00:04:09.810> we

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
after we had all of our parts made we

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.860 
after we had all of our parts made we
cleaned<00:04:11.040> up<00:04:11.190> all<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.519> metal<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:12.600> sent

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
cleaned up all the metal and we sent

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.319 
cleaned up all the metal and we sent

of<00:05:37.270> our<00:05:37.630> turbocharger<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:38.530> it's<00:05:38.980> designed<00:05:39.400> to

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
of our turbocharger and it's designed to

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.360 
of our turbocharger and it's designed to
keep<00:05:39.669> heat<00:05:40.270> inside<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.290> turbo<00:05:41.680> for<00:05:42.220> better

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
keep heat inside the turbo for better

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.970 
keep heat inside the turbo for better
turbo<00:05:42.820> performance<00:05:43.450> and<00:05:43.630> also<00:05:44.080> to<00:05:44.290> keep<00:05:44.680> the

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
turbo performance and also to keep the

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.950 
turbo performance and also to keep the
under<00:05:45.340> hood<00:05:45.730> temperatures<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.570> little<00:05:46.870> bit

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
under hood temperatures a little bit

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.690 
under hood temperatures a little bit
cooler<00:05:47.080> and<00:05:47.590> this<00:05:48.100> product<00:05:48.400> is<00:05:48.550> pretty

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
cooler and this product is pretty

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.280 
cooler and this product is pretty
interesting<00:05:49.000> because<00:05:49.390> it's<00:05:49.870> actually<00:05:50.080> made

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
interesting because it's actually made

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.700 
interesting because it's actually made
from<00:05:51.160> pulverized<00:05:51.940> lava<00:05:52.450> rock<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:53.500> has<00:05:53.680> a

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
from pulverized lava rock it has a

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.470 
from pulverized lava rock it has a
titanium<00:05:54.220> color<00:05:54.669> but<00:05:54.910> it's<00:05:55.030> not<00:05:55.090> actually

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
titanium color but it's not actually

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.600 
titanium color but it's not actually
made<00:05:55.630> of<00:05:55.780> titanium<00:05:56.040> and<00:05:57.040> what<00:05:57.190> they<00:05:57.310> do<00:05:57.370> is

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
made of titanium and what they do is

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.730 
made of titanium and what they do is
they<00:05:57.790> get<00:05:57.910> this<00:05:58.060> pulverized<00:05:58.690> lava<00:05:59.080> rock<00:05:59.410> and

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
they get this pulverized lava rock and

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.640 
they get this pulverized lava rock and
then<00:06:00.220> it<00:06:00.340> is<00:06:00.430> spun<00:06:00.880> into<00:06:01.270> fibers<00:06:01.900> and<00:06:02.200> then

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
then it is spun into fibers and then

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.580 
then it is spun into fibers and then
woven<00:06:02.980> into<00:06:03.790> this<00:06:03.970> blanket<00:06:04.570> that<00:06:05.080> securely

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
woven into this blanket that securely

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.710 
woven into this blanket that securely
wraps<00:06:05.919> around<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.370> turbo<00:06:06.760> they<00:06:07.390> make<00:06:07.600> them

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
wraps around the turbo they make them

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.420 
wraps around the turbo they make them
for<00:06:07.930> a<00:06:07.960> couple<00:06:08.200> different<00:06:08.350> sized<00:06:08.830> turbo

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
for a couple different sized turbo

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.550 
for a couple different sized turbo
applications<00:06:10.120> ours<00:06:10.690> is<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.020> big<00:06:11.200> one

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560

applications ours is the big one
t-6<00:06:12.130> but<00:06:12.669> they<00:06:12.790> make<00:06:12.970> them<00:06:13.090> for<00:06:13.270> smaller<00:06:13.540> ones

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
t-6 but they make them for smaller ones

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.850 
t-6 but they make them for smaller ones
as<00:06:13.990> well<00:06:14.169> and<00:06:14.560> it<00:06:14.889> formed<00:06:15.340> fits<00:06:15.700> around<00:06:16.270> that

as well and it formed fits around that

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.440 
as well and it formed fits around that
turbine<00:06:17.860> housing<00:06:18.280> and<00:06:18.460> then<00:06:18.970> you<00:06:19.090> wire<00:06:19.419> it

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
turbine housing and then you wire it

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.960 
turbine housing and then you wire it
tight<00:06:20.139> around<00:06:20.410> the<00:06:20.710> base<00:06:20.919> using<00:06:21.639> some

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
tight around the base using some

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.570 
tight around the base using some
stainless<00:06:22.389> steel<00:06:22.600> wire<00:06:22.840> and<00:06:23.200> it's<00:06:24.130> designed

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
stainless steel wire and it's designed

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.170

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
to handle 1,800 degrees of contact

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.210 
to handle 1,800 degrees of contact
temperature<00:06:28.720> so<00:06:29.320> if<00:06:29.440> your<00:06:29.560> turbo<00:06:29.830> gets<00:06:30.040> real

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
temperature so if your turbo gets real

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.040 
temperature so if your turbo gets real
hot<00:06:30.490> you<00:06:31.030> know<00:06:31.150> this<00:06:31.570> thing<00:06:31.780> should<00:06:31.930> be<00:06:31.990> able

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
hot you know this thing should be able

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.680 
hot you know this thing should be able
to<00:06:32.200> stand<00:06:32.470> it<00:06:32.650> I<00:06:32.830> mean<00:06:33.040> it's<00:06:33.190> made<00:06:33.400> from

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
to stand it I mean it's made from

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.670 
to stand it I mean it's made from
volcanoes<00:06:34.690> for<00:06:34.960> crying<00:06:35.169> out<00:06:35.290> loud

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
volcanoes for crying out loud

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.659 
volcanoes for crying out loud
and<00:06:35.770> then<00:06:36.310> on<00:06:36.430> the<00:06:36.520> outside<00:06:36.550> if<00:06:37.330> it<00:06:37.930> gets<00:06:38.169> near

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
and then on the outside if it gets near

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:40.620 
and then on the outside if it gets near
radiant<00:06:39.669> heat<00:06:39.850> it<00:06:40.060> can<00:06:40.240> handle<00:06:40.389> those

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
radiant heat it can handle those

temperatures up to like 2500 degrees
we're<00:06:43.810> pretty<00:06:43.990> confident<00:06:44.560> that<00:06:44.590> it's<00:06:44.830> going

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
we're pretty confident that it's going

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.920 
we're pretty confident that it's going
to<00:06:45.100> help<00:06:45.760> keep<00:06:46.120> those<00:06:46.419> underhood

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
to help keep those underhood

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.379 
to help keep those underhood
temperatures<00:06:47.229> down<00:06:47.710> and<00:06:48.070> then<00:06:48.669> on<00:06:48.790> the<00:06:48.940> tubing

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.170 
temperatures down and then on the tubing
leading<00:06:50.020> out<00:06:50.229> of<00:06:50.260> the<00:06:50.440> turbo<00:06:50.919> we<00:06:51.520> also<00:06:51.850> wrapped

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
leading out of the turbo we also wrapped

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.650 
leading out of the turbo we also wrapped
all<00:06:52.419> that<00:06:52.660> stuff<00:06:52.960> with<00:06:53.290> some<00:06:53.470> Dei<00:06:54.270> header<00:06:55.270> wrap

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
all that stuff with some Dei header wrap

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.290 
all that stuff with some Dei header wrap
which<00:06:56.200> is<00:06:56.380> made<00:06:56.620> from<00:06:56.830> that<00:06:57.040> same<00:06:57.400> lava<00:06:57.970> rock

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:06.790 
hood the trick to installing the wrap is

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.379 
hood the trick to installing the wrap is
to<00:07:07.240> only<00:07:07.630> have<00:07:08.050> about<00:07:08.620> a<00:07:08.650> 1/4<00:07:09.220> inch<00:07:09.370> overlap<00:07:10.090> as

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:10.389 
to only have about a 1/4 inch overlap as

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:12.600 
to only have about a 1/4 inch overlap as
you<00:07:10.780> wrap<00:07:11.050> it<00:07:11.080> around<00:07:11.260> your<00:07:11.560> tubing<00:07:12.040> but<00:07:12.490> if

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:12.610 
you wrap it around your tubing but if

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.219 
you wrap it around your tubing but if
you<00:07:12.669> take<00:07:12.850> your<00:07:13.000> time<00:07:13.240> you'll<00:07:13.720> be<00:07:13.840> able<00:07:13.930> to<00:07:14.110> get

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:14.229 
you take your time you'll be able to get

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.040 
you take your time you'll be able to get
it<00:07:14.320> to<00:07:14.350> lay<00:07:14.560> out<00:07:14.710> real<00:07:14.919> nice<00:07:15.130> and<00:07:15.460> this<00:07:16.060> again
