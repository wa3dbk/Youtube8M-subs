I've<00:03:00.790> been<00:03:00.910> working<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.300> here<00:03:01.690> we're<00:03:02.410> working

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
I've been working on here we're working

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.670 
I've been working on here we're working
with<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.040> young<00:03:03.280> child<00:03:03.580> such<00:03:04.300> as<00:03:04.450> Patrick<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
with a young child such as Patrick the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.680 
with a young child such as Patrick the
skills<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.340> were<00:03:06.760> working<00:03:06.970> on<00:03:07.270> are<00:03:07.540> all

skills that were working on are all

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.050 
skills that were working on are all
interdependent<00:03:08.170> science<00:03:08.860> related<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:09.970> it

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
interdependent science related so it

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.450 
interdependent science related so it
would<00:03:10.180> make<00:03:10.210> sense<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.900> all<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.470> clinicians

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
would make sense that all the clinicians

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.550 
would make sense that all the clinicians
that<00:03:12.520> are<00:03:12.670> working<00:03:13.030> with<00:03:13.180> him<00:03:13.470> basically<00:03:14.470> are
