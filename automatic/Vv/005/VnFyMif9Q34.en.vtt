00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 so girls I think it's done 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.310
 really long time I have not done any 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.630
 videos really puts long as 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.360
 two months but now I'm back 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.179
 on youtube then I hope you are 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.010
 happy because I think the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.520
 managers put in the videos can 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.140
 hear before I invest lada and then 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.939
 the game explain to you why I 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.670
 was no longer on youtube alphonse 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.910
 because the ugly more with my boyfriend 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.450
 it's like a big story and I 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.640
 can talk about it too much but in a nutshell 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.559
 people think about it I learned full to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.449
 to make it really put me down 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.860
 so close for those that it tempts me 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.090
 really not talking about the waters I had 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.079
 really not a gouge and goes bad and you 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.629
 so you roll his job so the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.489
 mix and 7 passes through this game 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.909
 keep smiling 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.430
 and then we know it's been a month and 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.049
 half or so so I try to forget 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.880
 all that's why that's why I 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.439
 decided to make a video because I 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.580
 want to hand me the darse finally has to 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.740
 what to do with my days 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.630
 but despite that I hurt that I work 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.350
 also the but I had to have a 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.600
 occupation 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.460
 so I had a lot of concrete purpose at this 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.450
 video there I just wanted to tell you that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:41.250
 I came back and then this game you 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:46.320
 explain why I explained to you 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.700
 briefly but that I decided to do 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.780
 a little video shows you and what is 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.250
 what I received for children's christmas 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.140
 it's not much but I'm going when 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.520
 even a watch and so my mother told me 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.520
 given a pajama 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.510
 that's the butter patches ever from where the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:16.920
 today as the fabrics of the dresses 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:21.750
 of room the sweaters like that with 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.470
 too comfortable pockets will then be 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.870
 my papara and gave the yes I say 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.280
 the mason pajamas herself and she is 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.400
 burned mean heroes primo because they 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.120
 have bought a month it also stands out the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.170
 same thing and makeup brushes 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.880
 I never thought that my friend 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.640
 redeem threshold is really too nice 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.510
 the strength is there I do not know in the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.950
 combines but there are many I have them 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.970
 not even unpacked are as much as 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.400
 would have in small super plastic 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.850
 flight 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.020
 because I really have a lot 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.660
 and then they do not take a soldier that 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.430
 I was poor that I read you jean the 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.739
 little game is not with me the little 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.209
 smile I was just thinking of one I 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.209
 I wanted it to be at best 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.910
 so this is none other than I have plenty of 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.580
 brush buddies then did not educate me 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.700
 bought on the internet but I do not know if 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.060
 for the mark would have a member if 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.060
 you want to know 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.590
 so it is not against the 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.410
 princes at synthetic it's bojan la 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:47.520

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:50.010

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:27.770
