and they would always break somehow I
would<00:01:06.090> always<00:01:06.330> wish<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.500> invent<00:01:07.710> my<00:01:07.890> own

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920

earbuds<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.939> they<00:01:09.510> would<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.869> really

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
earbuds that they would be really

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.560 
earbuds that they would be really
adorable<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.420> is

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570

across<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> gamut<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.409> think<00:01:13.619> every<00:01:13.920> company

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

across the gamut I think every company
that<00:01:14.310> makes<00:01:14.549> your<00:01:14.760> buds<00:01:14.939> should<00:01:15.180> come<00:01:15.479> with<00:01:15.900> a

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
