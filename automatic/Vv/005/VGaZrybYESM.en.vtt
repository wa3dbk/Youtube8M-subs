00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.090
 hello youtube gives us rubin mexico good 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.820
 today I received a package of 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:14.750
 highly anticipated lubricant and I'm also going to 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.119
 do review of the new way long I think that 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.130
 let's start with the ubric before this 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.970
 I ordered the lubricant 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:27.120
 a friend a fan of guadalajara rice 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.510
 arturo weasley for mexico 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:34.690
 because the truth was already dry was hung 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:39.030
 bright then I asked him were 200 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.120
 cc here are the lubricant bottles 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.010
 well this lubricant is very 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.079
 similar to the unics in fact I feel that it is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.290
 better than the beats of that speed 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.449
 to the juices that sociologists give us 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.949
 I applied it in a syringe of Lewis 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.949
 I just filled out why that looks 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.909
 the only thing that I did not like but good 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.240
 It does not bother me so much, it's not that it leaves them 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:09.530
 like a sticky sound like that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.530
 yes they were purposes 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.560
 but I think it's not going to party but yes 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.180
 good only apply if they reach 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.850
 buy it the truth I recommend them 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:24.729
 much more than the noise is like if your 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.300
 husband then I think that's why 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.840
 that leaves you as well as sound so 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.610
 policies 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 sounds but it's the review let's talk 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.960
 of the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.850
 Williams is the second cube that we 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.070
 we mark that they send us today or that we 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.660
 give me or me of dj lopera and union john 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.790
 young had another very good cube that 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.790
 5 x 5 before that example draw 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.970
 he went for the cubes good with stickers 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.970
 does not have a set 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.840
 perhaps 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:13.040
 the orange is a very colorful orange 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:18.500
 now it saves this interesting 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.060
 and pos had another bigger logo of will 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.080
 id 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.080
 the lubricant 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.870
 will be 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.450
 let's see speed is much more 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.639
 Quick 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.620
 wang jing if it 's faster than juaning 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:39.750
 it's faster to be guys faster 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.990
 what fancy and faster than fancy sound 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.530
 so 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.710
 I do not recommend this game to Cuberos 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.810
 very novices exist within 40 30 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.570
 I still do not recommend it to them 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.460
 I recommend one hour an hour for them 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:00.040
 and it is very good they will like it 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:05.070
 and then this cube that has to us 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:09.390
 offers not take no for version game 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.460
 a cut intended for 45 degrees 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.720
 and it's already driving and singing that I put 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:20.080
 either cut a little over 45 degrees 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:23.660
 their speed is assigned and they offer us and 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:27.340
 they offer us less noise than huang in one 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.340
 remember that it is a horrible rattle 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.840
 as such in these first things my 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.209
 first impressions with what my 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.489
 opinion about the cube cuban if it is 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.989
 very well it already takes it sometimes control 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.260
 and versiona by being very used to 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.340
 my wine 3 that was super super fast 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.720
 then I kind of kept that 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.440
 feeling of speed 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.130
 and I really did not know a regional 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.860
 that said that Paraguay does not recommend it 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.800
 to anybody, no trace, but the truth is 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.040
 I like I like umbrellas and because 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.600
 cut the corners with ease and 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.650
 students can do one more way 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.420
 fluid then paraguay if it's okay if 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.770
 It is obviously advisable to 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.290
 Tuberos are a minicasino machete 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.739
 they will not like it because they really 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.090
 he has a lot of practice 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.919
 but it's not like they are 30 25 to this cube them 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.880
 he liked it is the truth if he's going to 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.910
 like for 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.970
 h 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.970
 and with your wii and wii 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.720
 I leave you the link of a contact of ross 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.640
 arturo wifi is nothing removes his logo me 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.010
 like your logo I like harry potter 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.990
 and not personal, because I like it because it is 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.820
 that of the relics of death ' 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.100
 apart from having the three relics has 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.160
 a cube in half a block what is the 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.600
 Elderberry is impregnated with the 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:04.300
 turn of faculty crossing across the 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.490
 cube then it's like file 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.370
 he studies us know if they have alicante 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.220
 when and cheap very good very good 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.729
 excellent lubricant lubricant 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.430
 wikileaks I do not know how to swim the staff 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:21.100
 say but if it is very cheap 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.770
 and it's very very good reminds me a little 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.360
 here I do not know whether to try all those 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.850
 sensations is like that level of 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.920
 viscosity but as with the speed 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.370
 of the unics is maintained 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:38.420
 and well if I fly though it's very good 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.420
 I've tried that and it has not let me 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.180
 even more on my mouth what I faint I want 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.710
 the 4x4 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.350
 weiss 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.750
 so then if this guy and I like it 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.450
 have the ticas to the fourth game 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:57.830
 always to the ticos works the 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.500
 seeds your tours because basically that 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.270
 that's it 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:06.780
 this lubricant how can you see are 206 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:09.690
 and this is the ix of 86 good is lumix 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.710
 stuffed with wisnik then come a 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.569
 low capacity see everything I asked 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.469
 so I think that 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.469
 until the many 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.529
 we have the calendar or nothing 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.000
 of that then 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:30.800
 it's with clock you 're going to like 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.190
 and this teaches them their corners I like 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.770
 I really like fans and I like it 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.900
 from the guan yi none of these the 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.540
 new revolution of the cubes is 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:46.480
 carving is dying and we are staying 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.480
 with a bow so thank you your people
