some of them driving and walking so it's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.830 
some of them driving and walking so it's
not<00:00:29.460> gonna<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.910> completely<00:00:30.420> smooth<00:00:30.689> as

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
not gonna be as completely smooth as

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.089 
not gonna be as completely smooth as
you'll<00:00:31.019> probably<00:00:31.170> be<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.590> hold<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.949> still

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you'll probably be if you hold it still

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.500

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
but some of them you can really tell the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.420 
but some of them you can really tell the
image<00:00:34.110> stabilization<00:00:34.469> does<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.219> work

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
image stabilization does really work
