hair dryer doesn't have a nozzle on the
end<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.489> if<00:02:12.670> yours<00:02:12.880> does<00:02:13.180> then<00:02:13.780> that's

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
end of it if yours does then that's

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.530 
end of it if yours does then that's
brilliant<00:02:14.410> I've<00:02:14.739> lost<00:02:15.040> mine<00:02:15.370> if<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.360> have<00:02:16.510> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
brilliant I've lost mine if you have a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.030 
brilliant I've lost mine if you have a
nozzle<00:02:16.840> then<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.290> going<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.560> give<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.010> a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
nozzle then it's going to give you a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.949 
nozzle then it's going to give you a
much<00:02:18.250> better<00:02:18.519> job<00:02:18.640> but<00:02:19.120> without<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.510> nozzle

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
much better job but without the nozzle

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.660 
much better job but without the nozzle
I'm<00:02:20.500> just<00:02:20.680> making<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.040> best<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.370> what<00:02:21.430> I've

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
I'm just making the best of what I've

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.400 
I'm just making the best of what I've
got<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.150> I'll<00:02:22.299> just<00:02:22.329> show<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.750> briefly<00:02:23.019> what<00:02:23.260> I

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
got so I'll just show you briefly what I

00:02:23.410 --> 00:03:35.360 
got so I'll just show you briefly what I
do<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.720> flecked<00:02:26.019> my<00:02:26.140> hair<00:02:26.349> over<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.980> start

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.730 

so<00:03:36.370> there<00:03:36.550> you<00:03:36.580> can<00:03:36.910> see<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.230> common

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
so there you can see that it is common

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.270 
so there you can see that it is common
like<00:03:38.890> quite<00:03:39.340> strength<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.860> I've<00:03:41.860> been<00:03:42.070> doing

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
like quite strength and I've been doing

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.710 
like quite strength and I've been doing
this<00:03:42.310> for<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> few<00:03:42.820> months<00:03:43.000> now<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.300> I<00:03:43.510> haven't

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
this for a few months now and I haven't

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.540 
this for a few months now and I haven't
heard<00:03:43.960> straighteners<00:03:44.410> near<00:03:44.710> my<00:03:44.830> hair<00:03:45.070> well

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
heard straighteners near my hair well

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.220 
heard straighteners near my hair well
I've<00:03:45.760> had<00:03:45.790> them<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.180> Omaha<00:03:46.450> boat<00:03:46.630> once<00:03:46.870> in<00:03:47.110> the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
I've had them the Omaha boat once in the

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.580 
I've had them the Omaha boat once in the
last<00:03:47.640> four<00:03:48.640> or<00:03:48.730> five<00:03:48.790> months<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.200> think<00:03:50.380> it's

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
last four or five months so I think it's

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.260 
last four or five months so I think it's
better<00:03:50.770> just<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.070> have<00:03:51.220> one<00:03:51.250> heat<00:03:51.760> source<00:03:52.060> on

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
better just to have one heat source on

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.880 
better just to have one heat source on
your<00:03:52.300> hair<00:03:52.630> if<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.530> can<00:03:53.740> so<00:03:54.460> just<00:03:54.490> remember<00:03:54.820> to

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890

pick<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.010> brush<00:03:57.190> underneath<00:03:57.610> twist<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.210> down

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
pick the brush underneath twist it down

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.750 
pick the brush underneath twist it down

and i'll just show you around the back

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.450 
and i'll just show you around the back
obviously<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.259> back<00:05:21.440> is<00:05:21.710> never<00:05:22.039> going<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.310> be

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
obviously the back is never going to be

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.610 
obviously the back is never going to be
as<00:05:22.490> good<00:05:22.970> when<00:05:23.720> you're<00:05:23.870> doing<00:05:24.050> your<00:05:24.080> own<00:05:24.259> hair

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
as good when you're doing your own hair

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.360 
as good when you're doing your own hair
because<00:05:25.039> it's<00:05:25.190> hard<00:05:25.400> to<00:05:25.520> reach<00:05:26.770> so<00:05:27.770> i'm<00:05:28.220> not

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
because it's hard to reach so i'm not

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.649 
because it's hard to reach so i'm not
even<00:05:28.520> sure<00:05:28.669> what<00:05:29.000> the<00:05:29.120> back<00:05:29.270> looks<00:05:29.300> like

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
even sure what the back looks like

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:30.939 
even sure what the back looks like
because<00:05:29.900> i<00:05:30.020> haven't<00:05:30.229> looked<00:05:30.530> in<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.740> mirror

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949
