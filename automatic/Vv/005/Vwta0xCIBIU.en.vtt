00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
model of the ultimate series they also

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.530 
model of the ultimate series they also
come<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.019> 900<00:00:37.530> watts<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.040> 1100<00:00:38.879> watts<00:00:39.120> but

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
come in 900 watts and 1100 watts but

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.930 
come in 900 watts and 1100 watts but
they<00:00:39.720> all<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:39.920> circuit<00:00:40.920> protection<00:00:41.309> right

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
components on the chart here it shows

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.990 
components on the chart here it shows
you<00:00:54.600> how<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.229> wattage<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.580> amps<00:00:56.909> are

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you how the wattage and the amps are

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.410 
you how the wattage and the amps are
allocated<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.350> each<00:00:58.650> output<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.210> way<00:01:00.360> you

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
allocated to each output so that way you

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.939 
allocated to each output so that way you
can<00:01:00.629> kind<00:01:00.839> of<00:01:00.869> calculate<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.680> how<00:01:01.799> much

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
can kind of calculate and see how much

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.600 
can kind of calculate and see how much
is<00:01:02.129> being<00:01:02.309> used<00:01:02.720> more<00:01:03.720> or<00:01:03.809> less<00:01:03.869> for<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:04.979> 700

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
is being used more or less for this 700

is being used more or less for this 700
watt<00:01:05.850> version<00:01:06.390> remember<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
watt version remember this is the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.530 
watt version remember this is the
heartbeat<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.430> PC<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.119> want<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.450> get

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
heartbeat of your PC so you want to get

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.510 
heartbeat of your PC so you want to get
enough<00:01:09.810> power<00:01:10.020> now<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.010> turn<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.280> over<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
enough power now if we turn it over to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.390 
enough power now if we turn it over to
the<00:01:11.729> side<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.990> power<00:01:13.230> plug<00:01:13.890> nothing

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the side here the power plug nothing

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.430 
the side here the power plug nothing
fancy<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.090> there's<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.510> on/off<00:01:15.900> switch<00:01:16.170> but

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
fancy and there's the on/off switch but

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.130 
fancy and there's the on/off switch but
look<00:01:16.590> at<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.860> mesh<00:01:17.160> great<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.480> that's<00:01:18.900> for

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
look at that mesh great here that's for

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.530 
look at that mesh great here that's for
the<00:01:19.200> airflow<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:20.010> you<00:01:20.310> need<00:01:20.550> right<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.300> we

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the airflow that you need right so we

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.110 
the airflow that you need right so we
got<00:01:21.570> excellent<00:01:22.280> airflow<00:01:23.280> coming<00:01:23.490> through<00:01:23.880> and

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
got excellent airflow coming through and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.300 
got excellent airflow coming through and
on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> side<00:01:24.660> where<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> fan<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:26.100> also

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
on the side where the fan is we also

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.600 
on the side where the fan is we also
have<00:01:26.490> great<00:01:27.180> airflow<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.990> efficiency<00:01:28.620> so<00:01:29.460> it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
have great airflow and efficiency so it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.630 
have great airflow and efficiency so it
has<00:01:29.760> a<00:01:29.790> consistent<00:01:30.480> rpm<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> use<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.800> power<00:01:32.100> up

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
has a consistent rpm and use of power up

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
has a consistent rpm and use of power up
until<00:01:33.000> around<00:01:33.090> eighty<00:01:33.510> to<00:01:33.660> eighty<00:01:33.780> seven

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
until around eighty to eighty seven

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.800 
until around eighty to eighty seven
percent<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.920> starts<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.400> increase<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.660> you've

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
percent it starts to increase but you've

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560 
percent it starts to increase but you've
got<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> great<00:01:37.700> airflow<00:01:38.700> coming<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.360> out<00:01:39.420> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
got a great airflow coming in and out of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.510 
got a great airflow coming in and out of
this<00:01:39.659> little<00:01:39.870> guy<00:01:40.080> if<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.680> actually<00:01:40.830> open<00:01:41.190> it

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
this little guy if you actually open it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.850 
this little guy if you actually open it
up<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.300> see<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.600> these<00:01:43.050> capacitors<00:01:43.800> or

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
up you can see that these capacitors or

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.310 
up you can see that these capacitors or
japanese<00:01:44.490> maid<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.060> that's<00:01:45.210> quality<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.140> want

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
japanese maid so that's quality you want

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.170 
japanese maid so that's quality you want
to<00:01:46.500> look<00:01:46.650> for<00:01:46.830> stuff<00:01:46.980> like<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:47.940> when<00:01:48.090> it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to look for stuff like that now when it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.240 
to look for stuff like that now when it
comes<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.450> cable<00:01:48.780> management<00:01:49.020> though<00:01:49.530> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
comes to cable management though this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.240 
comes to cable management though this
specific<00:01:50.970> model<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.900> modular<00:01:52.740> okay<00:01:53.190> so

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
specific model is not modular okay so

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.950 
specific model is not modular okay so
let<00:01:53.430> me<00:01:53.460> turn<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.790> around<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.630> see

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
let me turn it around here you can see

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.380 
let me turn it around here you can see
that<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.950> right<00:01:56.370> built-in<00:01:56.880> into<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> box

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
that this is right built-in into the box

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.840 
that this is right built-in into the box
it<00:01:57.600> doesn't<00:01:57.840> come<00:01:57.990> out<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.650> this<00:01:59.130> model<00:01:59.700> does

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it doesn't come out so this model does
