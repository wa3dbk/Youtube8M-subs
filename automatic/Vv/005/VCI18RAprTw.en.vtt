00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:23.439
 19 to get together to your brownie 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.539
 and a short video and I'm fine 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.869
 currently the pc community a bit 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.880
 on the biscuit, so to speak 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.670
 I'll say three pages or three 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.720
 types of community just on the pc 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.370
 that's just the hack so so 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.430
 this is also about hedging today 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.860
 further then there are those who themselves 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.369
 get excited about the hedge and then there is 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.140
 once those who are upset over people 

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:52.110
 supposedly but not at all 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.489
 had and what is going on there 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.790
 and the people just do not look 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.659
 So the people of the third category 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.629
 just do not look that it 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.489
 In fact we are good players in cod 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.750
 if it's a little example here 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.280
 Just show me that 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.020
 is not such a great example though 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.939
 I do not know the type anyway 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.850
 thought I would in any case 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:19.330
 pretty funny because he's after me 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.790
 saved this action and then got me 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.010
 offended and did my mother insulted 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.570
 or has actually offended everyone and 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.490
 I said hedge and hopefully will 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.200
 I banned and so on it 's easy 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.510
 The action looks ridiculous 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.380
 I tell you it was a bit 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.810
 hot 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.730
 yes, but it was logical , it's easy 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.440
 only logical 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.970
 and only because I do not have anyone through the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.830
 wall kill or memorize the people 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.110
 the wall does not mean that 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.400
 i wanted walter this is so abnormal 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.440
 and I also notice when I'm with others 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.150
 There are many people playing together 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.650
 people are simply referred to as hackers 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.479
 just stupidly clear on one 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.830
 page there are many hackers in mw3 that 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.510
 But that's because the team is easy too 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.680
 unable to patch anything 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.240
 or infinity or 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.310
 Otherwise cadre in any case now 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.370
 in any case, the action here 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.489
 i play here on lockdown with the acr 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.940
 again against the course well 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.409
 first wait through the wall 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.480
 first off very briefly from still writing in 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.080
 Brown hacker comes after neighbors 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.610
 you do not see a red one either 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.349
 yes okay I know he's in the back 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.299
 the wall must be simple again 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.260
 by now I write it out comes 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.560
 or it does not come 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.860
 or something 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.910
 I can not read it now but no matter 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.950
 through just yet war one kill 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.540
 By the wall it is cloudy 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.390
 no it is not we will be there now 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.280
 Just look at it again for a short time 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.849
 though you have to go back to july 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.670
 like to watch 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.380
 Look, my teams are on the left 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.300
 means she can only be right 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.800
 its then there is a red dot and 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.080
 they always fight back there does not matter 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.849
 in which they had always situation 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.489
 just behind the part 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.420
 messed up finished from mickey mouse like that 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:05.630
 then pay attention to the bridging 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.250
 scraps of music bad I see him right 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.989
 a red name c to the left I like it 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.370
 I still she has a good name by 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.019
 year old I know he has to go back there 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.209
 just stand again 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.590
 through the wall and has to do the tail 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.910
 one but because i just seen 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.769
 then I still see a red 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.450
 point for where I have written before 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.709
 he shot at the pub it was 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.890
 a red dot I shoot through times 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.360
 again behind the link and as that has 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.650
 to hedge it just means 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.840
 that I just play with the game 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.250
 have followed and there is still really 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.920
 players who just play reasonably 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.510
 can and actually without vanek too 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.880
 in wolbeck can do it on the pc 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.100
 just a wolbecker so you can 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.940
 one through the man-decker you get 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.340
 a hacker would have to hedge which 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.010
 ask which tail I have then I know 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.630
 do not know no matter what, but he is clear 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.730
 i have god fashion and still stands 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.290
 Age is just me so on the 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.579
 Table and I hope if you also everyone 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.870
 as hacker clearly means there is 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.819
 hacker but the hacker sees market 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.530
 plans ultimately for example with Werner 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.880
 allegedly he has come first 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.489
 gainward was also applied at night 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.840
 Of course, I am quite solemn since I am in 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.130
 sixsome team was easy was what 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.319
 she had no opponents anymore 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.310
 happy 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:16.400
 ok yes in any case, this is only one 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.380
 be illustrative videos and that was like 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.639
 a simple situation just said 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.350
 as you also against the wall 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.810
 I can pick them up, for example 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.250
 always so i prix celebration always before 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.289
 i come around a corner for example when 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.660
 I go on and have to be free 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.590
 I just fire and hit the opponents 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.690
 just go away 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.150
 then it's called six awesome because 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.320
 I stopped in front of the corner 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.020
 shoot before I even saw him 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.320
 but although I know that he is there 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.430
 Often it just so happens 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.780
 shoot or a corner is equal to the 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.610
 why not shoot my opponent? 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.900
 that is often like that but thats her 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.330
 the others are not just stop 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.800
 if they are really there and that 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.660
 is just really just pc 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.390
 community and definitely makes 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.670
 it's just as fun as many people 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.320
 mean that rambo still hangs when 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.470
 you look at his gameplay then look 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.820
 If he had not it's just it 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.190
 can you tell me what you want but 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.620
 there does not think he has maybe 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.500
 money from me I do not know but 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.200
 if we are so in the livestream of franz heck 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.620
 that means people you have to just like that 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.230
 see 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.520
 you play is in the game happening in it 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.960
 and you can do it a bit 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.220
 think about gambling and then you know 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.290
 actually already where the opponents so 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.480
 then half way, you can just 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.130
 celebrate or anything else therefore nothing 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.020
 shares and just like paul banks 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.370
 just like here for example plays to 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.900
 For example, 90 only with radar is 20 percent 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.650
 the 90 percent is a bit much 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.360
 here say 60 percent, I want to be with 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.490
 that means my eyes are only on the 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.090
 Radar and I just walk out loud 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.920
 Radar and shit is what I do real 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.350
 is I do not look really that into the 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.150
 middle or so are opponents but me 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.710
 really often look at radar running 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.780
 Just after the radar you can see that 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.760
 also the corners and so just after 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.640
 the radar already seen the red dot 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.200
 finished but I just play too easy 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.020
 a lot with radar how do i find myself 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.430
 but today by winning 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.390
 you can also see where the opponents are and there 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.300
 It will be easy to get through 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.240
 position correctly and just tap 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.010
 take care and well I have here now 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.380
 another small clip underneath 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.780
 probably if not then sorry 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.240
 but otherwise it was definitely 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.010
 from me from your hacker you know 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.680
 I would have hung you and we all hack 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.050
 is in the hacker all and even the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.770
 monkeys go deep are also hackers so 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.630
 is not a thing 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.760
 so take it easy 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.120
 back when it had little on the subject 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.730
 going 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.590
 hacker can be seen very clearly if someone 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.380
 then you would really pull it and 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.420
 honestly such actions so what arouses 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.760
 Just on or would I am 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.600
 favorite to switch console but there 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.860
 I will not do that 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.430
 In this sense, skin looks pure 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.430
 logan
