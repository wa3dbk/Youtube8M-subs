00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
that was the right way around then so

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.060 
that was the right way around then so
just<00:02:40.100> get<00:02:40.880> forward<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.270> get<00:02:41.360> back<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:43.010> the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
just get forward to get back on the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.770 
just get forward to get back on the
bottom<00:02:43.310> we<00:02:43.400> have<00:02:43.520> some<00:02:43.640> rubber<00:02:43.850> feet<00:02:44.060> nice

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.450 
after the speaker there just to give you
a<00:05:35.419> full<00:05:35.720> feeling<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.710> song<00:05:36.860> quality<00:05:37.250> and

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
a full feeling of the song quality and

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.840 
a full feeling of the song quality and
it<00:05:37.790> was<00:05:37.970> pretty<00:05:38.300> good<00:05:38.570> and<00:05:39.130> well<00:05:40.130> hard<00:05:40.400> test

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
it was pretty good and well hard test

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:51.230 
it was pretty good and well hard test
and<00:05:41.030> see<00:05:41.120> how<00:05:41.240> it<00:05:41.510> goes

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.490 

and<00:05:52.240> I<00:05:52.570> would<00:05:52.690> say<00:05:52.840> that<00:05:52.990> there's<00:05:53.200> a<00:05:53.260> decent

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
and I would say that there's a decent

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.909 
and I would say that there's a decent
amount<00:05:54.130> of<00:05:54.280> volume<00:05:54.669> and<00:05:54.820> that<00:05:54.880> it's<00:05:55.090> not

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
amount of volume and that it's not

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.990 
amount of volume and that it's not
earth-shattering<00:05:56.950> however<00:05:57.430> it's<00:05:57.700> certainly

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
earth-shattering however it's certainly

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.180 
earth-shattering however it's certainly
lighter<00:05:58.270> than<00:05:58.540> most<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.990> the<00:05:59.200> speakers<00:05:59.860> that

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
lighter than most of the speakers that

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.300 
lighter than most of the speakers that
you<00:06:00.220> get<00:06:00.430> on<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.639> mobile<00:06:01.000> phone<00:06:01.270> so<00:06:02.070> I'm<00:06:03.070> yeah

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
you get on a mobile phone so I'm yeah

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.920 
you get on a mobile phone so I'm yeah
but<00:06:03.550> that<00:06:03.730> seems<00:06:04.030> like<00:06:04.090> a<00:06:04.180> fairly<00:06:04.480> good<00:06:04.750> buy

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
but that seems like a fairly good buy

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.260 
but that seems like a fairly good buy
for<00:06:04.960> only<00:06:05.350> thirty<00:06:05.680> quid<00:06:05.950> you<00:06:06.160> could<00:06:06.850> do<00:06:07.000> far

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
for only thirty quid you could do far

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.810 
for only thirty quid you could do far
worse<00:06:07.330> I<00:06:07.870> imagine<00:06:08.350> for<00:06:09.010> that<00:06:09.160> for<00:06:09.520> that<00:06:09.610> kind

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
worse I imagine for that for that kind

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.440 
worse I imagine for that for that kind
of<00:06:09.880> money

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
of money

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.900
