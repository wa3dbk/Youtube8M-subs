different programs you can even have the
same<00:01:10.260> exact<00:01:10.560> program<00:01:10.799> let's<00:01:11.729> say<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.000> example

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
same exact program let's say for example

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.170 
same exact program let's say for example
that<00:01:12.510> piggies<00:01:13.049> yeah<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.680> same<00:01:14.189> program<00:01:14.640> but

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that piggies yeah the same program but

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.580 
that piggies yeah the same program but
different<00:01:15.450> users<00:01:15.720> will<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.140> different

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
different users will be at different

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.450 
different users will be at different
levels<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.000> also<00:01:18.600> stays<00:01:18.960> intact<00:01:19.460> some

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
levels so that also stays intact some

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.370 
levels so that also stays intact some
some<00:01:20.729> great<00:01:20.909> things<00:01:21.060> there<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.990> terms<00:01:22.229> of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
some great things there now in terms of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.640 
some great things there now in terms of
power<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:23.490> certainly<00:01:23.729> has<00:01:24.500> some<00:01:25.500> great

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
power this certainly has some great

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.590 
power this certainly has some great
power<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.159> terms<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.820> performance<00:01:27.210> you're

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
power in terms of performance you're

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660 
power in terms of performance you're
looking<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:27.930> at<00:01:28.020> 1.7<00:01:28.680> gigahertz<00:01:28.979> dual-core

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
looking at at 1.7 gigahertz dual-core

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.569 
looking at at 1.7 gigahertz dual-core
cortex<00:01:30.710> a15<00:01:32.630> X<00:01:33.630> knows<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.409> believe<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> 5250

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.120 
cortex a15 X knows I believe a 5250
processor<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.500> definitely<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> be

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
processor so it's definitely going to be

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.399 
processor so it's definitely going to be
speedy<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:39.030> doing<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.689> little<00:01:39.869> bit<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.140> tour
