00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
the driveway is from inside the computer

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.590 
the driveway is from inside the computer
so<00:01:07.330> i<00:01:07.390> can<00:01:07.630> actually<00:01:08.560> put<00:01:08.979> in<00:01:09.100> some<00:01:09.369> of<00:01:09.490> my<00:01:09.729> what

so i can actually put in some of my what

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.149 
so i can actually put in some of my what
according<00:01:10.840> components<00:01:11.560> without<00:01:11.619> having<00:01:12.070> to

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
according components without having to

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.060 
according components without having to
struggle<00:01:12.369> floor<00:01:12.970> i'm<00:01:13.119> space<00:01:13.509> inside<00:01:13.990> so<00:01:14.830> on

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
struggle floor i'm space inside so on

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.190 
struggle floor i'm space inside so on
i'll<00:01:15.549> go<00:01:15.670> ahead<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:15.970> I'll<00:01:16.119> open<00:01:16.689> up<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.049> show

i'll go ahead and I'll open up and show
you<00:01:17.259> guys<00:01:17.470> with<00:01:17.740> on<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.979> side<00:01:21.990> okay<00:01:22.990> so<00:01:23.049> this

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
you guys with on the side okay so this

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.200 
you guys with on the side okay so this
is<00:01:23.710> what<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.950> interior<00:01:24.400> looks<00:01:24.610> like<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.180> far

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
is what the interior looks like so far

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.520 
is what the interior looks like so far
so<00:01:26.220> my<00:01:27.220> plan<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.670> mount<00:01:28.479> my<00:01:28.689> our<00:01:28.900> reservoir

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
so my plan is to mount my our reservoir

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.870 
so my plan is to mount my our reservoir
just<00:01:29.799> along<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:29.979> front<00:01:30.280> of<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.400> case<00:01:30.579> there

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
just along the front of the case there

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.440 
just along the front of the case there
and<00:01:31.360> then<00:01:32.170> have<00:01:32.530> my<00:01:32.829> pump<00:01:33.159> sitting<00:01:34.060> on<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
and then have my pump sitting on the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.090 
and then have my pump sitting on the
bottom<00:01:34.689> here<00:01:35.140> i'll<00:01:35.290> probably<00:01:35.530> put<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:35.829> over

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
bottom here i'll probably put it over

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.899 
bottom here i'll probably put it over
the<00:01:36.340> UM<00:01:36.750> rub<00:01:37.750> feet<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.009> beds<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.549> stop<00:01:39.729> any

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
the UM rub feet of the beds to stop any

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.319 
the UM rub feet of the beds to stop any
vibration<00:01:40.540> getting<00:01:40.840> through<00:01:41.170> i<00:01:41.970> put<00:01:42.970> all<00:01:43.149> the

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
vibration getting through i put all the

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.410 
vibration getting through i put all the
UM<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:44.560> power<00:01:44.979> button<00:01:45.369> cables<00:01:45.880> or<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.210> front

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
UM like power button cables or the front

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.870 
UM like power button cables or the front
panel<00:01:46.630> wire<00:01:46.960> cables<00:01:47.860> through<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.640> young

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
panel wire cables through the young

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.789 
panel wire cables through the young
pacify<00:01:49.479> area<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.020> if<00:01:50.140> they<00:01:50.290> can<00:01:50.500> bring<00:01:50.680> them

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
pacify area so if they can bring them

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.620 
pacify area so if they can bring them
around<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.790> they<00:01:51.909> connect<00:01:52.270> up<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.420> the

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
around so they connect up to the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.410 
around so they connect up to the
motherboard<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:54.100> just<00:01:54.670> have<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.850> see<00:01:55.119> if<00:01:55.149> it'll

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
motherboard I just have to see if it'll

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.060 
motherboard I just have to see if it'll
fit<00:01:55.659> because<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.140> graphics<00:01:56.500> card<00:01:56.740> will<00:01:56.950> go

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
fit because the graphics card will go

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.740 
fit because the graphics card will go
pretty<00:01:57.280> much<00:01:57.520> from<00:01:57.729> there<00:01:58.000> all<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.420> way<00:01:58.570> to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
pretty much from there all the way to

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.090 
pretty much from there all the way to
somewhere<00:01:59.439> over<00:01:59.619> here<00:01:59.649> probably<00:02:00.189> so<00:02:01.439> yeah<00:02:02.439> um

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
somewhere over here probably so yeah um

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.209 
somewhere over here probably so yeah um
that's<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:04.509> plan<00:02:04.719> so<00:02:05.020> far<00:02:05.079> I'm<00:02:05.649> just<00:02:05.860> waiting

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
that's the plan so far I'm just waiting

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.900 
that's the plan so far I'm just waiting
on<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.670> parts<00:02:07.030> like<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.360> said<00:02:07.600> on<00:02:08.700> should<00:02:09.700> have

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
on the parts like I said on should have

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.050 
on the parts like I said on should have
my<00:02:10.119> motherboard<00:02:10.780> cpu<00:02:11.140> ram<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.400> power<00:02:12.640> supply

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
my motherboard cpu ram and power supply

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.340 
my motherboard cpu ram and power supply
in<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.420> next<00:02:13.960> um<00:02:14.340> probably<00:02:15.340> three<00:02:15.880> days<00:02:16.350> so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
in the next um probably three days so

graphics<00:02:36.170> card<00:02:36.440> probably<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.069> couple<00:02:37.250> weeks

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
graphics card probably a couple weeks

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.270 
graphics card probably a couple weeks
after<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.200> mainly<00:02:39.200> because<00:02:39.350> it's<00:02:39.800> fourteen

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
after that mainly because it's fourteen

after that mainly because it's fourteen
hundred<00:02:40.459> dollars<00:02:40.970> at<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.690> moment<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.140> that's

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
hundred dollars at the moment and that's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.540 
hundred dollars at the moment and that's
bloody<00:02:43.160> expensive<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:44.120> i<00:02:45.160> have<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.310> wait<00:02:46.520> a

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
bloody expensive so i have to wait a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.870 
bloody expensive so i have to wait a
little<00:02:46.790> bit<00:02:46.970> on<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.400> with<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.700> water

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
little bit on that so with the water

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.490 
little bit on that so with the water
cooling<00:02:50.270> i'm<00:02:50.540> probably<00:02:50.900> going<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.170> put<00:02:51.290> my

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
cooling i'm probably going to put my

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.670 
cooling i'm probably going to put my
pump<00:02:52.430> in<00:02:52.610> there<00:02:52.700> like<00:02:52.910> i<00:02:52.940> said<00:02:53.440> reservoir<00:02:54.440> up

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
pump in there like i said reservoir up

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.600 
pump in there like i said reservoir up
front<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:56.000> i'll<00:02:56.510> have<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.380> hot<00:02:57.830> water<00:02:58.160> coming

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
front so i'll have the hot water coming

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.699 
front so i'll have the hot water coming
out<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.060> radiator<00:02:59.410> into<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.500> reservoir

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
out of the radiator into the reservoir

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.949 
out of the radiator into the reservoir
and<00:03:01.220> then<00:03:01.640> being<00:03:01.820> sucked<00:03:02.120> into<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.450> pump<00:03:02.660> and

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
and then being sucked into the pump and

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.850 
and then being sucked into the pump and
then<00:03:04.209> put<00:03:05.209> through<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.690> cpu<00:03:06.170> graphics<00:03:06.650> card

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
then put through the cpu graphics card

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.290 
then put through the cpu graphics card
back<00:03:07.100> up<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.340> radio<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.730> call<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.150> and

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
back up to the radio to call it and

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.490 
back up to the radio to call it and
that'll<00:03:09.080> complete<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.860> loop<00:03:10.040> pretty<00:03:10.459> much

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
that'll complete the loop pretty much

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.580 
that'll complete the loop pretty much
i'll<00:03:12.500> be<00:03:12.830> taking<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.660> SSD<00:03:14.660> out<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.350> my

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
i'll be taking the SSD out of my

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.350 
i'll be taking the SSD out of my
alienware<00:03:16.269> laptop<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:18.459> putting<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.610> in<00:03:19.819> there

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
alienware laptop and putting it in there

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.180 
alienware laptop and putting it in there
for<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.780> main<00:03:20.989> boot<00:03:21.260> drive<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:22.010> then<00:03:22.069> i'll

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
for the main boot drive and then i'll

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.280 
for the main boot drive and then i'll
just<00:03:22.400> keep<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:22.790> storage<00:03:23.329> drive<00:03:23.600> antique

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
just keep that storage drive antique

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.140 
just keep that storage drive antique
stores<00:03:24.590> job<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.190> shouldn't<00:03:25.489> be<00:03:25.579> enough<00:03:25.910> for

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
stores job that shouldn't be enough for

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.360 
stores job that shouldn't be enough for
now<00:03:26.209> if<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.230> need<00:03:27.380> anything<00:03:27.620> else<00:03:27.860> there's<00:03:28.280> a

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
now if I need anything else there's a

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.310 
now if I need anything else there's a
place<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.420> mount<00:03:29.540> two<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:29.959> half<00:03:30.079> inch

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
place to mount two and a half inch

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.319 
place to mount two and a half inch
drives<00:03:30.650> along<00:03:31.130> there<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.940> think<00:03:32.180> there's

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
drives along there and I think there's

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.850 
drives along there and I think there's
one<00:03:32.360> along<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.840> bottom<00:03:33.019> if<00:03:33.260> it'll<00:03:33.500> fit<00:03:33.650> with

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
one along the bottom if it'll fit with

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.900 
one along the bottom if it'll fit with
the<00:03:34.010> pump<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.400> it<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.829> that's<00:03:37.220> pretty<00:03:37.670> much<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
the pump in it so that's pretty much the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.350 
the pump in it so that's pretty much the
plan<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:38.480> far<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.910> make<00:03:40.910> another<00:03:41.120> video

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
plan so far and I make another video

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.910 
plan so far and I make another video
when<00:03:41.840> parts<00:03:42.709> arrive<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:43.810> I've<00:03:44.810> also<00:03:44.989> recycle

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
when parts arrive so I've also recycle

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.460 
when parts arrive so I've also recycle
the<00:03:46.209> default<00:03:47.209> case<00:03:47.480> fans<00:03:47.840> just<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.170> ones<00:03:48.320> that

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
the default case fans just the ones that

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.440 
the default case fans just the ones that
came<00:03:48.650> with<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:48.859> I<00:03:49.130> just<00:03:49.850> put<00:03:50.030> them<00:03:50.180> at<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.299> top

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
came with it I just put them at the top

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.720 
came with it I just put them at the top
here<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.320> there<00:03:51.950> will<00:03:52.100> be<00:03:52.130> use<00:03:52.459> for<00:03:52.489> the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
here so there will be use for the

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.910 
here so there will be use for the
radiator<00:03:53.209> harm<00:03:53.510> I'm<00:03:54.290> considering<00:03:54.859> getting

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
radiator harm I'm considering getting

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.860 
radiator harm I'm considering getting
some<00:03:55.220> new<00:03:55.370> ones<00:03:55.579> just<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.329> create<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.720> little

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
some new ones just to create a little

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.930 
some new ones just to create a little
bit<00:03:57.049> more<00:03:57.140> air<00:03:57.350> for<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:57.709> but<00:03:57.859> we'll<00:03:58.760> see<00:03:58.910> how

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
bit more air for it but we'll see how

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.340 
bit more air for it but we'll see how
these<00:03:59.209> ones<00:03:59.420> doing<00:03:59.660> if<00:03:59.900> they're<00:04:00.079> all<00:04:00.170> right

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
these ones doing if they're all right

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.449 
these ones doing if they're all right
off<00:04:00.500> or<00:04:00.650> they<00:04:00.709> just<00:04:00.739> keep<00:04:01.070> them<00:04:01.250> because

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
off or they just keep them because

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.599 
off or they just keep them because
they're<00:04:01.640> they're<00:04:01.970> pretty<00:04:02.150> nice<00:04:02.329> fan<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.019> I

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
they're they're pretty nice fan so I

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.319 
they're they're pretty nice fan so I
don't<00:04:04.609> see<00:04:04.760> why<00:04:04.880> I'd<00:04:04.970> want<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.209> replace<00:04:05.450> them

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
don't see why I'd want to replace them

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.150 
don't see why I'd want to replace them
so<00:04:08.329> far<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.630> like<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.840> case<00:04:09.109> a<00:04:09.140> lot<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.590> SAP<00:04:09.829> use

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
so far I like the case a lot of SAP use

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.910 
so far I like the case a lot of SAP use
it<00:04:10.840> but<00:04:11.840> my<00:04:11.989> only<00:04:12.109> real<00:04:12.320> complaint<00:04:12.350> is<00:04:12.650> because

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
it but my only real complaint is because

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.890 
it but my only real complaint is because
these<00:04:13.100> arm<00:04:13.400> handles<00:04:14.799> a<00:04:15.799> little<00:04:16.250> bit<00:04:16.340> flexible

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
these arm handles a little bit flexible

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.080 
these arm handles a little bit flexible
it<00:04:17.900> tends<00:04:18.229> to<00:04:18.410> on<00:04:18.769> rock<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.519> little<00:04:19.760> bit<00:04:19.970> the

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
it tends to on rock a little bit the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.990 
it tends to on rock a little bit the
case<00:04:20.269> so<00:04:20.979> when<00:04:21.979> I<00:04:22.010> rock<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.460> case<00:04:22.700> it<00:04:22.970> just

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
case so when I rock the case it just

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.500 
case so when I rock the case it just
makes<00:04:23.660> a<00:04:23.750> little<00:04:23.870> bit<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.110> noise<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:24.910> it<00:04:25.910> could

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
makes a little bit of noise and it could

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.529 
makes a little bit of noise and it could
just<00:04:26.690> be<00:04:26.810> that<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.169> bottom<00:04:27.440> ones<00:04:28.390> could<00:04:29.390> be

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
just be that the bottom ones could be

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.999 
just be that the bottom ones could be
more<00:04:29.690> solid<00:04:30.140> in<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.470> next<00:04:31.190> version<00:04:31.400> of<00:04:31.760> the

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
more solid in the next version of the

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.999 
more solid in the next version of the
case<00:04:32.159> the<00:04:32.369> BitFenix<00:04:32.610> makes<00:04:33.889> running<00:04:34.889> out<00:04:34.949> of

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
case the BitFenix makes running out of

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.439 
case the BitFenix makes running out of
stock<00:04:35.219> the<00:04:35.339> case<00:04:35.520> which<00:04:35.759> set<00:04:35.939> the<00:04:36.029> standard

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
stock the case which set the standard

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.820 
stock the case which set the standard
