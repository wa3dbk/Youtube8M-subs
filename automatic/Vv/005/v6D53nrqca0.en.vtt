have lots of stuff to say about so yeah

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.629 
have lots of stuff to say about so yeah
so<00:05:31.780> I<00:05:31.810> need<00:05:31.990> another<00:05:32.080> break<00:05:32.530> because<00:05:32.830> that<00:05:33.520> was

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
so I need another break because that was

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.640 
so I need another break because that was
freaking<00:05:33.970> long<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.900> other<00:05:35.050> shelf<00:05:35.380> is

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
freaking long the other shelf is

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.629 
freaking long the other shelf is
considerably<00:05:36.250> smaller<00:05:36.370> so<00:05:36.940> part<00:05:37.330> three<00:05:37.810> I

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
considerably smaller so part three I

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.890 
considerably smaller so part three I
really<00:05:39.639> thought<00:05:40.030> I<00:05:40.090> could<00:05:40.150> cram<00:05:40.449> it<00:05:40.570> into<00:05:40.750> two

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
really thought I could cram it into two

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.020 
really thought I could cram it into two
parts<00:05:41.080> but<00:05:41.349> apparently<00:05:41.680> not

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
parts but apparently not

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.850 
parts but apparently not
part<00:05:43.449> three<00:05:43.690> will<00:05:43.810> be<00:05:43.930> considerably<00:05:44.440> shorter

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
part three will be considerably shorter

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.010 
part three will be considerably shorter
