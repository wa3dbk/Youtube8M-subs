you can see the price Peaks for at
different<00:06:35.030> times<00:06:35.270> but<00:06:35.509> really<00:06:35.870> I<00:06:35.900> just<00:06:36.229> wanted

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
different times but really I just wanted

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.020 
different times but really I just wanted
to<00:06:36.560> show<00:06:36.710> what<00:06:36.860> promotions<00:06:37.340> like<00:06:37.400> this<00:06:37.669> can<00:06:37.849> do

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
to show what promotions like this can do

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.300 
to show what promotions like this can do

unassigned the times to the experience

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.649 
unassigned the times to the experience
rate<00:06:42.710> because<00:06:43.130> most<00:06:43.430> likely<00:06:43.820> people<00:06:44.030> would<00:06:44.449> be

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
rate because most likely people would be

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:47.200 
rate because most likely people would be

using this aura to get their x to exp
way<00:06:47.930> in<00:06:48.050> the<00:06:48.169> end<00:06:48.349> it<00:06:48.590> doesn't<00:06:48.949> really<00:06:49.039> matter

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
way in the end it doesn't really matter

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.480 
way in the end it doesn't really matter
as<00:06:49.699> you<00:06:50.330> can<00:06:50.479> see<00:06:50.750> the<00:06:51.289> efficiency<00:06:51.740> value<00:06:52.280> is

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
as you can see the efficiency value is

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.640 
as you can see the efficiency value is
five<00:06:52.880> million<00:06:53.210> one<00:06:53.719> hundred<00:06:54.020> thirty<00:06:54.199> thousand

four hundred GP per hour so pretty much
