00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.320 
doing anyway so I give him hammer but
he's<00:04:16.380> really<00:04:16.590> craft<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.669> so<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.090> was<00:04:18.180> trying

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
he's really craft so and so I was trying

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.130 
he's really craft so and so I was trying
to<00:04:18.359> get<00:04:18.510> with<00:04:18.630> him<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.970> that's<00:04:21.720> pretty<00:04:21.930> much<00:04:22.049> it

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
to get with him so that's pretty much it

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.129 
to get with him so that's pretty much it
he's

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
he's

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.719 
he's
good<00:04:23.229> player<00:04:23.409> he's<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.680> bit<00:04:23.919> older<00:04:24.310> thought<00:04:24.550> he

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
good player he's a bit older thought he

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.640 
good player he's a bit older thought he
saw<00:04:24.939> they<00:04:25.300> didn't<00:04:25.749> like<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.080> one<00:04:26.139> as<00:04:26.469> i<00:04:26.499> told

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
saw they didn't like that one as i told

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.969 
saw they didn't like that one as i told
you<00:04:27.009> so<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.789> think<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.210> bumped<00:04:28.719> that<00:04:28.840> up<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.590> about

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
you so I think I bumped that up to about

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.570 
you so I think I bumped that up to about
seven<00:04:30.849> I<00:04:31.169> go<00:04:32.169> into<00:04:32.289> loan<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.740> see<00:04:32.919> but<00:04:33.069> I<00:04:33.099> really

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
seven I go into loan to see but I really

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.820 
seven I go into loan to see but I really
don't<00:04:33.729> want<00:04:33.879> to<00:04:33.969> do<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.020> go<00:04:35.199> and<00:04:35.229> I<00:04:35.529> give

think in the end of it because that's

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.459 
think in the end of it because that's
what<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.039> kind<00:04:42.490> of<00:04:42.639> between<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.259> a
