in<00:00:02.580> 1973<00:00:03.860> scientists<00:00:04.860> discovered<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:05.400> we

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
in 1973 scientists discovered that we

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.639 
in 1973 scientists discovered that we
have<00:00:05.670> specific<00:00:06.299> receptors<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:07.049> our<00:00:07.109> brain<00:00:07.170> for

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
have specific receptors in our brain for

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.820 
have specific receptors in our brain for
opiate<00:00:08.190> drugs<00:00:08.549> like<00:00:08.790> heroin<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.389> morphine

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
opiate drugs like heroin and morphine

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.070 
opiate drugs like heroin and morphine
since<00:00:10.830> we<00:00:11.190> didn't<00:00:11.429> involve<00:00:11.700> shooting<00:00:12.509> up<00:00:12.809> it

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
since we didn't involve shooting up it

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.390 
since we didn't involve shooting up it
stood<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.620> reason<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.980> there<00:00:14.099> were<00:00:14.190> natural

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
stood to reason and there were natural

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400 
stood to reason and there were natural
compounds<00:00:15.269> produced<00:00:15.630> by<00:00:15.809> our<00:00:15.839> bodies<00:00:15.990> that

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
compounds produced by our bodies that

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.769 
compounds produced by our bodies that
fit<00:00:16.650> into<00:00:16.920> those<00:00:17.279> receptors<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.449> we<00:00:18.600> went

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
fit into those receptors so we went

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.269 
fit into those receptors so we went
looking<00:00:18.930> discovered<00:00:19.619> them<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.770> named<00:00:20.070> them

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
looking discovered them and named them

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.179 
looking discovered them and named them
endogenous<00:00:21.090> morphine's<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:22.080> endorphins<00:00:22.830> for

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
endogenous morphine's or endorphins for

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.550 
endogenous morphine's or endorphins for
short<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.699> endorphins<00:00:24.689> are<00:00:24.990> good<00:00:25.170> there<00:00:25.439> are

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
short and endorphins are good there are

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.009 
short and endorphins are good there are
natural<00:00:26.100> pain<00:00:26.400> relievers<00:00:26.939> released<00:00:27.869> during

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
natural pain relievers released during

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.019 
natural pain relievers released during
exercise<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.890> consumption<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.400> spicy<00:00:29.730> food

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
exercise to consumption of spicy food

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.310 
exercise to consumption of spicy food
and<00:00:30.330> orgasm

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and orgasm

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.950 
and orgasm
so<00:00:31.610> there<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:32.640> healthier<00:00:33.210> ways<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.660> stimulate

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
so there are healthier ways to stimulate

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.840 
so there are healthier ways to stimulate
these<00:00:34.410> receptors<00:00:34.980> than<00:00:35.160> shooting<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.820> heroin

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
these receptors than shooting up heroin

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.799 
these receptors than shooting up heroin
in<00:00:37.219> 1990<00:00:38.219> scientists<00:00:39.210> discovered<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.750> we

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
in 1990 scientists discovered that we
