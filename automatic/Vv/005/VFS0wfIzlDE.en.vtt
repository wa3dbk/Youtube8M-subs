 Enigma is not yours but maybe not as 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.710
 full body 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.110
 buff will help get immortals

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.410
 wait for international in all weapons link 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.410
 in the video description 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.730
 Hello dear friends, holy and with you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.590
 today i want to tell you how 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.529
 all the same zagankat middle or middle 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.330
 line and why it needs to be done here can 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.489
 only be one problem if meeder 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.070
 bad and you do not understand when you 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.260
 come to the gang and so why do you need 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.420
 gang in mid and everything is simple the more 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.450
 will be able to make your initial game leader 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.640
 so much easier then you will personally play 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.140
 I think that the middleman needs to gank at least 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.780
 twice to 5 minutes and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.360
 so the first gang is a gun in smoke 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.699
 second gang &amp; the gang at night you can 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.199
 Smoke and can be without you are sure that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.050
 the enemy does not put wards 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.550
 so how do you need to gank mid to start 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.739
 not wearing on 2 3 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.600
 when you already got the level playing for 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.570
 support then with the second support 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.549
 can go and kill the enemy mider with 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.040
 poppies but you must warn your 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.049
 shag so that he does not push in line of enemies 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.360
 from the goods you profitable when the enemy 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.430
 coming down from your high ground as 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.840
 Only his foot on the river you can 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.840
 boldly go kill 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.680
 well you killed the enemy miden but in 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.790
 this moment you left your carry 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.160
 which will be put on the enemy 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.280
 hardliner so run back to 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.740
 our carry and now it's 4 minutes and 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.290
 night came gave a review of all the characters 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.830
 decreased and became about 800 and it was 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.410
 1800 so you just run-run again 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.540
 speak enemy midie night mider 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.060
 as vulnerable as possible so kill him 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.930
 it will be much easier provided he 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.360
 can't see you 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.980
 also having more stan and dyuibla 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.200
 the leader gets very easily 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.360
 many know that the step is very hard 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.710
 miller but what will he do if he will 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.730
 gank ppd 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.950
 at leshrak on 1 blue about 400 75 hp 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.790
 think yourself what they can do with it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.040
 two heroes 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.530
 one of which has stand but here 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.840
 example ring and place and terror she 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.390
 will inflict a lot on the enemy hero 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.250
 damage stronger renew enemy 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.650
 the easier it will be for you to win the game 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.900
 example is now very rarely seen 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.200
 on the professional scene like some 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.320
 video kills another 11 practically in 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.410
 In all cases, supports gangut mid they 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.330
 do not once and minion 34 because they 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.030
 understand that if two enemy midor 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.030
 so nothing good it will not 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.120
 but thats all dear friends on this 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.120

 play and don't know how to gank mid layt 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.030
