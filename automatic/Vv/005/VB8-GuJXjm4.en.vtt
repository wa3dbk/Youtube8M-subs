00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.180
 and now we need the dessert something 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.000
 very easy 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.650
 and good is the idea of ​​doing it with mango 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.080
 because with good handle for the handle and 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.880
 the season starts and we find mango 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.460
 Well, practically in every corner I 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.170
 I'm a super fan of the mango and well 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.840
 we found some good manila handles 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.849
 well the successes in each corner and it's worth 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.429
 it's a pity that they buy it and well 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.020
 coincided a way to give fruits or 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.180
 vegetables to the family can be the 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.370
 dessert and it's a good choice for the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.920
 base in this post then one more way 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.180
 light then omitting one of the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.879
 ingredients behind the milk 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.399
 condensed and replacing it the best with 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.629
 some sugar substitute now 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.070
 well if you want to make the recipe 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.559
 traditional because we have children at home 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.969
 this is the option and also if you do not 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.590
 like mango can do it with because 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.809
 another fruit with strawberries with sasha blackberries 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.820
 with raspberries is great but take 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.920
 note because we are going to see the ingredients 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.100
 It looks like mango jelly 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.629
 need 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.629
 three cups of whipping cream 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.170
 one and a half cans of condensed milk 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.350
 600 grams of natural mango pulp 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.700
 four envelopes of grenadine hydrated in 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.670
 half a cup of water and dissolved in a bath 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.549
 Mary 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.799
 and well then to decorate two hands just 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.689
 the extra pulp to be able to decorate 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.759
 and now we are ready with these 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.500
 ingredients make gelatin since I already 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.200
 we have dominated is something very simple 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.090
 let's put here in the blender 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.909
 practically all the ingredients do not 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.680
 also with a spatula to help us 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:51.759
 let's put the whipping cream here 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:55.210
 which is the cream that is not sweetened is 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.920
 the cream they sell to beat well says 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.740
 cream to beat where if you 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.350
 add the best icing sugar and the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.920
 we put the blender to fluff 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.410
 that can be beaten and will express this 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.190
 cream they sell it in a boat in a pot of 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.200
 cardboard and it's with the red sra 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.610
 So, well, the rest are tips 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.130
 originally asked how much cream 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.420
 to beat because I already explained the way 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.030
 to also put the condensed milk 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.680
 the mango only the pulp 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.469
 please 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.109
 we peel it and we're going to put the cuff 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.819
 we are already full the blender we will go 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.290
 when little by little because we put a 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:41.080
 little more but it does not matter we're going to 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.620
 cover well with a rag to this one 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.920
 we started to beat 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.620
 very well let's leave it there 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.170
 that his movies when perfectly well and 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.180
 while we're going to hydrate our big 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.090
 team remember that for any 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.400
 gelatine you always have to have the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.170
 grenetina to set if not then not 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.200
 is going to curdle and well the grenetina 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.700
 always have to go touch and dissolve 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.069
 we have part of greece we have the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.300
 grenetina which is the powder that the 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.610
 We generally use the program here 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.959
 because you can generally 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.060
 find with great ease in the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.310
 then good supermarket then let's go 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.000
 here use the agrede they have everything 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.000
 we are going to 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.020
 the meat has powder with iker water 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.060
 of gelatin plus the thin not so hard 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.500
 then what they are going to do is occupy 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.840
 only two to three envelopes of 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.640
 grenetina if they want a gelatin a 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.220
 little firmer then we will occupy 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.750
 the four envelopes to see in each only 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.910
 has seven grams for people who 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.010
 they buy the grenetina in bulk every single 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.550
 It has approximately seven grams 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.440
 and well then go here to moisturize the 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.170
 We will take 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.820
 to the microwave oven around about 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.070
 30 seconds approximately nothing more to 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.500
 that gets hot that dissolves if not 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.690
 they have a good microwave oven 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.000
 of course what they can do is do it 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.950
 to bain-marie and well then let's go 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.680
 serving while you think 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.460
 our bean caldillo and I already 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.820
 we have here very listy that 0 this 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:17.850
 spectacular is not not seen this is 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.070
 great to see nothing else has a 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.690
 Chile pasilla flavor that is very 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.510
 all right 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.250
 I'm making my mouth water and 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.960
 we have of course there the garrison 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.650
 that's good so let's put up the 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.880
 final that we already have our caldillo and 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.700
 cabbage 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.560
 with noodles will only pay the 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.690
 caldillo 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.030
 and then put it on the table 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.570
 presentation together with your garnishes 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.310

 Well, even today 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:23.670
 hungry we are going here to put another 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:25.770

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.140
 if they want also as I told them 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.920
 can add a little bit of potato or 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:34.650
 of planting of course carnita and 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.050

 put a little leaf that we have here 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.560
 but it may be incidentally it can be 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.640
 what you have at home 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.680
 always stirred to give a little 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.040
 sight let's go now so add the 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.750
 grenetina 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.400
 blender running to me always me 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.220
 like it's working the blender 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.190
 so that we are going to be lumps of the 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.880
 let's add the 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.880
 there is 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.020
 our cover we are going to leave them two 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.020
 minutes 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.440
 after green 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.330
 a jelly mold we have here 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.120
 Rose mold for gelatin this 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.920
 it works very well of gelatin also what 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.560
 can do well then in a 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.390
 refractory video or else in 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.370
 a cake mold you can always 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.380
 put some spray oil for 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.100
 make it much easier to unmold and 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.670
 now if we go 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.540
 pour this mango mixture that is 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:44.080
 well exquisite 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.660
 well exquisite is our mixture to 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.750
 show nothing else what a delight we're going here 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.430
 to pour our gelatin some 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.750
 taps 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.860
 so that we stay even 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:00.800
 this list let's give it a few taps 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.810
 a few laps a few strokes and I the 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.160
 I take the navigator for two hours 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.930
 until it completely fills up with this 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.580
 firm and with this now if we go 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.990
 straight to the in this presentation for 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.160
 see how were his riquísimos technical 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.160
 to share
