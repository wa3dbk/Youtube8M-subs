00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
at the woodland I thought it would be a

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.140 
at the woodland I thought it would be a
bit<00:04:36.540> more<00:04:36.720> just<00:04:37.500> red<00:04:37.920> dirt<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.400> not<00:04:38.910> much

growing so it's it's lushness that was a
surprise<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.920> thought<00:04:44.220> it<00:04:44.340> would<00:04:44.460> be<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:45.150> arid

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540
