00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
planning on getting into the series this

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.270 
planning on getting into the series this
is<00:01:36.390> probably<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.990> worst<00:01:37.259> chapter<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.159> get

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
is probably the worst chapter to get

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.550 
is probably the worst chapter to get
involved<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> honestly<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.170> artwork

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
involved in and honestly the artwork

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.200 
involved in and honestly the artwork
really<00:01:40.920> wasn't<00:01:41.189> anything<00:01:41.369> that's<00:01:41.700> special

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
really wasn't anything that's special

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.609 
really wasn't anything that's special
and<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.479> lot<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.899> has<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.380> with<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
and a lot of that has to do with the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.230 
and a lot of that has to do with the
fact<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.159> were<00:01:44.220> set<00:01:44.549> within<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.909> big

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
fact that they were set within this big

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.899 
fact that they were set within this big
white<00:01:45.600> world<00:01:45.920> obito<00:01:46.920> himself<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.549> pretty<00:01:47.759> much

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
what it's really not an awful chapter in

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.670 
what it's really not an awful chapter in
fact<00:02:29.090> most<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.570> dialogue<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.080> pretty<00:02:30.470> well

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
fact most of the dialogue is pretty well

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.640 
fact most of the dialogue is pretty well
written<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.730> just<00:02:32.060> not<00:02:32.300> all<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.840> exciting

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
written it's just not all that exciting

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.770 
written it's just not all that exciting
or<00:02:33.770> compelling<00:02:34.220> no<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:35.209> on<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.570> upside

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
or compelling no but on the upside

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.960 
or compelling no but on the upside
hopefully<00:02:36.770> things<00:02:36.980> might<00:02:37.280> pick<00:02:37.459> up<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.700> little

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
hopefully things might pick up a little

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.520 
hopefully things might pick up a little
bit<00:02:38.090> more<00:02:38.270> next<00:02:38.510> week<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.900> we'll<00:02:38.989> finally<00:02:39.410> get

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
you brought up the artwork Cory because

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.010 
you brought up the artwork Cory because
I<00:02:45.920> thought<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.400> was<00:02:46.489> well<00:02:46.790> drawn<00:02:47.239> but<00:02:47.780> also

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
I thought it was well drawn but also

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.930 
I thought it was well drawn but also
like<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> angles<00:02:48.950> they<00:02:49.070> used<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.550> was<00:02:49.640> just<00:02:49.820> a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
like the angles they used it was just a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.540 
like the angles they used it was just a
ton<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.209> like<00:02:50.480> close-ups<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.350> then<00:02:51.800> like<00:02:52.010> you

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
ton of like close-ups and then like you

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.890 
ton of like close-ups and then like you
see<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.820> over<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.150> shoulder<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.450> them<00:02:53.630> talking

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
see it over the shoulder of them talking

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.360 
see it over the shoulder of them talking
and<00:02:54.200> then<00:02:54.320> like<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.650> mid<00:02:54.920> shot<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.280> the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
and then like a mid shot of the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.199 
and then like a mid shot of the
characters<00:02:55.700> are<00:02:55.730> standing<00:02:56.090> there<00:02:56.180> thinking

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
characters are standing there thinking

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.449 
characters are standing there thinking
and<00:02:56.720> dot<00:02:56.870> dot<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.470> just<00:02:57.739> thought<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.040> artwork

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
and dot dot I just thought the artwork

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.990 
and dot dot I just thought the artwork
was<00:02:58.640> kind<00:02:58.850> of<00:02:58.910> like<00:02:59.090> good<00:03:00.020> but<00:03:00.680> uninspired<00:03:01.580> I

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
was kind of like good but uninspired I

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.820 
was kind of like good but uninspired I
mean<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.270> didn't<00:03:02.630> see<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.020> emotion<00:03:03.560> on<00:03:03.650> those

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
mean I didn't see the emotion on those

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.050 
mean I didn't see the emotion on those
characters<00:03:04.370> when<00:03:04.580> they're<00:03:04.670> talking<00:03:04.850> about

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
characters when they're talking about

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.640 
characters when they're talking about
all<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.390> shit<00:03:05.420> but<00:03:06.110> maybe<00:03:06.260> that's<00:03:06.440> kind<00:03:06.500> of

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
all the shit but maybe that's kind of

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.050 
all the shit but maybe that's kind of
what<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.799> flashbacks<00:03:07.459> are<00:03:07.670> for<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:07.880> guess

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
what the flashbacks are for I guess

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.490 
what the flashbacks are for I guess
you're<00:03:08.330> supposed<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.630> live<00:03:08.989> those<00:03:09.200> moments

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
you're supposed to live those moments

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.500 
you're supposed to live those moments
with<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.860> characters<00:03:10.280> but<00:03:10.790> fucking<00:03:11.090> obito

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
with the characters but fucking obito

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.539
