00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.519
 to throw in the game 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.519

 Piet has been around too long 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.719
 but on the cupboard 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.370
 in possession of the ball without a victory 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.979
 it is asked for a bill 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.650

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.039
 and the acceleration 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.039
 peeters cd v 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.919

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.740
 a chain collision occurred 

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:06.369
 keating sports matters 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:09.369

 2 goals to stop 7 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:17.710

 jeroen the field 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.590

 it is not in the competition that movies are on my skin 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.990
 it in the country 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.150
 a good rebound 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.150
 this ball 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.169
 I am not fifteen parties 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.889

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.289
 it's the end 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:03.899
 for the public 

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:06.899
 we are entering the last minute 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:11.899
 but on lucas 

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:13.319
 search for a point of contact 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:15.319
 another six seconds on the shovel village 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:17.300
 Coopers must shoot 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.469
 pilot nature 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:19.719
 for pkc 

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:22.099
 and that should get along wim scholtmeijer 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:23.529
 feedback is important 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:26.529
 the 35 seconds this ball needs the tire 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.580
