00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:05.580
 But again, it is clear from Justus Frantz Toni Finsterbusch here in 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.340
 Mainaschaff cannons board 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.340
 for three weeks neither in which Saarow moz nor 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.979
 Klack ins or so what it is then let my team 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.119
 and here as a whole you have to printz any of them 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.050
 Raw materials use up to the 40 Altenberge the ATR and on all grounds 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:27.279
 Gravity or just ten animals without Strasser advisable 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.060
 but I do that has influence there 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.400
 the words that was such a percent just just before Mickelson 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.660
 so duck family cannon 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.660
 That's about how you can make them roll too long 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.190
 our percent here is next to Steube 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860
 and around 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.950
 At the front comes other things, a stone plate mixes rows 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.730
 or whatever I can do anywhere you want 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.190
 for the locations were 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.770
 The main thing is half blocked and also Mato flat or something 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.940
 reinmachen 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.570
 Number of locations flies parents rather high 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.700
 and the comedy 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.530
 there are a block Â»water protruding 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.620
 or just water again 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.620
 that's what he still flows here and then 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.270
 and 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.080
 yes that would be in principle that's just ten percent during that 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.200
 their power 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.760
 but not on this Los Angeles 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.560
 We will not break anything 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.080
 and 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.380
 above also the topics 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.380
 which then places on these locations and with an unknown destination 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.770
 read that 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.850
 Canton 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.850
 NanoGram make 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
 Columnist and ultimately put pressure 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.580
 Gazprom Neft presentation 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.530
 since came is to be assumed 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.249
 that will do too 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:16.189
 Targeting in Athens that's OK to do so and kindled kid 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.429
 want 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:20.840
 and 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.919
 Yes exactly 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.919
 now allow me two more heads 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:34.299
 2 Meyer built a new one and I also take Capcom 2 ourselves 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.419
 from that here 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.419
 It is hoped to use that down with this one above 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.339
 then put up with their animals but do not stop at the water source village 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.299
 2 percent after it's clear he's turning in what's called 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.499
 The next one is already there, but it does not hurt 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.839
 and it is also the principle of this that is so practice 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.579
 There was no discussion but then also the seven largest German had that 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.539
 we will be hurled title forward 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.729
 we are three looking for the first rear 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:07.179
 and then the front wheel 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:08.839
 Kadlec 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.549
 the newspaper would only have been back at home or some sort of minister 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.299
 a bit broken 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.879
 and yes you can do it to a much greater extent SWO this finally 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.539
 is now built here normal 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.539
 "We're seven runners now 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.379
 "That's got to be tough if it's even bigger, that's seven runs with it 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.419
 be with the award and beautiful mystery Fourth install because you 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.419
 that will be such a signal and nine-year-old too weak Red 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.789
 maybe because the team is just off 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.739
 and the Else Somoza small park of which you could do it again 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:52.499
 and so it's pretty destructive we could of course 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.459
 even if her parents like it a lot, too 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.909
 put Saturn Canon stacked on top of each other 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.159
 and 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.719
 yes that's stuff today 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:03.840
 No and 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.569
 that's it already and here are not at first
