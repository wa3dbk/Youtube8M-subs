00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.280
 of the opportunity 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.380
 while the two 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.870
 so they are 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.000
 new 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.000
 to remember you well I love 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.190
 in this world he said to increase 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.920
 but not 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.129
 and personally if I also play each 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.129
 side 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.130
 of forward playmaker on the way 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.590
 where he could play all the equipment that 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.190
 I was so 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.190
 actually 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.080
 It has cost a bit but I think that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.250
 level go up a little despite 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.110
 that is lost in Iquique but I think that 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.090
 it can be quite good 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.090
 and I think the water week 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.970
 only when 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.970
 they talk a little 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
 it's going to be very hard 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.560
 which digital so we expected 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.240
 we show 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.240
 with the team that we are companies 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.710
 when you always lose crisis in everything 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.600
 what before so 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.869
 the only thing I can say that I finish it 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.869
 never 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.270
 this is the subject of it being
