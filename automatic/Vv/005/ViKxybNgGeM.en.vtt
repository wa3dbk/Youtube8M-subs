sad<00:01:30.090> wonder<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.320> search

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
sad wonder if we can actually search

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.469 
sad wonder if we can actually search
other<00:01:31.860> clans<00:01:32.280> um<00:01:34.189> Bob<00:01:35.210> can<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.299> search
