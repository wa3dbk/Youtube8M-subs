have the coins up here you would have

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.789

all letter coins all number coins or all

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.380 
all letter coins all number coins or all
color<00:01:32.100> coins<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.640> could<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> soap

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
color coins you could do it on the soap

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.109 
color coins you could do it on the soap
board<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> put<00:01:34.680> them<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.490> metal<00:01:35.970> cookie

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
board but I put them on a metal cookie

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.520 
board but I put them on a metal cookie
sheet<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.600> they're<00:01:36.810> done<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.049> magnets

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
sheet because they're done with magnets

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.719 
sheet because they're done with magnets
I<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.920> works<00:01:38.159> better<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.579> children

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I think that works better for children

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.240 
I think that works better for children
when<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.060> come<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.360> remove<00:01:39.600> items<00:01:40.250> magnets

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
when they come to remove items magnets

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.039 
when they come to remove items magnets
are<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:42.030> easier<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.479> down<00:01:42.540> then

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
are much more easier to take down then

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.170 
are much more easier to take down then
Salk<00:01:43.740> Road<00:01:44.009> items<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.400> a<00:01:44.430> felt<00:01:44.729> board<00:01:44.909> because

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
Salk Road items to a felt board because
