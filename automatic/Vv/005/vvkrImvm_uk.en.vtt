going to add a gallon of distilled water

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.960 
going to add a gallon of distilled water
it<00:00:24.210> must<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.869> distilled<00:00:25.320> if<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.430> use<00:00:26.550> regular

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
it must be distilled if you use regular

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.359 
it must be distilled if you use regular
water<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> corrosive<00:00:28.439> agent<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.279> may

water<00:00:41.510> I'm<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> add<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> gallon<00:00:43.350> of

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
water I'm going to add a gallon of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.410 
water I'm going to add a gallon of
distilled<00:00:43.590> water<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.399> after<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.059> I'm<00:00:45.300> going

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
distilled water and after this I'm going

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.200 
distilled water and after this I'm going
to<00:00:45.480> add<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.840> mercedes-benz<00:00:46.320> coolant<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:48.059> new

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
to add the mercedes-benz coolant the new

00:00:48.210 --> 00:01:06.080 
to add the mercedes-benz coolant the new
formula<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.140> blue<00:00:49.350> color<00:01:04.640> there's<00:01:05.640> there

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
formula is the blue color there's there

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.890 
formula is the blue color there's there
goes<00:01:06.270> about<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> gallon<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.080> distilled<00:01:07.200> water

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.080 

and<00:01:13.070> I'm<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.250> let<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> coolant

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and I'm going to let the coolant

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.570 
and I'm going to let the coolant
reservoir<00:01:15.150> tank<00:01:15.689> drain<00:01:18.080> tank<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.200> little<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
reservoir tank drain tank a little so I

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:33.080 
reservoir tank drain tank a little so I
can<00:01:20.610> put<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> coolant<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.450> next<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:32.939> we

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
can put the coolant in next and here we

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.480 
can put the coolant in next and here we
have<00:01:33.680> Mercedes<00:01:34.680> Benz<00:01:35.780> anti<00:01:36.780> corrosive

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
have Mercedes Benz anti corrosive

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.429 
have Mercedes Benz anti corrosive
antifreeze<00:01:38.490> agent<00:01:39.290> approved<00:01:40.290> for

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
antifreeze agent approved for

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.420 
antifreeze agent approved for
mercedes-benz<00:01:40.890> vehicles<00:01:42.950> here<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.070> go

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
mercedes-benz vehicles here we go

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.450 
mercedes-benz vehicles here we go
I<00:01:47.810> should<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:48.899> use<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> funnel<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
I should have use the funnel but you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:59.380 
I should have use the funnel but you
know<00:01:50.549> what<00:01:50.700> I'm<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> use<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> funnel

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:10.430 

there<00:02:00.390> goes<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> funnel<00:02:08.990> put<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.050> camera

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
there goes the funnel put the camera

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:28.160 
there goes the funnel put the camera
down<00:02:10.470> right<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.280> do<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:27.170> do

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
down right here so I can do it do

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.850 
down right here so I can do it do
apologize<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:30.260> taking<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> little<00:02:31.470> longer<00:02:31.650> than

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
apologize I taking a little longer than

00:02:31.860 --> 00:03:00.940 
apologize I taking a little longer than
usual

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:30.770 

there<00:03:01.950> we<00:03:02.040> go<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:29.280> usually<00:03:29.790> add<00:03:29.940> one<00:03:30.209> gallon<00:03:30.630> of

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
there we go so usually add one gallon of

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.600 
there we go so usually add one gallon of
antifreeze<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.860> one<00:03:32.010> gallon<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.400> distilled

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
antifreeze and one gallon of distilled

00:03:32.610 --> 00:04:35.260 
antifreeze and one gallon of distilled
water<00:03:42.080> that<00:03:43.080> way<00:03:43.230> we<00:03:43.380> have<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> good<00:03:43.739> mixture

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.210 

this<00:04:35.870> process<00:04:36.320> takes<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.620> while<00:04:36.830> you<00:04:37.070> could

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
this process takes a while you could

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.430 
this process takes a while you could
turn<00:04:37.370> on<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.640> car<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:38.840> increase<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:41.440> drainage

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
turn on the car to increase the drainage

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.330 
turn on the car to increase the drainage
process<00:04:43.220> in<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.640> coolant<00:04:43.970> reservoir<00:04:44.090> tank

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
process in the coolant reservoir tank

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.690 
process in the coolant reservoir tank
will<00:04:46.340> go<00:04:46.460> much<00:04:46.640> faster<00:04:48.220> what<00:04:49.220> I'm<00:04:49.310> doing<00:04:49.580> it

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
will go much faster what I'm doing it

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.020 
will go much faster what I'm doing it
with<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:49.880> car<00:04:50.090> off<00:04:50.270> so<00:04:50.600> you<00:04:50.660> can<00:04:50.900> hear<00:04:51.110> me<00:04:55.030> you

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
with the car off so you can hear me you

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:26.220 
with the car off so you can hear me you
only<00:04:56.180> have<00:04:56.360> about<00:04:56.830> quarter<00:04:57.830> left<00:04:58.040> to<00:04:58.160> go

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.750 

this<00:05:26.530> is<00:05:26.710> really<00:05:26.920> good<00:05:27.160> for<00:05:27.340> doing<00:05:27.460> in<00:05:27.670> the

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
this is really good for doing in the

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.540 
this is really good for doing in the
summer<00:05:28.000> months<00:05:28.530> you<00:05:29.530> know<00:05:29.920> when<00:05:30.070> it<00:05:30.190> gets<00:05:30.340> real

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
summer months you know when it gets real

00:05:30.550 --> 00:06:06.150 
summer months you know when it gets real
