00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.950
 I want to welcome him in today's video contribution I want you 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.499
 introduce the team kind of the so-called autofocus Faller 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.409
 What's it all about 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.919
 I faced the challenge of being an athlete the other day 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.550
 should take pictures 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.039
 the one on a long straight and the EKD had moved towards the camera 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:26.640
 Has 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.609
 and the time or the challenge was in it 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.940
 that the athlete gets caught right at a point xy in that way percent 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.949
 had to be with the autofocus second act at this point right and left 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.640
 suddenly there 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.810
 percent 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.660
 Fixed were statically fastened goods 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.060
 so may percent 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.810
 I had to rely on that was not in meters before or meters after that 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.340
 Athlete had to catch but he knows the point where the camera 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.450
 The train would be less directly on the Fendi meter exactly 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.020
 set 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.240
 I solved this with the so-called autofocus trap as the name does 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.790
 already said it is so Dr athlete or the photographed 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.400
 Object moves towards the camera and the moment Wood recognizes the camera 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.710
 Now he is in exactly the right sheep field 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.050
 Now I enjoy 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.350
 a really great thing you actually have nothing more to do as a photographer 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.840
 make and prepare in advance 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.290
 just once where the athlete should be caught percent of the camera 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.350
 also Schaaf 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.159
 Holds the trigger where long until the athletes go to percent 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.200
 moved the correct autofocus range and then puts the chamber was percent 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.409
 until the camera just by itself and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.759
 my advantage part of it so that then the squares the right and 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.129
 were positioned at the right time 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.229
 we 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.380
 and if we did then Abraham could come 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.619
 of course I can say that because I look into the hips 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.230
 Manual I can only here now 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.560
 leads Nicole speak in the case here the trial in Dietersweiler the 700 meters 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.800
 when the 3ds and other models as I said just click in the paint 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.779
 Instruction Manual 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.269
 here in our case 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.870
 The confectionery percent actually works it's relatively easy 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.070
 be careful 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.970
 that the camera for one percent in so-called in the so-called sheep 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.560
 Priority it is already set that is the autofocus the modern 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.470
 trigger 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.490
 if the object is to capture what is actually sheep also that is the Kalff 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.479
 a point 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.290
 the other point is Dr 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.410
 that one percent first time autofocus only with the help of so-called 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.070
 Manado 11 and n may set the tre and not synonymous over the trigger of their 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.369
 above you can tell the individual of Thun 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:56.599
 a determination 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.709
 here is that the individual function a5 as mentioned on it pay attention only to the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.199
 Autofocus passed 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.179
 set high serious 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:08.579
 the children in front 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:13.569
 First of all we profit our object what to photograph money speak 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.609
 this autofocus point, however, the capture here in the folds do that 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.009
 just in the stands 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:22.540
 they fix the ring firmly and then release 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.570
 only with the help of Wotan fit 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.570
 the scientist exactly on this Prague we did that we in 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.189
 our case the athletes 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.389
 now it is now that we have a remote trigger 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.639
 connect to the camera and this course Lazar easy 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:43.879
 hold firm hold pressed in the case I have to do so hundredweight hand 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.109
 There are also triggers where you can easily bend it in the 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.639
 so-called percent in function 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.279
 and 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.999
 what happens now if I have pressed this shutter first times 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:55.850
 nothing at all 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.370
 because the camera is now waiting in the products music that is 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.100
 an object that awakens in him the sharpness and point defined by her 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.140
 moved into it 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.379
 in that case, that's the hand and 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.450
 and to find in punk what thereby only the Romandie where the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.450
 Hand would move one and then capture the ring what happens 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.939
 Ristow show the world again 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.669
 Press shutter button firmly 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.189
 nothing happens here at first because she does not get a sharp point but 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.650
 at the moment where the points Rachael Shardlow moves to areas 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:31.979
 Yes we can too 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.629
 so the athlete is accurate 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.909
 caught at the point where I wanted him I would have confessed now 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.839
 have wonderful you can also use this by, for example, animals 

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:44.580
 want to photograph and as for women miss box 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.620
 because they move exactly in the area percent where I want them 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.029
 I would like to or the neighboring cities from the chamber on 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.249
 as previously noted the newly fixed focus area 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:05:00.089
 puts the club trigger on Bauer out of solution 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.639
 and the penalties amount 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.759
 I wish you a lot of fun while copying chips and bite to Exten
