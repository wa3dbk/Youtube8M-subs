00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.520
 why is that there anyway, this planet is so different than the earth has why 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.180
 the son has another atmosphere now on Venus if at all 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.829
 Has given water 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.139
 then this water has evaporated relatively quickly has decomposed 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.439
 and there is nothing left in the hydrogen has disappeared the World Cup 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.609
 Oxygen has been coupled to the carbon dioxide 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.749
 and the water was gone 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:24.499
 on our earth 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.569
 has in the slices moment 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.359
 One hundred years of rain led to it 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.870
 that a large part of our planet's carbon dioxide is from our Earth's atmosphere 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.600
 Clock earth 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.300
 was washed out 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.640
 that's why the carbonate rocks are tips for playing 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.670
 on Venus 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.130
 that did not happen 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.010
 on Venus what practically always so dry 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 never water on the surface 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.450
 but there is something else on Venus 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.510
 for example, the land 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.760
 Electronic of an electronic measuring devices Sun credible difficult 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.460
 makes 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.740
 there are sulfuric acid clouds 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.729
 I already said the surface 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.979
 Venus is so very young a few hundred million years old clock so 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.399
 not like Merck or Moon where you go to the primeval times of the solar system Rhine 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.420
 can watch 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.970
 Percent because the surfaces are crunched by craters on Venus's 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.890
 Volcanism 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.840
 So there are very large volcanoes 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.740
 this volcanism sets naturally 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.010
 Sulfur dioxide free 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.890
 and he actually has sulfur dioxide 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.630
 Sulfuric acid clouds produced 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.189
 it had to think about sulfuric acid 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.120
 in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.729
 because there electronic equipment like that of r 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.369
 Percentage of sophisticated sun for example my money there you have to 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.200
 Luckily you can take a photo like you do when you a13 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.060
 this worry that is over at all 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.810
 and these sulfuric acid clouds 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.909
 As it were, sulfuric acid also causes rain from time to time 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:54.790
 this planet 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.620
 This planet is otherwise very active, as I said 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.410
 even the masses, however, he has a property 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.990
 which is not so easy to understand, he turns exactly 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.770
 the other way around than the other planets 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.319
 Venus, so to speak, turns all other planets clockwise 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.950
 turn counterclockwise 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.029
 Venus turns 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.959
 show with the place 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.239
 and the "Venus" turns very slowly 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.510
 so she turns around the sun in its 24 days and her year 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.799
 and now it's almost gone for almost as long 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.099
 So something must have happened earlier with this planet 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.660
 in his homily 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.999
 behaves completely differently 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.289
 than all other planets 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:39.199
 something must have happened to his atmosphere that is so different from 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.659
 his neighbor earth 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.650
 Venus is the prime example, so to speak 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.710
 what happens to three planets 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.950
 one by one 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.970
 who are traveling around a star like our sun we have on the one 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.269
 Site far out to Mars 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.269
 he is much smaller than the earth and the Venus 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.829
 but may offer us 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.349
 One day the opportunity to also sometimes country like because a station 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.989
 because he keeps at least a bit of atmosphere and he is very 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.779
 dry and obviously he may have had some time to know that 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:08.619
 not exactly 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:09.610
 but at least 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.219
 he offers a kind of geology on the surface 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.729
 we can understand there are canyons there are high mountains and so on nice 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.919
 in the middle the earth 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.719
 Obviously somehow this has gotten in this temperature 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.639
 falls the sun 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.989
 a reasonable for life percent reasonable temperature on Brecht too 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.150
 keep inside and inside 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.399
 the Venus 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:34.869
 Venus with her twisted direction otherwise she trains 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.149
 same part inlet the same heavy elements as the earth namely 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:39.969
 Nickelmann Garden 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.559
 Carbon and so on there is Sweden and and all that so 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:47.029
 is a fast Malek then composition 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.259
 she does not turn 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:49.649
 and she has 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:50.919
 did not make it 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.829
 to build a lively atmosphere 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.189
 the weather on Venus is pretty boring you always have the 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.290
 same cloud cover you have the same temperatures everywhere 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.600
 So there are almost no temperature differences at all 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.459
 and she is essentially 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.949
 Cloudy fields covering it make us completely impossible 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.349
 against what 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.219
 to look directly at it and in that sense this picture is of those of its 13th 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.430
 real 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.789
 a true percent 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.499
 real rarity 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:22.610
 there's something else about Venus that's special, she does not have her own 

00:04:22.609 --> 00:04:25.449
 magnetic field 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.199
 at Venus, something different from the sun-facing side takes place, which we do 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.289
 in our 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.360
 he has come to fairer reward of our mantle fairer does not know so well 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.819
 me 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.909
 we had the honor Andy Pohl magnetic field and this the finds of the solar wind 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.290
 blown 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.520
 and so the magnetic field at the front of the earth, so to speak 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.520
 warped in the back as the cyclist's hair blows backwards 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.640
 At Venus, she plays something completely different from there 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.759
 the solar wind more or less directly on the Venus atmosphere on it 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.550
 June drag her here 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.250
 and in this Gervais action that means there are charged particles 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.270
 in one moment magnetic fields are created, ie such tubes are created 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.470
 magnetic hoses at once but nothing with the magnetic field of Venus 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.360
 because she has no reason she does not have one 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.789
 then ask why did the goose because she did not speak Red 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.500
 namely to a dynamic 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.760
 namely to one the Porsche considers like that he has heard that for example 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.160
 that the planet can turn fast enough and that its convection strong 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.379
 enough is the movement in the planet's interior 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:26.749
 Now we know from volcanism that Venus certainly has this movement 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.349
 not as strong as the earth in which he is this big 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.340
 Plate tectonics is driven by the internal convection 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.629
 where the continents move back and forth 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.689
 everything seems to go more in such small funnels in Venus 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:41.869
 as a fairly distinct local volcanism 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.029
 but otherwise 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.680
 Venus is for us nowadays 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.880
 So, as far as landing is concerned, we can call people to the planet Venus 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.640
 bring is no longer an issue that you would never do we can barely 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.479
 bring our inanimate technology there 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.809
 it would not be a planet that will pay off in the foreseeable future 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:04.699
 Time maybe just start landing a few million years ago 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.240
 The sun is getting hotter and the hotter the sun gets, the hotter it gets 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.969
 it also on Venus, of course 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.490
 because of this ultra greenhouse effect 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.279
 He actually only learns one from us 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:17.949
 "We should be with our planet 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.199
 handle it very carefully 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.589
 so it will not be us one day 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:23.689
 it works 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:25.189
 like the Windows Iranians 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:26.930
 in science fiction literature 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.930
 that is going to happen 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:47.779
 v
