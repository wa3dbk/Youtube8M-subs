review five total and the first figure
here<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.230> will<00:00:19.289> review<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.900> Scorpion

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
here that I will review is the Scorpion

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.040 
here that I will review is the Scorpion
figure<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.490> this<00:00:23.490> scorpion<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.240> from<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
figure and this scorpion is from the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.859 
figure and this scorpion is from the
spider-man<00:00:25.500> 3<00:00:25.650> video<00:00:26.039> game<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.180> like

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
spider-man 3 video game so this is like

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.370 
spider-man 3 video game so this is like
the<00:00:28.170> video<00:00:28.380> game<00:00:28.560> version<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.929> his<00:00:30.929> character

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the video game version of his character

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.459 
the video game version of his character
which<00:00:31.980> he<00:00:32.340> was<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> movie<00:00:33.420> he<00:00:34.380> was

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
which he was not in the movie he was

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.549 
which he was not in the movie he was
only<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> video<00:00:35.070> game<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:37.079> guess<00:00:37.440> they

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
only in the video game so I guess they

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.170 
only in the video game so I guess they
just<00:00:37.590> came<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.160> cool<00:00:38.460> conceptual

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
just came up with this cool conceptual

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.310 
just came up with this cool conceptual
design<00:00:39.750> Grimm<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.790> as<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:42.180> he<00:00:42.930> does<00:00:43.079> look

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
design Grimm and as you see he does look

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.030 
design Grimm and as you see he does look
kind<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.590> cool

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
kind of cool

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.369 
kind of cool
I<00:00:44.180> think<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.270> figure<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.570> very<00:00:45.809> rare<00:00:46.140> because

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
I think this figure is very rare because

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.799 
I think this figure is very rare because
I've<00:00:46.500> not<00:00:46.680> seen<00:00:46.920> much<00:00:47.219> reviews<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.760> them<00:00:50.809> so

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
I've not seen much reviews on them so

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.760

for<00:02:20.880> our<00:02:21.000> particular<00:02:21.180> scene<00:02:21.540> his<00:02:21.660> arm

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
for our particular scene his arm

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.090 
for our particular scene his arm
surprise<00:02:22.860> he<00:02:22.980> has<00:02:23.160> no<00:02:23.370> wrist<00:02:23.700> articulation

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
surprise he has no wrist articulation

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.810 
surprise he has no wrist articulation
would<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.190> been<00:02:26.280> nice<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:26.550> they<00:02:26.640> were<00:02:26.760> to

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
would have been nice if they were to

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.820 
would have been nice if they were to
added<00:02:27.090> one<00:02:27.270> but<00:02:27.570> there's<00:02:27.780> none<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.680> it's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
added one but there's none there so it's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.210 
added one but there's none there so it's
just<00:02:28.920> for<00:02:29.100> like<00:02:29.250> his<00:02:29.490> elbow<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.690> his

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
Legends for his tail see he has like

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.080 
Legends for his tail see he has like
this<00:03:21.270> part<00:03:21.660> right<00:03:21.840> here<00:03:22.110> which<00:03:22.730> if<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.940> just

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
this part right here which if you just

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.870 
this part right here which if you just
hold<00:03:24.210> it<00:03:24.300> back<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.960> let<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.110> go

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
hold it back like that and let it go

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.280 
hold it back like that and let it go
you'll<00:03:26.880> kind<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.150> do<00:03:27.240> like<00:03:27.270> of<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.630> tail<00:03:27.960> attack

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
you'll kind of do like of a tail attack

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.850 
you'll kind of do like of a tail attack
type<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.680> thing<00:03:30.530> that's<00:03:31.530> why<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.710> was

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
type of thing that's why I was

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.680 
type of thing that's why I was
surprising<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.280> add<00:03:32.460> any<00:03:33.150> waist<00:03:33.540> articulation

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
surprising to add any waist articulation

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.570 
surprising to add any waist articulation
so<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.290> can<00:03:34.380> just<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:35.040> know<00:03:35.100> turn<00:03:35.370> them<00:03:35.520> at

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
so you can just you know turn them at

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.090 
so you can just you know turn them at
the<00:03:35.700> waist<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.150> do<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.840> instead<00:03:37.260> they<00:03:37.920> have

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
the waist and do that instead they have

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.220 
the waist and do that instead they have
it<00:03:38.250> at<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.430> tail<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.390> backpack<00:03:40.050> right

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
it at the tail that is a backpack right

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.820 
it at the tail that is a backpack right
here<00:03:41.420> so<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.960> does<00:03:43.880> have<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:45.000> joint<00:03:45.270> right<00:03:45.450> there

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
here so it does have a joint right there

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.190 
here so it does have a joint right there
joint<00:03:46.830> right<00:03:46.950> there<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.720> another<00:03:48.720> joint

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
joint right there and another joint

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.950 
joint right there and another joint
right<00:03:49.410> there<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:50.270> one<00:03:51.270> last<00:03:51.510> joint<00:03:51.690> right

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
right there and one last joint right

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.400 
right there and one last joint right
there<00:03:52.410> for<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:53.570> blade<00:03:54.570> hook<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.200> end<00:03:55.230> of

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
there for the blade hook on the end of

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.220 
there for the blade hook on the end of
this<00:03:55.500> tail<00:03:55.740> right<00:03:55.950> there<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:57.300> then<00:03:58.020> just

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
this tail right there and then just

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.390 
this tail right there and then just
don't<00:03:58.650> rotate<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.640> believe<00:04:00.620> no<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:02.040> does<00:04:02.220> not

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
don't rotate I believe no it does not

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.090 
don't rotate I believe no it does not
rotate<00:04:02.960> so<00:04:03.960> it<00:04:04.020> just<00:04:04.200> has<00:04:04.320> multiple<00:04:04.710> joints<00:04:05.010> to

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
rotate so it just has multiple joints to

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.600 
rotate so it just has multiple joints to
get<00:04:05.220> dead

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
get dead

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.699 
get dead
cool<00:04:06.300> swinging<00:04:06.990> action<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:09.560> here<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.680> a

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
cool swinging action and here is a

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.560
