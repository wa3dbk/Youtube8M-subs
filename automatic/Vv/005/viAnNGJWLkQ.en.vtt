00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.490
 hello everybody, everything beauty superpicape 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.480
 Unpublished here for another video tip of 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.600
 avoid 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.280
 Today I'm going to talk about the guess thing. 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.220
 extremely important 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.990
 I get many questions the staff 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.800
 speaking the following by Pedro de Color in 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.080
 all the chips on the scale to be held in 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.490
 pentatonic scale scale and 7 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.250
 Only when it was improvised, I'm 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.820
 I do not know what to do. 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.230
 when this is very common in those who are 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.190
 learning 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.379
 Let's make it very clear, guys. 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.780
 is to have mastery of the guitar arm and have 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.300
 I mean, what do I know where 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.239
 are the notes on the guitar arm 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.059
 This chip- playing thing is one like that. 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.280
 help on the one hand but harms 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.629
 so I think it hurts the most 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.829
 background that helps because when you 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.600
 decorating chips was decorating its shape 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.420
 geometric of the saints knows what 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.700
 Are you playing the then instead of the 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.189
 people keep thinking about chips come on 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.680
 think of notes that we are 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.720
 playing what is the relationship of this fashion in 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.159
 field with a chord on which I 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.020
 Playing this note, this is the most 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.579
 important is not enough to just get the sheik 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.619
 rang up you might think you're staying 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.880
 everything beautiful is not so thing 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.329
 it works 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.399
 so I really like being stuck on 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:35.680
 sheiks alaa drawings or anything then 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.299
 Can you do to improve this? 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.020
 there is why the following when you 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.270
 it's improvising I recommend it 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.490
 you think where the author tone was already 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.520
 already spent his free time was already already 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.820
 lost the idea is that you can do is 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.040
 simple in simply gives an example 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.040
 here you apply all the causes that 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.130
 Do you know Catholic greater than all? 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.409
 else does the decorating will pick up here 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.770
 module 5 from the scale up to the 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.590
 most famous, everyone knows 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.880
 here with Bruno tells Tony that we 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.880
 use the not 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.750
 only everyone 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.120
 the Catholic from there in the seven then everything 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.790
 world knows here the error is 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.260
 right here and get stuck here what 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.440
 the person sees she sees balls, it's not for 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.890
 of balls is to see notes this Thursday 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.140
 with the note but ball house and rope 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.510
 performs when both the barrel has no 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.760
 a little pattern petal and purify 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.840
 uranium has to know all of us still to 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.450
 same thing 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.930
 So what do you do, take the government of 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.030
 have a diagram that remains of the arm of the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.920
 guitar and white it all scales 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.170
 that you know you're starting to do the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.540
 Next replace the marbles 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.610
 you will do what it will take to do 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:35.930
 this here 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:37.790
 how will you stay there doh sun form 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.489
 simple and practical 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:45.200
 this way when you decorate a 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:47.150
 scale is decorate the notes on the arm that 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.980
 and the most important 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.530
 as it is touching the scale you have to 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.049
 know the grades of this scale 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.709
 what are the gaps in this 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.430
 scale 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.440
 no use touching the chip the chip does not 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.180
 music is of no use 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.280
 so look for coral that way 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.280
 transposes to all situations of the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.049
 scale including octaves 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.120
 this way so you will 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:18.109
 start decorating where the notes are 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.130
 and over time you start to decorate 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.360
 way much more 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.070
 The guitar arm is fast here. 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.120
 extremely important 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.680
 personal improvisation and influence 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.110
 influence is continuity, can not 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.960
 stop to think about improvising time 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.810
 where is what she notices is that she does not have 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.360
 how to stop an improvisation roll 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.730
 is faithful is the whole time there you have to 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.000
 know where you are and where you are 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.340
 new here then to change a little to 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.130
 way to study helps a lot 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.140
 Ok guys this was another video tip 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.140
 to avoid there enters the next then
