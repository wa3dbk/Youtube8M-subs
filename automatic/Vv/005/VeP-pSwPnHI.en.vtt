00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 hello everyone is bad I hope 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.589
 that you are well back in this 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.359
 new video is today we're getting 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.069
 simply find for this 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.440
 anecdote about video games it's a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.460
 concept that I've ever done on the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.299
 chain but I think it's going to be able 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.760
 you like it so we start everything 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.760
 just with a game that came out in 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.359
 1980 it's a bit of a little 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.650
 yellow guy 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.369
 I think you guessed it is 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.470
 of just pac man or batman is this 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.170
 that you know that name was not 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.430
 originally planned 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.340
 the name originally planned was puck man 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.800
 but the developer was afraid that the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.320
 Americans replaces the ppf that would give 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.930
 flex valdes is good it's not very 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.079
 attractive and less attractive as in 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.700
 one I think we all agree 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.559
 second anecdotes about pacman the total 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.899
 maximum points was achieved in 1999 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.789
 by bill mitchell who achieved the score 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.910
 maximum of three million three hundred 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.829
 thirty three thousand years 160 points he has 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.230
 completed the game in 6 hours do you imagine 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.210
 6h on pac man 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.460
 he caught him all the fruits to eat 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.000
 the four ghosts and all that without 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.770
 loss of life 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.880
 hat to doha wholesale do not you know where he 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.619
 wants to know that there were four 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.090
 ghosts difference on pac man but 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.380
 did you know that there were four brains 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.720
 different ie they do not have 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.189
 all the same red behavior is 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.810
 more aggressive they want faster and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.909
 they try they run after you 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.670
 simply the rose seek to block 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.740
 your trajectories blue follows from afar the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.450
 red and orange mouth randomly 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.610
 that's it for pac man on 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.509
 tackles the series assassin's creed 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.009
 coventry was not in play that was 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.600
 in ubisoft's plans initially he 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.549
 just had to release a new album 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.549
 of prince of persia named assassin 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.490
 this is the origin of this crisis knew 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.710
 you that all the targets in each 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.000
 buy assassin's creed pardon are some 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.430
 historical characters actually having 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.920
 existed died the same year at the same 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.259
 place an example take example on 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.659
 black flag with edward teach more known 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.200
 under the name of black beard and killed at the 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.590
 end of the game 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.960
 so here is an example of 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.160
 historical characters who died 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.789
 in reality and who is dead 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.760
 also 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.560
 anzin assassin's creed the famous jump of 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.090
 the angel you all know 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.440
 were not in the base of the game it's 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.260
 a beta testers who fell from a 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.790
 tree on a haystack and it is 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.930
 dead who therefore contacted the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.549
 developers for them to do a 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.709
 animation of this seal now 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:32.560
 mythical this agreement with me now 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.239
 we tackle an anecdote quite enough 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.890
 what the fuck is pretty unusual I saw 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.470
 I really searched many times 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.299
 on the internet bass that's enough 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.220
 good chelou tell you what you in 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.160
 think in the comments of the chiefs 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.390
 of the gypsy prison in China 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.040
 force some of their detainees to 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.170
 play online game world of warcraft 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.850
 in order to make money he 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.920
 take the gold farming that consists of 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.810
 accumulate virtual goods within 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.079
 a game and then resell them to 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.820
 players 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.910
 they can also they can as well 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.260
 win up to 650 euros per day in 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.829
 playing the inmates up to twelve 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.720
 hours in a row 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.819
 the golfing arming industry would count 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.590
 more than 100 people one hundred thousand 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.920
 people mostly located in 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.590
 China 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.780
 so basically he asks you ideas to 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.160
 play world of warcraft and farm 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.470
 gold to be able to resell them to 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.020
 enough players what the fuck 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.710
 now we are tackling a study that 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.210
 was made 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.890
 good a study enough what the fuck too 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.290
 because I think it's not 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.680
 really physicists what do we do that 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.590
 well short so the study has defined when 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.270
 an hour of play on gta and trouble in 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.690
 the real life would be about two 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.370
 prison sentences to perpetuate +55 years of 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.260
 prison but five license withdrawal 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.220
 and the cherry on the cake 8 million 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.440
 of euros related to the amateurs one attacks 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.670
 now at two rankings the top 3 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.380
 the best selling consoles of 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.760
 the history of the video game 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.660
 this ranking will surely surprise 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.570
 more than one starts in first place 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.340
 with the playstation 2 variants 2000 and 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.620
 with no less than 157 million 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.670
 copies sold 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.130
 not far behind we find the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.340
 Nintendo DS released in 2004 and sold to 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.200
 more than 154 million copies in 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.720
 third position that you doubt 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.850
 surely that united and Bahrain and its 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.220
 twin sister the game boy color who are 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.120
 published every two respectively 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:27.740
 1989 and 1998 and she sold herself to 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.930
 more than 118 million 118-110 8.69 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.780
 millions of copies excuse me for 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.820
 those who also target it is for for 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.190
 info the playstation 3 is sixth with 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.790
 83 million pints closely followed 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.890
 by xbox 360 which l to 89 million 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.300
 weeds bride none at pickup 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.400
 but hey it's normal 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.690
 they have only one desire and pc shon 4 is 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.640
 19th with 15 million copies 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.520
 sold and far enough behind the xbox 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.879
 one trolling in 26th place with his 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.930
 8 million sales 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:58.789
 we attack the second ranking 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.529
 with the games that cost the most 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.270
 to the developers and here I go out 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:03.009
 to surprise more than one for the first 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.779
 square 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.270
 it's destiny yes it's destiny in 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:11.199
 first position with no less than 500 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.909
 millions of dollars spent on this game 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.680
 this is really huge for a game 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.599
 like that that was not a very big 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.069
 success apart for a few few 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.990
 real fans who really have who does the 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.159
 game but for me it's really not 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.449
 the game I play 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:29.449
 that's the second position you're in 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.240
 doubt doubt gta 5 who is second 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.520
 simply with 266 million 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.009
 dollars spent in this little gem I 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.779
 think you agreed with me 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.279
 so I thought that finally you think 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.080
 that gta 5 was first good no I you 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.360
 promise that drawing was the first 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.009
 short between his positions we find ourselves 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.960
 with a game that has not been a free 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:50.719
 success at its release in 2011 I want 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.029
 sure to talk about star wars the old republic 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.729
 with little 100 million spent in a 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.110
 game that's free and yes the game is 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.699
 free 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.139
 I have not what margins they made 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.340
 profits the top but that's when 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.260
 even a lot 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.350
 go as if nice I make you two 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.699
 good bonus that's not it other than that 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.470
 relationship with video games but he 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.180
 found it still seems erno rubik 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.010
 the inventor of rubik's cube put a 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.169
 months to solve and found the solution 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.590
 of his own playing in his first 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:21.860
 edition was published in 1974 the guy 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.310
 makes a toy but he gets to the 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.620
 solve 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.880
 a month after their little parenthesis flight 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.919
 rubik's cube 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.800
 hold your dog to your 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.570
 chair him of course your seat 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.580
 the number of possible combinations with 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.419
 this little square that makes us crazy and 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.440
 two elected which has cottoned on to the screen but 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.280
 what did I not do the link because 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.800
 otherwise I will pass it 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.900
 dan agree now we're going 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.729
 to the zombies for a few anecdotes 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.229
 on the cult series The Walking Dead 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.290
 did you know and zombies do not leave 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.490
 never eyes that has its faults and I have 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.320
 not if you look at the 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.789
 walking dead you are passionate about 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.630
 eels eyes not personal but I 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.930
 found it on the internet 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:03.350
 so I find it pretty observes 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:06.590
 short not the last anecdote about the 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:09.710
 walking dead it's really the one where I 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.030
 find on this last his bubble this 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.650
 last anecdote is really the one where 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.330
 so in the series the walking dead 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.580
 they did not pronounce the word once 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.070
 zombies yet the series a little bit 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.690
 spent on his elder 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.039
 so go listen to people this is already the 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.570
 end of this video I hope it will 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:24.979
