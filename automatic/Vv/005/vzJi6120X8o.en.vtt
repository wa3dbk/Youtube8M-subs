up<00:01:55.729> try<00:01:56.729> not<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.060> any<00:01:57.149> shell<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.990> then

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
up try not to get any shell and then

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.510 
up try not to get any shell and then
just<00:01:58.320> go<00:01:58.439> back<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.860> forth<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.130> that

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
just go back and forth with that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.810 
just go back and forth with that
yo<00:02:00.259> separating<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> egg<00:02:01.500> whites<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.520> use

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
yo separating the egg whites now I use

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340 
yo separating the egg whites now I use
whole<00:02:03.030> eggs<00:02:03.060> versus<00:02:03.750> buying<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.140> from<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
whole eggs versus buying it from the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.560 
whole eggs versus buying it from the
milk<00:02:04.590> artists<00:02:05.070> buying<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.549> whole<00:02:05.729> egg<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
milk artists buying the whole egg is a

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.479 
milk artists buying the whole egg is a
lot<00:02:06.869> cheaper<00:02:06.899> than<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.649> buying<00:02:07.829> egg<00:02:08.160> whites

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
lot cheaper than just buying egg whites

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.010 
lot cheaper than just buying egg whites
so<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.060> buy<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.569> my<00:02:09.690> Wegmans<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.229> eight

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
so I buy on my Wegmans and eight

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.920 
so I buy on my Wegmans and eight
cards<00:02:11.590> of<00:02:11.710> 18<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:13.300> then<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.570> just<00:02:13.780> go<00:02:13.900> through

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
cards of 18 and then I just go through

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.200 
cards of 18 and then I just go through
these<00:02:14.290> now<00:02:15.040> depending<00:02:15.520> on<00:02:15.610> where<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.180> are

one<00:02:24.570> I've<00:02:25.570> learned<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.830> best<00:02:27.040> way<00:02:27.310> to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
one I've learned that the best way to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.200 
one I've learned that the best way to
make<00:02:27.610> sure<00:02:27.760> you're<00:02:27.940> getting<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.300> 50%<00:02:28.690> of

protein is with a high-protein breakfast
all<00:02:33.790> right<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:34.090> really<00:02:34.350> kind<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.410> going<00:02:35.530> over

all right it really kind of going over

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.230 
all right it really kind of going over
the<00:02:35.920> top<00:02:36.130> when<00:02:36.340> your<00:02:36.460> protein<00:02:36.880> in<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.060> morning

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
the top when your protein in the morning

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.720 
the top when your protein in the morning
allows<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.380> some<00:02:38.650> more<00:02:38.890> flexibility<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:39.640> the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
medium-high heat I just kind of go in

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.910 
medium-high heat I just kind of go in
here<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.450> get<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.750> peppers<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.380> onions<00:03:46.650> off

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
the bottom get the eggs underneath it'll

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.160 
the bottom get the eggs underneath it'll
make<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.190> easier<00:03:50.490> for<00:03:50.730> me<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.450> flip<00:03:51.780> when<00:03:52.020> it's

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
make it easier for me to flip when it's

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.470 
make it easier for me to flip when it's
time<00:03:52.520> and<00:03:53.520> then<00:03:53.640> just<00:03:53.850> kind<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.090> swirl<00:03:54.300> it

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
time and then just kind of swirl it

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.020 
time and then just kind of swirl it
around<00:03:54.510> one<00:03:55.440> thing<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.740> I've<00:03:55.860> learned<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.490> to

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
around one thing that I've learned is to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.870 
around one thing that I've learned is to
when<00:03:57.390> you're<00:03:57.540> making<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.010> omelet<00:03:59.010> that<00:03:59.700> you

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
when you're making the omelet that you

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.090 
when you're making the omelet that you
wanna<00:04:00.170> cuz<00:04:01.170> as<00:04:01.290> soon<00:04:01.500> as<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.709> starts<00:04:01.950> cooking

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
wanna cuz as soon as it starts cooking

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.350 
wanna cuz as soon as it starts cooking
right<00:04:02.310> away<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.550> just<00:04:02.820> kind<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.060> want<00:04:03.180> to

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
right away you just kind of want to

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.570 
right away you just kind of want to
separate<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.290> from<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.530> side<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:04.800> bring<00:04:05.280> over

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
separate it from the side and bring over

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.460 
separate it from the side and bring over
that<00:04:05.700> extra<00:04:08.420> egg<00:04:09.420> whites<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:10.020> fill<00:04:10.230> in<00:04:10.350> the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
that extra egg whites to fill in the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.620 
that extra egg whites to fill in the
gaps<00:04:11.030> it's<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.120> little<00:04:12.300> bit<00:04:12.390> easier<00:04:14.330> it<00:04:15.330> cooks<00:04:15.540> a

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
gaps it's a little bit easier it cooks a

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.820 
gaps it's a little bit easier it cooks a
little<00:04:15.690> bit<00:04:15.900> faster<00:04:16.350> cuz<00:04:16.560> they<00:04:16.650> have<00:04:16.680> a

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
little bit faster cuz they have a

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.070 
little bit faster cuz they have a
medium-high<00:04:17.250> heat<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:18.450> bottom<00:04:18.780> will<00:04:18.870> cook

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
medium-high heat the bottom will cook

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.370 
medium-high heat the bottom will cook
pretty<00:04:19.260> quick<00:04:20.690> so<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.720> just<00:04:21.959> want<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.230> make

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
pretty quick so you just want to make

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.460 
pretty quick so you just want to make
sure<00:04:22.530> that<00:04:22.650> you're<00:04:23.630> gonna<00:04:24.630> survive<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.260> other

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
sure that you're gonna survive the other

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.020 
sure that you're gonna survive the other
thing<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:25.890> want<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.100> do<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.490> kind<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:26.850> mix
