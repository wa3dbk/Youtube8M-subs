many people think self-driving cars are
science<00:01:45.870> fiction<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.130> reality<00:01:47.580> is<00:01:47.670> that

this is an early prototype but our

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
driver can actually release the steering

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.420

that<00:02:26.640> he<00:02:26.790> or<00:02:26.940> she<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.480> do<00:02:27.630> something<00:02:27.840> else

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
that he or she can do something else
