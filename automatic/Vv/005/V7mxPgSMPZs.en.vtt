 Android screens as you see I have it 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.760
 customized as you see the time

 do not forget to watch this video 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:57.710
 good and now we start we will use two 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.710
 applications that good one I think that already 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.150
 it's not in the google pay because good 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.460
 I think those who saw and used 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.080
 this application did not understand it very much and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:17.620
 they put at least one star I think 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.620
 but the other yes this nation is 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:29.210
 is this and cc wv some small widgets 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.580
 but that are not touchable that we can 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.760
 Use for 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.140
 leave our phone as well as they are 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.520
 seeing now on screen well if there's no 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.820
 and service cv en 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.109
 google play I'll leave a link here in 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.939
 the description of this video well and a 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:57.210
 Once we have installed the sc wv what 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.210
 we open 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.520
 as you see is this new version of the cw 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.709
 v has zinc material that is him 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.640
 the material of the new version of 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.280
 android and google well here we appear 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.110
 here by default we would not appear anything 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.959
 but when we downloaded the jarvis cv and 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.410
 we go back to the application we 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.790
 these would appear that would be the club that 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:34.510
 the battery in part 3 part 1 the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:39.579
 part 2 is part 4 well and now they 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.420
 I will show how to put these mini widgets 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:45.560
 untouchable 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.580
 ok we start in the application is 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.090
 well so this does not help us 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.880
 so we go to widgets first but 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.670
 notice let install the application 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.510
 because otherwise the widgets will not work 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.420
 we go to the widgets 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.959
 we search 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:14.510
 these widgets that have the appearance 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:18.380
 of sc wv well here brings by default 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:24.410
 several widgets as one by one 1 by 2 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:28.850
 1 for 4 1 for 5 2 for 1 2 for 2 4 for 4 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:33.550
 and enter one of 3 by 1 also brings 3 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:40.120
 by 2 3 by 3 4 by 1 you have plenty of 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:45.450
 good sizes we will try the 4 x 4 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.450
 we touch it we put it 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.510
 we wait for the widgets to load and 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.480
 how do those widgets look 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.010
 they are not returned to the application in 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.830
 this case let's try with 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.030
 battery 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:08.440
 we give it, we keep it, we give it a single 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.460
 click and then it would be forming the 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.790
 widgets if we keep it pressed and 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.489
 then let it go we can enlarge it to 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.220
 our taste then we play again in 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.100
 display and ready and would be us 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.100
 widget if we do not like it we can delete it 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.460
 Y 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.590
 re-enter the widgets choose 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.020
 another widget 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.689
 as now we will try 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.860
 let's try the number 1 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.860
 we press it 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:51.460
 we wait for it to load the same 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.360
 we enlarge it a little 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:05:01.539
 and as you see here has information like 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:04.900
 the year the day the time everything and always what 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:08.020
 we can remove this application without 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.470
 doubt the best to customize your 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:17.400
 android and if you like this background that 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:20.150
 I have like this is called wallpaper 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.500
 If you like, I'll leave you in the 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.680
 description of the video just like 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:29.610
 jarvis q and well this has been all 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.990
 Androids, Chau Chau, I forgot 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:37.830
 we already have 15 and we had 15 subscribers 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:41.729
 the day of now we have 16 we're going 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:45.389
 little bit but remember slow 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:46.630
 but surely the whole race is never 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:51.010
 good 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.600
 well maybe I'll take some screen 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.090
 groups 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.150
 these two screens so they can 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.820
 customize your android equal to mine 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.070
 good and this has been today's video 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.230
