00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.049
 hello planes thank you very much for giving 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:07.359
 play to this video once again here they 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.210
 I bring a hairstyles tutorial and I hope 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.540
 that you like here how can you 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.290
 mind I already made two divisions that is 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:21.460
 one zigzag and the other from the top of the 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:25.630
 head towards the end of the ear here 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:29.140
 from each side we are going to grab what is 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.940
 we'll divide it in two and what 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.199
 let's start making churro 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.199
 as you notice here 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.500
 we intertwine the churros and good you 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.140
 we ask our lovely model that 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.519
 we take it or if not then we put for a 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.250
 clamp and continue putting another side with the 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.899
 another side is empirically the same to the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.239
 better it costs a little more work because 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.439
 well I zig zag did it sideways not 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.500
 I did it not in the middle of the head 

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:02.420
 then therefore there is more hair one more 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.369
 hair on one side than on the other 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.710
 then this side cost me a little more 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.080
 of work but yes if you can 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.650
 unite 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.350
 and after humans with a 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.600
 limited or with 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.740
 with a good light 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.840
 donate so that it will not break and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.140
 after that we're going to start 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.150
 interlacing the millions of hair 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.610
 the kit that I can recommend 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.180
 always for a very long hair home 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.490
 and that is entangled every time is good because 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.280
 that we are wetting that we are not 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.080
 is brushing brushing because if not 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 we make this good it makes us balls 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.700
 horrible that is the case for example of 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.220
 my daughter who is the model that I always 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.020
 he occupied to do good hairstyles there my 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.500
 mom but she has too much hair 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.500
 long has it say that until the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.360
 booty and he's very foolish that he sees 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.430
 Although the comb and so on 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.920
 that feeling that I can give you what 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.780
 are moistening and they are 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.780
 brushing as always they were not 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.009
 it's carmen the good thing that we grab here 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.470
 lock 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.269
 and we're going to make churro too but 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.030
 we are going to go around what 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.920
 is the liguita that is from the side we are 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.750
 working on the left side we're going to 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.819
 turn the right side 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.260
 if we are working on the right side 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.879
 we are going to turn the side 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.340
 left so that for us to be made 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.340
 easier to comb and to make it 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.730
 so that it goes grabbing pretty shape 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.380
 because if we do it the other way around 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.750
 has a case because if they are not going to 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.660
 leave your hair and you will see everything 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.720
 weird there then it has to be on the side 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.790
 in which we go to the side where the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.650
 liguita where we already grabbed the hair of 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.680
 that side is where we are going to turn the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.230
 churros have to count the aritos that 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.209
 they're going in because because if they do not 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.080
 tell a side will go to the best of 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.450
 five 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.239
 squirts and on the other side will go to the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.900
 better than three and if it looks really bad 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.760
 then better let's be equitable 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.330
 in the hair for example here I what 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.960
 I made four each side 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.550
 and then be here we finished the 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.410
 four we are first in the middle of the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.260
 head we take with some lists 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.260
 again what is this hair 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.200
 remaining we join with the tail that already 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.630
 we had those of the tail of the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.650
 churros and then let's put another side 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.200
 which is the same the same as we divide 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.870
 hair we grabbed a lock he quoted 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.130
 We give churro towards ready towards 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.960
 left because we are already in the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.020
 right then we are going to do the 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.700
 left and this we put it what 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.420
 interlaced in the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.629
 in the half we have here we say of 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.700
 churro we grabbed the other lock what 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.470
 we already incorporated a trickle 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.379
 previously we had give 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.440
 turn again to the same side 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.970
 we put back and so on 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.670
 equal to the term since we do not have 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.269
 hair that we put it back to 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.860
 incorporate in the horse's tail and already 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.209
 it is as if we were 8 a queue of 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.359
 horse but it is a braid is a braid 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.040
 that subject is a spiral press forgiveness 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.139
 because they move so deep 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.520
 braids look there I'm telling you 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.620
 how good we already have how many this one 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.389
 how many squirts gotten and has to 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.080
 be fair to not only see 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.849
 do not look bad I want to clarify that the 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.099
 milestones and those that I have not taken to my 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.319
 girl, I always tell her with a hard head 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.210
 because I'm going to pull for the same in the 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.659
 hair that has it very heavy then 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.940
 she already knows she did not hurt her 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.710
 the hair I do not make a rude 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.270
 no nonsense out there someone I 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.629
 commented that I was two is 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.990
 combing but it's not that but it's yes 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:01.300
 it's my girl's hair but good 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.069
 everyone I do not want anything else I want here 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.240

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.789
