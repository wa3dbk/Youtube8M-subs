00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
5-inch screen right there front and

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.619 
5-inch screen right there front and
center<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.579> hardware<00:00:52.940> is<00:00:53.059> well<00:00:53.239> designed

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
center and the hardware is well designed

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.110 
center and the hardware is well designed
as<00:00:53.899> well<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:54.530> LG<00:00:54.829> did<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.070> pretty<00:00:55.460> fine<00:00:55.760> job

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
as well so LG did a pretty fine job

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.630 
as well so LG did a pretty fine job
making<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.809> hardware<00:00:57.140> hardware<00:00:57.890> feels<00:00:58.159> solid

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
making the hardware hardware feels solid

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.489 
making the hardware hardware feels solid
it's<00:00:58.999> plastic<00:00:59.600> but<00:00:59.870> it<00:00:59.989> doesn't<00:01:00.350> feel

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
it's plastic but it doesn't feel

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.579 
it's plastic but it doesn't feel
necessarily<00:01:01.489> cheap<00:01:01.960> inside<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.109> box<00:01:03.350> you'll

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
necessarily cheap inside the box you'll

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.220 
necessarily cheap inside the box you'll
see<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:04.100> sim<00:01:04.489> card<00:01:04.520> little<00:01:05.030> pin<00:01:05.630> tool<00:01:05.930> that

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
see the sim card little pin tool that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.620 
see the sim card little pin tool that
pop<00:01:06.410> out<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.620> sim<00:01:06.770> card<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:08.330> some<00:01:08.480> other

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
pop out the sim card and some other

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.030 
pop out the sim card and some other
manuals<00:01:09.170> actually<00:01:09.560> have<00:01:09.680> two<00:01:09.860> of<00:01:09.980> these

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
manuals actually have two of these

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.360 
manuals actually have two of these
safety<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:11.080> warranty<00:01:12.080> manuals<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.190> I<00:01:13.220> guess

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
safety and warranty manuals so I guess

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.790 
safety and warranty manuals so I guess
they<00:01:13.550> really<00:01:14.060> thought<00:01:14.690> I<00:01:14.750> needed<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:15.320> look

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
they really thought I needed to look

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.400 
they really thought I needed to look
those<00:01:16.040> over<00:01:16.660> included<00:01:17.660> two<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.930> them<00:01:18.050> for<00:01:18.080> me

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
those over included two of them for me

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.080 
those over included two of them for me
so<00:01:18.950> maybe<00:01:19.100> I'll<00:01:19.280> share<00:01:19.550> that<00:01:19.760> with<00:01:19.880> someone

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
so maybe I'll share that with someone

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.520 
so maybe I'll share that with someone
else<00:01:20.300> who<00:01:20.420> knows<00:01:20.570> but<00:01:20.870> yeah<00:01:21.170> they're<00:01:21.350> they're

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
else who knows but yeah they're they're

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.350 
else who knows but yeah they're they're
actually<00:01:21.920> exactly<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.520> same<00:01:22.760> it<00:01:22.940> looks<00:01:23.150> like

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
actually exactly the same it looks like

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.840 
actually exactly the same it looks like
at<00:01:23.510> least<00:01:23.740> all<00:01:24.740> right<00:01:24.920> so<00:01:25.190> what<00:01:25.460> else<00:01:25.610> is<00:01:25.700> in

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
at least all right so what else is in

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.630 
at least all right so what else is in
the<00:01:25.940> box<00:01:26.180> we<00:01:26.420> have<00:01:26.690> of<00:01:27.020> course<00:01:27.290> our<00:01:27.590> USB<00:01:28.010> cable

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
the box we have of course our USB cable

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.150 
the box we have of course our USB cable

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
and that hooks up to the charger or to

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.100 
and that hooks up to the charger or to
your<00:01:31.280> computer<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.630> travel
