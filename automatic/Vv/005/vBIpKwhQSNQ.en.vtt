00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 as they are in today's video we're going 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.430
 to emphasize a little bit more and 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.430
 go deep into the embouchure 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.950
 they just enter and they are barely 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:18.460
 learning or want to get sound from 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.070
 clarinet I leave here arribita the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.930
 previous video where I explain how to do 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.510
 sound the planet in a very easy way 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.980
 and sure good first thing we have 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.619
 what to do is give a little more 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.419
 stability to the lower lip which is 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.989
 Where will the cane rest? Let's go 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.870
 try to flatten or stretch this part 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.720
 of the chin these muscles as 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.230
 down as it is a bit flat 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.230
 this way 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.390
 after doing that it is very important 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.390
 seal the mouthpiece with the corners of 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.850
 the lips that is to say with this part is 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.320
 very important to close as embrace 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.320
 true well 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.650
 then what we have to do is be 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.440
 very aware of our language is worth 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.710
 that is not in the middle of the mouth because 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.990
 there as if floating but try to leave it 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.850
 simply relaxed where normally 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.680
 is when we do not speak or when we do not 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.070
 we do nothing there is relaxed 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.510
 in the bottom part of the vocalist not 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.100
 you have to move there to force those 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.610
 down nothing simply relax the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.470
 drop it there and try not to move it 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.630
 from there to deal with when we play and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.430
 we blow socially always always 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.240
 keep the language and what happens sometimes 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.830
 when the tongue starts to float inside 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.930
 from the mouth it may close a little 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.450
 the throat or it may prevent the passage 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.460
 of the air is worth then having very in 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.480
 mind that we're going to try to sound 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:05.350
 again this part of ethics clarÃ­n 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.350
 remember chin corners and tongue 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.940
 when we already have this ready what 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.910
 let's do is try to imagine or 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.490
 to feel that the inside part of 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.280
 our cheeks become a bit 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.560
 in contact 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.920
 with the sides of the tongue is worth 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.580
 remember the relaxed tongue below and the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.140
 cheeks the inside part a little in 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.860
 contact let's think about that now 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.400
 when we touch chin tongue commissures 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.410
 and the part of the cheeks never inflate 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.900
 never really make that move and with 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.480
 the commissures never think so 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.100
 less so I do I never try to 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.110
 think about smiling when we are playing 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.380
 but always very closed towards the 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.380
 nozzle 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.310
 finally let's try to think now 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.140
 with we are making those sounds let's go 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.260
 to try to think as if we were 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.240
 singing one and truth one and what happens 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.310
 our language is going to stay down as 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.060
 always but will try to catch a 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.440
 way like when we say or sing the 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.390
 vocal and and this helps the column a lot 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.250
 of the air and especially in this part that 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.500
 It is essential at the time of departure 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.420
 of the air will round out the sound a lot 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.420
 and will greatly improve stability 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.090
 finally let's do an exercise 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.500
 with the chromatic scale for our 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.470
 next exercise we need to put 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.069
 our pulse at 60 speed is worth 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.069
 here it is 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.540
 remember that we must do it very 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.390
 slowly without accelerating us from that time 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.130
 60 and being very aware of all 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.690
 our embouchure of what we have already seen 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.690
 previously the ribbon goes 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.940
 and 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.100
 do not 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.180
 well this was all with the care and 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.370
 Remember to subscribe if you have any 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.300
 Comment some doubt ask and we 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.300
 we see the next video
