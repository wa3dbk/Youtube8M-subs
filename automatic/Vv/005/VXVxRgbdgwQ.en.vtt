idea about the size of this guy here
this<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.350> the<00:00:10.469> t-rex<00:00:10.860> 150<00:00:11.460> DFC<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.930> love<00:00:13.440> flying

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:13.709 
this is the t-rex 150 DFC I love flying

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:14.270 
this is the t-rex 150 DFC I love flying
this<00:00:13.889> guy

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
this guy

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.120 
this guy
as<00:00:14.539> you<00:00:15.539> can<00:00:15.660> see<00:00:15.840> connects<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.410> next<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
as you can see connects to next to the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.170 
as you can see connects to next to the
mCP<00:00:17.520> xbl<00:00:19.370> it's<00:00:20.370> actually<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> little<00:00:20.880> smaller

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
mCP xbl it's actually a little smaller

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.490 
mCP xbl it's actually a little smaller
if<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.110> put<00:00:22.380> them<00:00:22.470> nose<00:00:23.270> to<00:00:24.270> back<00:00:24.500> it's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
if you put them nose to back it's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.070 
if you put them nose to back it's
actually<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:26.040> lower<00:00:26.840> to<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> ground<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:30.080> as

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
actually just lower to the ground and as

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.430 
actually just lower to the ground and as
far<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.350> blade<00:00:32.009> length<00:00:32.399> goes<00:00:36.109> put<00:00:37.109> that<00:00:37.289> out

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
far as blade length goes put that out

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.220 
far as blade length goes put that out
there<00:00:37.999> just<00:00:38.999> a<00:00:39.089> little<00:00:39.570> bit<00:00:39.690> longer<00:00:39.899> blade

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
there just a little bit longer blade

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.819 
there just a little bit longer blade
length<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.659> it<00:00:42.719> has<00:00:42.839> a<00:00:42.870> lot<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.199> power<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
length so but it has a lot of power and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.119 
length so but it has a lot of power and
if<00:00:44.640> Fleiss<00:00:44.989> almost<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.140> good<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.409> the<00:00:46.530> 130<00:00:46.890> X

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
if Fleiss almost as good as the 130 X

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.590 
if Fleiss almost as good as the 130 X
which<00:00:47.339> I<00:00:47.460> love<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.909> it's<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.269> little<00:00:48.390> bit

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
which I love and it's a little bit

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.660 
which I love and it's a little bit
bigger<00:00:48.839> so<00:00:49.109> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.309> any<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.609> these

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
bigger so if you have any of these

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639 
bigger so if you have any of these
helicopters<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> you're<00:00:51.839> wondering<00:00:52.109> how<00:00:52.199> big

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
helicopters and you're wondering how big

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.540 
helicopters and you're wondering how big
exactly<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.370> t-rex<00:00:53.940> 150<00:00:54.449> DFC<00:00:54.839> is<00:00:55.370> that's<00:00:56.370> how

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
exactly the t-rex 150 DFC is that's how

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.369 
exactly the t-rex 150 DFC is that's how
big<00:00:56.729> it<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.909> and<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.510> surprised<00:00:57.809> me<00:00:57.960> too<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.350> I

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
big it is and it surprised me too when I

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.059 
big it is and it surprised me too when I
first<00:00:58.679> picked<00:00:58.889> it<00:00:59.069> up<00:00:59.159> in<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.829> it's<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:01.949> much

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:02.069 
first picked it up in the it's so much

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:03.860 
first picked it up in the it's so much
bigger<00:01:02.309> than<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:03.269> I<00:01:03.299> first<00:01:03.449> picked<00:01:03.690> it

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
bigger than that when I first picked it

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.030 
bigger than that when I first picked it
up<00:01:03.929> in<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> hobby<00:01:04.320> store<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.920> was

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
up in the hobby store because I was

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.590 
up in the hobby store because I was
expecting<00:01:05.220> something<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:06.060> little<00:01:06.390> bit<00:01:06.479> bigger

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
expecting something a little bit bigger

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.110 
expecting something a little bit bigger
than<00:01:06.870> the<00:01:06.990> 130<00:01:07.440> X<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> flies<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> lot<00:01:08.670> like

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
than the 130 X but it flies a lot like

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.660 
than the 130 X but it flies a lot like
the<00:01:09.240> 130<00:01:09.660> X<00:01:09.870> and<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.800> does<00:01:10.980> deserve<00:01:11.370> the<00:01:11.550> name

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the 130 X and it does deserve the name

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.460 
the 130 X and it does deserve the name
150<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.690> sheer<00:01:12.930> amount<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.230> power

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
150 because of the sheer amount of power

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.120 
150 because of the sheer amount of power
that<00:01:13.740> has<00:01:13.920> behind<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:15.300> under<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> hood

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
that has behind it now under the hood

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.480 
that has behind it now under the hood
there<00:01:17.130> were<00:01:17.250> some<00:01:17.460> problems<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:20.220> swash

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
there were some problems the swash

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.760 
there were some problems the swash
separates<00:01:21.030> pretty<00:01:21.840> easily

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
separates pretty easily

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
separates pretty easily
I<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.310> version<00:01:23.610> one<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.030> heard<00:01:24.300> there<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.480> a

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
things they updated was the squash and

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.530 
things they updated was the squash and
also<00:01:28.980> the<00:01:29.130> frame<00:01:29.400> apparently<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:29.940> frame<00:01:30.180> has

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
also the frame apparently this frame has

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.050 
also the frame apparently this frame has
some<00:01:30.720> weak<00:01:30.870> points<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.700> they've<00:01:32.700> added<00:01:33.000> some

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.380 
idea what they're gonna do about
upgrading<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> people<00:01:38.790> who<00:01:38.910> already<00:01:39.090> bought

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
upgrading the people who already bought

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.790 
upgrading the people who already bought
it<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.200> an<00:01:40.950> early<00:01:41.190> adopter<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:43.380> accept

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
it but as an early adopter I just accept

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.410 
it but as an early adopter I just accept
that<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.250> bought<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.940> that<00:01:45.060> way

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420

underneath the flybarless as you can see
the<00:01:51.330> flybarless<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.020> crooked<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.860> some<00:01:53.490> 3m

complaint from a lot of people that that

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.290 
complaint from a lot of people that that
is<00:02:01.380> mounted<00:02:01.740> poorly<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.940> really<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:04.070> and

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
is mounted poorly and it really is and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.899 
is mounted poorly and it really is and
the<00:02:06.300> other<00:02:06.420> thing<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.990> had<00:02:07.260> even<00:02:08.099> though<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> used

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 
the other thing I had even though I used

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.089 
the other thing I had even though I used
a<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:10.050> little<00:02:10.289> screwdriver<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.769> came<00:02:10.979> with

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
a that little screwdriver that came with

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.210 
a that little screwdriver that came with
it<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.400> pry<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.330> off<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.840> had<00:02:12.960> two<00:02:13.170> wires

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
it to pry that off as I had two wires

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.220 
it to pry that off as I had two wires
come<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:15.270> they<00:02:15.600> just<00:02:15.630> popped<00:02:16.020> right<00:02:16.200> off

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
come just they just popped right off

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.400 
come just they just popped right off
while<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.680> reprogramming<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.170> think

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
while I was reprogramming it and I think

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.230 
while I was reprogramming it and I think
that's<00:02:19.590> all<00:02:19.860> my<00:02:20.010> complaints<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.640> now<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.030> do

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
that's all my complaints for now I do

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.990 
that's all my complaints for now I do
like<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.600> full-size<00:02:21.990> servos<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.850> head

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
like the full-size servos and the head

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.890 
like the full-size servos and the head
geometry<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:26.880> think<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.210> gives<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.630> helps

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
geometry and I think that gives it helps

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.630 
geometry and I think that gives it helps
give<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.440> lot<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.920> power<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:32.220> comes<00:02:32.400> with

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
give it a lot of the power it comes with

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.500 
give it a lot of the power it comes with
an<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:32.910> metal<00:02:33.150> head<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.720> metal<00:02:35.990> shaft<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
an all metal head all metal shaft the

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.910 
an all metal head all metal shaft the
main<00:02:39.510> shaft<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.960> haven't<00:02:40.140> taken<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.470> off<00:02:40.650> yet

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
main shaft I haven't taken that off yet

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.850 
main shaft I haven't taken that off yet
but<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.160> do<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:42.000> metal<00:02:42.420> swash<00:02:43.200> plate<00:02:43.410> from

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
but I do have a metal swash plate from

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.370 
but I do have a metal swash plate from
micro<00:02:44.220> heli<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.730> way<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:44.880> I'm<00:02:45.660> gonna<00:02:45.990> find

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
micro heli on the way so I'm gonna find

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.320 
micro heli on the way so I'm gonna find
out<00:02:46.440> how<00:02:46.650> easy<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.100> pops<00:02:47.370> off<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.910> how<00:02:48.000> easy

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
out how easy that pops off and how easy

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.210 
out how easy that pops off and how easy
it<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.690> change<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.990> swash<00:02:49.380> put<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.770> campi

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
it is to change that swash put the campi

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.820 
it is to change that swash put the campi
back<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.090> guy<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.540> let's<00:02:52.290> hover<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.709> in

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
back on this guy and let's hover it in

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.430 
back on this guy and let's hover it in
the<00:02:52.920> living<00:02:53.190> room<00:02:53.340> again<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:54.900> freezing<00:02:55.320> out

the living room again it's freezing out

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.890 
the living room again it's freezing out
I<00:02:55.709> can't<00:02:56.100> take<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.430> outside<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:57.209> show<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.450> but

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
really a little taper at the end I'll

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.780 
really a little taper at the end I'll
hold<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.680> but<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.040> holds<00:03:11.250> surprisingly

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
hold it on but it holds surprisingly

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.880 
hold it on but it holds surprisingly
well<00:03:12.030> I'm<00:03:12.750> taking<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.140> canopy<00:03:13.500> on<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.800> off

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
well I'm taking the canopy on and off

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.500 
well I'm taking the canopy on and off
make<00:03:14.130> sure<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.520> don't<00:03:14.670> lose<00:03:14.790> grommets<00:03:15.300> I

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
make sure that you don't lose grommets I

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.250 
make sure that you don't lose grommets I
had<00:03:15.780> one<00:03:15.959> half<00:03:16.320> pop<00:03:16.590> out<00:03:16.770> one<00:03:16.950> time

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
had one half pop out one time

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.830 
had one half pop out one time
alright<00:03:19.260> that's<00:03:19.530> on<00:03:19.800> I<00:03:21.440> haven't<00:03:22.440> slow<00:03:22.769> startup

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
alright that's on I haven't slow startup

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.920 
alright that's on I haven't slow startup
comes<00:03:24.840> up<00:03:24.959> pretty<00:03:25.050> good<00:03:25.200> off<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.500> ground

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.149 

handles<00:03:32.650> pretty<00:03:32.829> well<00:03:33.069> I<00:03:36.209> mean<00:03:37.409> that<00:03:38.409> 100%

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
handles pretty well I mean that 100%

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.670 
handles pretty well I mean that 100%
with<00:03:39.730> what<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.659> had<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.959> Expo<00:03:41.319> set<00:03:41.560> 30<00:03:42.400> 30<00:03:42.730> 15<00:03:43.209> I

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
with what I had the Expo set 30 30 15 I

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.440 
with what I had the Expo set 30 30 15 I
think<00:03:44.680> 15<00:03:45.189> is<00:03:45.219> on<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.489> rudder<00:03:45.640> aileron<00:03:46.239> and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
think 15 is on the rudder aileron and

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.280 
think 15 is on the rudder aileron and
elevator<00:03:48.480> are<00:03:49.480> 30<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:52.510> handles<00:03:52.750> got<00:03:53.260> a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
elevator are 30 and it handles got a

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.709 
elevator are 30 and it handles got a
little<00:03:53.530> bit<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.739> a<00:03:53.969> I've<00:03:54.969> been<00:03:55.030> beating<00:03:55.450> up<00:03:55.510> on

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:55.719 
little bit of a I've been beating up on

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:06.559 
little bit of a I've been beating up on
it<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.170> I<00:03:56.439> think<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.489> might<00:03:57.609> already

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.110 

I<00:04:06.629> don't<00:04:07.590> know<00:04:07.650> it's<00:04:08.519> fine<00:04:08.790> great<00:04:09.090> right<00:04:09.299> now

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.460 

sit<00:04:15.120> for<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.329> little<00:04:15.480> wag<00:04:15.719> I<00:04:15.959> have<00:04:16.049> my<00:04:16.169> gyro

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
sit for that little wag I have my gyro

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.460 
sit for that little wag I have my gyro
tuned<00:04:17.160> up<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.400> little<00:04:17.609> high<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.019> get<00:04:19.259> a<00:04:19.289> little

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
tuned up a little high so I get a little

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:36.310 
tuned up a little high so I get a little
wag

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.940 

I'm<00:04:36.860> keeping<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.430> pretty<00:04:37.670> tame<00:04:37.940> because<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.450> am

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
I'm keeping it pretty tame because I am

00:04:38.950 --> 00:05:01.080 
I'm keeping it pretty tame because I am
inside<00:04:39.950> my<00:04:40.160> house

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.510 

I<00:05:01.470> guess<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.590> could<00:05:02.710> turn<00:05:02.830> that<00:05:02.889> gyro<00:05:03.310> down<00:05:03.490> a

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
I guess I could turn that gyro down a

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.040 
I guess I could turn that gyro down a
little<00:05:03.730> but<00:05:04.330> when<00:05:04.449> you're<00:05:04.570> doing<00:05:04.780> fast

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
little but when you're doing fast

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.200 
little but when you're doing fast
forward<00:05:05.410> flight<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:06.550> you're<00:05:06.730> doing<00:05:07.000> loops

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
forward flight and you're doing loops

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.840 
forward flight and you're doing loops
and<00:05:07.480> rolls<00:05:07.510> and<00:05:07.870> stuff<00:05:08.430> you<00:05:09.430> don't<00:05:09.610> even

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
and rolls and stuff you don't even

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:20.410 
and rolls and stuff you don't even
notice<00:05:10.000> this

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:39.100 

all<00:05:20.990> right<00:05:21.110> that's<00:05:21.260> pretty<00:05:21.410> bad<00:05:21.680> wag

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.200 

all<00:05:39.740> right<00:05:40.040> taking<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:40.460> down<00:05:40.610> that<00:05:40.880> battery

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
all right taking it down that battery

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:49.780 
all right taking it down that battery
has<00:05:41.330> to<00:05:41.360> be<00:05:41.540> dead<00:05:41.720> by<00:05:41.870> now<00:05:47.830> so<00:05:48.830> that's<00:05:49.040> it<00:05:49.310> the

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
has to be dead by now so that's it the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.650 
has to be dead by now so that's it the
align<00:05:50.030> t-rex<00:05:50.570> 1:50<00:05:51.500> DFC<00:05:52.330> wish<00:05:53.330> I<00:05:53.390> could<00:05:53.540> take

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
align t-rex 1:50 DFC wish I could take

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.110 
align t-rex 1:50 DFC wish I could take
it<00:05:53.690> outside<00:05:53.870> and<00:05:54.230> show<00:05:54.410> you<00:05:54.470> because<00:05:54.680> it<00:05:55.070> is

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
it outside and show you because it is

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.370 
it outside and show you because it is
awesome<00:05:56.120> when<00:05:56.630> you're<00:05:56.750> doing<00:05:56.930> stunts<00:05:57.260> and

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
awesome when you're doing stunts and

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.080 
awesome when you're doing stunts and
stuff<00:05:58.630> definitely<00:05:59.630> better<00:05:59.990> than<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.170> mCP<00:06:00.620> xbl

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
stuff definitely better than the mCP xbl

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.560 
stuff definitely better than the mCP xbl
almost<00:06:02.090> as<00:06:02.240> good<00:06:02.390> as<00:06:02.540> 130<00:06:03.020> X<00:06:03.230> I<00:06:04.420> recommend<00:06:05.420> it

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
almost as good as 130 X I recommend it

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.570 
almost as good as 130 X I recommend it
just<00:06:05.780> make<00:06:05.960> sure<00:06:06.170> if<00:06:06.560> you're<00:06:07.010> used<00:06:07.220> to<00:06:07.310> blade

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
just make sure if you're used to blade

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.130 
just make sure if you're used to blade
helicopters<00:06:08.180> like<00:06:08.300> I<00:06:08.480> am<00:06:08.630> you<00:06:08.780> get<00:06:08.930> used<00:06:09.080> to

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
helicopters like I am you get used to

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.040 
helicopters like I am you get used to
programming<00:06:09.710> things<00:06:09.920> and<00:06:10.750> handling<00:06:11.750> things

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
programming things and handling things

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.310 
programming things and handling things
that<00:06:12.230> are<00:06:12.350> not<00:06:13.840> what's<00:06:14.840> that<00:06:15.050> doing<00:06:15.260> is

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
that are not what's that doing is

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.110 
that are not what's that doing is
counting<00:06:15.440> down<00:06:15.590> if<00:06:16.520> you<00:06:16.700> used<00:06:16.880> two<00:06:16.940> blade

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
counting down if you used two blade

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.790 
counting down if you used two blade
helicopters<00:06:17.750> and<00:06:17.930> use<00:06:18.050> two<00:06:18.200> things<00:06:18.410> right<00:06:18.620> out

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
helicopters and use two things right out

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.400 
helicopters and use two things right out
of<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:18.980> box<00:06:19.510> working<00:06:20.510> even<00:06:20.810> though<00:06:21.020> even<00:06:21.230> with

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
of the box working even though even with

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.920 
of the box working even though even with
blades<00:06:21.680> sometimes<00:06:21.890> you<00:06:22.220> need<00:06:22.340> to<00:06:22.720> set<00:06:23.720> them<00:06:23.840> up

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
blades sometimes you need to set them up

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.110 
blades sometimes you need to set them up
might<00:06:24.860> want<00:06:25.010> to<00:06:25.040> sit<00:06:25.190> down<00:06:25.400> I<00:06:25.670> have<00:06:25.850> two<00:06:25.970> other

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
might want to sit down I have two other

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.520 
might want to sit down I have two other
videos<00:06:26.330> I'm<00:06:26.660> going<00:06:26.780> to<00:06:26.870> put<00:06:26.990> out<00:06:27.110> one<00:06:27.320> how<00:06:27.470> to

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
videos I'm going to put out one how to

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.580 
videos I'm going to put out one how to
change<00:06:27.800> the<00:06:27.950> pitch<00:06:28.780> on<00:06:29.780> your<00:06:29.990> blades<00:06:30.230> and

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
change the pitch on your blades and

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.170 
change the pitch on your blades and
adjust<00:06:31.250> that<00:06:31.430> through<00:06:31.730> the<00:06:31.790> flybarless

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
adjust that through the flybarless

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.000 
adjust that through the flybarless
system<00:06:32.660> which<00:06:32.810> is<00:06:32.930> very<00:06:33.140> easy<00:06:33.410> and<00:06:33.740> another

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
system which is very easy and another

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.210 
system which is very easy and another
one<00:06:34.220> that<00:06:34.970> is<00:06:35.030> going<00:06:35.450> to<00:06:35.810> be<00:06:36.170> how<00:06:36.680> to<00:06:36.740> program

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
one that is going to be how to program

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.910 
one that is going to be how to program
using<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.580> transmitter<00:06:38.150> for<00:06:38.420> stuff<00:06:38.690> like

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
using the transmitter for stuff like

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.850 
using the transmitter for stuff like
well<00:06:39.920> I'll<00:06:40.190> go<00:06:40.340> through<00:06:40.520> that<00:06:40.580> in<00:06:40.700> that<00:06:40.880> video

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
well I'll go through that in that video

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.720 
well I'll go through that in that video
the<00:06:42.860> one<00:06:42.980> you're<00:06:43.190> probably<00:06:43.220> gonna<00:06:43.520> want<00:06:43.670> to

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
the one you're probably gonna want to

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.360 
the one you're probably gonna want to
pay<00:06:43.850> attention<00:06:44.060> to<00:06:44.330> is<00:06:44.630> super<00:06:44.870> slow<00:06:45.370> startup

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
pay attention to is super slow startup

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.920 
pay attention to is super slow startup
type<00:06:46.670> all<00:06:47.630> right<00:06:47.870> I<00:06:48.370> like<00:06:49.370> it<00:06:49.600> if<00:06:50.600> you<00:06:50.750> can<00:06:50.840> get

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
type all right I like it if you can get

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.110 
type all right I like it if you can get
version<00:06:51.320> to<00:06:51.440> get<00:06:51.710> version<00:06:52.040> two<00:06:52.220> and<00:06:52.460> I'll<00:06:52.940> see

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
version to get version two and I'll see

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.420 
version to get version two and I'll see
you<00:06:53.210> guys<00:06:53.390> later
