00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
decrease in adverse medication events so

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.660 
decrease in adverse medication events so
we're<00:02:12.110> never<00:02:12.380> making<00:02:12.739> mistakes<00:02:13.459> with

paperwork that frees up the nurses so

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.680

the electronic health record is going to

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.510 
the electronic health record is going to

changes in health care really coincide
with<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.650> movement<00:04:08.040> toward<00:04:08.730> electronic

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
with the movement toward electronic

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.330 
with the movement toward electronic
records<00:04:09.720> if<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:10.590> want<00:04:10.800> to<00:04:10.890> have<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.070> more

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
records if we want to have a more

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.250 
records if we want to have a more
efficient<00:04:11.730> system<00:04:11.880> then<00:04:12.390> electronic<00:04:12.930> records

efficient system then electronic records

are<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.380> part<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.740> it<00:04:13.920> I'd<00:04:14.130> give<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.400> frank

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
are a part of it I'd give a frank

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.240 
are a part of it I'd give a frank
comment<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.690> my<00:04:15.930> physician<00:04:16.440> colleagues<00:04:16.470> and

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
comment to my physician colleagues and

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.990 
comment to my physician colleagues and
I'd<00:04:18.030> say<00:04:18.359> if<00:04:18.870> they<00:04:19.530> don't<00:04:19.770> evolve<00:04:20.220> they<00:04:20.820> will

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
I'd say if they don't evolve they will

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.760 
I'd say if they don't evolve they will
become<00:04:21.299> extinct<00:04:21.870> that

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
become extinct that

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.939 
become extinct that
evolution<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:24.270> cultural<00:04:24.690> adoption<00:04:25.229> has

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
evolution and the cultural adoption has

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.189 
evolution and the cultural adoption has
to<00:04:26.250> be<00:04:26.400> there<00:04:26.610> if<00:04:26.879> you<00:04:27.360> want<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.930> practice

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
to be there if you want to practice

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.010 
to be there if you want to practice
safer<00:04:29.069> if<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.400> want<00:04:29.789> to<00:04:29.910> practice<00:04:30.150> smarter

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
safer if you want to practice smarter

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.050 
safer if you want to practice smarter
and<00:04:31.199> if<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.770> want<00:04:32.039> to<00:04:32.190> do<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.669> right<00:04:32.789> thing

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
and if you want to do the right thing

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.730 
and if you want to do the right thing
for<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.389> patient<00:04:33.569> then<00:04:34.139> those<00:04:34.440> are<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
for the patient then those are the

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.680 
for the patient then those are the
reasons<00:04:34.889> that<00:04:35.159> you<00:04:35.280> become<00:04:35.849> a<00:04:35.909> physician<00:04:36.509> and

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
reasons that you become a physician and

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.869 
reasons that you become a physician and
those<00:04:37.349> are<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.590> reasons<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.220> use<00:04:38.639> this

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
those are the reasons to use this

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.780 
those are the reasons to use this
technology

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.850
