comments on asking for a shuckle sweep
so<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.269> thought<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.049> would<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.230> kind<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.529> cool

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
so I thought it would be kind of cool

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.240 
so I thought it would be kind of cool
and<00:00:16.980> fresh<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.750> shuffle<00:00:18.750> sweep<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.560> I'm

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
and fresh to do a shuffle sweep and I'm

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.730 
and fresh to do a shuffle sweep and I'm
also<00:00:20.430> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> attempt<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.480> time<00:00:21.779> sit

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
also going to attempt this time sit

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.529 
also going to attempt this time sit
tight<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> little<00:00:23.189> strategy<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.000> play<00:00:24.210> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
tight a little strategy and play to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.779 
tight a little strategy and play to
actually<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:25.080> use<00:00:25.320> any<00:00:25.590> our<00:00:25.920> boosts<00:00:26.369> because

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
actually not use any our boosts because

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.029 
actually not use any our boosts because
a<00:00:26.820> lot<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.119> people<00:00:27.390> said<00:00:27.599> oh<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.289> bet<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.800> can't

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
a lot of people said oh I bet you can't

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.759 
a lot of people said oh I bet you can't
do<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.490> sweep<00:00:30.000> without<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> boost<00:00:30.599> or<00:00:30.960> something

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
do a sweep without a boost or something

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.290 
do a sweep without a boost or something
along<00:00:31.920> those<00:00:32.130> lines<00:00:32.399> or<00:00:32.550> would<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:32.880> cool<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> do

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
along those lines or would be cool to do

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.139 
along those lines or would be cool to do
one<00:00:33.480> without<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.750> boost<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.969> thought<00:00:35.969> about

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
one without a boost so I thought about

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.819 
one without a boost so I thought about
that<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.450> lot<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.630> enough<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.350> came<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.710> it

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that a lot and enough and I came with it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.639 
that a lot and enough and I came with it
up<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.190> strategy<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> chuckle<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.260> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
up with a strategy with a chuckle so I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.850 
up with a strategy with a chuckle so I
hope<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.379> did

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.790 
actually take a very very long while to
do<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.879> yes<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.239> very<00:00:48.750> very<00:00:48.870> hard<00:00:49.200> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
do because yes it was very very hard to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.549

things off of my hip now and he stopped

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.700 
things off of my hip now and he stopped
of<00:01:03.809> these<00:01:03.960> are<00:01:04.430> bananas<00:01:05.430> which<00:01:06.409> is<00:01:07.409> quite<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
of these are bananas which is quite a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.030 
of these are bananas which is quite a
cool<00:01:07.920> name<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.250> Tropius<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
cool name for a Tropius so I go for the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.830 
cool name for a Tropius so I go for the
thunder<00:01:11.310> wave<00:01:11.460> he<00:01:11.670> sets<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> sunny<00:01:12.479> day

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
thunder wave he sets up the sunny day

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.100 
thunder wave he sets up the sunny day
I'm<00:01:13.520> guessing<00:01:14.520> his<00:01:14.700> next<00:01:15.090> move<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.299> most

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
I'm guessing his next move is most

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.710 
I'm guessing his next move is most
definitely<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> solar<00:01:17.369> beam<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
definitely going to be a solar beam so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.690 
definitely going to be a solar beam so
just<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> case<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.830> doesn't<00:01:20.070> truckload<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
just in case that doesn't truckload a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.640 
just in case that doesn't truckload a
damage<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.659> make<00:01:21.780> SATA<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.320> take<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
damage I going to make SATA to take the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.080 
damage I going to make SATA to take the
solar<00:01:22.890> beam<00:01:23.130> yeah<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.490> thinking<00:01:26.580> hear

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
solar beam yeah so I was thinking hear

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.780 
solar beam yeah so I was thinking hear
what<00:01:27.420> other<00:01:27.600> Moses<00:01:28.080> tropics<00:01:28.619> Tropius<00:01:29.189> could

good<00:01:53.640> wall<00:01:54.540> incapacities<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.560> with<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:56.070> bow

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
good wall incapacities now with a bow

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
good wall incapacities now with a bow
for<00:01:56.549> front<00:01:56.850> reflect<00:01:57.630> that's<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> bit<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.259> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
for front reflect that's a bit of a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.170 
for front reflect that's a bit of a
tongue<00:01:58.469> twister<00:01:58.619> sometime<00:01:59.189> reflect<00:01:59.969> and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
tongue twister sometime reflect and

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.780 
tongue twister sometime reflect and
light<00:02:00.390> screen<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:01.049> at<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.320> same<00:02:01.590> time<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.130> it

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
light screen up at the same time of it

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.670 
light screen up at the same time of it
obviously<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.540> Tropius<00:02:04.079> has<00:02:04.229> got<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> life

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
obviously this Tropius has got a life

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.900 
obviously this Tropius has got a life
orb<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.600> first<00:02:06.810> time<00:02:06.960> I've<00:02:07.049> actually

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
orb so it's the first time I've actually

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.089 
orb so it's the first time I've actually
faced<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.149> Tropius<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:10.050> fifth<00:02:10.470> gen<00:02:10.770> which<00:02:11.009> I

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
faced a Tropius in fifth gen which I

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.250 
faced a Tropius in fifth gen which I
found<00:02:11.340> pretty<00:02:11.430> cool<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.270> go<00:02:12.720> into<00:02:12.840> my<00:02:12.930> hunt

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
found pretty cool so I go into my hunt

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.760 
found pretty cool so I go into my hunt
tail

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
tail

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.490 
tail
so<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.550> idea<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.180> hunter<00:02:15.630> really<00:02:15.900> wasn't

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so the idea of this hunter really wasn't

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.440 
so the idea of this hunter really wasn't
to<00:02:16.970> do<00:02:17.970> much<00:02:18.300> for<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> accept<00:02:19.170> par<00:02:20.090> pass<00:02:21.090> my

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
to do much for the accept par pass my

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.610 
to do much for the accept par pass my
arm<00:02:21.980> my<00:02:22.980> awkward<00:02:23.430> off<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:24.440> regain<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> little

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
arm my awkward off to regain a little

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.800 
arm my awkward off to regain a little
bit<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.040> health<00:02:26.220> because<00:02:26.420> chuckle<00:02:27.420> we'll<00:02:27.600> need

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
bit of health because chuckle we'll need

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.680 
bit of health because chuckle we'll need
some<00:02:28.020> health<00:02:28.230> regen<00:02:28.800> because<00:02:29.250> I'm<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.450> really

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
some health regen because I'm not really

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.140 
some health regen because I'm not really
confident<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.470> rely<00:02:31.770> just<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:32.310> steady<00:02:32.760> because

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
confident to rely just on steady because

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.490 
confident to rely just on steady because
there's<00:02:33.330> too<00:02:33.510> many<00:02:33.630> priority<00:02:34.110> moves<00:02:34.320> out

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
there's too many priority moves out

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.910 
there's too many priority moves out
there<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:36.840> thing<00:02:37.110> really<00:02:37.440> actually<00:02:37.620> does

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
there so that thing really actually does

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.160 
there so that thing really actually does
have<00:02:38.070> got<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> prophecy<00:02:39.180> thing<00:02:39.330> I've<00:02:39.480> halo<00:02:39.930> that

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
have got a prophecy thing I've halo that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.900 
have got a prophecy thing I've halo that
it<00:02:40.320> really<00:02:40.710> does<00:02:41.010> now<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.340> think<00:02:41.460> about<00:02:41.730> it

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
it really does now I think about it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.420 
it really does now I think about it
anyway<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:42.810> I'm<00:02:43.140> going<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:43.770> go<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.920> my<00:02:44.100> hip<00:02:44.250> note

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
anyway so I'm going to go to my hip note

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.690 
anyway so I'm going to go to my hip note
and<00:02:44.670> spank<00:02:45.090> me<00:02:45.210> with<00:02:45.390> my<00:02:45.600> arm<00:02:45.870> yo-yo<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.700> my

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and spank me with my arm yo-yo and my

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.430 
and spank me with my arm yo-yo and my
light<00:02:48.090> screen<00:02:48.330> actually<00:02:48.690> wears<00:02:48.900> off<00:02:49.140> which

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
light screen actually wears off which

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.590 
light screen actually wears off which
doesn't<00:02:50.340> really<00:02:50.490> matter<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.850> guess<00:02:51.240> because

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
doesn't really matter a guess because

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.080 
doesn't really matter a guess because
Hypno's<00:02:52.110> quite<00:02:52.380> bulky<00:02:52.620> anyway<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> set<00:02:53.970> my

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
Hypno's quite bulky anyway so I set my

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.970 
Hypno's quite bulky anyway so I set my
trick<00:02:54.360> room<00:02:54.540> up<00:02:54.750> trick<00:02:55.140> room<00:02:55.380> if<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.650> don't

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
trick room up trick room if you don't

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.700 
trick room up trick room if you don't
know<00:02:56.160> actually<00:02:56.510> switches<00:02:57.510> dimensions<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.380> the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
know actually switches dimensions so the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.860 
know actually switches dimensions so the
slower<00:02:59.070> pokemon<00:02:59.700> will<00:02:59.940> actually<00:03:00.300> go<00:03:00.480> first

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
slower pokemon will actually go first

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.820 
slower pokemon will actually go first
for<00:03:01.230> five<00:03:01.500> turns<00:03:02.330> okay<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:04.320> get<00:03:04.710> my

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
for five turns okay so I get my

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.950 
for five turns okay so I get my
leftovers<00:03:05.280> recovery<00:03:05.760> reflect<00:03:06.360> does<00:03:06.660> wear<00:03:06.930> off

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
leftovers recovery reflect does wear off

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.990 
leftovers recovery reflect does wear off
but<00:03:07.350> that's<00:03:07.890> all<00:03:08.160> good<00:03:08.340> I'm<00:03:08.490> going<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.670> baton

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
but that's all good I'm going to baton

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.390 
but that's all good I'm going to baton
pass<00:03:09.180> out<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.870> I'm<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:10.740> go<00:03:10.860> into<00:03:11.280> my

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
pass out and I'm going to go into my

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.510 
pass out and I'm going to go into my
shuttle<00:03:11.760> here<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.350> idea<00:03:13.680> here<00:03:13.740> what<00:03:14.190> here

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
shuttle here so the idea here what here

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.800 
shuttle here so the idea here what here
was<00:03:15.050> to<00:03:16.050> first<00:03:16.530> use<00:03:17.100> power<00:03:17.700> trick<00:03:18.180> which

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
was to first use power trick which

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.560 
was to first use power trick which
actually<00:03:19.200> switches<00:03:19.709> my<00:03:19.920> defense<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.120> attack

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
actually switches my defense and attack

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.380 
actually switches my defense and attack
mode<00:03:21.840> around<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.670> let's<00:03:23.670> go<00:03:23.910> shackle

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
mode around so let's go shackle

00:03:26.390 --> 00:04:10.180 
mode around so let's go shackle
