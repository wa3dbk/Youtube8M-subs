00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.710 
gonna do I'm gonna let them spin for a
little<00:03:37.920> bit<00:03:38.010> longer<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.580> might<00:03:39.120> work

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
little bit longer that might work

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.750 
little bit longer that might work
we<00:03:40.349> don't<00:03:40.530> know<00:03:40.590> because<00:03:40.800> normally<00:03:41.069> we<00:03:41.190> we<00:03:41.550> tap

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
we don't know because normally we we tap

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.949 
we don't know because normally we we tap
it<00:03:41.879> maybe<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.120> little<00:03:42.269> bit<00:03:42.420> too<00:03:42.569> quick<00:03:42.780> maybe

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
it maybe a little bit too quick maybe

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.170 
it maybe a little bit too quick maybe
doesn't<00:03:43.290> get<00:03:43.890> good<00:03:44.099> enough<00:03:44.340> spin<00:03:44.879> on<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
doesn't get good enough spin on it to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.540 
doesn't get good enough spin on it to
land<00:03:45.569> on<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.810> four<00:03:46.019> star<00:03:46.319> alright<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:47.370> let's

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
land on the four star alright so let's

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.449 
land on the four star alright so let's
get<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:47.760> down<00:03:47.849> here<00:03:48.200> this<00:03:49.200> go<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.650> circle

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
get it down here this go in a circle

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.970 
get it down here this go in a circle
let's<00:03:50.700> go<00:03:50.819> clockwise<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:52.910> drop<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.090> in<00:03:54.980> so

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
let's go clockwise and drop it in so

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.860 
let's go clockwise and drop it in so
we're<00:03:56.069> gonna<00:03:56.130> let<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.370> spin<00:03:56.819> get<00:03:57.180> good<00:03:57.510> good

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
we're gonna let it spin get good good

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.960 
we're gonna let it spin get good good
spin<00:03:58.140> on<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:58.440> look<00:03:59.130> all<00:03:59.340> damn<00:03:59.519> little<00:03:59.760> bit<00:03:59.880> of

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
spin on that look all damn little bit of

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.880 
spin on that look all damn little bit of
particles<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:00.660> this<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:01.110> two<00:04:01.319> crystals<00:04:01.709> just

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
particles of this just two crystals just

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.320 
particles of this just two crystals just
coming<00:04:02.129> off<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.340> they're<00:04:02.519> ready<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:02.879> I'm
