first time I did the big chop and I
especially<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.530> side<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:52.560> just<00:00:52.800> seems

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
especially on this side it it just seems

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.760 
especially on this side it it just seems
very<00:00:53.280> slow<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.120> even<00:00:54.870> before<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.230> did<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> big

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
I think as well what's happened is like

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.270 
I think as well what's happened is like
I<00:01:04.460> put<00:01:05.460> share<00:01:05.820> butter<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.570> my<00:01:07.170> hair<00:01:07.439> because

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.310 
I put share butter on my hair because
everyone's<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:09.119> saying<00:01:09.420> how<00:01:09.630> share<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.140> is

excellent as but is wonderful but I

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.770 
excellent as but is wonderful but I

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
downstairs at the back of the house so

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.140 
downstairs at the back of the house so
that's<00:06:08.690> kind<00:06:09.080> of<00:06:09.200> a<00:06:09.320> trek<00:06:09.650> every<00:06:10.220> hour<00:06:10.460> on<00:06:10.670> you

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
that's kind of a trek every hour on you

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.320 
that's kind of a trek every hour on you
but<00:06:12.110> it's<00:06:12.470> proof<00:06:12.740> that<00:06:12.770> your<00:06:13.460> body<00:06:13.670> only<00:06:13.910> uses

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
but it's proof that your body only uses

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.990 
but it's proof that your body only uses
as<00:06:14.450> much<00:06:14.630> as<00:06:14.840> it<00:06:14.960> needs
