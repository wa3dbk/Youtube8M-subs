00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.670 

Jers<00:00:12.599> from<00:00:13.599> plunge

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
Jers from plunge

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.980 
Jers from plunge
housings<00:00:15.190> you'll<00:00:15.790> notice<00:00:16.180> on<00:00:16.390> this<00:00:16.660> because

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
housings you'll notice on this because

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.270 
housings you'll notice on this because
it's<00:00:17.320> a<00:00:17.470> single<00:00:17.710> actuator<00:00:18.510> both<00:00:19.510> the

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280 
it's a single actuator both the

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.140 
it's a single actuator both the
adjusters<00:00:21.280> are<00:00:21.940> on<00:00:22.510> one<00:00:22.810> plunger<00:00:23.760> that's<00:00:24.760> so

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
adjusters are on one plunger that's so

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.890 
adjusters are on one plunger that's so
that<00:00:25.390> as<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:26.189> actuator<00:00:27.189> pushes<00:00:28.090> on<00:00:28.510> the<00:00:28.660> wedge

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
that as the actuator pushes on the wedge

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.340 
that as the actuator pushes on the wedge
it<00:00:29.650> pushes<00:00:30.610> the<00:00:31.110> plungers<00:00:32.110> out<00:00:32.379> and<00:00:33.000> because

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it pushes the plungers out and because

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.799 
it pushes the plungers out and because
there's<00:00:35.350> only<00:00:35.559> one<00:00:35.860> side<00:00:36.160> being<00:00:36.460> actuated<00:00:37.090> we

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
there's only one side being actuated we

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.780 
there's only one side being actuated we
need<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.110> have<00:00:38.230> both<00:00:38.379> adjusters<00:00:39.190> on<00:00:39.400> it

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
need to have both adjusters on it

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.939 
need to have both adjusters on it
so<00:00:40.239> both<00:00:40.480> anchor<00:00:41.080> pins<00:00:41.350> will<00:00:41.559> be<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:41.830> the

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
so both anchor pins will be on the

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.150 
so both anchor pins will be on the
opposite<00:00:42.550> one<00:00:42.760> dealing<00:00:43.480> with<00:00:43.780> a<00:00:44.160> heavy-duty

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
opposite one dealing with a heavy-duty

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.830 
opposite one dealing with a heavy-duty
with<00:00:46.000> two<00:00:46.899> air<00:00:47.140> chambers<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:49.360> what<00:00:49.690> you'll

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
with two air chambers then what you'll

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.970 
with two air chambers then what you'll
do<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.290> you'll<00:00:50.470> have<00:00:50.680> an<00:00:51.090> adjuster<00:00:52.090> on<00:00:52.950> one<00:00:53.950> of

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
do is you'll have an adjuster on one of

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.510 
do is you'll have an adjuster on one of
the<00:00:54.190> plungers<00:00:55.980> housings<00:00:56.980> and<00:00:58.829> solid<00:00:59.829> one<00:01:00.250> on

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
the plungers housings and solid one on

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.950 
the plungers housings and solid one on
the<00:01:00.670> other<00:01:00.850> end<00:01:02.520> that's<00:01:03.520> the<00:01:04.270> design<00:01:04.690> of<00:01:04.930> that

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
the other end that's the design of that

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.230 
the other end that's the design of that
is<00:01:05.410> so<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:05.710> both<00:01:06.700> adjust<00:01:07.270> out<00:01:08.160> also<00:01:09.240> you'll

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
is so that both adjust out also you'll

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.630 
is so that both adjust out also you'll
have<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.690> adjuster<00:01:11.290> end<00:01:11.530> on<00:01:11.800> the<00:01:12.220> end<00:01:12.250> that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
have the adjuster end on the end that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.300 
have the adjuster end on the end that
takes<00:01:13.149> the<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.770> least<00:01:15.039> amount<00:01:15.369> of<00:01:15.550> force<00:01:17.310> when

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
takes the the least amount of force when

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.469 
takes the the least amount of force when
you<00:01:18.430> deal<00:01:18.670> with<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:18.940> double<00:01:20.159> actuator<00:01:21.159> as<00:01:22.030> the

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
you deal with a double actuator as the

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.510 
you deal with a double actuator as the
shoe<00:01:22.810> rotates<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.869> comes<00:01:26.530> out<00:01:26.770> into<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.250> drum

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
shoe rotates it comes out into the drum

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.300 
shoe rotates it comes out into the drum
and<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:29.290> wedges

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
and it wedges

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.910 
and it wedges
that's<00:01:30.700> called<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.240> self<00:01:31.540> energizing<00:01:32.380> action

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
that's called a self energizing action

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.149 
that's called a self energizing action
so<00:01:33.549> we<00:01:33.729> want<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.090> put<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:35.170> side<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.890> has<00:01:36.130> the

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
so we want to put the side that has the

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.140 
so we want to put the side that has the
most<00:01:36.670> force<00:01:37.240> from<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.930> wedging<00:01:38.350> action<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
most force from the wedging action to

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.230 
most force from the wedging action to
the<00:01:40.299> solid<00:01:40.780> plunger<00:01:41.439> if<00:01:42.100> we're<00:01:42.430> using<00:01:42.670> double

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
the solid plunger if we're using double

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.899 
the solid plunger if we're using double
actuated<00:01:43.780> this<00:01:44.290> is<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.500> single<00:01:44.979> actuator<00:01:45.369> will

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
actuated this is a single actuator will

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.749 
actuated this is a single actuator will
put<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.240> plungers<00:01:46.750> on<00:01:46.930> both<00:01:47.140> sides<00:01:47.549> again<00:01:48.549> the

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
put the plungers on both sides again the

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.380 
put the plungers on both sides again the
easy<00:01:48.939> way<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.000> back<00:01:52.030> together

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
easy way to get it back together

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.160 
easy way to get it back together
correctly<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.740> do<00:01:54.100> one<00:01:54.340> side<00:01:54.640> at<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:55.030> time<00:01:55.299> so

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
correctly is to do one side at a time so

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.719 
correctly is to do one side at a time so
that<00:01:56.320> you<00:01:56.439> have<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.650> reference<00:01:57.250> on<00:01:57.579> the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
that you have a reference on the

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.200 
that you have a reference on the
opposite<00:01:58.329> side<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:59.560> also<00:02:00.130> use<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.670> manuals

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
opposite side and also use the manuals

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.969 
opposite side and also use the manuals
so<00:02:02.049> we'll<00:02:02.409> take<00:02:02.860> off<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:04.110> these<00:02:05.110> are<00:02:05.320> guide

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
so we'll take off the these are guide

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.660 
so we'll take off the these are guide
plunger<00:02:06.850> guide<00:02:07.090> pins<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:08.500> keep<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.979> plungers

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
plunger guide pins to keep the plungers

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.460 
plunger guide pins to keep the plungers
from<00:02:10.030> turning<00:02:10.570> they<00:02:11.019> have<00:02:11.260> brass<00:02:13.110> seals<00:02:14.110> on

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
from turning they have brass seals on

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.680 
from turning they have brass seals on
them

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
them

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.170 
them
we'll<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:16.770> take<00:02:17.010> off<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.520> seals<00:02:17.790> very

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
we'll just take off the seals very

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.730 
we'll just take off the seals very
important<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.320> check<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.830> seals<00:02:20.160> to

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
important that we check the seals to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.380 
important that we check the seals to
make<00:02:22.740> sure<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.220> they're<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.610> good<00:02:23.760> shape

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
make sure that they're in good shape

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:35.230 
make sure that they're in good shape
there's<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:26.780> solid<00:02:27.780> plunger<00:02:29.420> for<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.600> side

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.420 

solid<00:02:36.240> plunger<00:02:36.720> for<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.110> side<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.710> then

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
solid plunger for that side and then

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:46.340 
solid plunger for that side and then
we'll<00:02:38.700> take<00:02:38.910> our<00:02:38.970> adjusters<00:02:39.720> out<00:02:45.350> the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
we'll take our adjusters out the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.340 
we'll take our adjusters out the
adjusters<00:02:46.980> use<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:48.020> pall<00:02:49.310> system<00:02:50.990> this<00:02:51.990> Paul

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
adjusters use a pall system this Paul

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.180 
adjusters use a pall system this Paul
these<00:02:52.710> Paul<00:02:53.100> teeth<00:02:54.200> will<00:02:55.200> ratchet<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.980> one

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
these Paul teeth will ratchet in one

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.180 
these Paul teeth will ratchet in one
direction<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:57.030> lock<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.780> other<00:02:58.190> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
direction and lock in the other the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.190 
direction and lock in the other the
design<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.880> them<00:02:59.970> allows<00:03:00.240> them<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.690> ratchet

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
design of them allows them to ratchet

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.390 
design of them allows them to ratchet
one<00:03:01.380> way<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:01.620> lock<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.460> other<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:04.400> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
one way but lock and the other and the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.270 
one way but lock and the other and the
reason<00:03:05.880> for<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:10.110> they<00:03:10.560> go<00:03:10.770> into<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
reason for that is that they go into the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.380 
reason for that is that they go into the
