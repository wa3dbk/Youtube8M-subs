00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.480
 pepe and I took stairs from the chain cope 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.990
 a point that knows little about everything from 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.610
 the form that has been produced and second 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.599
 what explanation has the change of Jorge 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.599
 molina by n'diayÃ© 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.690
 and good to see 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.570
 I think we have made a 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.880
 first part pretty good 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.050
 yes a pity not to go with a goal more I think 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.690
 that we had options to do it 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.699
 and in the second part 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.870
 the change of jorge as it is a 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:45.329
 my mistake because I want to want 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 protect kings because you're blinded 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.110
 touched because dan and zeballos have done 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.489
 played half an hour injured as fuck the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.829
 last half hour with ten because dani 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.010
 could not 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.980
 then to protect that to protect 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.079
 to kings the possibility that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.760
 we have a problem there because I have 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.220
 decided that change and I was wrong I 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.450
 he has made a mistake because 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.000
 because the second part does not 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.399
 the team has not reacted as I did 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.899
 I was waiting for Alfred's entrance 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.880
 made weaker instead of making us more 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.219
 powerful 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.130
 and the fault is mine and in fact the 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.509
 footballers that we do have to think 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.149
 we are on the third day of the 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.369
 second round and we have to tighten the 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.110
 teeth because we have all the 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.259
 intact options to make good 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.490
 things but I have to tell you that 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.259
 the first part I liked a lot and 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.259
 surely I second the spoils 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.200
 good pp is discipline of viva sevilla 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.570
 and deep light outside of self-criticism 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.800
 what you are doing and of recognizing your 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.590
 own mistakes 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.570
 believes that the second part there has been a 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.490
 some laziness or to call it some 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.040
 way too much confidence on the part of the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.710
 team no overconfidence is 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.930
 impossible because it is everything 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.340
 contrary 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.640
 we have the tightness of getting up 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.810
 the squeeze of reaching April with a 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.730
 good position for the final sprint 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.990
 inside there can never be sloppiness and less 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.920
 when a match you have it with a 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.990
 10 only not well it is true that the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.160
 ponferradine is not that I have had 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.350
 goal chances we have had 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.880
 all of the party I do not remember 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.270
 good if the berrocal the first 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.550
 apart and little more but yes that is true 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.500
 what my team did not like 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.690
 absolutely nothing in the second part 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.890
 it is also true I repeat again that 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.420
 we have played more than half an hour with ten 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.300
 footballers because dan and zeballos is 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.770
 injured the pool injury and the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.010
 injury this morning from xavi towers has 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.250
 been a rugged day but above all 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.170
 I'm going fucked home because I think that 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.030
 for protecting a football player with a card 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.720
 yellow you have to foresee what you could 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.130
 unconsciously pass the message 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.650
 that I have sent to the players is that 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.280
 they had to defend a result so 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.090
 so much the fault is mine 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.340
 and so the supreme good night jaime velasco 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.340
 Canal Sur Radio has been able to miss its 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.650
 physical equipment in that second half is 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.310
 complicated everything repeated have 11 in 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.850
 the field but in truth have 10 and 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.650
 running behind the ball 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.390
 continually 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.190
 and then it is complicated 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.830
 when I think we have made choices 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.050
 before that 55th or 60th minute of power 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.350
 win the game not quietly but 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.710
 follow with a wider marker not 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.140
 then we have the want to call fortune 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.690
 but at the last minute of discount the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.890
 good penalty also I think I think 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.120
 in my way of seeing I do not know why from 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.070
 the area does not look very good I think the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.140
 penalty that has been called is a penalty 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.970
 I think it's a penalty from where I am 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.980
 but I also think it's a penalty, not me 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.170
 jorge molina in the first part but 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.230
 well that at the end the referee whistles 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.850
 what do you see and 11 and we have to think about 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.220
 Albacete and we have to think that this 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.500
 It's very long and it's a race 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.900
 background that not that today we will not ascend 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.190
 much less in the month of May or 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.750
 forgiveness in March or that of 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.360
 February 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.670
 good evening radio seville chain be 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.320
 has recognized an error but the person 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.930
 the footballer who introduces in the field 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.280
 yesterday is that because it weakens 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.670
 the betis and I ask you also with the 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.060
 day and should not the futuristic betis that 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.790
 also cost to sign for its cost 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.130
 economic should not be stronger the 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.530
 good team that's the intention when 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.360
 one makes a change when one moves the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.580
 bank thinking about making a change 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.930
 always does it with the best intention 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.540
 then the players themselves are the 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.960
 that make a change good or bad 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.960
 has answered 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.040
 I was wrong because because the 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.330
 message to the best that I give to the 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.650
 footballers is that you have to keep 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.660
 a result that what I'm saying 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.460
 but then alfred because maybe not 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.960
 but like the rest in the second part 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.260
 they have not been there have not been any 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.390
 none to the height that they can 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.490
 be but yes it is true that I return to 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.740
 repeat that my decision to do that 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.270
 I change the message that I send to the team 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.220
 Maybe it's not the right one, it's not the 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:24.040
 successful and there comes the fault 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.860
 two weeks ago there was a lot of euphoria not 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.800
 the results gave for it now what 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.020
 message would launch or give to the 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.940
 own players in principle no longer 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.300
 what we said we are day 3 second 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.300
 return 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.980
 we are two points from the first all 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.720
 for playing everything to decide to see if 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.970
 we recover people we will see the 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.430
 part of casualties to do that yes I 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.050
 Worry because pool is discarded 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.650
 xavi towers this morning has very good 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.560
 pinta zeballos has injured good we go 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.639
 to see bruno is expelled 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.199
 Alfred has five cards too 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.199
 I already have to think about that 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:12.360
 xavi had a problem with portillo yesterday 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:15.419
 we thought it was not important but at 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.399
 final yes it is and he could not have 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.360
 the quadriceps inflamed and could not 

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:20.360
 to compete
