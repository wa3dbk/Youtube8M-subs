00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello I'm proud and I represent the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.630
 esr group i will introduce you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.460
 today the recipe for a rooster but to 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.099
 mushrooms for the recipe 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 so we need to 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.910
 mushrooms here marinated mushrooms 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.590
 chanterelle mushrooms and shallots 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.990
 chiseled and chervil 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.650
 we will start by heating 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.450
 of utensils so is a pan 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.520
 specific with a very thick bottom and 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.739
 so it allows to store so the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.219
 heat and leather without fat we go 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.469
 so proceed to cooking the cockerels 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.870
 so temperature control of 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.680
 the utensil and then I put them 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.600
 skin-side cockerels directly into the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.320
 pan 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.350
 we cook without fat 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.520
 only with the meat inside 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.220
 is what makes it possible not to have 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.930
 adding fat during cooking and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.229
 no breeding burned so no hitch 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.840
 legacy 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.280
 after ten minutes of cooking on the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.790
 paul sides we're going to divert the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.880
 cockerels to color them 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.850
 on the other side we hijacked the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.380
 cockerels after ten minutes 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.880
 we will write on our easy you 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.790
 can you see that they do not have 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.530
 paste even without adding greece to this 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.050
 cooking stage so cockerels are 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.270
 almost are almost cooked we 're going 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.680
 so add the filling so the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.250
 trim so that consists of 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.470
 chanterelles and white mushrooms so 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.520
 the trim so and deposited around the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.600
 cockerels always without addition of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:50.800
 fat and so I rest the lid 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.770
 which will allow to write to the smothered to 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.570
 this stage the trim has been added and there 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.780
 we are going to add ourselves 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.150
 now to an aromatic garnish 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.240
 composed of shallots and chervil 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.240
 chased 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.800
 we will continue slightly 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.830
 cooking for two or three minutes 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.890
 with the aromatic filling and I 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.569
 therefore pushes back the special cover that 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.240
 allows the steam to flow to make 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.740
 drop the juices back inside so 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.600
 now you know leather to the cochlea 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.800
 with its little mushrooms keeping 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.800
 all its flavor and vitamins
