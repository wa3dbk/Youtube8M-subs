00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello dear friends miss from 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.069
 alexey we are starting a new company 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.280
 cut in gallium in the game 3 m 2 total war 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.139
 but before we start we will make it also by 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.310
 analogies as and because of the original 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.990
 we will give the company a choice 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.470
 passing this company to you so 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:28.230
 we are 4 frax and Rome itself where you can play 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:32.579
 for the most julia caesar or faithful post 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.090
 who somehow do not exactly remember their name 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.809
 some kind of what are you hot on 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.760
 ends up for freedoms it is German 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.829
 tribes and energies are squirrel tribes 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.840
 more about them I will start here 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.460
 it is clear that there is a war brewing 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 could have been avoided but she would 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.480
 very profitable Julius Caesar reigns in Gaul 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.850
 chaos used Rome 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.980
 blow off the food and suffered a crushing 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.899
 defeat from neighboring neighboring tribes 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.020
 German worms pushed worms 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.790
 forced to migrate to southern gallium 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.590
 I don't have tickets, but you are here 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.450
 pretty 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.270
 after all , southern gallium c occupying 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.520
 the position of proconsul of the protection of gallia and 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.350
 Illyria understands that the invasion of Gaul 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.969
 serve not only to spread 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.479
 the authorities of Rome but also the strengthening of it 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:29.299
 own influence in the senate and so or 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.479
 the loyal are the Gallic warriors available 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.569
 one province 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.619
 More precisely one settlement in my opinion she 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.810
 the capital is 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.090
 at one time or true were one of 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.340
 the most powerful tribes himself trike 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.310
 central Ghalib have not yet suffered 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.079
 defeat by the Romans 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.819
 one hundred and twenty first year of our era in 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.310
 as a result, they were forced to yield 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.599
 Rome and some neighboring tribes 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.849
 part of their lands 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:58.670
 so now I can not wait to bring 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:01.489
 old abacus at the start of the campaign 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.159
 or faithful with the support of boobs from to 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.229
 Islands have already defeated food and 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.849
 some 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.910
 which protects rome except 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.590
 moreover, the extinction of his sight 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.510
 moved southern gallium in which 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.100
 there was complete chaos for or where 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.680
 love is just an ideal opportunity 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.790
 try to retake Gaul 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.950
 entirely with you invaders from Germany with 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.810
 in you or our people in a different way them 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.120
 call this union militancy 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.019
 warlike Germanic tribes speaking 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.790
 in the same language and the same worshipers 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.950
 same gods led by the leader 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.930
 arif ariovist they helped cekva us in 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.599
 their fight against second-hand could trouble 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.290
 because of what cekva did not give them a part 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.590
 their lands 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.250
 having mastered the land behind your rhine you can 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.780
 take advantage of the chaos caused 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.170
 relocation of tickets southern gallium 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.530
 him try to go 2 bst wine 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.620
 throughout the region to further strengthen 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.010
 their positions 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.590
 but the energy of the most important of builds 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.830
 most fearless fiercely of all tribes 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.550
 squirrel in northern gallium they sacredly honor 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.230
 Traditions of their claim are explained 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.069
 spartan lifestyle despising luxury 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.840
 avoiding drunkenness and tail fitted from 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.599
 can count on support 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.450
 many allied tribes and now when 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.730
 suddenly I overpowered the tickets plunged 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.819
 house southern gallium in front of us 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.290
 many opportunities 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.660
 considering what exactly they managed to give 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.780
 repulse of the roman invaders in the thick of the earth 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.130
 galls nerve hardly 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.290
 resist such a tempting 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.830
 perspective 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.830
 Well, here are the four factions that is 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.860
 rome is roman culture 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.209
 tarver on i'm so gallic culture svb 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.370
 This is a German or Celtic culture 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.190
 energies also support the Celtic 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:10.390
 culture they are related 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:13.500
 soul to all guests of the tribes and for whom 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.600
 play here already see for yourself 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.959
 location that is nerves and they are in 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.530
 principle is on the edge of the map 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.870
 capturing only one city alone 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.560
 subjugate completely the province and already 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.810
 there you can move in all directions along 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.730
 your buff is a bit like everything here 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.140
 is Rome velveteen and which 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:46.200
 patronage patronize kings 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:46.200
 we from the north go the same energies there 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.910
 wear some of the Celtic tribes too 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.740
 that is, it will also be quite difficult 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:59.650
 Sar faithful there is a misfortune so sad 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.710
 as from all sides we are surrounded in 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.840
 principle as well as enemies and allies 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.770
 can use and confederation 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.950
 create your alliances and already together 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.520
 try to defend against Rome but behind Rome 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:19.390
 here everything is clearly losing this province and go 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.390
 captures everything around this 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.930
 companies here the company will be held 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:30.270
 not like the original 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.220
 24 years are available for us for about a year. 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.930
 each turn is two weeks that is 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:40.229
 a fortnight again there will be times 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.990
 years such as spring winter summer and autumn 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:47.280
 where in the winter we will lose troops from 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:50.580
 cold when moving and will also 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:55.050
 debuff and food production cities 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.720
 by public order and so on that 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.289
 will give even more contrast in the most 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.410
 companies so what else can you say yes 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:09.060
 each of the commanders in four factions 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:11.520
 will have the ability to feature in 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.860
 which can not die, that is possible 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.990
 lose the battle but the general wo n't die 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.970
 he will be wounded and after several moves 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.780
 he will recover and be able to again 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:26.070
 lead any of the squads or 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.680
 any of the army about 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.800
 civil war here did something 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.870
 another came up with such a thing as 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:39.080
 if we let us play barbaric 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.080
 tribes that after some time 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.530
 will be the invasion of the Romans let's say 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.830
 there will be a lot 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.430
 the army of Rome, which will come from the shore 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.020
 shores 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:57.180
 here here here in liguria and go 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.110
 shred everything and everything as far as if 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.470
 play for rome 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:04.040
 then barbarian tribes enclose anius 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.690
 after some time and just as well 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.220
 a lot of army will be erected and us 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.650
 will have even harder 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.710
 from them to fight it come 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.780
 necessarily in any case and but how 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.350
 sooner or later everything will depend 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:22.020
 from us, well, guys, now the choice is only 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.810
 it remains for you for whom we will 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.880
 pass this company will do

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:37.700

 will help determine the choice of home and 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:44.150
