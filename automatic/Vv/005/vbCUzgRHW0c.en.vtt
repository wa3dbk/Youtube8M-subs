00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:26.319
 for the filling we will use a fresh sausage minced beef veal 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.210
 we make a bed with potatoes onions and we put 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.200
 the carrot 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.980
 veiled the grapes and the penalties 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.050

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.700
 everything above 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.700

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.190
 and the white wine glass 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.810

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.270
 go well 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.250
 the podium 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.990
 what we are going to do is tell it when marte roads 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.780
 If you do not have more effective 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.740
 was to use butter without problems 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.380
 the hotel is oriented everywhere 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.380
 let's do for the fill as its amount 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.230
 we leave the skin 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.710
 we mix the minced meat with the pasta 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.860
 for both the flesh of the mosques 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.340
 stay in nothing 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 and we will start to withdraw 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.130
 coppola five floors 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.760
 to finish 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.020
 let's go tell me 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.770
 so that it does not come out and we're going to do it 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.770
 Half lemon 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.790
 We put in the oven tray value how certain degrees have been generated 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.600
 one hour minimum 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.780
 and so we have left 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.810
 after a little bit of weight to a little bit of filling equal position 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.160
