00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.390
 moisturize and give a turner to my face 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.180
 I use this other that is the brand 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.500
 glory procured him much that in the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.110
 products that I will use for my 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.050
 face do not contain alcohol that after 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.450
 of each exfoliator and tied it with a 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.750
 cotton I put on all my faces and in 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.050
 massages or my skin shines makeup this 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.520
 product that is northeast is the 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.070
 illuminator and it became my favorite 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.770
 favorite apart because it illuminates gives you a 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.690
 color to the hard face is not that 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.360
 illuminator is that it is given as the plasta 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.880
 white yes huge is not in cream tone 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.010
 can fade much better to the face 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.350
 so you will be asked a very man 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.010
 Illuminator is the one I recommend 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.489
 wendy vice cake heat today I 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.100
 colors fascinate tones this 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.570
 has matte colors that are those of 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.120
 they want something that does not contain brightness the 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.890
 rest does contain brightness so if not 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.540
 you're one of the girls who like the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.340
 shine if you do not like it good is not something 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.590
 that the best one could recommend 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.470
 for example that everything is blue now 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.640
 but he says it a bit with the black 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.319
 so that it did not look so 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.690
 glossy and more because I use it from 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.090
 the day this makeup has become 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.940
 in one of my loves lately is something 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.450
 that I use daily and more for the 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.140
 time to go to work then used 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.660
 this is the roller of garnier to the 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.549
 I have seen an improvement at the beginning 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.700
 not without that so effective that you use it 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.829
 since I said good I applied it and what 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.930
 it happened through my dark circles they did not cover 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.510
 help to eliminate them but not for 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.480
 correct because I chose to do was this 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.569
 apply a little in the dark circles me what 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.970
 applied I let it dry and then benicarlÃ³ 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.340
 Blurred me works excellent is very 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.440
 difficult to find a good make-up remover 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.900
 to avoid us the next morning 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.180
 appear with the eyes of raccoons and 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.980
 Eyelash glue also without 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.049
 the wheels we put the plants of 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.290
 mascara all that I take away as household 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.290
 it's running out and it's blue sonic and it 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.719
 I bought it in target for the body 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.030
 and to bathe it is very important not to dry 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:20.400
 completely your body that absorbs it 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.680
 body the water by itself that we're going 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.620
 to help a little more apart from taking 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.080
 water that gets hydrated on the skin I use 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.900
 this by the way as I bring it as 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.050
 this is all whitey east is east of 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.289
 cocoa butter procoin helps 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.720
 soften and hydrate show another 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.210
 product and nobody comes close to the warmth 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.669
 to see is that we do not have time to go to 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.410
 Tanning a tanning bed is not 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.870
 like a tan that will stay with you 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.729
 instant perez day and used it to 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.280
 my arms for my legs like 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.240
 tan and shining times it contains 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.910
 Jojoba oil and olive oil 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.820
 I'm going to show you this mega 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.600
 and it's 13 m really that all the 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.510
 collection for heat protector 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.300
 the musel spray I think this brand is 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.920
 one of my favorites and smells rich that's 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.570
 the brand that you have today the truth that 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.600
 I recommend it many of you have 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.760
 asked about what I do to them 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.590
 that the curls last longer they look more 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.020
 defined when it is one more event 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.120
 special this product of the umbro brand 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.970
 that really me it has worked 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.100
 perfectly or curls that really 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.410
 you do not want to keep in place without having 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.590
 that apply neither the spray or the musel gel 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.020
 before praying the this is a wax for 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.050
 This hair was used before 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.690
 apply the pincer I apply only very 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.470
 little in the lock and then used 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.260
 the curling iron and the curl is super-defined 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.210
 that brightness cited and apart that not the 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.940
 abuse that they have vitamin e for 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.490
 the hair to a thermal product and that 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.980
 I showed a video of the well 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.680
 purchases are then set looks like 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.990
 half stretched and it was only 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.180
 with this and all I did was hold 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.850
 my hair give it a few twists 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.990
 how many seconds and remove them has 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.480
 charmed 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.890
 the argan products are not seen and 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.500
 Normally when we apply something 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.900
 hot the hair usually gets dry and 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.270
 that's why we resort to oils 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.000
 to shine the hair in this 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.560
 I do not recommend it that good 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.270
 girls this as it is because of what 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.400
 has done boring I only wanted 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.530
 show you some products that I used 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.510
