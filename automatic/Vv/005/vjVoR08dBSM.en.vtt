range in particle for right now is

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.589 
range in particle for right now is
because<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.699> actually<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.480> be

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
going to show you guys how to set this

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.200 
going to show you guys how to set this
up<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.329> how<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.190> activate<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.489> feature<00:00:41.670> for

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
up and how to activate the feature for

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.760 
up and how to activate the feature for
those<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.629> guys<00:00:42.780> don't<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.170> how<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.620> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
those of you guys don't know how can you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
those of you guys don't know how can you
do<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.430> those<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.030> who<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.329> unaware

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
do this for those of you who are unaware

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.090 
do this for those of you who are unaware
of<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> head<00:00:46.320> tracking<00:00:46.500> feature<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.980> this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
of the head tracking feature in this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.750 
of the head tracking feature in this
game<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:48.000> never<00:00:48.600> heard<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.200> before

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
game or have never heard of it before

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.400 
game or have never heard of it before
basically<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.199> use

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
basically what this is is that you use

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.500 
basically what this is is that you use
the<00:00:52.440> Kinect<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> Kinect<00:00:54.059> does<00:00:54.270> is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the Kinect and what the Kinect does is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.510 
the Kinect and what the Kinect does is
that<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.870> senses<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.500> head<00:00:55.829> movement<00:00:56.309> which

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that it senses your head movement which

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910 
that it senses your head movement which
will<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.789> used<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.270> game<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.289> let<00:00:58.469> me<00:00:58.590> say<00:00:58.770> that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
will be used in game so let me say that

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.500 
will be used in game so let me say that
are<00:00:59.039> trying<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> pilot<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.879> jet<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
are trying to pilot a jet in the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.660 
are trying to pilot a jet in the
multiplayer<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.199> party<00:01:01.500> food<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
multiplayer of party food for what the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.359 
multiplayer of party food for what the
camera<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.449> actually<00:01:04.439> connect<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.189> work

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
camera will do actually connect to work

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
camera will do actually connect to work
along<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.090> camera<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.900> actually<00:01:06.960> detect

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
along with the camera to actually detect

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.920 
along with the camera to actually detect
where<00:01:07.860> you're<00:01:08.040> looking<00:01:08.390> from<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> in-game

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
where you're looking from the in-game

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.350 
where you're looking from the in-game
perspective<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.830> whenever<00:01:11.729> whatever<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
perspective so whenever whatever you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.660 
perspective so whenever whatever you
look<00:01:12.659> basically<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.530> camera<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:14.310> it's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
look basically the camera is where it's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
look basically the camera is where it's
going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.970> look<00:01:15.150> as<00:01:15.299> well<00:01:15.540> rather<00:01:16.080> than<00:01:16.320> just

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
going to look as well rather than just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.289 
going to look as well rather than just
using<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.950> controller<00:01:17.340> which<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.850> precise

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
using a controller which is this precise

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.090 
using a controller which is this precise
now<00:01:18.600> let's<00:01:18.840> start<00:01:19.049> discussing<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> positive

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
now let's start discussing the positive

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100 
now let's start discussing the positive
aspects<00:01:20.700> about<00:01:21.180> using<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> head<00:01:21.840> tracking

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
aspects about using the head tracking

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.380 
aspects about using the head tracking
feature<00:01:22.350> now<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.670> first<00:01:23.909> thing<00:01:24.000> about<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
feature now the first thing about the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
feature now the first thing about the
head<00:01:24.540> tracking<00:01:24.750> feature<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.619> find<00:01:26.310> is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
head tracking feature that I find is

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
head tracking feature that I find is
really<00:01:26.490> interesting<00:01:27.180> about<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.840> that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
really interesting about this is that

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
really interesting about this is that
you<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.350> better<00:01:28.590> perspective<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.340> your

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you get a better perspective of your

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160 
you get a better perspective of your
environment<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.210> you're<00:01:30.360> piloting<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.140> jet

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
environment when you're piloting a jet

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.710 
environment when you're piloting a jet
or<00:01:31.619> when<00:01:32.220> you're<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.460> any<00:01:32.759> other<00:01:33.000> vehicle<00:01:33.509> it's

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
or when you're in any other vehicle it's

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.170 
or when you're in any other vehicle it's
much<00:01:33.960> easier<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> use<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.130> also<00:01:35.400> responds

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
much easier to use and it also responds

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.660 
much easier to use and it also responds
much<00:01:36.509> faster<00:01:36.990> than<00:01:37.409> uza<00:01:37.770> than<00:01:38.250> using<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
much faster than uza than using a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.880 
much faster than uza than using a
controller<00:01:39.180> since<00:01:40.079> you're<00:01:40.259> basically<00:01:40.829> just

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
controller since you're basically just

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.710 
controller since you're basically just
moving<00:01:41.400> your<00:01:41.490> head<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> same<00:01:42.450> time

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
moving your head and at the same time

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.929 
moving your head and at the same time
that<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.020> move<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.500> move<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.710> head<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
that you move as you move your head the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.090 
that you move as you move your head the
camera<00:01:45.299> angles<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.930> moving<00:01:46.290> along<00:01:46.619> with<00:01:46.860> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
camera angles is moving along with you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.920 
camera angles is moving along with you
which<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.549> something<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.270> pretty<00:01:48.479> cool<00:01:48.750> so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
which is something that's pretty cool so

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.380 
which is something that's pretty cool so
it's<00:01:49.079> much<00:01:49.829> faster<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.310> detect<00:01:50.640> enemies<00:01:51.149> which

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it's much faster to detect enemies which

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.969 
it's much faster to detect enemies which
are<00:01:51.540> either<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.110> your<00:01:52.229> left<00:01:52.439> or<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.799> your<00:01:52.829> right

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
are either to your left or to your right

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.069 
are either to your left or to your right
which<00:01:53.729> will<00:01:53.820> benefit<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> player<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
which will benefit you as a player and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.870 
which will benefit you as a player and

about<00:01:57.479> using<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.930> head<00:01:58.200> review<00:01:58.469> feature<00:01:58.680> is

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
about using this head review feature is

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.910 
about using this head review feature is
that<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.850> don't<00:02:00.210> actually<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
that you don't actually have to

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.770 
that you don't actually have to
completely<00:02:01.920> turn<00:02:02.250> your<00:02:02.430> head<00:02:02.670> sideways<00:02:03.030> for

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
completely turn your head sideways for

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.480 
completely turn your head sideways for
camera<00:02:04.079> angles<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.560> change<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.189> reason

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
camera angles to change the reason

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.940 
camera angles to change the reason
behind<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.840> Kinect<00:02:07.320> system<00:02:07.560> is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
behind this is that the Kinect system is

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.420 
behind this is that the Kinect system is
actually<00:02:08.520> very<00:02:08.670> precise<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:09.660> calculating

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
actually very precise when calculating

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.690 
actually very precise when calculating
where<00:02:11.430> your<00:02:11.610> head<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:11.849> moving<00:02:12.150> so

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
where your head is moving so

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.880 
where your head is moving so
need<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.060> move<00:02:13.209> your<00:02:13.450> head<00:02:13.629> completely<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.739> the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
need to move your head completely to the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.619 
need to move your head completely to the
right<00:02:14.920> or<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.310> don't<00:02:15.520> need<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:16.060> completely

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
right or you don't need to a completely

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.150 
right or you don't need to a completely
rotated<00:02:17.170> towards<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.650> left<00:02:17.860> or<00:02:18.010> something

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
rotated towards the left or something

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.809 
rotated towards the left or something
like<00:02:18.340> this

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
like this

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.759 
like this
we<00:02:19.030> just<00:02:19.269> need<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.540> slightly<00:02:19.840> tilt<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.500> or

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
we just need to slightly tilt it or

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.830 
we just need to slightly tilt it or
slightly<00:02:21.250> turn<00:02:21.459> your<00:02:21.489> head<00:02:21.760> towards<00:02:22.599> any

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
slightly turn your head towards any

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.199 
slightly turn your head towards any
direction<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.560> wish<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
direction that you wish to and the

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.270 
direction that you wish to and the
Kinect<00:02:25.540> will<00:02:25.720> respond<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:27.160> other

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
Kinect will respond to that in other

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.520 
Kinect will respond to that in other
words<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.670> sensitivity<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.540> high<00:02:28.569> which

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
words the sensitivity is high which

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.839 
words the sensitivity is high which
allows<00:02:29.769> players<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.220> actually<00:02:30.580> quickly

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
allows players to actually quickly

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.210 
allows players to actually quickly
locate<00:02:31.269> other<00:02:31.959> players<00:02:32.349> much<00:02:32.590> faster<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
locate other players much faster and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.040 
locate other players much faster and
have<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.610> faster<00:02:33.940> response<00:02:34.060> when<00:02:34.540> detecting

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
have a faster response when detecting

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.020 
have a faster response when detecting
enemies<00:02:35.440> approaching<00:02:36.069> towards<00:02:36.310> your<00:02:36.550> vehicle

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
enemies approaching towards your vehicle

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.550 
enemies approaching towards your vehicle
which<00:02:37.239> is<00:02:37.269> something<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.630> will<00:02:37.870> benefit<00:02:38.380> you

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
which is something that will benefit you

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.250 
which is something that will benefit you
as<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.769> player<00:02:39.099> in<00:02:39.700> terms<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.180> using<00:02:41.140> the

now moving on to the second part of this
video<00:02:44.560> we'll<00:02:44.830> be<00:02:45.010> discussing<00:02:45.400> whether<00:02:45.730> the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
video we'll be discussing whether the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.970 
video we'll be discussing whether the
head<00:02:46.750> tracking<00:02:47.049> feature<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.410> battlefield<00:02:47.799> 4

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
head tracking feature in battlefield 4

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.850 
head tracking feature in battlefield 4
is<00:02:48.010> actually<00:02:48.630> useful<00:02:49.630> when<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.230> are<00:02:50.349> playing

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
is actually useful when you are playing

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.520 
is actually useful when you are playing
as<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.069> normal<00:02:51.430> soldier<00:02:51.840> for<00:02:52.840> those<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:53.079> you<00:02:53.200> who

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
as a normal soldier for those of you who

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.350 
as a normal soldier for those of you who
don't<00:02:53.799> know<00:02:53.920> about<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.400> is<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.940> leaning<00:02:55.239> in

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
don't know about this is the leaning in

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.539 
don't know about this is the leaning in
and<00:02:55.510> laying<00:02:55.810> out<00:02:55.989> feature<00:02:56.319> where<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.250> Kinect

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
and laying out feature where the Kinect

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.770 
and laying out feature where the Kinect
will<00:02:57.640> actually<00:02:57.940> detect<00:02:58.299> whether<00:02:58.540> you're

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
will actually detect whether you're

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.509 
will actually detect whether you're
leaning<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.440> or<00:02:59.650> letting<00:02:59.920> out<00:03:00.069> out<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.370> your

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
leaning in or letting out out of your

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.339 
leaning in or letting out out of your
chair<00:03:00.910> or<00:03:00.940> something<00:03:01.299> like<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.630> now<00:03:02.170> one<00:03:02.319> of

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
chair or something like this now one of

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.170 
chair or something like this now one of
the<00:03:02.530> few<00:03:02.709> positive<00:03:03.190> aspects<00:03:03.640> about<00:03:03.730> using

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
the few positive aspects about using

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.720 
the few positive aspects about using
this<00:03:04.329> feature<00:03:04.660> when<00:03:05.560> using<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.280> Kinect<00:03:06.579> for

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
this feature when using the Kinect for

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.360 
this feature when using the Kinect for
the<00:03:06.819> Xbox<00:03:07.180> one<00:03:07.390> is<00:03:07.660> that<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.500> responds<00:03:08.950> faster

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
the Xbox one is that it responds faster

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.610 
the Xbox one is that it responds faster
to<00:03:09.519> your<00:03:09.640> movement<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.810> when<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.079> lean<00:03:11.380> out

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
to your movement so when you lean out

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.199 
to your movement so when you lean out
it's<00:03:11.980> much<00:03:12.160> faster<00:03:12.340> than<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.790> using<00:03:13.120> a

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
it's much faster than you using a

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.960 
it's much faster than you using a
controller<00:03:13.630> which<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.370> which<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.519> something<00:03:15.670> I

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
controller which is which is something I

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.580 
controller which is which is something I
again<00:03:16.360> mentioned<00:03:16.780> at<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.930> beginning<00:03:17.109> of<00:03:17.440> this

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
again mentioned at the beginning of this

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.710 
again mentioned at the beginning of this
video<00:03:17.829> another<00:03:18.670> thing<00:03:18.880> about<00:03:19.000> this<00:03:19.299> is<00:03:19.540> that

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
video another thing about this is that

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.940 
video another thing about this is that
it<00:03:19.870> works<00:03:20.079> very<00:03:20.170> well<00:03:20.410> with<00:03:20.620> fully<00:03:20.920> automatic

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
it works very well with fully automatic

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.460 
it works very well with fully automatic
weapon<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:22.450> either<00:03:22.660> when<00:03:22.900> you're<00:03:23.019> using<00:03:23.170> the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
weapon so either when you're using the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.550 
weapon so either when you're using the
assault<00:03:23.769> class<00:03:23.980> or<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.370> engineer<00:03:24.760> or<00:03:24.850> the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
support class this will work really well

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.080 
support class this will work really well
with<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:28.989> this<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.769> huge<00:03:30.400> advantage

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
with that and this is a huge advantage

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.150 
with that and this is a huge advantage
towards<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.720> support<00:03:31.900> class<00:03:32.319> in<00:03:32.560> parkour<00:03:32.920> for

towards the support class in parkour for
if<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.940> think<00:03:34.150> about<00:03:34.389> this<00:03:34.569> the<00:03:34.930> support

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
if you think about this the support

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.800 
if you think about this the support
class<00:03:35.470> could<00:03:35.859> easily<00:03:36.209> just<00:03:37.209> cap<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.540> on

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
class could easily just cap it on

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.050 
class could easily just cap it on

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
you're trying to capture an objective

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.860 
you're trying to capture an objective
and<00:03:45.549> you're<00:03:45.700> actually<00:03:45.880> how<00:03:46.209> did<00:03:46.389> you<00:03:46.480> hit<00:03:46.630> when

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
and you're actually how did you hit when

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.720 
and you're actually how did you hit when
you're<00:03:46.959> using<00:03:47.139> this<00:03:47.380> feature<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:48.190> only<00:03:48.459> your

you're using this feature is only your

you're using this feature is only your
head<00:03:48.970> actually<00:03:49.420> shows<00:03:49.660> when<00:03:49.959> you're<00:03:50.109> leaving

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
head actually shows when you're leaving

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.099 
head actually shows when you're leaving
out<00:03:50.590> using<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.160> leaning<00:03:52.090> feature<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:52.690> as<00:03:52.870> for

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
out using the leaning feature so as for

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.569 
out using the leaning feature so as for
the<00:03:53.200> snipers<00:03:53.650> who<00:03:53.799> try<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.100> take<00:03:54.280> you<00:03:54.549> out

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
the snipers who try to take you out

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.550 
the snipers who try to take you out
they'll<00:03:54.940> have<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.329> really<00:03:56.109> hard<00:03:56.290> time<00:03:56.380> trying

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
they'll have a really hard time trying

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.860 
they'll have a really hard time trying
to<00:03:56.980> aim<00:03:57.250> at<00:03:57.519> your<00:03:57.730> head<00:03:57.910> just<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.420> take<00:03:58.599> you<00:03:58.750> out

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
to aim at your head just to take you out

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.360 
to aim at your head just to take you out
so<00:03:59.109> this<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.349> a<00:03:59.440> really<00:03:59.650> good<00:03:59.859> advantage

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
so this is a really good advantage

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.580 
so this is a really good advantage
towards<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.849> support<00:04:01.239> class<00:04:01.440> when<00:04:02.440> you're

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
trying to capture an objective which is

least<00:04:04.840> effective<00:04:05.440> when<00:04:05.620> using<00:04:05.829> a<00:04:06.010> sniper

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
least effective when using a sniper

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.520 
least effective when using a sniper
rifle<00:04:06.489> because<00:04:07.359> as<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.660> sniper<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.230> need<00:04:08.440> to

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
rifle because as a sniper you need to

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.409 
rifle because as a sniper you need to
have<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.739> wide<00:04:08.980> range<00:04:09.400> of<00:04:09.639> what's<00:04:09.910> going<00:04:10.180> on

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
have the wide range of what's going on

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.379

within<00:04:11.380> your<00:04:11.680> perspective<00:04:12.250> viewpoint<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.299> you

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
within your perspective viewpoint so you

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:14.819 
within your perspective viewpoint so you
need<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.630> be<00:04:13.720> able<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.959> see<00:04:14.200> what<00:04:14.349> is<00:04:14.500> going<00:04:14.680> on

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
need to be able to see what is going on

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.279 
need to be able to see what is going on
around<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.370> as<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.519> sniper<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.209> if<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.079> think

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
around you as a sniper and if you think

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.589 
around you as a sniper and if you think
about<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.709> leaning<00:04:18.099> out<00:04:18.310> for<00:04:18.880> 20<00:04:19.239> minutes

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
about it leaning out for 20 minutes

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.680 
about it leaning out for 20 minutes
trying<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:20.340> hold<00:04:21.340> back<00:04:21.459> people<00:04:22.210> from<00:04:22.539> the

trying to hold back people from the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.210 
trying to hold back people from the
objective<00:04:23.229> it's<00:04:23.440> going<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.860> be<00:04:23.979> really

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
objective it's going to be really

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.129 
objective it's going to be really
difficult<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.669> do<00:04:24.880> which<00:04:25.180> is<00:04:25.210> why<00:04:25.510> this<00:04:25.570> is<00:04:25.750> not

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
difficult to do which is why this is not

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.480 
difficult to do which is why this is not
recommended<00:04:26.560> that<00:04:26.650> you<00:04:26.800> use<00:04:27.039> this<00:04:27.249> feature

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.159 
when you are actually snapping unless if

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.249 
when you are actually snapping unless if
you<00:04:30.280> want<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.699> bit<00:04:31.030> of<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.240> challenge<00:04:31.479> then<00:04:32.110> this

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
you want a bit of a challenge then this

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.719 
you want a bit of a challenge then this
would<00:04:32.409> be<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.740> feature<00:04:32.979> for<00:04:33.219> you<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.520> use

simple<00:05:02.620> things<00:05:02.889> that<00:05:03.039> you<00:05:03.189> could<00:05:03.460> do<00:05:03.610> through

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
simple things that you could do through

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.149 
simple things that you could do through
the<00:05:04.509> head<00:05:04.689> tracking<00:05:04.900> feature<00:05:05.199> or<00:05:05.469> either<00:05:05.710> the

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
the head tracking feature or either the

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.100 
the head tracking feature or either the
leaning<00:05:06.580> in<00:05:06.729> or<00:05:06.909> out<00:05:07.060> feature<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.689> course<00:05:07.930> the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
leaning in or out feature of course the

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.200 
leaning in or out feature of course the
leaning<00:05:08.379> feature<00:05:08.560> can<00:05:08.830> also<00:05:09.009> be<00:05:09.250> used<00:05:09.490> just

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
leaning feature can also be used just

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.640 
leaning feature can also be used just
with<00:05:10.449> a<00:05:10.479> controller<00:05:10.900> so<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.199> don't<00:05:11.379> need<00:05:11.500> to

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
with a controller so you don't need to

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.980 
with a controller so you don't need to
have<00:05:11.860> your<00:05:12.099> Kinect<00:05:12.520> connected<00:05:13.060> or<00:05:13.539> anything

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
have your Kinect connected or anything

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.149 
have your Kinect connected or anything
like<00:05:14.169> that<00:05:14.229> so<00:05:14.439> you<00:05:14.650> can<00:05:14.800> just<00:05:14.830> use<00:05:15.129> your

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 
like that so you can just use your

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:16.619 
like that so you can just use your
controller<00:05:15.699> it's<00:05:15.969> not<00:05:16.150> going<00:05:16.389> to<00:05:16.479> be<00:05:16.599> a

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:16.629 
controller it's not going to be a

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:17.369 
controller it's not going to be a
problem

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
problem

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.469 
problem
and<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.710> also<00:05:17.889> highly<00:05:18.279> suggest<00:05:18.639> to<00:05:18.759> play<00:05:18.969> with

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
and I also highly suggest to play with

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.540 
and I also highly suggest to play with
your<00:05:19.599> own<00:05:19.779> play<00:05:20.050> style<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:21.069> sort<00:05:21.279> of<00:05:21.310> guy

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
your own play style so the sort of guy

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.879 
your own play style so the sort of guy
who<00:05:21.580> lacks<00:05:21.849> use<00:05:22.089> Kinect<00:05:22.839> and<00:05:23.020> leaning<00:05:23.680> and

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
who lacks use Kinect and leaning and

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.100 
who lacks use Kinect and leaning and
lean<00:05:24.219> out<00:05:24.400> all<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.699> time<00:05:24.939> in<00:05:25.629> front<00:05:25.810> of<00:05:25.990> your

lean out all the time in front of your

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.019 
lean out all the time in front of your
TV<00:05:26.349> then<00:05:26.800> that's<00:05:27.009> something<00:05:27.430> that's<00:05:27.610> really

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
TV then that's something that's really

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.529 
TV then that's something that's really
great

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
great

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.869 
great
you<00:05:28.930> could<00:05:29.080> easily<00:05:29.289> use<00:05:29.499> that<00:05:29.949> now<00:05:30.550> one<00:05:30.729> more

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:30.879 
you could easily use that now one more

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.279 
you could easily use that now one more
thing<00:05:31.029> I<00:05:31.120> forgot<00:05:31.150> to<00:05:31.449> mention<00:05:31.629> about<00:05:31.900> the

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
thing I forgot to mention about the

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.890 
thing I forgot to mention about the
problems<00:05:32.710> with<00:05:32.889> using<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.819> leaning<00:05:34.689> feature

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
problems with using the leaning feature

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.779 
problems with using the leaning feature
in<00:05:35.080> battlefield<00:05:35.529> 4<00:05:35.560> while<00:05:35.919> using<00:05:36.219> the<00:05:36.430> Kinect

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
in battlefield 4 while using the Kinect

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.089 
in battlefield 4 while using the Kinect
is<00:05:37.000> that<00:05:37.509> sometimes<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.229> Kinect<00:05:38.560> will<00:05:38.710> detect

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
is that sometimes the Kinect will detect

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.399 
is that sometimes the Kinect will detect
objects<00:05:39.939> in<00:05:40.060> the<00:05:40.180> background<00:05:40.659> or<00:05:40.870> sometimes

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
objects in the background or sometimes

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.829 
objects in the background or sometimes
it<00:05:41.589> will<00:05:41.680> also<00:05:42.009> detect<00:05:42.370> other<00:05:43.210> people<00:05:43.689> that

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:43.839 
it will also detect other people that

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.079 
it will also detect other people that
walk<00:05:44.110> in<00:05:44.379> behind<00:05:44.649> you<00:05:45.099> for<00:05:45.430> example<00:05:45.849> this<00:05:45.939> has

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
walk in behind you for example this has

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:48.329 
walk in behind you for example this has
happened<00:05:46.509> to<00:05:46.569> the<00:05:46.719> many<00:05:47.409> times<00:05:47.680> before<00:05:47.919> you

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:48.339 
happened to the many times before you

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:51.119 
happened to the many times before you
actually<00:05:48.879> lock<00:05:49.360> on<00:05:49.599> to<00:05:49.779> them<00:05:49.960> as<00:05:50.169> well<00:05:50.409> so<00:05:50.710> when

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
actually lock on to them as well so when

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.010 
actually lock on to them as well so when
they're<00:05:51.399> looking<00:05:51.699> at<00:05:51.969> your<00:05:52.210> screen<00:05:52.419> boy<00:05:52.719> I

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
they're looking at your screen boy I

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.079 
they're looking at your screen boy I
just<00:05:53.259> watching<00:05:53.740> you<00:05:53.860> play<00:05:54.039> their<00:05:54.279> game<00:05:54.490> the

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:55.089 
just watching you play their game the

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:56.820 
just watching you play their game the
camera<00:05:55.360> angles<00:05:55.750> will<00:05:55.930> move<00:05:56.139> when<00:05:56.439> they<00:05:56.589> move

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
camera angles will move when they move

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.010 
camera angles will move when they move
their<00:05:56.979> heads<00:05:57.219> as<00:05:57.370> well<00:05:57.580> so<00:05:57.819> just<00:05:57.849> be<00:05:58.210> aware<00:05:58.569> of

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
their heads as well so just be aware of

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.529 
their heads as well so just be aware of
this<00:05:59.289> problem<00:05:59.589> it<00:05:59.949> may<00:06:00.189> happen<00:06:00.669> and<00:06:00.849> I<00:06:01.210> really

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
this problem it may happen and I really

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.389 
this problem it may happen and I really
hope<00:06:01.689> that<00:06:01.779> they<00:06:02.050> do<00:06:02.110> fix<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.680> in<00:06:02.889> the<00:06:03.009> future

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:03.399 
hope that they do fix it in the future
