my pouring tool homemade handmade out of

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.569 
my pouring tool homemade handmade out of
half-inch<00:00:47.460> bar<00:00:48.460> stock<00:00:48.789> square<00:00:49.449> style<00:00:50.579> didn't

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
half-inch bar stock square style didn't

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.020 
half-inch bar stock square style didn't
do<00:00:51.670> any<00:00:52.030> real<00:00:52.300> measuring<00:00:52.839> just<00:00:53.760> took<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.820> piece

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
do any real measuring just took a piece

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.869 
do any real measuring just took a piece
of<00:00:55.059> flat<00:00:55.420> steel<00:00:55.690> flat<00:00:56.379> bar<00:00:56.620> and<00:00:56.860> bend<00:00:57.790> it

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
of flat steel flat bar and bend it

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.329 
of flat steel flat bar and bend it
around<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.180> crucible<00:00:58.629> where<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.620> would<00:01:01.050> not

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
around the crucible where it would not

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.630 
around the crucible where it would not
fit<00:01:03.339> all<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.579> way<00:01:03.610> through<00:01:03.909> so<00:01:04.629> it'll<00:01:04.809> lift

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
fit all the way through so it'll lift

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.450 
fit all the way through so it'll lift
figured<00:01:06.640> out<00:01:06.759> where<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.659> height<00:01:07.869> would<00:01:08.140> be<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
figured out where the height would be to

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.420 
figured out where the height would be to
get<00:01:09.580> this<00:01:09.759> gate<00:01:10.030> latch<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.540> hold<00:01:10.750> it<00:01:10.869> in<00:01:10.960> place

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
get this gate latch to hold it in place

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.400 
get this gate latch to hold it in place
and<00:01:12.430> then<00:01:12.580> just<00:01:12.640> marked<00:01:13.300> it<00:01:13.420> and<00:01:13.630> welded<00:01:14.350> it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
and then just marked it and welded it

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.100 
and then just marked it and welded it
together<00:01:14.679> right<00:01:14.920> there<00:01:18.810> nothing<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.840> it

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
together right there nothing to it

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.870 
together right there nothing to it
really<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:23.259> bit<00:01:23.380> of<00:01:23.530> welding<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.070> can

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
really a little bit of welding you can

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.889 
really a little bit of welding you can
see<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.119> am<00:01:25.360> NOT<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> welder<00:01:26.050> but<00:01:26.800> it<00:01:26.950> holds<00:01:27.899> made

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
see I am NOT a welder but it holds made

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.440 
see I am NOT a welder but it holds made
the<00:01:29.080> angle<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.729> big<00:01:30.880> ol<00:01:31.000> handle<00:01:31.240> on<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.420> end

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
the angle but a big ol handle on the end

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.620 
the angle but a big ol handle on the end
and<00:01:31.780> then<00:01:32.560> let<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:32.860> rest<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:34.270> still<00:01:34.479> gets

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
and then let it rest but it still gets

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.410 
and then let it rest but it still gets
the<00:01:34.720> job<00:01:34.750> done

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the job done

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.850 
the job done
the<00:01:37.420> way<00:01:37.539> I<00:01:37.569> actually<00:01:37.899> lift<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.409> crucible

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
the way I actually lift the crucible

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.350 
the way I actually lift the crucible
from<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.250> foundry<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.640> get<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:39.970> into<00:01:40.119> this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
from the foundry and get it into this

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.389 
from the foundry and get it into this
rig<00:01:40.600> there's<00:01:41.440> nothing<00:01:41.710> more<00:01:41.830> than<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.069> piece<00:01:42.250> of

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
rig there's nothing more than a piece of

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.880 
rig there's nothing more than a piece of
quarter-inch<00:01:42.670> steel<00:01:43.179> wire<00:01:43.479> bar<00:01:44.409> stock<00:01:44.710> I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
quarter-inch steel wire bar stock I

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.300 
quarter-inch steel wire bar stock I
think<00:01:44.920> wire<00:01:45.880> stock<00:01:46.270> whatever<00:01:46.690> it'll<00:01:46.929> be<00:01:47.310> hand

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
think wire stock whatever it'll be hand

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.910 
think wire stock whatever it'll be hand
bent<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:49.119> that'll<00:01:49.390> fit<00:01:49.630> over<00:01:49.989> the<00:01:50.410> crucible

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
bent so that'll fit over the crucible

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.240 
bent so that'll fit over the crucible
and<00:01:51.369> then<00:01:51.819> I<00:01:51.880> slide<00:01:52.209> this<00:01:52.509> rectangle<00:01:53.470> down<00:01:53.649> to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
and then I slide this rectangle down to

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.359 
and then I slide this rectangle down to
hold<00:01:54.429> it<00:01:54.550> closed<00:01:55.080> use<00:01:56.080> both<00:01:56.319> of<00:01:56.349> them<00:01:56.619> opposite

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
hold it closed use both of them opposite

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.790 
hold it closed use both of them opposite
each<00:01:57.520> other<00:01:57.670> gives<00:01:58.599> me<00:01:58.720> two<00:01:58.869> handles<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.500> pick

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
each other gives me two handles to pick

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.150 
each other gives me two handles to pick
it<00:01:59.890> up<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.160> take<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.369> out<00:02:00.989> I<00:02:01.989> was<00:02:02.649> using<00:02:02.890> just

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
it up and take it out I was using just

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.609 
it up and take it out I was using just
one<00:02:03.429> initially<00:02:04.090> but<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:04.869> found<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.259> when<00:02:05.500> the

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
one initially but I found that when the

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.350 
one initially but I found that when the
crucible<00:02:06.009> is<00:02:06.069> actually<00:02:06.310> good<00:02:06.489> and<00:02:06.550> hot<00:02:06.759> it'll

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
crucible is actually good and hot it'll

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.639 
crucible is actually good and hot it'll
get<00:02:07.539> too<00:02:07.720> hot<00:02:07.929> right<00:02:08.170> here<00:02:08.319> in<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.500> corner

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
get too hot right here in the corner

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.889 
get too hot right here in the corner
soften<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.310> metal<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.700> bend<00:02:10.209> down<00:02:10.330> trying<00:02:10.780> to

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
soften the metal and bend down trying to

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.020 
soften the metal and bend down trying to
drop<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.230> crucible<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.129> I<00:02:12.160> made<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> second<00:02:12.910> one

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
drop the crucible so I made a second one

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.900 
drop the crucible so I made a second one
and<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.330> works<00:02:13.510> out<00:02:13.720> well<00:02:14.069> with<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.550> can

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
and it works out well with that I can

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.000 
and it works out well with that I can
lift<00:02:16.330> my<00:02:16.569> crucible<00:02:16.930> from<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.470> foundry<00:02:17.860> and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
lift my crucible from the foundry and

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.570 
lift my crucible from the foundry and
get<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.400> into<00:02:18.550> my<00:02:18.780> pouring<00:02:19.780> rig<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.430> go<00:02:21.430> where

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
get it into my pouring rig and go where

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.160 
get it into my pouring rig and go where
I<00:02:21.610> need<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:21.940> go<00:02:22.090> pour<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.660> molds<00:02:23.069> good<00:02:24.069> stuff
