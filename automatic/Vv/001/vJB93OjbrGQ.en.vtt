life's and in the tank when I'm setting

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.690 
life's and in the tank when I'm setting
it<00:00:32.279> up<00:00:32.960> put<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.850> base<00:00:35.850> layer<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.899> dead<00:00:37.700> clean

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
it up put a base layer of dead clean

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.500 
it up put a base layer of dead clean
porous<00:00:39.420> rock<00:00:39.750> down<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.790> laying<00:00:42.059> about<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
porous rock down and then laying about a

hundred pounds of live rock on top of

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.260 
hundred pounds of live rock on top of
that<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.710> I<00:00:46.710> think<00:00:47.129> that's<00:00:47.520> what<00:00:47.730> i'm<00:00:47.820> doing<00:00:48.149> i

got<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.480> 50<00:00:48.989> pound<00:00:49.170> box<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.739> rocks<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.219> those

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
got a 50 pound box of rocks from those

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.189 
got a 50 pound box of rocks from those
people<00:00:51.079> $85<00:00:52.079> that's<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.710> shipping<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.309> it's

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
people $85 that's with shipping and it's

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.119 
people $85 that's with shipping and it's
turned<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:59.629> to<00:01:00.629> me<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:01.559> nice<00:01:01.800> Rock

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
turned out to be to me very nice Rock

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.929 
turned out to be to me very nice Rock
very<00:01:02.430> porous<00:01:03.650> lots<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.830> holes<00:01:05.010> nooks<00:01:05.519> crannies

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
very porous lots of holes nooks crannies

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.230 
very porous lots of holes nooks crannies
different<00:01:07.130> shapes<00:01:08.150> sizes<00:01:11.000> even<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> little

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
different shapes sizes even a little

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.750 
different shapes sizes even a little
flat<00:01:12.540> spot<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> couple<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:14.610> they've

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
flat spot on a couple of them or they've

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.039 
flat spot on a couple of them or they've
been<00:01:14.909> cut<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.009> think<00:01:20.570> this<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
been cut and I think this is going to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.330 
been cut and I think this is going to
work<00:01:22.200> good<00:01:22.530> after<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> aquarium<00:01:24.299> cycles<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
work good after the aquarium cycles the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.130 
work good after the aquarium cycles the
good<00:01:26.340> stuff<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> live<00:01:27.540> rock<00:01:27.900> will

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
good stuff that's on the live rock will

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.140 
good stuff that's on the live rock will
start<00:01:28.380> migrating<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.369> populating<00:01:30.000> this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
start migrating down and populating this

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
start migrating down and populating this
rock<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:33.229> don't<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.380> any<00:01:34.560> reason<00:01:34.740> why<00:01:34.890> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
rock and I don't see any reason why that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.490 
rock and I don't see any reason why that
wouldn't<00:01:35.369> work<00:01:35.579> i<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.420> had<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> couple<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
people say that's a good idea and some

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.789 
people say that's a good idea and some
people<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.540> were<00:01:42.689> totally<00:01:43.110> indifferent<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
people that were totally indifferent to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.710 
people that were totally indifferent to
the<00:01:43.890> whole<00:01:44.040> deal<00:01:46.340> i'm<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.119> like

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the whole deal i'm going to do that like

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560 
the whole deal i'm going to do that like
I<00:01:48.810> say<00:01:48.990> I've<00:01:49.229> got<00:01:49.579> 240<00:01:50.579> pounds<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> sand<00:01:51.270> which

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I say I've got 240 pounds of sand which

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170 
I say I've got 240 pounds of sand which
I'm<00:01:51.750> hoping<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.829> enough<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.369> deep<00:01:53.579> sand<00:01:53.850> bed

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
I'm hoping is enough for a deep sand bed

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
I'm hoping is enough for a deep sand bed
I<00:01:54.420> don't<00:01:55.140> believe<00:01:55.290> I've<00:01:55.500> mentioned<00:01:55.740> that

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
I don't believe I've mentioned that

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.399 
I don't believe I've mentioned that
before<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.700> am<00:01:56.939> doing<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.540> deep<00:01:57.750> sand<00:01:57.990> bed<00:01:58.259> in

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
before but I am doing a deep sand bed in

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.929 
before but I am doing a deep sand bed in
my<00:01:58.530> aquarium<00:02:01.369> I'm<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.640> put<00:02:02.790> down

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
my aquarium I'm going to put down

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.480 
my aquarium I'm going to put down
probably<00:02:03.329> about<00:02:03.630> half<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:05.009> settle

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
probably about half of that then settle

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.520 
probably about half of that then settle
this<00:02:05.610> rock<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.719> put<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> rest<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
this rock in and put the rest of the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.880 
this rock in and put the rest of the
sand<00:02:07.829> down<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.429> lay<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.569> live<00:02:10.140> rock<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.679> top

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
sand down and lay the live rock on top

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.770 
sand down and lay the live rock on top
of<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
of it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.750 
of it
what<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:13.989> actually<00:02:14.260> helped<00:02:15.220> me<00:02:15.370> do<00:02:15.519> was

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
what this actually helped me do was

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.190 
what this actually helped me do was
probably<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.150> save<00:02:16.360> about<00:02:16.659> one<00:02:16.840> hundred<00:02:16.900> fifty

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
probably to save about one hundred fifty

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.690 
probably to save about one hundred fifty
dollars<00:02:17.680> on<00:02:17.829> live<00:02:18.040> rock<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.730> would<00:02:18.909> just<00:02:18.939> be

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
dollars on live rock that would just be

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.309 
dollars on live rock that would just be
basically<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.819> base<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:23.829> lower<00:02:24.040> part<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.849> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
basically a base the lower part of the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.130 
basically a base the lower part of the
brief<00:02:26.319> as<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.560> were<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.540> that's<00:02:28.840> what<00:02:29.019> I<00:02:29.079> came

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
brief as it were so that's what I came

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.130 
brief as it were so that's what I came
up<00:02:29.379> with<00:02:29.739> I<00:02:30.069> don't<00:02:30.940> look<00:02:31.329> in<00:02:31.569> I<00:02:31.720> don't<00:02:31.870> see<00:02:32.049> any
