00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.970
 short comparison video from the outside 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.470
 between the apple ipad mini and the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.360
 google nexus 10 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.969
 what is striking bears it is one 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.789
 different size 9 7 inches 10.05 c4 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.180
 to 316 to new factor at the screen 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.140
 but jumps directly into the eye come 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.410
 but expect 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.980
 the weight we have here 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.080
 umts version so that's it 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.130
 660 grams 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.710
 and here are 600 grams of the nexus 10 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.629
 there is no umts version and somehow 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.280
 it is speculated that one 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.250
 completely new version with more power 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.660
 comes and I can not 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.360
 So imagine the rumors that there 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.449
 Soon there will be a 3g version but watch 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.969
 do I notice this 60 grams 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.879
 difference and I have to say yes one 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.260
 She also notices when the thing is so big 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.449
 So the nexus works here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.000
 It is surprisingly good in hand 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.400
 Feels very thin and very light 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.229
 on the other side, that I 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.760
 Here at apple my usual aluminum 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.369
 have and here this combination looks like 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.759
 Let's say rubber and plastic is 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.259
 ipad feels already finished is always 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.390
 so the nice word that is used there 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.950
 and yes it feels just different but at 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.600
 There are also people who like it better 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.850
 this rubber is not many yet 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.049
 cold aluminum in the paws young man 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.210
 ever on the back are then 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.299
 we see here directly the cameras 5 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.060
 megapixel full hd on a video recording 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.270
 at the ipad and also five megapixels here 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.340
 at the galaxy nexus 10 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.020
 because even with lightning I have to say 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.509
 I think I'll take a picture with you 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.680
 Back of the tablet make it come 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.600
 once a year ago 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:55.079
 So not really the difference 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.670
 then front just under 12 megapixel 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:03.719
 Camera 720p recording at the ipad and here 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.340
 have what also 91 9 megapixel camera 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.259
 very well 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.479
 then things from the buttons we have 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.039
 they are a bit strange 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.080
 the nexus as I think so what he 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.540
 strange the nexus definitely on it 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.760
 designed with the buttons with the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.450
 loudspeakers everything that kept it transversal 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.590
 So will notice in horizontal mode 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.709
 I keep coming back from the button 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.750
 service if i'm so round here so i 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.120
 had been brought to extra like me 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.489
 that felt a bit strange but na 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.069
 well, the camera is up there as at 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.200
 amazon at the kindle and what us of course 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.810
 on no hardware drops buttons here 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.370
 like home button the typical android 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.090
 of course, the speakers here in front 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.230
 recessed 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.260
 on the left usb and headphones 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.790
 then on top of speakers quieter and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.730
 on the right side we have again 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.290
 an additional gimmick a micro hdmi 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.670
 Exit very cool and at the bottom 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.769
 still dog station connections while it even 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.340
 for the 10 still no no 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.360
 sensible dog accessory gives if it 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.549
 because ever newspaper at all 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.019
 That's where Google says you are 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.660
 but glad that ever this 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.780
 can buy tablet at apple our 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.420
 usual home-button louder 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.540
 rotation lures up the on off 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.310
 loudspeaker red from jack so headphones 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.980
 left side micro and then down 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.959
 Of course, speakers and the 30 pin 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.549
 adapter with the new devices is 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.549
 of course already the lightning installed 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.030
 that was it actually from the tour of 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.590
 Outside 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.099
 what strikes me when I think so 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.169
 next to each other still lying with the thick 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:50.910
 they are actually doing that themselves 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:53.010
 actually nothing from the haptic of 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.919
 feel the work i think i am 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.060
 then the form factor of the ipad more 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.340
 opposite 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.959
 the size I have it is me 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.519
 incredibly thin and light as I often do 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.130
 but find the appearance is deceptive 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.120
 one thinks it is incredibly easy and 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.590
 thin 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.109
 if you can do it right again 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.790
 compares to that of the ceiling falls 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.010
 It's not that way, of course 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.599
 weight I realize what you naturally 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.609
 wishes or I would wish for 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.939
 to keep 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.729
 a big ipad still at 200 grams 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:24.710
 easier so around the 400 grams best 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.020
 still constructed as it is ipad mini with 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.810
 the backside that would be something fine 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.900
 when nexus from the outside of the haptic must 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.240
 I say I think it is me 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.129
 tick too big yes there are many people 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.280
 they like the big parts i belong there 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.740
 now not too the 16 to 9 factor 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.830
 is nice to watch movies 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.389
 but how often do I watch movies? 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.650
 on the tablet so clearly there is 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.099
 People who only look I know 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.710
 people who watch whatever lovefilm up 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.969
 and listen down on their tablets 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.830
 I did not let that much now 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.289
 of course very appealing to me though 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.960
 then again disturbs is just that 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.569
 missing accessories for those for actually 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.250
 the complete android devices apple has 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.050
 here the beautiful head cosmos same 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.509
 form factor and i can make the smart cover 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.400
 I can use the logitech keyboard 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.050
 continue to use there are so many cases 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.229
 and then we look at the android 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.580
 unfortunately the accessories sectors and there 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.190
 It just is not worth it 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.259
 Not so for the manufacturer 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.659
 on 50 different Android devices 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.270
 to let in somehow there is 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.740
 makes apple of course easier so that 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.080
 but now I felt too far 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.190
 that was the comparison from the outside makes it 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.190
 good and see you next video
