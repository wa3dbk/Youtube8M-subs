00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.980 

one<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.159> my<00:00:02.250> previous<00:00:02.520> videos<00:00:03.090> I<00:00:03.419> was<00:00:03.720> showing

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
one of my previous videos I was showing

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.950 
one of my previous videos I was showing
how<00:00:04.970> in<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.120> back<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.509> van

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
how in the back of the van

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.049 
how in the back of the van
there<00:00:07.859> was<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.010> rot<00:00:08.280> on<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.710> Rewald<00:00:10.710> here<00:00:11.099> and

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
there was a rot on this Rewald here and

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.849 
there was a rot on this Rewald here and
I've<00:00:12.179> replaced<00:00:13.700> paneling<00:00:15.590> and<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.650> wear<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
I've replaced paneling and I wear a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.460 
I've replaced paneling and I wear a
young<00:00:17.330> some<00:00:18.330> photos<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.109> about<00:00:19.320> how<00:00:19.439> I

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
young some photos and so on about how I

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.830 
young some photos and so on about how I
did<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.210> of<00:00:21.210> course<00:00:21.390> I've<00:00:21.480> got<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.689> same

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
did that but of course I've got the same

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.650 
did that but of course I've got the same
problem<00:00:22.109> with<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.260> front<00:00:23.300> and<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.710> I've<00:00:25.710> just

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
problem with the front and so I've just

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.040 
problem with the front and so I've just
in<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> process<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.439> now<00:00:28.619> ripping<00:00:29.160> out<00:00:30.050> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
in the process of now ripping out the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.610 
in the process of now ripping out the
rotted<00:00:31.500> cladding<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:34.100> he's<00:00:35.100> weather<00:00:36.620> gives

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
rotted cladding and he's weather gives

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.040 
rotted cladding and he's weather gives
an<00:00:37.770> indication<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.510> how<00:00:39.510> much<00:00:39.660> water<00:00:39.899> was

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
an indication of how much water was

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.310 
an indication of how much water was
coming<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.149> still<00:00:42.719> think<00:00:42.750> I've<00:00:43.110> got<00:00:43.290> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
coming in and I still think I've got a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.779 
coming in and I still think I've got a
bit<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> water<00:00:43.829> leak<00:00:44.040> somewhere<00:00:44.340> cause<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
bit of a water leak somewhere cause it

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.010 
bit of a water leak somewhere cause it
does<00:00:45.030> same<00:00:45.420> let's<00:00:46.379> duel<00:00:46.739> damn<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:48.020> can't

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
does same let's duel damn I can't

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.100 
does same let's duel damn I can't
believe<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.289> water<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.950> stay<00:00:50.190> damp<00:00:51.110> for

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
believe that water can stay damp for

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.520 
believe that water can stay damp for
that<00:00:52.230> long<00:00:54.379> anyway<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:56.430> all<00:00:56.640> gonna<00:00:56.789> come<00:00:57.030> off

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
that long anyway it's all gonna come off

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
that long anyway it's all gonna come off
now<00:00:59.449> in<00:01:00.449> terms<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.809> fitting<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.530> think<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.460> is

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
now in terms of fitting I think this is

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.270 
now in terms of fitting I think this is
actually<00:01:02.850> gonna<00:01:02.969> be<00:01:03.059> easier<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.830> by<00:01:04.979> removing

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
actually gonna be easier so by removing

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.690 
actually gonna be easier so by removing
the<00:01:05.549> entire<00:01:05.820> panel<00:01:06.979> I'm<00:01:07.979> gonna<00:01:08.189> start<00:01:08.490> from

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the entire panel I'm gonna start from

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.469 
the entire panel I'm gonna start from
the<00:01:08.760> floor<00:01:10.010> this<00:01:11.010> bench<00:01:11.700> he<00:01:11.970> will<00:01:12.150> provide<00:01:13.220> the

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
the floor this bench he will provide the

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.570 
the floor this bench he will provide the
stress<00:01:16.070> towards<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> front<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> van<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
stress towards the front of the van and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.800 
stress towards the front of the van and
basically<00:01:20.580> there's<00:01:20.820> no<00:01:20.939> insulation<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.630> just

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
basically there's no insulation is just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.080 
basically there's no insulation is just
rinse<00:01:22.049> water<00:01:22.259> begins<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> skim<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
rinse water begins to skim and as it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.539 
rinse water begins to skim and as it
comes<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.540> it'll<00:01:25.320> then<00:01:25.500> sit<00:01:25.830> flush<00:01:26.070> against

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
comes up it'll then sit flush against

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.640 
comes up it'll then sit flush against
here<00:01:26.759> hence<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.310> how<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.430> comes<00:01:29.640> down

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
here hence you can see how it comes down

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.020 
here hence you can see how it comes down
follows<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> edge<00:01:32.390> all<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> way<00:01:33.689> down<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
follows the edge all the way down so I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.520 
follows the edge all the way down so I
think<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.299> terms<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.659> support<00:01:37.049> there's<00:01:37.290> enough

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
think in terms of support there's enough

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.760 
think in terms of support there's enough
thing<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.189> fabricate<00:01:38.670> anything

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
thing I don't have to fabricate anything

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.429 
thing I don't have to fabricate anything
so<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.040> only<00:01:41.189> issue<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.880> whether<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.439> will

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
so the only issue is is whether I will

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.219 
so the only issue is is whether I will
need<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> end<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.070> removing<00:01:44.750> this<00:01:45.750> top<00:01:46.020> panel

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
need to end up removing this top panel

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.749 
need to end up removing this top panel
in<00:01:46.530> order<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:48.240> sheathing<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.899> which

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
in order to get the sheathing in which

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.840 
in order to get the sheathing in which
I'm<00:01:50.759> assuming<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.299> I'm<00:01:51.450> gonna<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.869> do

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
I'm assuming that I'm gonna have to do

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.069 
I'm assuming that I'm gonna have to do
and<00:01:53.850> hopefully<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:54.840> I've

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and hopefully that's about it but I've

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.510 
and hopefully that's about it but I've
noticed<00:01:55.619> little<00:01:55.950> holes<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:59.430> I'm

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
noticed little holes here and I'm

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.039 
noticed little holes here and I'm
wondering<00:01:59.850> whether<00:02:00.000> or<00:02:00.149> not<00:02:00.270> there's<00:02:00.840> any

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
wondering whether or not there's any

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.289 
wondering whether or not there's any
more<00:02:02.180> in<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.570> everything<00:02:03.930> else<00:02:04.200> seems<00:02:04.439> okay

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
more in here everything else seems okay

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.370 
more in here everything else seems okay
there<00:02:06.299> might<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.719> or<00:02:06.840> two<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.140> I'll<00:02:07.229> be

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
there might be one or two that I'll be

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.859 
there might be one or two that I'll be
able<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.740> find<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.190> cover<00:02:08.700> up

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
able to find and cover up

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.160 
able to find and cover up
but<00:02:10.200> um<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:11.370> I'll<00:02:11.459> do<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.640> I'll<00:02:11.790> remove<00:02:12.170> as

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
but um so what I'll do is I'll remove as

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.140 
but um so what I'll do is I'll remove as
I<00:02:13.319> said<00:02:13.500> remove<00:02:13.739> all<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> paneling<00:02:14.400> clean

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
I said remove all the paneling clean

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.410 
I said remove all the paneling clean
everything<00:02:15.599> up<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.989> then<00:02:16.920> wait<00:02:17.129> till<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:18.120> get<00:02:18.299> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
everything up and then wait till I get a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.930 
everything up and then wait till I get a
few<00:02:18.690> heavy<00:02:19.620> shells<00:02:19.920> which<00:02:20.250> seems<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
few heavy shells which seems to be the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.770 
few heavy shells which seems to be the
norm<00:02:21.060> at<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.360> moment<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.590> much<00:02:22.769> for<00:02:22.950> summer

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
norm at the moment so much for summer

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.360 
norm at the moment so much for summer
and<00:02:24.780> see<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.049> can<00:02:25.200> spot<00:02:25.409> a<00:02:25.470> leak<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.860> chances

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
and see if I can spot a leak and chances

all the way through it's also mounted I
believe<00:03:46.680> in<00:03:46.889> here<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:48.720> I'm<00:03:49.319> gonna<00:03:49.440> have<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.680> do

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
believe in here so I'm gonna have to do

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.500 
believe in here so I'm gonna have to do
the<00:03:49.889> same<00:03:50.129> here<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.669> of<00:03:51.030> course<00:03:51.090> the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
the same here and of course the

the same here and of course the
challenge<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.019> gonna<00:03:52.109> be<00:03:52.290> because<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.859> can

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
challenge is gonna be because you can

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:01.309 
challenge is gonna be because you can
see<00:03:53.160> here<00:03:56.599> not<00:03:57.599> much<00:03:57.780> room<00:03:59.000> and<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.540> don't<00:04:01.049> want

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
see here not much room and I don't want

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.490 
see here not much room and I don't want
to<00:04:01.379> damage<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.680> cladding<00:04:02.569> by<00:04:03.569> making<00:04:03.959> boy<00:04:04.260> a

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
to damage the cladding by making boy a

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.050 
to damage the cladding by making boy a
prong<00:04:04.919> too<00:04:05.129> much<00:04:05.280> for<00:04:05.519> so<00:04:05.730> I'm<00:04:05.819> just<00:04:05.970> gonna

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
prong too much for so I'm just gonna

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.580 
prong too much for so I'm just gonna
flip<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:06.389> you<00:04:06.449> very<00:04:06.870> very<00:04:07.199> gentle<00:04:08.180> like<00:04:09.180> this

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
flip it you very very gentle like this

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.939 
flip it you very very gentle like this
and<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:11.060> this<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.269> actually<00:04:12.769> probably<00:04:13.769> the

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
and so this is actually probably the

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.920 
and so this is actually probably the
only<00:04:14.160> way<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.459> do<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.790> without<00:04:15.359> actually

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
only way to do it without actually

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.130 
only way to do it without actually
removing<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:17.130> external<00:04:17.609> cladding<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.269> I

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
removing the external cladding and I

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.349 
removing the external cladding and I
really<00:04:19.469> don't<00:04:19.650> want<00:04:19.769> to<00:04:19.829> do<00:04:19.950> that<00:04:20.359> especially

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
really don't want to do that especially

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.570 
really don't want to do that especially
given<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.659> conditions

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
given the conditions

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.230

it's<00:05:08.780> just<00:05:08.990> slowly<00:05:09.349> trying<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:10.009> pry<00:05:11.349> it<00:05:12.349> out<00:05:12.530> of

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
it's just slowly trying to pry it out of

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.409 
it's just slowly trying to pry it out of
the<00:05:13.430> stables<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.960> then<00:05:15.889> ripping<00:05:16.759> him<00:05:17.029> from

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
the stables and then ripping him from

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.619 
the stables and then ripping him from
underneath<00:05:18.430> so<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.789> think<00:05:20.240> I've<00:05:20.389> had<00:05:20.539> enough

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629 
underneath so I think I've had enough

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.700 
underneath so I think I've had enough
for<00:05:20.810> now<00:05:22.750> it's<00:05:23.750> quite<00:05:23.960> a<00:05:23.990> lot<00:05:24.139> of<00:05:24.229> tedious<00:05:24.439> work

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
for now it's quite a lot of tedious work

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.540 
for now it's quite a lot of tedious work
I've<00:05:25.310> removed<00:05:25.759> that<00:05:25.969> rear<00:05:26.469> this<00:05:27.469> rebar<00:05:28.009> here

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
I've removed that rear this rebar here

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.809 
I've removed that rear this rebar here
in<00:05:29.360> order<00:05:29.629> to<00:05:29.840> work<00:05:30.110> put<00:05:30.349> a<00:05:30.379> new<00:05:30.590> piece<00:05:30.830> that

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
in order to work put a new piece that

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:42.629 
in order to work put a new piece that
way<00:05:32.029> the<00:05:36.849> these<00:05:38.889> pieces<00:05:39.889> of<00:05:40.099> metal<00:05:41.229> stables

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
way the these pieces of metal stables

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.990 
way the these pieces of metal stables
aren't<00:05:44.199> rubbing<00:05:45.199> up<00:05:45.500> against<00:05:45.830> there<00:05:46.099> the

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
aren't rubbing up against there the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.909 
aren't rubbing up against there the
cladding<00:05:48.430> so<00:05:49.430> I'm<00:05:49.520> just<00:05:49.669> putting<00:05:49.879> if<00:05:50.089> he<00:05:50.240> said

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
cladding so I'm just putting if he said

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
of course got a bit of floor right there

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:59.850 
of course got a bit of floor right there
which<00:05:55.789> I'm<00:05:55.940> also<00:05:56.120> gonna<00:05:56.449> have<00:05:56.659> to<00:05:57.430> deal<00:05:58.430> with

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
which I'm also gonna have to deal with

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.930 
which I'm also gonna have to deal with

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:06.589 
really got to find the source of the

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:11.950 
really got to find the source of the
leak<00:06:06.830> obviously<00:06:07.870> if<00:06:08.870> that's<00:06:09.110> the<00:06:09.229> case<00:06:10.960> clean

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
leak obviously if that's the case clean
