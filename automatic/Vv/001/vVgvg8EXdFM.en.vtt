00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.460
Hey

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.760
Hey, what's up dude?

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.460
I think I've got this week's video done already

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.360
Man, you got that thing done fast, killed it

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.000
Yeah, I know, and I'm pretty happy about it because

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.900
there's this one really funny part

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.400
Yeah?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.900
Where we're talking

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.400
Uh-huh

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.500
And then one of the other guys comes in and says

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.220
What's that on your shirt?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.240
That right there? That's just pixelated

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.800
You know, blurred it out

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.280
Right, I know it's pixelated. Why is it pixelated?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.960
Oh, you know, for material deemed obscene or morally questionable

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.140
or otherwise offensive to viewers

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.620
Gotta blur it out

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.600
Morally offensive to viewers, are we censoring our stuff now?

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.580
Well, I wouldn't look at it like that, it's more like

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.320
you know, trying to make the video look more professional?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.400
Like when you see those rap videos, they always have stuff blurred out. It looks really good

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.500
I don't really see how that increases production value

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.080
It does though it's really...it looks really good to me

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.120
What's that?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.400
Dude, didn't we just go over this two seconds ago? It's like deja vu here

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.300
How's that on your shirt?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.300
This is the same shirt I was wearing in the video, Joel

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.340
Duh

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.620
What are you? Don't touch my blur..Don't, don't do that

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.940
What are you...Hey, stop, hey that's my blur

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.580
Hey! Would you girls stop the slap fight and finish the video? I'm getting thirsty while I wait

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.340
Ah! So refreshing, and now in low-calorie

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.120
How're you doing that?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.340
Lot of people find product placement offensive

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.640
Hey, I could've made a lot of money on this

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.440
Gus, money's not everything buddy

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.500
Oh, woah! What the?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.580
Yeah, tattoos definitely fall under the morally questionable guideline

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.680
See, you got this chart that shows everything that needs to be blurred out

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.980
It's a lot of stuff

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.360
Okay, no one can read that chart. That chart is totally blurred out, Matt

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.340
That's what I just said! Everything on this list gets blurred out

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.360
Give me my hands back, I can't type like this

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.400
Hey, careful! This is too delicious to spill even a single drop

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.920
Still blurred

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.900
Oh, son of a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.400
Woah!

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.900
*Meow*

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.400
What's with the cat?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.760
Oh, a lot of people are allergic to cats

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.600
Okay, how the *bleep* are you doing

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.020
Did you just *bleep*

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.100
Okay, why the *bleep*

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.100
Okay, *bleep* stop bleeping me out

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.800
You might want to calm down

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.460
*bleep* you I'm. Alright *bleep*

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.860
What the *bleep* is this? What the *bleep* is this?

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.680
Dude, that's a little obscene even for us

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.720
Your face is obscene

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.500
Haha, very

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.820
*bleep* My face!

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.540
Alright, this is *bleep* ridiculous

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.920
Why is it blurry? I can't see anything!

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.120
Get the *bleep* off me! What the *bleep* man

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.000
*bleep* Would you stop bleeping me?! God *bleep* it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.780
What are they doing?

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.280
*bleep*

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.800
Very professional, guys

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.460
Thanks Gav, I'm glad somebody noticed

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.440
You've got something on your shirt

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:25.320
*outro music plays*

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.640
Hello!

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.140
Jesus!

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.400
Yee-haw!

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.560
That sounds scary

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.780
You can tell by my lightish-red armor

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.900
Yeah, we win!

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.400
*shotgun blast*

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.900
Blargh

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.100
Sometimes, I am so dumb

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.600
Aaah!

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.700
Grif, can you find the lever?

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.900
What was that?

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.680
Oh God, why does it keep chasing me?

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.140
Ah, that's nice
