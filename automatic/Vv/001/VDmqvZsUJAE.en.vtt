00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.700
 Welcome friends welcome to you 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:09.599
 home and good in this video I'm going to show 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.049
 how the emulator runs king houses for 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.200
 for Android platforms in this case 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.160
 I have an 85 and I will show how 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.160
 the emulator works 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.009
 let's try 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.640
 good to say that this is a new based 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.610
 in the df the pc works 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.170
 perfectly works very well the only thing 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.960
 it's good that they have to implement 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.170
 certain things about control and so on 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:07.150
 but as you can see the control panel there 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.310
 we see the main relief buttons 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 in the crosshead and this is kind of like 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.500
 analog start button 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.550
 well consider how the game runs 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.790
 ikaruga vale 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.770
 the game by touching the screen because there 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.590
 does nothing logically then the button 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.030
 start would be the little triangle as 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.030
 the triangle of the pad of the gringa 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.730
 and here, well, we can configure 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.400
 certain things but well let's do 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.890
 a test so that from there then at level 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.330
 playable well is to play perfectly what 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.330
 same as the control is crap 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.850
 but good as it is very advanced 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.830
 and when with one hand and with the other the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.490
 camera italy a little less so that 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.510
 see 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.430
 as they do not have any kind of the tub of 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.430
 sound perfectly 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.820
 there is nothing is very perfectly 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.220
 yes it is true that I would have to 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.900
 implement some things you can change 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.670
 the mode of these types games with the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.690
 same detail to be able to put it in 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.500
 vertical the moment does not get it and 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.080
 then good is working on the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.930
 command station 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.190
 for example in this kind of hand of 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.900
 adapter this is to put a command of 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.640
 playstation or some kind of command 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.790
 these adapted for this type of 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.790
 dispositives 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.720
 Well, let's take another so that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.100
 see how it works 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.100
 besides the duration 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.370
 it's a simple installation and good 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.269
 let's put for example 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.269
 this other 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.650
 the screen the margins also had 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.510
 that adapt it to the screens to be able 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.660
 adapting it later is not a step towards 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.099
 forward to be able to have this this 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.099
 functional emulator 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.010
 in a console or in a telephone 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.010
 mobile go 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.769
 there is no type of the degrees 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.670
 of volume a little easy 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.069
 well as samic 21 sonic adventures like 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.090
 a semi was announced that at some point 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:52.050
 There is some kind of fabric but nothing 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.680
 all underline do not use them in the future 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.680
 of updates 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.490
 then works hand Phyto 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:33.349
 for Suarez a few years practically nothing 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:35.749
 of what I'm saying when they start 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:40.479
 to make the updates can 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:40.479
 change the mapping of the control 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:03.029
 the people 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:08.330
 it's the fault of some promotes the moves 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:08.330
 of the total 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:31.350
 some completely place but the time 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:33.560
 to appreciate this game and a truck in 30 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.560
 minutes 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.780
 in the last one we can try 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.780
 rock 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:09.300
 works with the 3 bios with the American 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.300
 Japanese and European 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:17.430
 in this case it has a cold region goodbye 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.430
 so you can see 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:24.410
 run all the games because it loads by 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.410
 example was the Japanese version game 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:29.239
 one has a save or bad function 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:29.239
 Will 

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:51.580
 but its functions of the buttons 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.580
 bitter 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:59.000
 so much that they put a lot of pressure on me 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.000
 of hands so you can see 

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.420
 so see you soon
