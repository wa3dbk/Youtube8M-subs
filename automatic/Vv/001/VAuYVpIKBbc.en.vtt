you're bending it up to the 17th fret
which<00:04:32.449> played<00:04:33.350> over<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.680> chord<00:04:34.220> sounds<00:04:34.580> great

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
which played over a chord sounds great

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.050 
which played over a chord sounds great
because<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.510> note<00:04:35.780> you're<00:04:35.960> bending<00:04:36.199> to<00:04:37.060> that

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
because that note you're bending to that

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.600 
because that note you're bending to that
is<00:04:38.240> a<00:04:38.270> note<00:04:38.780> so<00:04:39.620> that's<00:04:39.919> kind<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.250> while<00:04:40.400> that

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
is a note so that's kind of while that

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.000 
is a note so that's kind of while that
makes<00:04:40.940> sense<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:44.090> then<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.320> next<00:04:45.590> part<00:04:45.770> we're

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
makes sense and then the next part we're

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.550 
makes sense and then the next part we're
gonna<00:04:46.100> do<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.340> pull<00:04:46.639> off<00:04:46.820> 15<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.479> 12
