i<00:01:57.090> want<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.960> say<00:01:58.079> i<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.290> nowhere<00:01:58.500> near<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.040> much

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
i want to say i get nowhere near as much

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.910 
i want to say i get nowhere near as much
like<00:01:59.729> or<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:02.729> kind<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.240> terrible<00:02:03.540> hit<00:02:04.350> markers

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
like or the kind of terrible hit markers

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.059 
like or the kind of terrible hit markers
and<00:02:05.189> things<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:06.140> instant<00:02:07.140> deaths<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
and things like instant deaths is a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.550 
and things like instant deaths is a
comparison<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.119> you'll<00:02:09.330> still<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.530> some

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
comparison so you'll still if for some

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.440 
comparison so you'll still if for some
reason<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.950> still<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.459> odd<00:02:11.670> kind<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.180> that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
reason I still get the odd kind of that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790 
reason I still get the odd kind of that
kind<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.750> situation<00:02:12.959> but

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
kind of situation but

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.260 
kind of situation but
I don't<00:02:14.040> get<00:02:14.190> nowhere<00:02:14.400> near<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.820> much<00:02:15.000> as<00:02:15.180> I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
I don't get nowhere near as much as I

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.970
