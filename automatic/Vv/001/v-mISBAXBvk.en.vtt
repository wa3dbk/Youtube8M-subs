00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
put myself through that especially when

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.399 
put myself through that especially when
I<00:03:00.310> was<00:03:00.819> just<00:03:01.060> about<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.359> embark<00:03:01.569> on<00:03:01.959> probably

I was just about to embark on probably

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:03.960 
I was just about to embark on probably
the<00:03:02.530> most<00:03:02.650> stressful<00:03:03.099> and<00:03:03.340> busy<00:03:03.400> year<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.849> my

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
the most stressful and busy year of my

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.839 
the most stressful and busy year of my
life<00:03:04.319> because<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.560> side<00:03:05.769> effects<00:03:06.189> /<00:03:06.400> accutane

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
life because the side effects / accutane

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.020 
life because the side effects / accutane
can<00:03:07.359> take<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.870> toll<00:03:08.139> on<00:03:08.200> your<00:03:08.799> mental<00:03:09.790> stability

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
can take a toll on your mental stability

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.330 
can take a toll on your mental stability
and<00:03:10.750> that's<00:03:11.500> probably<00:03:11.620> not<00:03:11.859> right<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.220> right

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
and that's probably not right the right

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.699 
and that's probably not right the right
word<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.609> say<00:03:12.819> that<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.389> just<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.319> didn't<00:03:14.500> want<00:03:14.650> to

word to say that I just I didn't want to

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.789 
word to say that I just I didn't want to
