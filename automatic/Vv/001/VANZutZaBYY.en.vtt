you'll get to rock formation just follow

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.260 
you'll get to rock formation just follow
around<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.750> try<00:02:21.990> jumping<00:02:22.230> over<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.650> but

actually<00:02:24.270> takes<00:02:24.510> longer<00:02:24.630> than<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.580> walking

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
actually takes longer than just walking
