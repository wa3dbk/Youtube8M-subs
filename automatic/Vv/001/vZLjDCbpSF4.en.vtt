good<00:00:05.160> biceps<00:00:05.430> workout<00:00:06.200> well<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.560> my<00:00:07.620> opinion

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
good biceps workout well in my opinion

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.540 
good biceps workout well in my opinion
one<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> best<00:00:09.000> buy<00:00:09.840> subscribe<00:00:10.349> sizes<00:00:10.740> is

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
one of the best buy subscribe sizes is

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.799 
one of the best buy subscribe sizes is
this<00:00:11.820> one<00:00:12.110> because<00:00:13.110> it<00:00:13.429> isolates<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:15.360> biceps

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
this one because it isolates the biceps

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.740 
this one because it isolates the biceps
completely<00:00:16.970> arnold<00:00:17.970> was<00:00:18.060> doing<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.570> and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
completely arnold was doing it and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.320 
completely arnold was doing it and
Arnold<00:00:19.680> had<00:00:19.859> great<00:00:20.160> arms<00:00:22.010> the<00:00:23.010> motion<00:00:23.430> must<00:00:24.150> be

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
Arnold had great arms the motion must be

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.439 
Arnold had great arms the motion must be
very<00:00:24.539> slowly<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.800> order<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> activate<00:00:26.550> all<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
very slowly in order to activate all the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.089 
very slowly in order to activate all the
muscle<00:00:27.779> fibers<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.529> biceps<00:00:30.769> you<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:31.980> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
muscle fibers in the biceps you want to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.560 
muscle fibers in the biceps you want to
let<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> biceps<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.840> growing<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.760> how

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
let the biceps know it's growing so how

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.000 
let the biceps know it's growing so how
do<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.760> you<00:00:38.760> simply<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:40.010> until

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
do you do that you simply do this until

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.319 
do you do that you simply do this until

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
muscle failure that is when you cannot

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.369 
muscle failure that is when you cannot
do<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.890> single<00:00:53.190> repetition<00:00:54.020> for<00:00:55.020> instance

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
do one single repetition for instance

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.439 
do one single repetition for instance
right<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.520> will<00:00:57.239> barely<00:00:57.480> make<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:58.469> rep<00:00:59.449> so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
right now I will barely make one rep so

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:13.850 
right now I will barely make one rep so
I'm<00:01:00.750> very<00:01:00.960> close<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> NM<00:01:01.770> f<00:01:10.460> so<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:12.860> right

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
I'm very close to NM f so you see right

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.310 
I'm very close to NM f so you see right
now<00:01:13.890> i'm<00:01:14.369> sure<00:01:14.430> i<00:01:15.000> will<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.840> able<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.200> do

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
now i'm sure i will not be able to do

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.679 
now i'm sure i will not be able to do
one<00:01:17.130> more<00:01:17.310> rep<00:01:19.790> ok<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.270> Mount<00:01:21.509> Airy

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
one more rep ok so this is Mount Airy

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.740 
one more rep ok so this is Mount Airy
muscle<00:01:21.990> failure<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.500> cannot<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.430> wrap<00:01:23.750> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
muscle failure I cannot do one wrap it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.080 
muscle failure I cannot do one wrap it
is<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.140> very<00:01:25.470> important<00:01:26.040> after<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
is very very important after the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.060 
is very very important after the
momentary<00:01:27.479> muscle<00:01:27.840> failure<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
momentary muscle failure to do this a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.240 
momentary muscle failure to do this a
negative<00:01:29.790> repetition<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:31.250> negative

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
negative repetition a negative

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.200 
negative repetition a negative
repetition<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:34.310> after<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.490> momentary<00:01:35.909> muscle

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
repetition is after the momentary muscle

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.719 
repetition is after the momentary muscle
failure<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:37.079> simply<00:01:37.409> try<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.700> more

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
failure you simply try to do one more

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.359 
failure you simply try to do one more
and<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.810> keep<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.710> you

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
and you just keep it like that and you

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.190 
and you just keep it like that and you
keep<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.970> keep<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.270> until<00:01:42.720> your<00:01:42.899> arm

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
keep it and you keep it until your arm

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.760 
keep it and you keep it until your arm
goes<00:01:43.950> down<00:01:45.110> now<00:01:46.110> now<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:49.439> drained

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
goes down now now I know I have drained

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.460 
goes down now now I know I have drained
the<00:01:50.399> last<00:01:50.640> carbohydrate<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.110> muscle

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the last carbohydrate for this muscle

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.590 
the last carbohydrate for this muscle
for<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> moment<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:56.130> remember<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:57.299> need<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
for the moment so remember you need to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.380 
for the moment so remember you need to
do<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> isolated<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.490> need<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.729> do<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.969> slowly

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
do it isolated you need to do it slowly

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.469 
do it isolated you need to do it slowly
so<00:02:01.020> all<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.439> muscle<00:02:01.829> fibers<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:02.969> biceps

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
so all the muscle fibers in the biceps

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.160 
so all the muscle fibers in the biceps
are<00:02:03.600> activated<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.329> then<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.899> until

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
are activated and then you do it until

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.090 
are activated and then you do it until
MMF<00:02:07.860> momentary<00:02:08.610> muscle<00:02:08.910> failure<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.560> then

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
MMF momentary muscle failure and then

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.390 
MMF momentary muscle failure and then
you<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> negative<00:02:11.940> repetition<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:14.160> number

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
you do a negative repetition the number

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.280 
you do a negative repetition the number
of<00:02:14.430> repetitions<00:02:14.730> should<00:02:15.390> be<00:02:15.510> between<00:02:15.690> seven

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
of repetitions should be between seven

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.480 
of repetitions should be between seven
and<00:02:16.410> 15<00:02:17.330> once<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.480> do<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:20.160> will<00:02:20.190> see

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
and 15 once you do this you will see

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.300 
and 15 once you do this you will see
results<00:02:20.670> next<00:02:21.570> time<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.870> go<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.080> gym<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:23.100> try
