 recruited about 4 non-invasive 2 3 4 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.189
 10 maybe 4 it's really if we are 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.750
 missing so I think 3.2 members 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.070
 that you can really try your 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.180
 pottermania I think you are a 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.250
 unaware for that after that there is 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.180
 also on conditions that we will 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.410
 to say that already you have to be times 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.539
 already clearly yapa has no say yeah 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.910

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:10.830
 that will only do that vs 1 1 in match of 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:15.060
 type no no we just want too there is 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.590
 what else also the eyes the maturity 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.650
 of young people see the maturity assets 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.240
 even if you have what three 3 years that 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.150
 I was doing the match when you are 13 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:30.060
 years ago that's so the serious crisis 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.439
 just as the mature guys but here 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.479
 do not ask you to be a dariaus ir 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.890
 legal is just then we can mess around 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.979
 everything but sometimes when you have to be 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.680
 natural be mature a gap to choose the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.119
 titles because there guys are recruiting 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.950
 dudes the egypt meaning are if you you 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.420
 auto clicks they or if you but if there is 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.899
 macros guys we're going to crame him 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.899
 direct 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.770
 I think that if you have macros 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.280
 stuff like that she do not even try 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.600

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.069

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.890

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.380
