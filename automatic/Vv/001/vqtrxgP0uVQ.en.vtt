00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
placing the salmon on plates let's take

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.870 
placing the salmon on plates let's take
our<00:02:12.819> salmon<00:02:13.599> it's<00:02:14.290> been<00:02:14.650> marinating<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.849> the

refrigerator for about four hours the
longer<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.540> let<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.930> marinate<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.620> stronger

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
longer you let it marinate the stronger

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.120 
longer you let it marinate the stronger
the<00:02:21.220> taste<00:02:21.489> will<00:02:21.730> be<00:02:22.019> shut<00:02:23.019> up<00:02:23.170> with<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.560> fish

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
the taste will be shut up with the fish

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.940 
the taste will be shut up with the fish
on<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.459> grill<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.970> trying<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.019> put<00:02:26.319> these<00:02:26.530> take

on the grill I trying to put these take

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.140 
on the grill I trying to put these take
part<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:28.209> as<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.540> center<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.170> grill<00:02:30.150> as

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
part in to as the center of the grill as

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.050 
part in to as the center of the grill as
you<00:02:31.420> see<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.959> can<00:02:32.140> fit<00:02:32.430> quite<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.489> bit<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.790> fish

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
you see you can fit quite a bit of fish

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.580 
you see you can fit quite a bit of fish
on<00:02:34.330> each<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.940> plates<00:02:37.209> each<00:02:37.450> fun<00:02:37.810> make<00:02:38.560> sure

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
on each on the plates each fun make sure

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.190 
on each on the plates each fun make sure
you<00:02:38.980> must<00:02:39.220> face<00:02:39.730> them<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.360> little<00:02:40.840> bit<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:43.200> you

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
you must face them a little bit and you

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.900 
you must face them a little bit and you
have<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.470> little<00:02:44.860> sliding<00:02:45.310> control<00:02:45.760> the

you<00:03:09.770> fat<00:03:10.670> does<00:03:10.970> two<00:03:11.360> things<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:12.310> since<00:03:13.310> there

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
you fat does two things that since there

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.480 
you fat does two things that since there
was<00:03:13.790> some<00:03:14.030> boiled<00:03:14.300> in<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.690> marinade<00:03:15.110> it

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
was some boiled in the marinade it

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.690 
was some boiled in the marinade it
provides<00:03:16.490> some<00:03:16.790> additional<00:03:17.030> oil<00:03:17.740> that<00:03:18.740> makes

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
provides some additional oil that makes

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.320 
provides some additional oil that makes
sure<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:21.250> fish<00:03:22.250> doesn't<00:03:22.550> stick<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.180> grill

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
sure the fish doesn't stick to the grill

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.380 
sure the fish doesn't stick to the grill
and<00:03:23.900> also<00:03:24.470> since<00:03:24.740> there<00:03:25.130> was<00:03:25.370> some<00:03:26.240> more

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
and also since there was some more

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.810 
and also since there was some more
flavor<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:27.170> will<00:03:27.320> increase<00:03:27.800> the<00:03:28.130> enhance<00:03:28.610> the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
flavor it will increase the enhance the

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.480 
flavor it will increase the enhance the
flavor<00:03:29.800> one<00:03:30.800> of<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.950> things<00:03:31.100> that<00:03:31.160> you'll<00:03:31.370> be

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
flavor one of the things that you'll be

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.710 
flavor one of the things that you'll be
surprised<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.750> how<00:03:33.320> quickly<00:03:33.770> the<00:03:34.160> fish

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
surprised that is how quickly the fish

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.340 
surprised that is how quickly the fish
cooks<00:03:35.720> on<00:03:35.990> here<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.550> I<00:03:37.550> actually<00:03:37.940> don't<00:03:38.540> turn

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
cooks on here and I actually don't turn

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.010 
cooks on here and I actually don't turn
since<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:39.980> have<00:03:40.250> elements<00:03:41.090> on<00:03:41.390> both<00:03:41.420> sides

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
since you have elements on both sides

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.340 
since you have elements on both sides
cooking<00:03:42.620> from<00:03:42.890> both<00:03:43.100> sides<00:03:43.460> I<00:03:43.790> don't<00:03:44.660> turn<00:03:45.140> the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
cooking from both sides I don't turn the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:52.110 
cooking from both sides I don't turn the
fish<00:03:45.590> over<00:03:46.630> let's<00:03:47.630> take<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> look<00:03:48.050> yes<00:03:48.530> time

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.310 

you<00:03:53.120> can<00:03:53.420> see<00:03:53.630> it's<00:03:53.980> browning<00:03:54.980> up<00:03:55.100> nicely<00:03:55.400> and

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
you can see it's browning up nicely and

what I have to check the dumbness of the
salmon<00:04:01.940> is<00:04:02.060> my<00:04:02.650> portable<00:04:03.650> digital

keeping track of the time with this

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.680 
keeping track of the time with this
little<00:04:12.740> timer<00:04:13.100> so<00:04:13.460> i<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:14.180> give<00:04:14.360> you<00:04:14.390> an<00:04:14.540> idea

little timer so i can give you an idea
of<00:04:14.960> how<00:04:15.740> long<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.760> will<00:04:17.060> take<00:04:17.450> cook<00:04:18.049> big<00:04:18.290> data

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
of how long it will take cook big data
