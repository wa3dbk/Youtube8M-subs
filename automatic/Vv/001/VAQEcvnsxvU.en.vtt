events such as their snow career so
that's<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.950> quite<00:00:11.430> a<00:00:11.460> busy<00:00:11.730> job<00:00:11.760> I<00:00:12.030> know<00:00:12.120> that

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:12.270 
that's a quite a busy job I know that

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.670 
that's a quite a busy job I know that
logistic<00:00:12.690> site<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.050> the<00:00:13.170> thing<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.350> you<00:00:13.530> do

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
logistic site is the thing that you do

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.320 
logistic site is the thing that you do
away<00:00:13.890> from<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.250> circuit<00:00:14.730> really<00:00:14.940> before<00:00:15.210> you

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
away from the circuit really before you

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.810 
away from the circuit really before you
get<00:00:15.510> here<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.230> an<00:00:16.800> event<00:00:17.009> like<00:00:17.189> this<00:00:17.580> what

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
get here but on an event like this what

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.880 
get here but on an event like this what
are<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.029> doing<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.599> drivers<00:00:19.050> but<00:00:19.740> all

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
are you doing for the drivers but all

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
are you doing for the drivers but all
the<00:00:20.070> logistics<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> preparation<00:00:21.480> sort

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the logistics and the preparation sort

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.599 
the logistics and the preparation sort
of<00:00:22.109> runs<00:00:22.320> over<00:00:22.589> into<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> Reece<00:00:23.039> waste<00:00:23.429> week

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
of runs over into the Reece waste week

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.970 
of runs over into the Reece waste week
and<00:00:23.759> obviously<00:00:24.349> when<00:00:25.349> we<00:00:25.439> get<00:00:25.589> to<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> track

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
and obviously when we get to the track

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.290 
and obviously when we get to the track
we<00:00:26.249> just<00:00:26.519> need<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> make<00:00:26.849> sure<00:00:26.909> that

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
we just need to make sure that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.089 
we just need to make sure that
everything<00:00:27.839> is<00:00:27.929> square<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.739> drivers

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
everything is square with the drivers

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.069 
everything is square with the drivers
all<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> way<00:00:29.519> from<00:00:29.909> getting<00:00:30.269> their<00:00:30.539> licensing

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
all the way from getting their licensing

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.619 
all the way from getting their licensing

job is on the truck and to get us to the
finish<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.700> make<00:01:05.880> sure<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:06.360> know

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
finish so we make sure that they know

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.300 
finish so we make sure that they know
they're<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.110> pits<00:01:07.350> when<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:07.890> need<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.100> be

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
they're in the pits when they need to be

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
they're in the pits when they need to be
and<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.759> interact<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.329> the<00:01:09.390> engineers<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and we interact with the engineers to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.359 
and we interact with the engineers to
make<00:01:10.079> sure<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.590> there's<00:01:10.770> any<00:01:10.920> change<00:01:11.220> in

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
make sure that if there's any change in

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
make sure that if there's any change in
the<00:01:11.460> driver<00:01:11.700> lineup<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.360> they're<00:01:12.570> where

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
the driver lineup that they're where

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.950 
the driver lineup that they're where
they<00:01:13.200> need<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> be<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> certain<00:01:13.920> time

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
they need to be at a certain time

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.870 
they need to be at a certain time
far<00:01:15.110> as<00:01:15.290> getting<00:01:15.440> their<00:01:15.650> uniforms<00:01:16.310> clean<00:01:16.580> and

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
far as getting their uniforms clean and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.930 
far as getting their uniforms clean and
then<00:01:17.060> back<00:01:17.299> on<00:01:18.020> track<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:19.190> win<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.820> race

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
then back on track and to win the race

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.210 
then back on track and to win the race
so<00:01:20.240> there's<00:01:20.930> seven<00:01:21.229> drivers<00:01:21.440> with<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.979> team

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
so there's seven drivers with the team

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.700 
so there's seven drivers with the team
so<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.610> can't<00:01:22.820> be<00:01:22.940> an<00:01:23.030> easy<00:01:23.150> job<00:01:23.479> no<00:01:24.320> it's<00:01:24.590> not

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
so it can't be an easy job no it's not

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.070 
so it can't be an easy job no it's not
easy<00:01:24.950> but<00:01:25.280> we've<00:01:25.640> got<00:01:26.000> it<00:01:26.030> down<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.450> science

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
easy but we've got it down to a science
