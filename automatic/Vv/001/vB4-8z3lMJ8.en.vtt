00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.610
 now the orange flower 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.070
 for this I have prepared a medium orange 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.520
 with which I'm going to paint everything they are 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.830
 the petals of the flower if it is an orange 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.250
 made based simply on yellow 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.250
 Red 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.939
 you can choose the orange tone that 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.939
 more you like 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.650
 a few 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.860
 and then what we are going to do is that 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.260
 let's load the brush 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.590
 and then we're going to download it in the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.590
 palette 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.190
 so as not to create a very marked shadow 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.200
 but rather a color that is natural 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.159
 and that can be blurred with the rest of 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.040
 the painting 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.500
 I'm going to put this same red 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.830
 then on the edges of the petal the edges 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.830
 forever 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.780
 to clean rally 6 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.000
 to be able to formulate 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.580
 the shape 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.479
 taps between the color that I just 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.479
 put and the background color 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.590
 Now with a little white paint 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:53.750
 what we are going to do is to eliminate 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.750
 the top part of the petals 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.369
 I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.320
 and then it just fades 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.200
 now with green moss let's aim 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.200
 these leaves and stems of the leaves 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.700
 What we are doing is creating another 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.700
 combination of leaves and stems 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.290
 with a little green spruce we will 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.549
 give the shadows and we will put more 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.549
 that swims in the bottom 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.200
 of the stem as of the leaves 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.200
 but we do not like it 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.710
 two 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.870
 so by the voice to blur 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.959
 let's apply a little bit of white 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.450
 some lights to our sheet 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.040
 and we blur
