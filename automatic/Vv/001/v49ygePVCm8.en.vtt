pressure<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:01.019> there<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.290> little<00:03:01.380> pop<00:03:01.650> right<00:03:01.950> off

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
pressure on there a little pop right off

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.800 
pressure on there a little pop right off
so<00:03:02.700> we're<00:03:02.820> going<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> take<00:03:03.180> off<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.540> first

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
so we're going to take off the first

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.080 
so we're going to take off the first
side<00:03:04.050> then<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.830> can<00:03:04.860> go<00:03:05.130> ahead<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.640> take<00:03:05.880> off

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
side then you can go ahead and take off

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.630 
side then you can go ahead and take off
the<00:03:06.120> other<00:03:06.510> side<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.170> when<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.100> do<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.400> this

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the other side and when you do that this

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.040 
the other side and when you do that this
little<00:03:08.910> plastic<00:03:09.090> piece<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.690> probably<00:03:09.930> going

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
little plastic piece is probably going

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.360 
little plastic piece is probably going
to<00:03:10.140> fall<00:03:10.290> off<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.680> go<00:03:10.769> ahead<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.040> put<00:03:11.250> that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
to fall off so go ahead and put that

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.699 
to fall off so go ahead and put that
away<00:03:11.540> now<00:03:12.540> we're<00:03:12.660> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.840> unplug<00:03:13.140> your<00:03:13.500> tail

yourself<00:04:32.060> like<00:04:32.660> an<00:04:32.810> adjustable<00:04:33.229> wrench<00:04:33.650> and

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
yourself like an adjustable wrench and

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.920 
yourself like an adjustable wrench and
tighten<00:04:34.520> those<00:04:34.699> down<00:04:34.759> you<00:04:35.150> can<00:04:35.360> definitely<00:04:35.509> do

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930

so<00:04:36.199> so<00:04:36.650> here's<00:04:36.949> a<00:04:37.039> setup<00:04:37.400> how<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:37.850> looks<00:04:38.090> once

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
so so here's a setup how it looks once

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.210 
so so here's a setup how it looks once
it's<00:04:38.539> all<00:04:38.690> completed<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.830> want<00:04:40.039> to<00:04:40.130> just

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
it's all completed and you want to just

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.740 
it's all completed and you want to just
go<00:04:40.370> ahead<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:40.580> make<00:04:40.789> sure<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:41.210> works<00:04:41.539> before

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
go ahead and make sure it works before

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.390 
go ahead and make sure it works before
you<00:04:41.960> solder<00:04:42.229> anything<00:04:42.680> together<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:43.130> just

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
you solder anything together I just

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.189 
you solder anything together I just
connect<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.789> two<00:04:43.940> wires<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.479> you<00:04:44.930> see<00:04:45.080> the

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
connect the two wires and you see the

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.680 
connect the two wires and you see the
turn<00:04:45.410> signals<00:04:45.770> are<00:04:45.979> actually<00:04:46.490> working<00:04:46.910> now

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
turn signals are actually working now

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.300 
turn signals are actually working now
I'm<00:04:47.990> going<00:04:48.139> to<00:04:48.199> go<00:04:48.289> ahead<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:48.650> snip<00:04:48.860> off<00:04:49.100> the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
I'm going to go ahead and snip off the

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.100 
I'm going to go ahead and snip off the
wires<00:04:49.550> there<00:04:49.970> I<00:04:50.330> kind<00:04:50.840> of<00:04:50.900> thought<00:04:51.050> about

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
wires there I kind of thought about

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.990 
wires there I kind of thought about
which<00:04:51.470> ones<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:51.860> wanted<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.250> use<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.639> I<00:04:52.699> decided

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
which ones I wanted to use and I decided

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.090 
which ones I wanted to use and I decided
to<00:04:53.060> snip<00:04:53.360> them<00:04:53.539> off<00:04:53.630> here<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.139> reuse<00:04:54.800> them<00:04:54.949> and

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
to snip them off here and reuse them and

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.650 
to snip them off here and reuse them and
I'm<00:04:55.160> going<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.370> just<00:04:55.669> put<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.060> tail<00:04:56.270> set<00:04:56.539> up

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
I'm going to just put the tail set up

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.840 
I'm going to just put the tail set up
away<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.410> here's<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.190> little<00:04:58.490> bit<00:04:58.580> of<00:04:58.669> solder

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
away and here's a little bit of solder

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.370 
away and here's a little bit of solder
