00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
vanities fiend but vanity spin can be

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.359 
vanities fiend but vanity spin can be
deadly<00:01:38.970> illy<00:01:39.450> game<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.710> he<00:01:40.829> was<00:01:41.009> really

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
deadly illy game but he was really

deadly illy game but he was really
really<00:01:41.759> beast<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.320> probably<00:01:43.799> wouldn't<00:01:44.130> have

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
really beast so I probably wouldn't have

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.670 
really beast so I probably wouldn't have
either<00:01:44.490> dropping<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> dark<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:46.049> dark<00:01:46.259> dust<00:01:46.470> i

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
either dropping the dark one dark dust i

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.649 
either dropping the dark one dark dust i
played<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.159> vanity<00:01:47.939> streaming<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.270> dropping

played for vanity streaming or dropping

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.499 
played for vanity streaming or dropping
a<00:01:48.780> lad<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.860> i<00:01:49.920> would<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.250> played<00:01:50.399> too<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.450> i

a lad but i would have played too and i

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.969 
a lad but i would have played too and i
think<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:51.930> how<00:01:52.079> frog<00:01:52.320> marks<00:01:52.680> would<00:01:52.770> have

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
think that's how frog marks would have

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.109 
think that's how frog marks would have
