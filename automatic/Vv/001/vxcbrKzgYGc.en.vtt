center of your leaf okay I'm just going

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.440 
center of your leaf okay I'm just going
to<00:03:22.269> turn<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.569> over<00:03:24.540> brush<00:03:25.540> off<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.959> excess<00:03:26.410> and

you're<00:03:31.140> going<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.320> go<00:03:31.410> all<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.770> way<00:03:31.800> around

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.690 

until<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:36.360> mate<00:03:36.830> make<00:03:37.830> sure<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.400> line

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
until you mate make sure that the line

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.530 
until you mate make sure that the line
reaches<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.840> base<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:44.430> opposite<00:03:44.940> end<00:03:45.210> of

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
reaches the base of the opposite end of

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.510 
reaches the base of the opposite end of
your<00:03:45.800> loop<00:03:47.270> okay<00:03:48.270> put<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.260> down<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:50.370> going

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
your loop okay put that down I'm going

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.240 
your loop okay put that down I'm going
to<00:03:50.550> take<00:03:50.760> my<00:03:50.910> next<00:03:51.150> brush<00:03:51.570> dip<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:53.870> into<00:03:54.870> my

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
to take my next brush dip that into my

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.490 
to take my next brush dip that into my
green<00:03:56.250> petal<00:03:56.670> dust<00:03:57.020> tap<00:03:58.020> off<00:03:58.230> any<00:03:58.380> excess

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
green petal dust tap off any excess

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.040 
green petal dust tap off any excess
petal<00:03:59.280> dust<00:03:59.460> and<00:03:59.850> then<00:04:00.360> just<00:04:00.540> start<00:04:00.810> dusting

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
petal dust and then just start dusting

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.660 
petal dust and then just start dusting
from<00:04:01.770> the<00:04:01.890> base<00:04:02.780> up<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:07.190> now<00:04:08.190> here<00:04:08.520> it's

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
from the base up like so now here it's

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.020 
from the base up like so now here it's
important<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.480> start<00:04:09.990> at<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.230> edges<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.030> just

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
important to start at the edges and just

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.520 
important to start at the edges and just
work<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.630> petal<00:04:13.020> dust<00:04:13.230> inward<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:15.440> think<00:04:16.440> it

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
work that petal dust inward I think it

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.560 
work that petal dust inward I think it
looks<00:04:16.680> best<00:04:16.980> if<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.549> edges<00:04:17.820> are<00:04:17.970> darker<00:04:18.359> and

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
looks best if the edges are darker and

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.560 
looks best if the edges are darker and
the<00:04:18.900> center<00:04:19.290> is<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.590> little<00:04:19.859> bit<00:04:20.100> lighter<00:04:20.570> so

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
the center is a little bit lighter so

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.610 
the center is a little bit lighter so
you're<00:04:21.690> going<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.870> do<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.170> all<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.410> way

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
you're going to do that all the way

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.450 
you're going to do that all the way
around<00:04:25.910> like<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.300> turn<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.110> over<00:04:28.230> again<00:04:29.100> start

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
around like so turn it over again start

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.870 
around like so turn it over again start
at<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.820> base

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:41.560 

work<00:04:33.480> that<00:04:33.830> peddled<00:04:34.830> us<00:04:34.980> all<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.430> way<00:04:35.550> up<00:04:40.460> and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
work that peddled us all the way up and

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.120 
work that peddled us all the way up and
you're<00:04:42.570> really<00:04:42.780> just<00:04:42.980> highlighting<00:04:43.980> this

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
you're really just highlighting this

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.950 
you're really just highlighting this
leaf<00:04:44.840> bringing<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.140> life<00:04:47.420> I'm<00:04:48.420> just<00:04:48.480> making

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
leaf bringing it to life I'm just making

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.390 
leaf bringing it to life I'm just making
it<00:04:49.080> really<00:04:49.410> interesting<00:04:50.090> an<00:04:51.090> organic<00:04:51.660> looking

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
it really interesting an organic looking

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.130 
it really interesting an organic looking
so<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.430> have<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.790> green<00:04:54.030> on<00:04:54.240> I'm<00:04:54.510> going<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.780> dip

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
so I have the green on I'm going to dip

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.670 
so I have the green on I'm going to dip
the<00:04:55.470> same<00:04:55.710> brush<00:04:56.240> into<00:04:57.240> that<00:04:57.450> luster<00:04:58.410> that

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
the same brush into that luster that

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.420 
the same brush into that luster that
luster<00:04:59.550> green<00:04:59.790> and<00:05:00.350> this<00:05:01.350> luster<00:05:01.950> green<00:05:02.160> just

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
luster green and this luster green just

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.840 
luster green and this luster green just
gives<00:05:03.420> it<00:05:03.600> an<00:05:03.780> entirely<00:05:04.500> different<00:05:05.460> look<00:05:07.850> it's

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
gives it an entirely different look it's

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.710 
gives it an entirely different look it's
almost<00:05:09.150> as<00:05:09.360> if<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:10.620> leaf<00:05:10.890> was<00:05:11.790> being<00:05:12.060> hit<00:05:12.690> by

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
almost as if the leaf was being hit by

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.110 
almost as if the leaf was being hit by
the<00:05:12.930> sunlight<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:14.400> was<00:05:14.520> just<00:05:14.790> kind<00:05:15.060> of

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
the sunlight and it was just kind of

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.640 
the sunlight and it was just kind of
glimmering<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:15.930> shining<00:05:18.050> it<00:05:19.050> adds<00:05:19.200> a<00:05:19.410> lot<00:05:19.590> of

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
glimmering and shining it adds a lot of

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.520 
glimmering and shining it adds a lot of
dimension<00:05:21.350> interesting<00:05:22.350> color<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:24.540> like<00:05:25.380> I

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
dimension interesting color and like I

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.790 
dimension interesting color and like I
said<00:05:25.590> makes<00:05:26.580> for<00:05:26.910> a<00:05:26.940> great<00:05:27.120> accent<00:05:27.800> for

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
said makes for a great accent for

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.580 
said makes for a great accent for
orchids<00:05:29.280> such<00:05:29.520> as<00:05:29.700> cat<00:05:29.880> Leia's<00:05:30.590> cymbidiums

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
orchids such as cat Leia's cymbidiums
