00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.740
 Tell us guys, what 's up? 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.750
 watching us at the moment as is 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.240
 that our partnership with jb 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.910
 fact that the master school of the sea 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.990
 This is our exchange of information. 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:28.070
 and our chat is there it's there 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.010
 from a year ago when I started to 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.790
 enjoy the videos of the bush 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.430
 I started there to find out what it is 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.250
 plus the question of bousquet this question 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.090
 of survival with and why it is something 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.880
 I also really like that and in 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.530
 contact here get the bush we started 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.290
 to exchange ideas and also emerged one of 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.260
 direction of this one-day knife 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.899
 was also to serve this public that 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.410
 practice going to get fifa practice 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.500
 also the survival 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.340
 she also took this direction for 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.549
 meet in our idea is also to integrate 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.310
 this one-day course with the 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.340
 use of knife in both basketball 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.900
 as in survival the knife she has 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.000
 this drawing that has a knife is made 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 to be a survival knife 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.720
 exactly here the student makes a knife in 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.270
 one day and the next day he in the environment 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.570
 of use even in practice in the bush it does 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:43.070
 the use of this knife there already 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:45.860
 producing there the shelter is produced there 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.100
 the material for fire and all that matter 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.530
 so she does not have it is not what the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.509
 randomly it was thought and it comes 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.710
 being developed all this was 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.590
 developed there 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.159
 from one year to this is that we 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.710
 this result is also a course of halo 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.759
 the possibility of interfering with some 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.820
 aspects of the knife in a way that 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.829
 adjust the profile slightly adjust the 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.019
 the blade profile according to the 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.850
 need of the student according to 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.709
 What matters is but is it so 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.440
 also happens in the course 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.510
 Yes, exactly 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.730
 of course she will not get away from the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.610
 pattern of a survival knife but 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.530
 the question of the grip 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.870
 we can not standardize the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.430
 width of the handle 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.590
 has people have the big hand 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.370
 There are people who have small hands so we 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.070
 we have to adjust this knife to the user of 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.270
 that he can use 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.820
 comfortable way 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.540
 it is logical that some things the learner can 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.910
 have their preference to the knife standard 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.820
 it would be a clip point but the student would 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.960
 he wants to make me like more drug 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.620
 with us this does not interfere with anything 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.810
 so he can do can also do 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.540
 this change in the knife also since 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.270
 these changes do not 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.280
 to avoid the standard of the purpose 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.620
 it is being developed 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.320
 the fruit of this partnership that has been 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.750
 created between the jb fax master school of 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.480
 sea embodied in other ways 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.150
 also beyond the course of a day what the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.430
 People are going to offer it to you. 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.290
 far beyond this one - day course will 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.959
 far beyond the possibility of you 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.790
 to create their own mud in one day 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.650
 people have also planned and 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.330
 developed some surprises that I 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.130
 I would like jb to explain a 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.980
 a little more for you 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.770
 well in that one year and that 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.040
 exchange that we have been dealing with there 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:48.970
 what we have been talking about is us 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.000
 we arrived at the drawing to the project of 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.459
 two knives and would be a knife for the 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.980
 training is one of survival and 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.100
 bousquet knife then 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.840
 Juliano was guiding me I went 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.620
 producing some prototypes and 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.470
 handing him over was analyzing and 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.930
 with those adjustments that have been 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.050
 occurring in that last year we arrived 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.660
 now an end product that is a 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.169
 survival that is very robust and that 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.650
 she builds her all she has 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.360
 one purpose each part of it was 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.570
 planned including length 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.880
 Blade compliance causes the wedge to 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.610
 handle format all this has a 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.449
 function that will be after Julian 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.639
 the power in the demonstration of these knives 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.430
 he will be able to teach to be able 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.949
 write there everything that this blade 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.990
 also provides the bousquet knife 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.780
 it was also drawn 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.969
 there is not much news it was drawn 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.550
 to go to a classic knife drawing of 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.610
 busquets but she is with the cut 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.949
 warm but it's a knife but it 's 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.620
 reinforced, a more robust knife is a 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:06.009
 fontaine knife that you have there 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.560
 the splints in micareta or celeron né 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:12.550
 calm a super tough material then 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.860
 it is a knife already a handmade knife that goes 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.199
 to provide is a bousquet practitioner 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.629
 a very good result that 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.029
 Julian have already proven and that soon 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.789
 he will do a demonstration of the fruit 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:26.830
 That's where we see us. 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.199
 We've been working there for practically 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.889
 a year there in the development of these 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.279
 knives 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.599
 soon you will have this news 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.430

 in the market knives to be used in the 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.129
 practice survival training 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.020
