futuristic<00:01:56.659> in<00:01:56.779> between<00:01:57.139> twenty<00:01:57.529> twenty<00:01:57.859> and

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
futuristic in between twenty twenty and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.799 
futuristic in between twenty twenty and
twenty<00:01:58.279> thirty<00:01:58.549> if<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.149> guys<00:01:59.270> do<00:01:59.509> not<00:01:59.630> know

modern warfare 3 ends around 2018 and he
was<00:02:03.169> shown<00:02:03.709> some<00:02:03.979> futuristic<00:02:04.549> guns<00:02:04.819> I<00:02:05.179> guess

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
was shown some futuristic guns I guess

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.120 
was shown some futuristic guns I guess
he<00:02:05.749> said<00:02:05.899> he<00:02:05.989> saw<00:02:06.200> an<00:02:06.289> assault<00:02:06.590> rifle<00:02:06.649> or

shotgun he says it kind of looked big
you<00:02:09.799> know<00:02:09.920> kind<00:02:10.219> of<00:02:10.280> like<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.519> titanfall

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
you know kind of like the titanfall

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.970 
you know kind of like the titanfall
weapons<00:02:11.480> he<00:02:11.599> compared<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.079> to<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.349> which<00:02:12.799> is

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
weapons he compared it to that which is

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.230 
weapons he compared it to that which is
really<00:02:13.189> weird<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.700> don't

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
really weird I don't

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.760 
really weird I don't
I<00:02:14.270> don't<00:02:14.510> know<00:02:14.600> but<00:02:14.990> he<00:02:15.110> also<00:02:15.230> said<00:02:15.500> he<00:02:15.530> could

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
I don't know but he also said he could

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.740 
I don't know but he also said he could
have<00:02:15.860> been<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> light<00:02:16.280> machine<00:02:16.670> gun<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.540> it

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
have been a light machine gun so it

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.150 
have been a light machine gun so it
basically<00:02:17.870> he<00:02:18.260> doesn't<00:02:18.650> know<00:02:18.740> what<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.130> but

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
basically he doesn't know what it is but

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.980 
basically he doesn't know what it is but
apparently<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.180> weapons<00:02:20.480> look<00:02:20.630> futuristic

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
apparently the weapons look futuristic

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.770 
apparently the weapons look futuristic
and<00:02:21.710> he<00:02:21.890> also<00:02:22.070> reiterated<00:02:22.390> another<00:02:23.390> leak<00:02:23.630> that

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
I went over my last video that there are

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.220 
I went over my last video that there are
the<00:02:25.730> physics<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.420> reflection<00:02:27.140> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
the physics and the reflection the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.080 
the physics and the reflection the
Lighting's<00:02:27.650> looking<00:02:27.950> really<00:02:28.190> great<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.610> it

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
Lighting's looking really great and it

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.970 
Lighting's looking really great and it
will<00:02:29.300> be<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.480> first<00:02:29.900> person<00:02:30.140> call<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.620> duty<00:02:30.830> as

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
like a power plant so that's very

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.120 
like a power plant so that's very
interesting<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.680> one<00:02:42.860> thing<00:02:43.070> that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
of reconfirmed another leak that came

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.730 
of reconfirmed another leak that came
out<00:02:46.940> just<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.240> couple<00:02:47.270> days<00:02:47.570> ago<00:02:47.750> if<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.620> guys

want to see that video there will be an

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.730 
want to see that video there will be an
annotation<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.870> link<00:02:50.990> in<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.260> description

again<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.250> was<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.030> blacksmith<00:02:53.630> rumor<00:02:53.900> that

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
again it was the blacksmith rumor that

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.930 
again it was the blacksmith rumor that
the<00:02:54.170> game<00:02:54.350> was<00:02:54.500> being<00:02:54.800> codenamed<00:02:55.310> blacksmith

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
the game was being codenamed blacksmith

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.880 
the game was being codenamed blacksmith
and<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.840> physics<00:02:57.170> were<00:02:57.320> great<00:02:57.620> and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
and that the physics were great and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.410 
and that the physics were great and
basically<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.460> rumor<00:02:58.760> confirmed<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.330> we

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
basically that rumor confirmed that we

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.940 
basically that rumor confirmed that we
would<00:02:59.540> be<00:02:59.630> getting<00:02:59.750> modern<00:03:00.200> warfare<00:03:00.410> for<00:03:00.740> this

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
would be getting modern warfare for this

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.370 
would be getting modern warfare for this
year<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.340> has<00:03:02.300> drifter<00:03:02.720> Canada<00:03:03.050> he<00:03:03.200> basically

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
year and has drifter Canada he basically

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.710 
year and has drifter Canada he basically
reconfirmed<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.400> information<00:03:05.180> so

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
reconfirmed that information so

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.450 
reconfirmed that information so
everything's<00:03:06.470> starting<00:03:06.740> to<00:03:06.950> come<00:03:07.250> together

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
everything's starting to come together

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.280 
everything's starting to come together
we're<00:03:07.850> gonna<00:03:08.000> probably<00:03:08.480> get<00:03:08.690> an<00:03:08.810> announcement

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
we're gonna probably get an announcement

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.440 
we're gonna probably get an announcement
later<00:03:09.470> on<00:03:09.680> maybe<00:03:09.830> this<00:03:10.130> month<00:03:10.400> or<00:03:10.580> maybe<00:03:11.120> next

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
later on maybe this month or maybe next

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.140 
later on maybe this month or maybe next
month<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:12.560> was<00:03:13.190> just<00:03:13.370> very<00:03:13.580> shocked<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.000> see

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
month so I was just very shocked to see

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.000 
month so I was just very shocked to see
this<00:03:14.300> video<00:03:14.570> up<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:14.930> fast<00:03:15.170> like<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.560> expected

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
this video up so fast like I expected

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.200 
this video up so fast like I expected
maybe<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.220> month<00:03:16.430> from<00:03:16.640> now<00:03:16.730> we<00:03:16.850> would<00:03:17.060> get

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
maybe a month from now we would get

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.730 
maybe a month from now we would get
something<00:03:17.570> like<00:03:17.750> this<00:03:17.930> from<00:03:18.110> drifter<00:03:18.560> or

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
something like this from drifter or

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.650 
something like this from drifter or
maybe<00:03:19.190> somebody<00:03:19.610> else<00:03:19.670> but<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.570> very

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
maybe somebody else but it is very

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.090 
maybe somebody else but it is very
interesting<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:21.290> drifter<00:03:21.740> has<00:03:21.890> this

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
interesting that drifter has this

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.620 
interesting that drifter has this
information<00:03:22.700> they<00:03:22.820> put<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.120> out<00:03:23.240> there<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.600> the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
information they put it out there to the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.420 
information they put it out there to the
public<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.770> gets<00:03:24.890> everybody's<00:03:25.310> attention

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
public so it gets everybody's attention

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.150 
public so it gets everybody's attention
and<00:03:25.910> let's<00:03:26.600> move<00:03:26.810> on<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.440> next<00:03:27.470> thing<00:03:27.890> and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
and let's move on to the next thing and

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.520 
and let's move on to the next thing and
it's<00:03:28.280> sledgehammers<00:03:28.910> job<00:03:29.270> listing<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.380> what

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
it's sledgehammers job listing so what

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.440 
it's sledgehammers job listing so what
this<00:03:30.650> job<00:03:30.920> listing<00:03:31.340> hat<00:03:31.550> says<00:03:31.850> it<00:03:32.090> basically

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
this job listing hat says it basically

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.790 
this job listing hat says it basically
says<00:03:32.750> they<00:03:32.900> were<00:03:32.960> looking<00:03:33.110> for<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.440> temporary

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800

gfx I mean VFX artists and the basically

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.850 
gfx I mean VFX artists and the basically
later<00:03:38.660> on<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.960> description<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.470> says<00:03:39.650> they're

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
later on the description it says they're

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.650 
later on the description it says they're
looking<00:03:40.070> for<00:03:40.250> somebody<00:03:40.790> that<00:03:40.940> can<00:03:41.240> that's

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
looking for somebody that can that's

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.150 
looking for somebody that can that's
comfortable<00:03:42.020> with<00:03:42.260> weaponary<00:03:42.740> effects

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160

comfortable with weaponary effects
vehicle<00:03:43.610> destruction<00:03:43.940> large-scale<00:03:44.600> rigid

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
vehicle destruction large-scale rigid

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.430 
vehicle destruction large-scale rigid
body<00:03:45.530> simulations<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.910> key<00:03:47.120> thing

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
body simulations and the key thing

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.380 
body simulations and the key thing
environmental<00:03:48.440> effects<00:03:49.130> such<00:03:49.370> as<00:03:49.400> fire<00:03:49.910> smoke

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
environmental effects such as fire smoke

water<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.020> weather<00:03:51.290> systems<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.700> well

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
water and weather systems so well

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.240 
water and weather systems so well
basically<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:54.080> could<00:03:54.410> change<00:03:54.440> call<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:55.040> duty

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
basically this could change call of duty

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.710 
basically this could change call of duty
forever<00:03:55.610> with<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:56.000> multiplayer<00:03:56.360> maps<00:03:56.570> you

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
forever with the multiplayer maps you

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.720 
forever with the multiplayer maps you
know<00:03:56.840> usually<00:03:57.080> just<00:03:57.410> played<00:03:57.740> with<00:03:57.770> say<00:03:58.670> you

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
know usually just played with say you

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.210 
know usually just played with say you
say<00:03:59.300> for<00:03:59.450> example<00:03:59.540> black<00:04:00.020> ops<00:04:00.260> 1<00:04:00.350> maps<00:04:00.800> no<00:04:01.190> I

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
say for example black ops 1 maps no I

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.070 
say for example black ops 1 maps no I
just<00:04:01.700> thought<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:02.000> that<00:04:02.120> randomly<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.720> you

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
just thought of that randomly the you

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.720 
just thought of that randomly the you
know<00:04:03.170> that's<00:04:03.350> played<00:04:03.590> at<00:04:03.740> night<00:04:03.920> we<00:04:04.430> could<00:04:04.580> be

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
know that's played at night we could be

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.190 
know that's played at night we could be
getting<00:04:04.880> some<00:04:05.210> type<00:04:05.390> of<00:04:05.420> Matt<00:04:05.690> let's<00:04:05.900> make<00:04:06.080> up

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
getting some type of Matt let's make up

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.350 
getting some type of Matt let's make up
a<00:04:06.290> random<00:04:06.620> app<00:04:06.740> name<00:04:06.920> right<00:04:07.100> now<00:04:07.360> retribution

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
a random app name right now retribution

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.030 
a random app name right now retribution
I<00:04:08.810> don't<00:04:08.990> know<00:04:09.050> why<00:04:09.110> I<00:04:09.140> thought<00:04:09.350> that<00:04:09.500> but<00:04:09.920> this

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
I don't know why I thought that but this

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.730 
I don't know why I thought that but this
map<00:04:10.250> retribution<00:04:10.640> it's<00:04:11.150> played<00:04:11.720> at<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:11.930> daytime

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
map retribution it's played at a daytime

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.300 
map retribution it's played at a daytime
and<00:04:13.360> we<00:04:14.360> could<00:04:14.570> have<00:04:14.750> now<00:04:14.959> have<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.440> as<00:04:15.590> daytime

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
and we could have now have it as daytime

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.039 
and we could have now have it as daytime
and<00:04:16.580> nighttime<00:04:16.850> week<00:04:17.330> would<00:04:17.480> have<00:04:17.630> different

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
and nighttime week would have different

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.840 
and nighttime week would have different
circumstances<00:04:18.859> we<00:04:19.040> could<00:04:19.220> be<00:04:19.310> playing<00:04:19.459> in<00:04:19.700> the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
circumstances we could be playing in the

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.280 
circumstances we could be playing in the
rain<00:04:19.970> we<00:04:20.180> could<00:04:20.330> be<00:04:20.390> playing<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.959> drizz

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
rain we could be playing it drizz

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.440 
rain we could be playing it drizz
drizzling<00:04:22.280> we<00:04:22.430> could<00:04:22.610> play<00:04:22.790> with<00:04:22.940> fog<00:04:23.240> you

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
drizzling we could play with fog you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.000 
drizzling we could play with fog you
could<00:04:23.600> play<00:04:23.750> clear<00:04:24.169> so<00:04:24.680> there's<00:04:24.890> different

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
could play clear so there's different

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.920 
could play clear so there's different
ways<00:04:25.400> these<00:04:25.610> maps<00:04:25.880> can<00:04:26.060> be<00:04:26.090> played<00:04:26.390> so<00:04:26.660> it'll

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
ways these maps can be played so it'll

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.440 
ways these maps can be played so it'll
would<00:04:27.050> change

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
would change

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.840 
would change
how<00:04:27.960> everybody<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.590> guess<00:04:28.920> reacts<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.580> plays

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
how everybody I guess reacts and plays

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.340 
how everybody I guess reacts and plays
the<00:04:29.880> multiplayer<00:04:30.390> maps<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.750> won't<00:04:30.930> be<00:04:31.170> the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
the multiplayer maps it won't be the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.990 
the multiplayer maps it won't be the
same<00:04:31.380> dull<00:04:31.860> map<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.610> we<00:04:32.700> play<00:04:32.940> every

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
same dull map that we play every

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.970 
same dull map that we play every
different<00:04:33.510> time<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:33.960> that's<00:04:34.470> what<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.710> really

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
different time and that's what I really

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.130 
different time and that's what I really
do<00:04:35.100> like<00:04:35.310> about<00:04:35.520> this<00:04:35.850> next-gen<00:04:36.480> that<00:04:37.020> we're

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
do like about this next-gen that we're

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.540 
do like about this next-gen that we're
going<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.320> have<00:04:37.440> so<00:04:37.710> much<00:04:37.770> different<00:04:38.250> features

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
going to have so much different features

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.070 
going to have so much different features
coming<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:39.000> all<00:04:39.180> kinds<00:04:39.510> of<00:04:39.690> games<00:04:39.840> not<00:04:40.050> just

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
coming to all kinds of games not just

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.870 
coming to all kinds of games not just
call<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.440> duty<00:04:40.800> but<00:04:41.280> let<00:04:41.370> me<00:04:41.430> know<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.700> guys

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
call it duty but let me know you guys
