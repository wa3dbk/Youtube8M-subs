00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 Hello everyone, you are watching a video blog 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.629
 herbarium and we talk about beer 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.189
 and today we will talk about another beer 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.470
 who tried brussels in there 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.050
 the beer bar seemed to me delicious and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.790
 interesting however i'm not inclined at all 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.130
 trusts my feelings because i'm 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.289
 that evening already went around a lot of bars it was 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 the last I was by then 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.910
 enough date and how it is known 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.250
 the more you drink the beer the tastier you 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.980
 seem follower varieties that you 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.840
 revenues are falling see did but in 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.149
 herbariums well and here we forgot this lesson about 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.190
 which we survey 18 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.190
 did he do for 1 review 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.050
 spin fat previous sample us 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.370
 pleased 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.710
 Leave a reference not 10 surprising 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.060
 dare and 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.040
 and today we are trying delirium beer 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.360
 tremens if someone suddenly seemed not 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.820
 knows Latin this delirium tremens 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.650
 translates to shaking dizziness 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.600
 or more simply, in Russian delirium tremens 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.430
 beer got its strange name 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.800
 because of the high alcohol content and 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.000
 hint manufacturers on the fact that 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.979
 the use of such strong alcohol 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.420
 Drinks are harmful and maybe cause 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.090
 is that the dealer is his first 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.220
 cooked eighty-ninth year and at that 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.450
 time as you know anything good in 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.450
 principle did not invent 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.670
 However, the beer is rumored to be quite 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.430
 myself worthy and even won some 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.260
 high beer awards by the way I bought 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.230
 its in one of the Moscow supermarket in 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.880
 a typical set here such as 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.770
 I was tempted by the price 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.870
 in markdown cost thousands of rubles instead 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.520
 one and a half as indicated on the price tag can 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.620
 be what kind of marketing victim but I don't 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.170
 I know if you consider that a bottle of beer 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.840
 this in itself 03 is around 250 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.010
 rubles and here their 4 is still attached 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.470
 corporate glass 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:21.840
 Well, my little internal Jew 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:25.260
 the bottle triumphs among other things very 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.840
 pretty made of pottery and on 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.180
 the label shows everything 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.310
 delirium tremens pink elephant 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.610
 green crocodile dragons some 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.470
 terrifying bird pink elephant itself 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.920
 and is the logo of this beer 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:48.870
 pink elephant 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:51.150
 and green let's try by the way me 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.700
 I like it when beer is drunk 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.610
 It is from the brand glass in this 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.160
 There is no wonder these manufacturers make that 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.440
 or another form 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.390
 Beer is very beautiful turbid 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.130
 straw color with lots of 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.770
 bubbles that raise even with 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.540
 center on the glass such as a small 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.430
 Vulcan 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.310
 foam tight and snow white principle 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.100
 brewed beer is very worthy of the aroma of beer 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.459
 citrus very very nice let's 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.459
 try it 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.710
 the same ones prevail in taste 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.650
 citrus notes although very interesting 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.240
 no orange peel in this amount 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.820
 having bought like for example in the same cougar yes 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.830
 no to dealers taste remotely 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.240
 reminds hoegaarden however compares 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.040
 two sorts of these beers are like 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:45.560
 creativity turning the gun to taste 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.750
 the delirium is much brighter much 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.440
 more interesting is revealed and drink it 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.570
 Much nicer than treating 8 and 9 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.490
 in principle does not feel with beer drink 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.940
 easy enough however it feels like 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.950
 beer spreads warmly throughout the body and in 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.800
 You understand that a lot of such beer 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.690
 drink impossible and probably drink 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.080
 his gulps do not feel better 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.180
 like that pull up on the chair protrude 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.490
 little finger impetigo to any 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.770
 beer connoisseurs then 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.510
 them across the sky 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.520
 the assessment there will be high beer I will put 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.810
 8 and a half on a scale beer Larry and I 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.580
 I think this is one of the most delicious 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.320
 beers that my words don't 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.250
 tried as part of our beer reviews 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.910
 and eight and a half is 9 because 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.100
 probably all the same this strong drink beer 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.810
 its hard but when compared to 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.370
 the same beer de ville which we 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.860
 tried in one of the previous reviews 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.840
 and stoked it seemed to me more tasty but 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.790
 I'll save the bottle for Vanya so he 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.520
 also could appreciate perhaps he will agree 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.360
 but it can appliance case thanks for 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.020
