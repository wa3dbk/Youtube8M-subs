you a massive advantage maybe guys will
do<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:13.079> think<00:04:13.560> that's<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.920> scenario<00:04:14.160> well

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
do it I think that's a scenario well

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.280 
do it I think that's a scenario well
that's<00:04:14.579> not<00:04:14.790> okay<00:04:15.090> anymore<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.690> think<00:04:16.169> we'll

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
that's not okay anymore I think we'll

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.900 
that's not okay anymore I think we'll
see<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.470> very<00:04:16.709> different<00:04:16.799> sport<00:04:17.370> going<00:04:17.609> forward

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
see a very different sport going forward

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.400 
see a very different sport going forward
you're<00:04:18.000> not<00:04:18.180> going<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.419> see<00:04:18.600> these<00:04:18.750> guys<00:04:19.019> in

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
you're not going to see these guys in

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.370 
you're not going to see these guys in
their<00:04:19.890> mid<00:04:19.919> 40s<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.790> there<00:04:20.880> later<00:04:21.120> 40s<00:04:21.720> going

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
their mid 40s and there later 40s going

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.570 
their mid 40s and there later 40s going
and<00:04:22.560> being<00:04:22.680> able<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.039> compete<00:04:23.310> at<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.550> high

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
and being able to compete at a high

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.150 
and being able to compete at a high
level<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:24.300> it's<00:04:25.140> probably<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.650> change<00:04:25.919> for<00:04:26.099> the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
level and it's probably a change for the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.440 
level and it's probably a change for the
better<00:04:26.220> it's<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.669> change<00:04:26.910> for<00:04:27.060> better

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
better it's a change for better

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.180 
better it's a change for better
for<00:04:27.780> these<00:04:27.870> guys<00:04:28.050> better<00:04:28.410> long-term<00:04:28.710> health

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
for these guys better long-term health

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.710 
for these guys better long-term health
but<00:04:29.640> it<00:04:29.820> will<00:04:29.970> definitely<00:04:30.090> affect<00:04:30.390> some<00:04:30.630> of

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
but it will definitely affect some of

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.360 
but it will definitely affect some of
them<00:04:30.810> well<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.020> know<00:04:31.110> Gilbert<00:04:31.350> Melendez<00:04:31.830> he's

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
them well you know Gilbert Melendez he's

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.520 
them well you know Gilbert Melendez he's
one<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.670> the<00:04:32.730> fortunate<00:04:32.970> ones<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:33.660> have<00:04:34.380> been

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
one of the fortunate ones that have been

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.470 
one of the fortunate ones that have been
able<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.010> make<00:04:35.130> money<00:04:35.340> in<00:04:35.580> mixed<00:04:35.880> martial<00:04:35.910> arts

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.120 
able to make money in mixed martial arts
so<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.840> don't<00:04:37.170> think<00:04:37.380> this<00:04:37.500> year<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.950> going<00:04:38.070> to

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
so I don't think this year is going to

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.290 
so I don't think this year is going to
hurt<00:04:38.370> them<00:04:38.520> like<00:04:38.550> some<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.150> other

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300

paydays but also you look at the fact
that<00:04:50.520> guilt<00:04:51.060> now<00:04:51.300> can<00:04:51.540> take<00:04:51.720> a<00:04:51.750> step<00:04:52.080> back<00:04:52.320> and

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
that guilt now can take a step back and

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.290 
that guilt now can take a step back and
it<00:04:52.920> can<00:04:53.040> be<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.160> good<00:04:53.370> thing<00:04:53.430> because<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:53.970> lot<00:04:54.270> of

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
it can be a good thing because a lot of

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.900 
it can be a good thing because a lot of
especially<00:04:54.690> a<00:04:54.990> fighter<00:04:55.290> of<00:04:55.470> his<00:04:55.740> stature<00:04:56.460> and

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
especially a fighter of his stature and

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.760 
especially a fighter of his stature and
the<00:04:57.030> wars<00:04:57.480> that<00:04:57.690> he's<00:04:57.840> gone<00:04:58.050> through<00:04:58.380> how

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
the wars that he's gone through how

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.100 
the wars that he's gone through how
important<00:04:59.250> is<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.400> break<00:04:59.820> I<00:05:00.090> think<00:05:00.600> if<00:05:00.720> Gilbert

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
important is a break I think if Gilbert

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.350 
important is a break I think if Gilbert
Melendez<00:05:01.590> said<00:05:01.920> after<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.460> fight<00:05:02.760> I'm

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
Melendez said after that fight I'm

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.630 
Melendez said after that fight I'm
choosing<00:05:04.260> to<00:05:04.290> take<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.560> year<00:05:04.890> off<00:05:05.040> I'm<00:05:05.370> gonna<00:05:05.430> do

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
choosing to take a year off I'm gonna do

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.250 
choosing to take a year off I'm gonna do
a<00:05:05.670> little<00:05:05.850> TV<00:05:06.090> work<00:05:06.510> I'm<00:05:06.870> gonna<00:05:06.960> learn<00:05:07.230> a

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
a little TV work I'm gonna learn a

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.050 
a little TV work I'm gonna learn a
little<00:05:07.530> more<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:07.860> different<00:05:08.340> angle<00:05:08.820> on<00:05:08.940> the

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
little more of a different angle on the

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.380 
little more of a different angle on the
sport<00:05:09.390> made<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:09.930> grass<00:05:10.590> save<00:05:11.460> up<00:05:11.640> my<00:05:11.820> body<00:05:12.030> and

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
sport made of grass save up my body and

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.000 
sport made of grass save up my body and
kind<00:05:12.720> of<00:05:12.780> regenerate<00:05:13.290> myself<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:13.800> get<00:05:13.860> my

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
kind of regenerate myself and get my

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.770 
kind of regenerate myself and get my
health<00:05:14.250> together<00:05:14.430> like<00:05:14.730> Frank<00:05:15.000> Mir<00:05:15.270> did<00:05:15.540> I

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
health together like Frank Mir did I

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.090 
health together like Frank Mir did I
think<00:05:16.200> it<00:05:16.260> would<00:05:16.380> have<00:05:16.470> been<00:05:16.530> very<00:05:16.830> beneficial

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
think it would have been very beneficial

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.890 
think it would have been very beneficial
for<00:05:17.700> him<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:18.180> take<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.420> year<00:05:18.600> off<00:05:18.750> I<00:05:18.870> think

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
for him to take a year off I think

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.960 
for him to take a year off I think
that's<00:05:19.170> a<00:05:19.260> benefit<00:05:19.620> but<00:05:19.950> the<00:05:20.070> way<00:05:20.280> it<00:05:20.490> happens

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
that's a benefit but the way it happens

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.790 
that's a benefit but the way it happens
it's<00:05:21.150> it's<00:05:21.390> damaging<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.230> people<00:05:22.560> who<00:05:22.650> don't

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
it's it's damaging to people who don't

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.820 
it's it's damaging to people who don't
necessarily<00:05:23.630> are<00:05:24.630> so<00:05:24.960> in<00:05:25.140> it<00:05:25.320> it's<00:05:25.500> black<00:05:25.710> and
