00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.270
 a man in the kitchen today I'm going to 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.980
 prepare an italian racing and as you see 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.400
 Here we have the ingredients for 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.110
 start that it is very easy and simple to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.010
 body of water 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.770
 let's use 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.770
 and apple cider vinegar a diet quote 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.320
 a teaspoon of sauces 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.440
 and a quarter cup of olive oil 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.650
 what is necessary and here as you can see 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.320
 We have 2 cloves of garlic a quarter of 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.080
 onions already ready to chop it and a 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.670
 Red chili to give color come and 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.420
 let's use a little sugar 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.120
 pepper and salt let's start applying 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.329
 the ingredients 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.200
 we move the onion 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.730
 the garlic 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:57.130
 and is to criticize it very finite because yes 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.130
 that should not be noticed 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:12.020
 you can start like this and as much as you can 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.020
 As long as they are not done together 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 do not 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:45.630
 and we have the garlic here full of logic 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:49.490
 We have the smallest thing that can be applied 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.490
 it is better 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.760
 is ready, let's continue with each other 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.250
 flavor 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.190
 we are going to add this as they can 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.190
 check 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.550
 AHA 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.319
 yes 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.319
 ah 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.610
 we have the water 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.040
 and this side we have onion and the 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.670
 list and now we're going to start with the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.230
 Water 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.230
 a quarter cup of water 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.319
 and what 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.939
 one is spoonful of sugar 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.939
 that is, brown or regular 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:38.370
 and we are going to put what follows next 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.370
 Apple vinager 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.420
 this new rate is seems that very well 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.480
 we have here 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.670
 and a quarter of olive oil 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.100
 enough food 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.820
 but how do we give 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.820
 more or less 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.260
 about a quarter 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.799
 and this will be very rich 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:26.599
 and we put a little bit of sun too 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:30.069
 to give it flavor and color is not much 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.069
 a teaspoon 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.610
 so we have all of us continue with the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.610
 Pepper 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.860
 a spoon of this also pepper 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.240
 it's not because it 's easier to 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.240
 to use it 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.150
 and salt the same too 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.750
 a teaspoon is the measure 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.750
 from the earth 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:23.590
 and we're going to give him a shake 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.590
 to see how we will 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.039
 if we determine what is 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.039
 how will it be 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.199
 ah 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.430
 we can add a little more 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:54.180
 of apple cider vinegar and more a little 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.180
 less very strong 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.230
 and if for some reason they do not have that 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.340
 vinegar apple ingredient can 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.140
 use white vegetable vinegar but what 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.020
 more recommendable is this for the taste 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.030
 that has apple 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.030
 and here we have it as you can see 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:25.460

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.000

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.850
