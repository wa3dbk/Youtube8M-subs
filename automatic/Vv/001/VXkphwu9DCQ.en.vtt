Photoshop and create a new file given a

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.950 
Photoshop and create a new file given a
name<00:00:16.299> of<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:16.660> banner<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:18.640> let's<00:00:19.360> create

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
name of the banner with let's create

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.029 
name of the banner with let's create
document<00:00:20.890> of<00:00:21.070> about<00:00:21.640> 800<00:00:22.449> pixels<00:00:22.869> x<00:00:23.320> 800

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
document of about 800 pixels x 800

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.550 
document of about 800 pixels x 800
pixels<00:00:24.070> and<00:00:24.820> click<00:00:25.029> OK<00:00:27.480> first<00:00:28.480> thing<00:00:28.779> we<00:00:29.439> need

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
pixels and click OK first thing we need

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.670 
pixels and click OK first thing we need
to<00:00:29.640> decide<00:00:30.640> how<00:00:31.090> large<00:00:31.510> our<00:00:31.810> bond<00:00:32.079> is<00:00:32.109> going<00:00:32.529> to

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
to decide how large our bond is going to

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.090 
to decide how large our bond is going to
be<00:00:33.120> my<00:00:34.120> banner<00:00:34.420> will<00:00:34.870> be<00:00:35.079> about<00:00:35.320> five<00:00:35.800> hundred

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
be my banner will be about five hundred

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.900 
be my banner will be about five hundred
sixty<00:00:37.030> pixels<00:00:37.440> by<00:00:38.440> hundred<00:00:38.920> pixels<00:00:39.100> so<00:00:39.760> if<00:00:39.850> we

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
sixty pixels by hundred pixels so if we

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.670 
sixty pixels by hundred pixels so if we
open<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.360> info<00:00:41.290> panel<00:00:41.730> use<00:00:42.730> our<00:00:42.910> selection<00:00:43.680> tool

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
open a info panel use our selection tool

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.979 
open a info panel use our selection tool
and<00:00:45.120> let's<00:00:46.120> create<00:00:46.450> something<00:00:47.140> about<00:00:48.120> 560<00:00:50.370> by

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and let's create something about 560 by

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:04.499 
and let's create something about 560 by
hundred<00:00:54.390> sorry<00:00:56.309> 560<00:00:57.840> by<00:00:58.840> about<00:00:59.110> 100<00:01:03.509> okay

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
hundred sorry 560 by about 100 okay

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.899 
hundred sorry 560 by about 100 okay
there<00:01:04.839> we<00:01:04.929> go<00:01:05.130> now<00:01:06.130> if<00:01:06.310> we<00:01:06.369> go<00:01:06.399> to<00:01:06.549> layers

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
there we go now if we go to layers

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.559 
there we go now if we go to layers
create<00:01:07.569> a<00:01:07.719> new<00:01:07.990> layer<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.939> fill<00:01:09.939> this<00:01:10.299> one

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:10.569 
create a new layer and fill this one

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:15.059 
create a new layer and fill this one
with<00:01:11.499> the<00:01:11.770> white<00:01:12.219> color<00:01:13.170> deselect<00:01:14.170> go<00:01:14.829> to<00:01:14.889> the

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:15.069 
with the white color deselect go to the

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:16.649 
with the white color deselect go to the
background<00:01:15.279> and<00:01:15.670> fill<00:01:15.969> it<00:01:16.090> up<00:01:16.149> with<00:01:16.209> a<00:01:16.389> black

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.999 
background and fill it up with a black
color<00:01:16.929> now<00:01:17.619> this<00:01:17.889> is<00:01:18.039> our<00:01:18.659> stage<00:01:19.659> and<00:01:20.079> this<00:01:20.889> is

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
color now this is our stage and this is

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.120 
color now this is our stage and this is
everything<00:01:21.369> outside<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:21.939> stage<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.770> first

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
everything outside of the stage so first

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.279 
everything outside of the stage so first
thing<00:01:24.399> we're<00:01:24.849> going<00:01:24.999> to<00:01:25.060> create<00:01:25.329> we<00:01:25.929> go<00:01:26.049> we're

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
thing we're going to create we go we're

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.989 
thing we're going to create we go we're
going<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.529> duplicate<00:01:26.859> this<00:01:27.459> layer<00:01:27.520> which

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
going to duplicate this layer which

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.289 
going to duplicate this layer which
which<00:01:28.179> which<00:01:28.929> will<00:01:29.169> just<00:01:29.380> create<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.299> we

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
which which will just create it and we

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.089 
which which will just create it and we
are<00:01:31.419> going<00:01:31.569> to<00:01:31.689> fill<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.020> up<00:01:32.229> with<00:01:32.289> some<00:01:32.859> nice

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:33.099 
are going to fill it up with some nice

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:38.190 
are going to fill it up with some nice
gradient<00:01:35.039> let's<00:01:36.039> go<00:01:36.189> to<00:01:36.249> the<00:01:36.450> gradients<00:01:37.450> and

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
gradient let's go to the gradients and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.499 
gradient let's go to the gradients and
select<00:01:39.069> something<00:01:39.749> perhaps<00:01:40.749> gray<00:01:41.469> light<00:01:42.340> gray

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
select something perhaps gray light gray

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.029 
select something perhaps gray light gray
this<00:01:43.509> one<00:01:43.779> looks<00:01:43.959> fine<00:01:45.329> reverse<00:01:46.709> and<00:01:47.709> we've

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
this one looks fine reverse and we've

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.510 
this one looks fine reverse and we've
got<00:01:49.169> the<00:01:50.700> first<00:01:51.700> stage<00:01:52.469> okay<00:01:53.469> now<00:01:53.919> if<00:01:54.189> we<00:01:54.340> put

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
got the first stage okay now if we put

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.219 
got the first stage okay now if we put
some<00:01:54.729> text<00:01:55.029> on<00:01:55.479> top<00:01:56.079> of<00:01:56.439> it<00:01:56.619> let's<00:01:57.429> say<00:01:58.229> twenty

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
some text on top of it let's say twenty

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:07.149 
some text on top of it let's say twenty
percent<00:01:59.770> discount<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:02.469> all<00:02:03.450> products

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.999 

but<00:02:07.789> as<00:02:07.850> we<00:02:07.999> can<00:02:08.179> add<00:02:08.509> some<00:02:08.840> colors<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:09.830> as

well<00:02:13.060> okay<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.300> go<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:16.569> character

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
well okay if we go to the character

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.820 
well okay if we go to the character
panel<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:22.569> some<00:02:23.569> perhaps<00:02:24.319> this<00:02:24.500> kind<00:02:24.769> of

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830

bluish<00:02:25.190> color<00:02:27.430> something<00:02:28.430> like<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:29.410> that's

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
bluish color something like this that's

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.550 
bluish color something like this that's
all<00:02:30.590> fine<00:02:32.980> what<00:02:33.980> else<00:02:34.220> we<00:02:34.370> can<00:02:34.489> add<00:02:34.640> some<00:02:35.560> some

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
all fine what else we can add some some

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.550 
all fine what else we can add some some
nice<00:02:36.739> brush<00:02:37.129> some<00:02:37.459> some<00:02:37.760> element<00:02:38.560> moving

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
nice brush some some element moving

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.250 
nice brush some some element moving
behind<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:40.129> text<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.910> it's<00:02:41.060> create<00:02:41.450> another

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
behind the text so it's create another

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.800 
behind the text so it's create another
layer<00:02:42.500> under<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.280> text<00:02:43.549> layer<00:02:43.700> go<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:44.599> the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
layer under the text layer go to the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.300 
layer under the text layer go to the
brushes<00:02:46.000> I've<00:02:47.049> downloaded<00:02:48.049> quite<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.010> few
