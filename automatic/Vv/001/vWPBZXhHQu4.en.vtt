00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
looks to be I think they used to use

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.249 
looks to be I think they used to use
this<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.479> soccer<00:02:00.719> drills<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.110> every

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
this for soccer drills and every

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.359 
this for soccer drills and every
sometimes<00:02:01.590> never<00:02:01.829> they're<00:02:01.950> playing<00:02:02.159> frisbee

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
sometimes never they're playing frisbee

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.340 
sometimes never they're playing frisbee
that<00:02:02.670> would<00:02:02.759> use<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.930> try<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> get

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
that would use this and you try to get

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.120 
that would use this and you try to get
these<00:02:04.439> through<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> holes

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

but<00:02:05.250> there's<00:02:05.399> chains<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:08.750> not<00:02:09.750> quite

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
but there's chains here so not quite

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.630 
but there's chains here so not quite
sure<00:02:10.050> about<00:02:10.410> that

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.460 

we<00:02:13.640> do<00:02:13.819> look<00:02:14.090> at<00:02:14.209> this<00:02:14.330> some<00:02:14.540> wheat<00:02:14.750> we<00:02:15.319> can
