00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
consistent and execute the shot how you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.840 
consistent and execute the shot how you
want<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.260> first<00:00:40.559> thing<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.190> do<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
want the first thing we have to do is is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.360 
want the first thing we have to do is is
get<00:00:42.090> our<00:00:42.300> bodies<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.170> our<00:00:43.410> hips<00:00:43.739> our

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
get our bodies and get our hips our

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.150 
get our bodies and get our hips our
torso<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.239> our<00:00:45.329> shoulders<00:00:45.960> level<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
torso and our shoulders level with the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.729 
torso and our shoulders level with the
gradient<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> slope<00:00:48.410> what<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.559> might

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
gradient of the slope what you might

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
gradient of the slope what you might
find<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.280> when<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> ball

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
find is when you do this that the ball

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.350 
find is when you do this that the ball
is<00:00:51.809> gonna<00:00:51.930> come<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> little<00:00:52.620> higher<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
is gonna come out a little higher so you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.850 
is gonna come out a little higher so you
definitely<00:00:54.510> probably<00:00:54.960> want<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.289> Club<00:00:55.590> down

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
definitely probably want to Club down

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.799 
definitely probably want to Club down
one<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.219> two<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.910> if<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.329> an<00:00:57.600> 8-iron

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
one or two so if you have an 8-iron

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.060 
one or two so if you have an 8-iron
maybe<00:00:58.710> go<00:00:58.920> down<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> seven<00:00:59.789> or<00:00:59.910> even<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.300> six

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
maybe go down to a seven or even a six

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.880 
maybe go down to a seven or even a six
when<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> go<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> hit<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> shop<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.890> definitely

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
when you go to hit the shop I definitely

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.890 
when you go to hit the shop I definitely
want<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> swing<00:01:05.700> nice<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.210> smoothly<00:01:06.540> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
want you to swing nice and smoothly this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.420 
want you to swing nice and smoothly this
isn't<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> shot<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.799> you're<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> try

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
isn't a shot that you're going to try

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.950 
isn't a shot that you're going to try
and<00:01:08.610> hit<00:01:08.850> hard<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.799> try<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.920> force<00:01:11.869> when<00:01:12.869> you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and hit hard or try and force when you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.580 
and hit hard or try and force when you
get<00:01:13.140> into<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.530> setup<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.930> thing<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.350> want

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
get into your setup the one thing I want

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.969 
get into your setup the one thing I want
you<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> focus<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.450> shot<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.979> where

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
you to focus on in the shot is where

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.890 
you to focus on in the shot is where
your<00:01:20.220> weight<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.540> gonna<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
your weight is I know it's gonna be a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.929 
your weight is I know it's gonna be a
little<00:01:22.080> bit<00:01:22.290> difficult<00:01:22.560> because<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.400> set

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
little bit difficult because we are set

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.660 
little bit difficult because we are set
up<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.140> us<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.619> our<00:01:25.650> bodies<00:01:26.310> this

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
up you know with us with our bodies this

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.270 
up you know with us with our bodies this
way<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.600> want<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.259> try<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> little

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
way and we want to try and get a little

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.910 
way and we want to try and get a little
bit<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.820> pressure<00:01:30.240> into<00:01:30.960> our<00:01:31.380> left-sided

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
bit of pressure into our left-sided

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920 
bit of pressure into our left-sided
impact<00:01:32.549> we'd<00:01:32.909> certainly<00:01:33.180> don't<00:01:33.479> want<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.780> get

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
impact we'd certainly don't want to get

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.719 
impact we'd certainly don't want to get
too<00:01:34.170> much<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.799> dig<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.159> club<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
too much because we dig the club in the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.149 
too much because we dig the club in the
ground<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.450> hang<00:01:36.750> back<00:01:37.110> we'll<00:01:37.829> simply

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
ground and if we hang back we'll simply

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.880 
ground and if we hang back we'll simply
balloon<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.970> ball<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.390> into<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> air<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.860> I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
balloon the ball up into the air so I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.359 
balloon the ball up into the air so I
would<00:01:41.159> suggest<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.560> set<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
would suggest that you set up with the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.730 
would suggest that you set up with the
gradient<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> slope<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.720> impact<00:01:46.409> just

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
gradient of the slope and impact just

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.969 
gradient of the slope and impact just
feel<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.009> probably<00:01:48.049> 55<00:01:49.049> percent<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.799> your

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
feel that probably 55 percent of your

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340 
feel that probably 55 percent of your
weight<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.430> your<00:01:50.700> left<00:01:50.880> side<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:52.049> will
