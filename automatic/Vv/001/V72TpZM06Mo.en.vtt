00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
really surprised about that action o gg

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:08.180 
really surprised about that action o gg
gg<00:07:01.550> so<00:07:03.200> orianna<00:07:04.200> i<00:07:05.060> am<00:07:06.140> not<00:07:07.140> the<00:07:07.200> best<00:07:07.650> you

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
gg so orianna i am not the best you

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.680 
gg so orianna i am not the best you
would<00:07:08.340> think<00:07:08.370> i<00:07:08.760> would<00:07:08.820> be<00:07:09.060> good<00:07:09.210> because<00:07:09.420> she

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
would think i would be good because she

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.440 
would think i would be good because she
handles<00:07:10.050> a<00:07:10.140> lot<00:07:10.170> of<00:07:10.440> balls<00:07:10.770> and<00:07:11.450> that's

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450 
handles a lot of balls and that's

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.740 
handles a lot of balls and that's
something<00:07:12.690> i<00:07:12.870> have<00:07:13.080> a<00:07:13.110> lot<00:07:13.350> of<00:07:13.380> Xperia<00:07:13.950> um<00:07:14.750> no

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
something i have a lot of Xperia um no

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.890 
something i have a lot of Xperia um no
she<00:07:15.810> seems<00:07:16.140> like<00:07:16.290> a<00:07:16.350> lot<00:07:16.470> of<00:07:16.500> fun<00:07:16.710> but<00:07:16.980> I

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
she seems like a lot of fun but I

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.270 
she seems like a lot of fun but I
honestly<00:07:18.900> in<00:07:19.230> the<00:07:19.350> one<00:07:19.530> for<00:07:19.770> all<00:07:19.860> there's<00:07:20.070> just

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
honestly in the one for all there's just

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.210 
honestly in the one for all there's just
too<00:07:20.490> many<00:07:20.610> balls<00:07:21.260> can't<00:07:22.260> handle<00:07:22.650> that<00:07:22.950> many

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 
too many balls can't handle that many

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.900 
too many balls can't handle that many
balls<00:07:24.380> so<00:07:25.380> I<00:07:25.980> think<00:07:26.130> that<00:07:26.310> she'd<00:07:26.520> be<00:07:26.610> better<00:07:26.730> in

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:26.910 
balls so I think that she'd be better in

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.820 
balls so I think that she'd be better in
a<00:07:26.970> normal<00:07:27.180> game<00:07:27.480> to<00:07:27.660> be<00:07:27.780> honest<00:07:28.080> I<00:07:28.320> might<00:07:28.680> have

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830 
a normal game to be honest I might have

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.170 
a normal game to be honest I might have
a<00:07:28.860> little<00:07:29.070> bit<00:07:29.250> more<00:07:29.370> hope<00:07:29.580> for<00:07:29.610> her<00:07:29.880> in<00:07:30.060> a

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
a little bit more hope for her in a

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.420 
a little bit more hope for her in a
normal<00:07:30.390> game<00:07:30.720> so<00:07:31.440> if<00:07:31.500> you<00:07:31.590> guys<00:07:31.710> enjoyed<00:07:32.190> this
