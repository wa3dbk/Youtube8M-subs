00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.439
 Wearable as you can see him knock his 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.750
 head to the turtle hat for a horn 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.210
 but we can put it back to you 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.780
 they are armables see in the previous video 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.090
 I showed them they are a bit like legos because 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.060
 They are assemblable figures but these are 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.080
 they come armed and good to see here is the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.930
 tortuguita one horn 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.390

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.370
 these are the ones that come for and mario 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.580

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.570
 hammer brow that if you know the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.580
 name of him in Spanish stop knowing 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.800
 in the comments because I was 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.410
 confusing with a pattern for but not 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.230
 It is said that hammer called pro but not 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.530
 I know how to say it in Spanish and then here 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.020

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.360
 all because it is disassemblable we can 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.819
 arm and reassemble we want and the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.120
 hammer pro this is so called because 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.020
 comes with this one that is like a hammer and 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.150
 hence we can put your little hand I have 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.370

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.600

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.190
 that bomb 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.700
 She is already armed but she assumes that 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.210
 we have to be able to arm and disarm 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.210
 see your feet 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.600
