she said why are you whispering because

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.310

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
sound travels over water and that last

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:18.910 
sound travels over water and that last
phrase<00:03:08.590> makes<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.040> premeditated

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
upstream right maybe when we're done we

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.690 
upstream right maybe when we're done we
could<00:03:23.549> throw<00:03:23.700> raspberries<00:03:24.510> at<00:03:24.659> the<00:03:24.750> moon

that's<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:27.060> as<00:03:27.209> logical<00:03:27.659> of<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.810> thought<00:03:28.019> then

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950
