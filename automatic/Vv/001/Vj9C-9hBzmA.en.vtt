an ashram craft rounder that is heavy at
one<00:00:16.049> end<00:00:16.640> and<00:00:17.640> just<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> pencil<00:00:19.470> sharpener

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
one end and just like a pencil sharpener

00:00:19.880 --> 00:01:09.790 
one end and just like a pencil sharpener
it<00:00:20.880> goes<00:00:21.090> around<00:00:21.770> and<00:00:24.170> shakes<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.470> stock

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.609 

this<00:01:10.800> is<00:01:11.040> another<00:01:11.369> use<00:01:11.729> for<00:01:12.200> wooden<00:01:13.200> threads

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
this is another use for wooden threads

this<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.550> cheese<00:01:15.119> press<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:16.050> you<00:01:16.259> take<00:01:16.500> out

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
this is a cheese press if you take out

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.010 
this is a cheese press if you take out
all<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.340> thumb<00:01:17.580> screws<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.300> remove<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
all of the thumb screws and remove the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.900 
all of the thumb screws and remove the
molding<00:01:19.440> then<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.950> window<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.490> come<00:01:20.700> right

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
now the screws that hold the windows in

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.740 
now the screws that hold the windows in
place<00:01:28.050> are<00:01:28.580> threaded<00:01:29.580> thumb<00:01:29.910> screws<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:32.750> they

that<00:02:08.489> these<00:02:08.670> are<00:02:08.880> wooden<00:02:09.149> threads<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.790> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that these are wooden threads and the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.690 
that these are wooden threads and the
bottom<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.360> held<00:02:12.660> with<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.020> nut<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.950> thread<00:02:14.520> as

bottom is held with a nut and thread as

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.270 
bottom is held with a nut and thread as
well<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.599> very<00:02:15.930> large<00:02:16.280> parallel

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
large dowels such as these would be used

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.600 
large dowels such as these would be used
for<00:02:28.380> vise<00:02:29.420> screws<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.770> smaller<00:02:31.770> dowels<00:02:32.340> would

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
for vise screws and smaller dowels would

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.119 
for vise screws and smaller dowels would
be<00:02:32.790> used<00:02:33.060> for<00:02:33.420> hand<00:02:33.690> clamp<00:02:33.989> these<00:02:34.379> are<00:02:34.709> some<00:02:34.950> of

hits the shoulder unscrew it put another

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.530 
hits the shoulder unscrew it put another
one<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:52.950> keep<00:03:53.190> going<00:03:53.670> now<00:03:54.480> the

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
needed other sizes so this would be a

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.950 
needed other sizes so this would be a
place<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.769> put<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.610> different<00:04:03.420> size<00:04:03.709> screw<00:04:04.709> box
