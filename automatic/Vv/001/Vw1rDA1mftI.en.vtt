00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
think it has a positive message in the

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.380 
think it has a positive message in the
end<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.370> think<00:04:24.580> if<00:04:24.670> you<00:04:24.790> want<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.270> learn

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
end I think if you want you to learn

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.180 
end I think if you want you to learn
something<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:26.020> want<00:04:26.560> people<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.890> know<00:04:27.010> that

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
something I want people to know that

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.740 
something I want people to know that
it's<00:04:27.340> real<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.820> lot<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.060> passion<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:28.720> a

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
it's real it's a lot of passion and a

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.870 
it's real it's a lot of passion and a
lot<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.560> hard<00:04:29.860> work<00:04:29.950> has<00:04:30.340> gone<00:04:30.370> into<00:04:30.580> this

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
lot of hard work has gone into this

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.120 
lot of hard work has gone into this
project<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:32.260> think<00:04:32.320> people<00:04:32.620> should<00:04:32.800> watch

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
project and I think people should watch

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.640 
project and I think people should watch
it<00:04:33.160> because<00:04:33.550> it's<00:04:34.450> just<00:04:34.600> something<00:04:35.350> for

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
it because it's just something for

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.540 
it because it's just something for
everybody<00:04:35.950> but<00:04:36.760> what<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:36.940> like<00:04:37.210> about<00:04:37.240> MBK<00:04:38.050> is

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
everybody but what I like about MBK is

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.530 
everybody but what I like about MBK is
responsible<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.700> we<00:04:39.910> get<00:04:40.090> our<00:04:40.180> message

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
responsible and we get our message

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.660 
responsible and we get our message
across<00:04:40.630> but<00:04:41.470> in<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.950> fashion<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.430> is

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
across but in a fashion that is

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.330 
across but in a fashion that is
acceptable<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.630> young<00:04:44.110> audiences<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:44.980> I

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
acceptable to young audiences and I

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.160 
acceptable to young audiences and I
think<00:04:45.640> there's<00:04:45.820> nothing<00:04:46.150> like<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:46.540> you<00:04:46.900> need

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
think there's nothing like it you need

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.170 
think there's nothing like it you need
to<00:04:47.320> watch<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:48.190> need<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.460> see<00:04:48.670> it<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:48.970> I

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
to watch it and you need to see it and I

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.350 
to watch it and you need to see it and I
just<00:04:49.390> think<00:04:49.630> that's<00:04:50.170> why<00:04:50.470> um<00:04:51.130> I<00:04:52.000> think<00:04:52.150> it's

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
just think that's why um I think it's

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.290 
just think that's why um I think it's
educational<00:04:53.130> it'll<00:04:54.130> give<00:04:54.250> people<00:04:54.670> something
