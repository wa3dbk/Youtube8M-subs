00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
but I had to go back home so got on the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.080 
but I had to go back home so got on the
plane<00:01:18.840> flew<00:01:19.560> back<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> problem<00:01:20.670> was<00:01:20.880> I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
plane flew back but the problem was I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.120 
plane flew back but the problem was I
really<00:01:21.450> hadn't<00:01:21.810> flown<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.650> often<00:01:22.860> up

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
really hadn't flown all that often up

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.649 
really hadn't flown all that often up
until<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.460> point<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> didn't<00:01:24.360> realize

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
until that point so I didn't realize

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.210 
until that point so I didn't realize

a waste of time and money it depends on
your<00:02:41.340> build<00:02:41.550> I'd<00:02:42.270> say<00:02:42.420> for<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.630> majority<00:02:42.959> of

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
your build I'd say for the majority of

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.559 
your build I'd say for the majority of
pcs<00:02:43.530> air<00:02:43.890> cooling<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.489> just<00:02:44.880> fine<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.390> all

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
pcs air cooling is just fine it's all

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.449 
pcs air cooling is just fine it's all
you<00:02:45.810> need<00:02:45.989> however<00:02:46.739> if<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.950> do<00:02:47.100> want<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.310> get<00:02:47.400> a

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
you need however if you do want to get a

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.710 
you need however if you do want to get a
little<00:02:47.640> bit<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.790> extra<00:02:47.970> performance<00:02:48.180> you

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
little bit of extra performance you

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.670 
little bit of extra performance you
don't<00:02:48.870> mind<00:02:49.020> spending<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.290> little<00:02:49.350> bit<00:02:49.470> more

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680

money<00:02:49.860> getting<00:02:50.790> something<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.090> a

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
money getting something like a

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.000 
money getting something like a
closed-loop<00:02:51.720> cooler<00:02:52.230> or<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.560> something<00:02:52.860> like

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
closed-loop cooler or so something like

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.240 
closed-loop cooler or so something like
a<00:02:53.130> courser<00:02:53.760> h<00:02:54.000> 110<00:02:54.690> or<00:02:55.200> even<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.769> full<00:02:55.980> water

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
a courser h 110 or even a full water

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.979 
a courser h 110 or even a full water
cooling<00:02:56.670> loop<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.239> absolutely<00:02:57.510> get<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.750> more

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
cooling loop can absolutely get you more

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.509 
cooling loop can absolutely get you more
performance<00:02:58.530> but<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.860> lot<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.130> times<00:02:59.340> it's

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
performance but a lot of the times it's

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.800 
performance but a lot of the times it's
really<00:02:59.610> not<00:02:59.820> going<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.030> be<00:03:00.180> worth<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.600> unless

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
really not going to be worth it unless

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.479 
really not going to be worth it unless
you<00:03:01.080> do<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.410> some<00:03:01.590> very<00:03:01.769> high<00:03:01.950> end<00:03:02.130> parts

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
you do have some very high end parts

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.310 
you do have some very high end parts
