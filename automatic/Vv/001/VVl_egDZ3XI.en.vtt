00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 how about friends of anses as you can see 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.029
 by the name of the video today I bring you 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.410
 a mapping so that they configure their 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.410
 keyboard with tractor 2 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.160
 is this program which is one of the 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.170
 better to use with driver but 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.860
 this time we will use it with 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.860
 our keyboard 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.420
 as you will see mine I have it configured 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.850
 with most micky ward keys 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.860
 here in the control manager option 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.050
 are all the configurations that 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.030
 we can do either with our keyboard 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.120
 or controller my mapping I have it 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.330
 using volume filter effects 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.199
 the fire games master volume filters and 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.000
 other little things more what we 're going to do 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.699
 is to download the rar file that 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.739
 I will leave in the description they will appear 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.540
 two files the configuration file 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.580
 mapping and an image where they can 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.379
 See the configuration in detail 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.379
 so that they adapt to the mapping 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.870
 here you can see the key combination 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.390
 and go testing 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.250
 this the file in which is the 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.150
 configuration that I did 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.150
 carrie you xvii 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.240
 now we are going to look for the folder 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.400
 where will we put our file if 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.740
 we open native instruments and in it 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.540
 they will have to have the tractor once there 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.470
 we open that folder and we will copy 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.470
 our configuration 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.300
 We went to copy our file in the 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.550
 default folder of the tractor here 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.800
 will ask us if we want to replace it 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.010
 we give that if you do not worry I'm going to 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.010
 try out 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.130
 As you can see, it continues to work 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.130
 perfection 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.950
 well I wait for service to my machine 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.050
 great a copy of the original file 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.990
 before putting my mapping just in case 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.270
 they do not like it 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.789
 well now to learn that maximum 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.970
 friends of mine to break that fucking pt 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.830
 x I will leave my personal facebook 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.050
 to ask if they do not understand 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.910
 Something remember, there is no question 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.910
 silly fool is the one who does not ask 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.030
 I hope my martyr has served you
