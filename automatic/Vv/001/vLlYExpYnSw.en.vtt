00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.640 

so<00:00:09.940> the<00:00:10.090> idea<00:00:10.180> behind<00:00:10.360> significant<00:00:11.110> birds<00:00:11.349> is

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
so the idea behind significant birds is

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.169 
so the idea behind significant birds is
that<00:00:12.070> it<00:00:12.190> explores<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:12.759> way<00:00:12.880> that<00:00:13.059> we

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:13.179 
that it explores the way that we

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.679 
that it explores the way that we
perceive<00:00:13.620> complex<00:00:14.620> sounds<00:00:15.190> and<00:00:15.910> particularly

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
perceive complex sounds and particularly

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.870 
perceive complex sounds and particularly
the<00:00:16.810> sound<00:00:17.050> of<00:00:17.200> the<00:00:17.290> voice<00:00:17.669> essentially<00:00:18.669> what

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
the sound of the voice essentially what

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.330 
the sound of the voice essentially what
our<00:00:19.060> ear<00:00:19.240> does<00:00:19.480> is<00:00:19.689> it<00:00:19.840> analyzes<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:21.130> voice

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
our ear does is it analyzes the voice

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.290 
our ear does is it analyzes the voice
down<00:00:21.670> into<00:00:22.000> very<00:00:22.180> pure<00:00:22.480> sine<00:00:23.439> wave<00:00:24.300> components

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
down into very pure sine wave components

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.660 
down into very pure sine wave components
which<00:00:25.480> is<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:26.019> mathematical<00:00:26.439> procedure<00:00:27.279> really

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
which is a mathematical procedure really

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.570 
which is a mathematical procedure really
and<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.900> brain<00:00:29.109> reconstructs<00:00:29.949> the<00:00:29.980> voice<00:00:30.250> so

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
and the brain reconstructs the voice so

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.490 
and the brain reconstructs the voice so
what<00:00:30.760> I've<00:00:30.880> done<00:00:30.910> is<00:00:31.150> I've<00:00:31.359> d<00:00:31.869> composed<00:00:32.290> a

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
what I've done is I've d composed a

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.160 
what I've done is I've d composed a
voice<00:00:32.650> into<00:00:33.070> these<00:00:33.269> components<00:00:34.269> each<00:00:34.870> of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
voice into these components each of

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.660 
voice into these components each of
which<00:00:35.290> is<00:00:35.350> playing<00:00:35.830> from<00:00:36.070> one<00:00:36.220> of<00:00:36.309> these<00:00:36.460> loud

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
which is playing from one of these loud

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.210 
which is playing from one of these loud
speakers<00:00:37.120> in<00:00:37.299> the<00:00:37.330> bird<00:00:37.570> cage<00:00:37.769> because<00:00:38.769> as<00:00:38.979> the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
speakers in the bird cage because as the

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.530 
speakers in the bird cage because as the
voice<00:00:39.309> changes<00:00:39.879> a<00:00:39.909> lot<00:00:40.120> while<00:00:40.390> you're

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
voice changes a lot while you're

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.500 
voice changes a lot while you're
speaking<00:00:40.659> that<00:00:41.140> way<00:00:41.979> sort<00:00:42.760> of<00:00:42.790> dance<00:00:43.030> around<00:00:43.330> a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
speaking that way sort of dance around a

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:54.329 
speaking that way sort of dance around a
bit<00:00:43.629> like<00:00:43.780> birdsong<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:54.070> of<00:00:54.159> the<00:00:54.250> interesting

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
bit like birdsong one of the interesting

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.280 
bit like birdsong one of the interesting
things<00:00:54.909> about<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.360> is<00:00:55.449> how<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.659> voice<00:00:55.900> has<00:00:56.110> no

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
things about it is how the voice has no

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.399 
things about it is how the voice has no
location<00:00:57.299> if<00:00:58.299> you<00:00:58.540> hear<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:58.839> voice<00:00:59.019> in<00:00:59.290> the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
location if you hear a voice in the

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.219 
location if you hear a voice in the
space<00:00:59.650> but<00:00:59.920> if<00:01:00.070> you<00:01:00.220> try<00:01:00.699> and<00:01:00.760> spot<00:01:01.629> where<00:01:01.989> it's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
space but if you try and spot where it's

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.539 
space but if you try and spot where it's
actually<00:01:02.379> coming<00:01:02.650> from<00:01:02.830> which<00:01:03.129> is<00:01:03.159> not<00:01:03.280> coming

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
actually coming from which is not coming

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:04.950 
actually coming from which is not coming
from<00:01:03.580> anywhere<00:01:03.970> in<00:01:04.089> particular<00:01:04.150> yeah<00:01:04.750> it

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
from anywhere in particular yeah it

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.359 
from anywhere in particular yeah it
obviously<00:01:05.080> is<00:01:05.470> an<00:01:05.590> illusion<00:01:05.979> because<00:01:06.220> there

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
obviously is an illusion because there

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.460 
obviously is an illusion because there
isn't<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.700> boyish<00:01:06.910> present<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.390> this<00:01:07.540> space<00:01:08.170> and

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
isn't a boyish present in this space and

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.290 
isn't a boyish present in this space and
you<00:01:08.560> hear<00:01:08.740> one<00:01:08.920> I<00:01:09.100> mean<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.610> could<00:01:09.820> argue<00:01:09.970> that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
you hear one I mean you could argue that

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.850 
you hear one I mean you could argue that
all<00:01:10.330> recording<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:11.050> an<00:01:11.170> illusion<00:01:11.590> in<00:01:11.680> that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
all recording is an illusion in that

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.980 
all recording is an illusion in that
sense<00:01:12.670> but<00:01:13.000> this<00:01:13.150> is<00:01:13.710> further<00:01:15.480> ado<00:01:16.480> zuri<00:01:16.780> in

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
sense but this is further ado zuri in

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.080 
sense but this is further ado zuri in
that<00:01:17.170> in<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.590> no<00:01:18.070> single<00:01:18.400> loudspeaker

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
that in that no single loudspeaker

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.640 
that in that no single loudspeaker
reduction<00:01:19.510> producing<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.050> sound<00:01:20.260> of<00:01:20.410> a<00:01:20.500> voice

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
reduction producing the sound of a voice

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.700 
reduction producing the sound of a voice
I<00:01:20.950> think<00:01:21.550> that<00:01:21.790> the<00:01:22.300> way<00:01:22.450> we<00:01:22.480> receive<00:01:23.200> art<00:01:23.500> and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
I think that the way we receive art and

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.660 
I think that the way we receive art and
perceive<00:01:24.190> art<00:01:24.510> has<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.540> lot<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:25.930> do<00:01:26.080> with<00:01:26.110> our

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
perceive art has a lot to do with our

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.880 
perceive art has a lot to do with our
input<00:01:27.670> as<00:01:27.910> receivers<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:28.890> our

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
input as receivers and our

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.030 
input as receivers and our
reconstruction<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:31.120> meaning<00:01:31.540> in<00:01:31.690> what<00:01:32.590> we

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
reconstruction of meaning in what we

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.980 
reconstruction of meaning in what we
perceive<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:34.090> think<00:01:34.390> we're<00:01:34.510> getting<00:01:34.659> quite

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
perceive I think we're getting quite

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.780 
perceive I think we're getting quite
used<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.409> idea<00:01:35.590> of<00:01:35.800> visual<00:01:36.190> illusions<00:01:36.640> I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
used to the idea of visual illusions I

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.090 
used to the idea of visual illusions I
think<00:01:36.970> all<00:01:37.120> illusions<00:01:37.720> are<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.409> newer<00:01:38.710> field

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
think all illusions are a newer field

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.399 
think all illusions are a newer field
for<00:01:39.520> most<00:01:39.700> people<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.180> I

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
for most people and I

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
for most people and I
think<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.649> idea<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.850> what<00:01:42.119> you're

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
think the idea that that what you're

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.749 
think the idea that that what you're
here<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.749> is<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.259> constructed<00:01:44.100> by<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.520> brain

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
here is is as constructed by your brain

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.020 
here is is as constructed by your brain
as<00:01:44.969> what<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:46.619> an<00:01:47.159> interesting<00:01:47.579> point

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
as what you see is an interesting point

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.280 
as what you see is an interesting point
to<00:01:48.240> take<00:01:48.420> away

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:04.780 

you

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.850 

you
