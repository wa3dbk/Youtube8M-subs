00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
recently just made a facebook fan page

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.339 
recently just made a facebook fan page
which<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:45.909> really<00:02:46.480> similar<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:47.139> twitter

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
which is really similar to twitter

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.020 
which is really similar to twitter
because<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:48.010> know<00:02:48.099> it's<00:02:48.250> like<00:02:48.400> updating<00:02:48.760> your

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
because you know it's like updating your

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.330 
because you know it's like updating your
fans<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.540> your<00:02:49.720> viewers<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.200> stuff<00:02:50.439> but<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.159> i

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
fans and your viewers and stuff but it i

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.770 
fans and your viewers and stuff but it i
think<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.669> a<00:02:51.790> little<00:02:51.879> bit<00:02:52.030> cooler<00:02:52.359> in<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.659> way

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
think it's a little bit cooler in a way

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.119 
think it's a little bit cooler in a way
because<00:02:52.989> even<00:02:53.500> though<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.650> can<00:02:53.889> share

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
because even though you can share

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.039 
because even though you can share
pictures<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.700> stuff<00:02:54.849> on<00:02:55.030> Twitter<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.900> know
