here<00:00:38.690> I've<00:00:39.690> got<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> fake<00:00:40.620> 29<00:00:42.530> battery<00:00:43.530> power<00:00:43.859> in

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.279 
them
and<00:00:45.240> so<00:00:46.240> far<00:00:46.480> it's<00:00:46.660> been<00:00:46.750> pretty<00:00:47.560> busy

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:59.889 

fine<00:00:51.289> up<00:00:53.140> speed<00:00:54.140> for<00:00:57.850> been<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.879> Creek<00:00:59.239> right<00:00:59.510> now

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
fine up speed for been a Creek right now

the<00:01:00.140> side

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
the side

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.560 
the side
and<00:01:01.370> there's<00:01:01.579> a<00:01:01.640> live<00:01:01.789> battery<00:01:02.179> be<00:01:02.329> sitting

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
and there's a live battery be sitting

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.179 
and there's a live battery be sitting
behind<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.079> rocks<00:01:03.379> here<00:01:03.679> so<00:01:04.009> we're<00:01:04.159> just

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
behind you the rocks here so we're just

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.280 
behind you the rocks here so we're just
gonna<00:01:04.489> we've<00:01:05.149> just<00:01:05.299> been<00:01:05.479> staying<00:01:05.630> in<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:06.049> tight

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
gonna we've just been staying in a tight

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.950 
gonna we've just been staying in a tight
circle<00:01:06.560> this<00:01:07.520> is<00:01:07.700> just<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:08.000> test<00:01:08.210> investment

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
circle this is just a test investment

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.080 
circle this is just a test investment
yeah<00:01:09.200> cuz<00:01:09.560> we're<00:01:09.740> not<00:01:09.770> trying<00:01:10.189> to<00:01:10.250> show<00:01:10.430> off<00:01:10.460> no

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
yeah cuz we're not trying to show off no

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.870 
yeah cuz we're not trying to show off no
the<00:01:12.020> fact<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.290> we<00:01:12.439> have<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.590> battery<00:01:12.979> no<00:01:13.640> this

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
the fact that we have a battery no this

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.719 
the fact that we have a battery no this
cooker<00:01:14.240> not<00:01:14.360> be<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:14.630> lot<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.049> fun<00:01:15.729> electrocution

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
cooker not be a lot of fun electrocution

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.820 
cooker not be a lot of fun electrocution
is<00:01:16.820> possible<00:01:17.270> especially<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.930> fifth<00:01:18.500> speed

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
is possible especially the fifth speed

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.529 
is possible especially the fifth speed
on<00:01:19.009> this<00:01:19.159> it<00:01:19.340> really<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.939> really<00:01:19.970> gives<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:20.450> a

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
on this it really it really gives you a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.870 
on this it really it really gives you a
joke<00:01:20.840> yeah<00:01:21.229> Oh<00:01:21.590> without<00:01:21.830> power<00:01:22.159> not<00:01:22.460> mattering

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
joke yeah Oh without power not mattering

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.710 
joke yeah Oh without power not mattering
like<00:01:23.240> there's<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:24.759> lot<00:01:25.759> more<00:01:25.970> thrust<00:01:26.330> at<00:01:26.600> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
like there's a lot more thrust at the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.620 
like there's a lot more thrust at the
ten<00:01:26.960> maximum<00:01:27.350> speed<00:01:27.649> than<00:01:27.920> it<00:01:28.149> from<00:01:29.149> going<00:01:29.479> oh

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
ten maximum speed than it from going oh

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.430 
ten maximum speed than it from going oh
yeah<00:01:29.929> you<00:01:29.990> do<00:01:30.259> not<00:01:30.380> expect<00:01:30.679> it<00:01:30.979> it's<00:01:31.729> terrible

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
yeah you do not expect it it's terrible

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.410 
yeah you do not expect it it's terrible
it's<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.619> speed<00:01:34.039> -<00:01:34.310> I'm<00:01:34.819> going<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.060> zoom<00:01:35.210> out

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
it's a speed - I'm going to zoom out

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.809 
it's a speed - I'm going to zoom out
give<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.049> a<00:01:36.110> perspective<00:01:36.549> currents<00:01:37.549> only

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
give you a perspective currents only

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:43.419 
give you a perspective currents only
going<00:01:38.179> at<00:01:38.330> like<00:01:40.000> yep<00:01:42.100> yeah<00:01:43.100> we're<00:01:43.280> going

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
going at like yep yeah we're going

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:51.310 
going at like yep yeah we're going
upstream<00:01:43.850> right<00:01:44.149> now

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:59.570 

the<00:01:51.890> third<00:01:52.430> speed<00:01:54.310> doubled<00:01:55.310> our<00:01:55.400> speed

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.190 

and<00:01:59.730> this<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.960> fourth<00:02:01.410> speed<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:03.200> don't

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and this is the fourth speed I don't

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.540 
and this is the fourth speed I don't
think<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.470> doubled<00:02:04.860> our<00:02:05.010> speed<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
think that doubled our speed that

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.710 
think that doubled our speed that
probably<00:02:06.320> up<00:02:07.320> maybe<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.620> third<00:02:11.360> yeah<00:02:12.390> that's

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
probably up maybe a third yeah that's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.320 
probably up maybe a third yeah that's
not<00:02:12.870> exaggerated<00:02:13.560> that's<00:02:13.800> that's<00:02:14.100> real<00:02:14.330> no

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
not exaggerated that's that's real no

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.650 
not exaggerated that's that's real no
exaggeration<00:02:16.020> that's<00:02:16.260> real<00:02:17.930> yeah<00:02:20.060> yep<00:02:21.060> going

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
exaggeration that's real yeah yep going

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.430 
exaggeration that's real yeah yep going
from<00:02:21.960> five<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.620> four<00:02:22.860> yeah<00:02:23.570> as<00:02:24.570> I'm<00:02:24.720> can't<00:02:25.260> see

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
from five to four yeah as I'm can't see

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.740 
from five to four yeah as I'm can't see
where<00:02:25.620> we're<00:02:25.740> going<00:02:25.770> right<00:02:26.100> now<00:02:26.310> I'm<00:02:26.750> trusting

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
where we're going right now I'm trusting

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
yeah we could die right behind him by

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.540 
yeah we could die right behind him by
