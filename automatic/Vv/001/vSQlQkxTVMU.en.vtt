is the load off is usually down here so

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.600 
is the load off is usually down here so
you've<00:01:04.080> got<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> find<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> load<00:01:04.920> off<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.159> load

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you've got to find the load off and load

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
I've changed my to a 5,000 but you might

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.640 
I've changed my to a 5,000 but you might
as<00:03:10.730> well<00:03:10.820> change<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.390> six<00:03:11.780> or<00:03:11.960> all<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.560> way

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
what that will do is as soon as we take

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.060 
what that will do is as soon as we take
your<00:03:20.209> foot<00:03:20.870> off<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.020> accelerator<00:03:21.200> keep

now<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.770> isn't<00:03:25.160> very<00:03:25.340> economical<00:03:26.090> but<00:03:26.530> it

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
now this isn't very economical but it

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.660 
now this isn't very economical but it
makes<00:03:29.300> one<00:03:29.720> hell<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.250> map<00:03:31.490> I

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
makes one hell of it this is a map I

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.760 
makes one hell of it this is a map I

there<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:46.990> yet<00:03:47.990> this<00:03:48.290> might<00:03:48.560> work<00:03:48.800> for<00:03:48.830> some

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
there and yet this might work for some

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.199 
there and yet this might work for some
of<00:03:49.370> yous<00:03:50.230> straight-line<00:03:51.230> might<00:03:51.530> work<00:03:51.740> for

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
of yous straight-line might work for

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.050 
of yous straight-line might work for
someone<00:03:53.209> else<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:54.100> trial<00:03:55.100> what<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.550> think<00:03:55.850> is

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
someone else so trial what you think is

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.780 
someone else so trial what you think is
best<00:03:56.290> also<00:03:57.290> want<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:57.740> put<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:57.950> word<00:03:58.370> of<00:03:58.490> caution

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
best also want to put a word of caution

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.480 
best also want to put a word of caution
out<00:03:59.120> there<00:03:59.360> this<00:03:59.540> could<00:03:59.840> damage<00:04:00.590> your<00:04:00.950> car<00:04:01.220> and
