00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.620
 swr1 rheinland-pfalz year runs great from Kaiserslautern 25 years old 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.940
 already has an extreme idea of ​​a summer vacation he is with the unicycle 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.719
 driven over the Alps 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.630
 200 km from rivers 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.039
 to Merano for a week over rocks 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.679
 m through mud 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.300
 and rivers all Reichhold Hello 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.640
 On the first day, 13 hours I am the method one 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.800
 Evening of the ProB 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.210
 It did not go down again every two hours again and again 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.869
 strict what is what should later continue 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.910
 that was not the main stock which one was the main event 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.360
 then most problems I had a good grades because you hold these 30 tons 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.370
 another heavy backpack then gentle on the driveway 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.820
 You can tell every hour and every kilo what you at Thränhardt and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.270
 Of course, the leg muscles are simply that who are high mountains 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.199
 under it fall from there one wheel 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.399
 Do a lot with the wine because we stop Chen we have two brakes 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.650
 We use rooms 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.830
 Not all the time saw a lot of wine and then a lot 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.559
 exhausting 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.480
 how do you prepare for such an effort 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.490
 I had been trying very physically to draw the full-blown man the algae 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.710
 driven by weekend around the holder an important customer group 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.100
 debts 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.590
 in Kaiserslautern even then the movie faster forest fall on the go as well 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.710
 three times four times Snowman Tønder 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.500
 to have comparably similar altitude meters 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.910
 You can properly train a string in the high alpine area and 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.410
 because you have to hope that you are fit enough when you're there and that it works 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.040
 ten thousand meters in altitude have covered how much more exhausting 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.950
 All this now, for example, on a normal bike to drive 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.270
 yes we do not have a circuit they have to constantly compensate 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.420
 that's a lot more exhausting so you always have to concentrate 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.960
 be that it alone also from the head were very exhausting 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.220
 13 hours of concentration to maintain that then no falls 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.440
 has just because you digress in your mind country is not full anymore 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.450
 Concentrated they had crashed 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.369
 Years Rheiner found already belongs to that one more frequently that descent 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.490
 Cycle 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.360
 but altogether Ziggler did not land on his feet honestly when 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.310
 whole tour 3 sunny but even surprised «I've been there with you 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.770
 But worse, they did not hurt each other. No, I am 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.750
 hewed a quick stone but today I have to assign a helmet 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.459
 where nothing happens then 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.319
 few scratches already had but nothing serious Lothar I wood out 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.290
 Kaiserslautern with the unicycle through the Alps continue to discuss mine 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.679
 three on the way 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:22.809
 there one drives oneself also already times 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.969
 but sometimes they are just before the care of the elderly 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:30.789
 Otherwise, Monday afternoon with a club 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.239
 summer vacationers 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.329
 Lothar I know from Kaiserslautern 25 years old has with the one wheel 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.360
 he has already told us that he is crossing the Alps 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.639
 not tested the wound point was but the back 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.479
 that there were some crashes but nothing bad 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:50.349
 they made a trip to the tour sense a retracted team they know each other 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.089
 For ten years, one sports only then one may at some point 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:58.179
 both so most of the time are very spurred on who does not get through the man 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.199
 that alone had stood through times one of three people is always 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.930
 motivated and the Sultan for not motivating 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.019
 carry on and do not stop 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.299
 but there are of course also show Mittal if you ask to proceed 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.889
 with China Money is no longer perfect and you also Marten sour 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.709
 However, when the ManU briefly moments on each other is agreed 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.099
 and at the latest on the square one arrives then everything is so again brought 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.060
 yesterday in the car the other one has always been 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.569
 Picture the prelude 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.659
 They also drove over passes, for example the theme 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.269
 those in South Tyrol also mean the most deadly stage for them 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:32.409
 «The deadliest Christmas 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.669
 Martinez still over the ice for step to Szczecin Hüther 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:41.259
 then 2500 meters of altitude were covered and 30 hours were on the way again 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:45.299
 have a lot of bad luck with the weather the first hour as the last rained 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.719
 It has snowed for hours 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.200
 We often walked along cliffs for an hour at one 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.469
 A thousand feet high cliff of Anhalt must not fall on the 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.819
 Case not to the left side in the case then 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.449
 and that was so consciously aware now also has changes that she still has 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.330
 a few meters up or down 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.889
 I would not have made it any further 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.039
 how short were they to throw a bike in the Alps? 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.209
 very short sometimes could have been soon thought 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.319
 why not meats over on a beautiful island on vacation and simply 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.620
 Henry Fonda from the outside the Maldives belong to the conspecific ones in the end than me 

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:22.830
 but always fun that was only moment and collar when you arrive 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.290
 and back to the deed an emperor is such a bliss that is 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.340
 all the hardships of the traffic offenders 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.370
 that was not her first extreme tour now what about 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.370
 Insite else everything so records show 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.370
 I hold a guinness record percent more bottles drive 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.580
 I have the wheel with the unicycle one meter all at the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.659
 Unity celebration now he tells 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.249
 With the highest jump landed in mid-May a faster so if the macho 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.669
 Coen of the desert from a cliff down into a bevel 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.219
 that were 500 meters Jana Nanni spilled competitions they feel 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:57.580
 actually still on two legs 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.979
 around sometimes it's very funny no here everything is no problem i was still running 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.639
 He does not like cycling too 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.310
 Kleinert Fall is just a part of being the main part of sports life but good 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.400
 also no green middle wheel drive or maize unis to run 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.350
 they hardly ever study environmental planning 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.020
 Do they even have iPad for that? 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.539
 Of course I still take the time to pass the weather 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.610
 I have to study after twelve hours a day 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.210
 Contrast program to have 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.100
 and totally soft yet study cover yet his professors have it 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.870
 actually until now no problem had to agree study and sport 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.290
 runs a shy from Kaiserslautern 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.750
 He rode over the Alps on a unicycle and told us something like that 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.250
 was 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.670
 Thank you very much 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.520
 and wish you a lot of crazy ideas I'm curious where you 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.680

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.860
