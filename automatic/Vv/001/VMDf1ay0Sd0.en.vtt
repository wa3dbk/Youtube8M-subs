00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 service people here is one of body 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.670
 pump and today it's about the topic 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.420
 I have to build on how do I take off 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.219
 I can do both at the same time and 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.820
 always a lot of interest in advance of need 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.810
 know once 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.420
 you just had to build properly 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.910
 if you eat more calories than 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.490
 he certainly uses it often 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.470
 heard and it is just like that 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 if you now less if now one 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.850
 have a total turnover of 3000 calories 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.140
 Companies only hold 2500 calories 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.579
 you then can not be effective 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.280
 build muscle because the body needs 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.489
 then you take it off a defined one 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.820
 although it decreases it does not build muscle 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.160
 right on if you wanted to lose weight there 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.860
 So if you have 3000 calories 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.329
 have basic turnover and yes it is only 2000 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.000
 calories 2500 you lose if you 3200 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.100
 calorie increases increases so if he 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.520
 no training on the stomach if you 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.600
 Training makes you think so 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.119
 really that you yours 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.470
 basic sales determined there are many 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.890
 For this I can do something extra 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.229
 make video and stick to it 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.750
 I do not think important at all 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.450
 whether you like low carb low fat palais or 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.229
 otherwise fed as it is only about 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.960
 the calories 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.280
 you can I locally tracks when her 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 a lot of calories are increasing 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.500
 then he takes it when you do it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.659
 A lot of calories you will take it 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.970
 is definitely so natural it comes 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.189
 then to a second stage then what I 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 me for my body important when I'm there 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.530
 not want to eat fat but also 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.700
 a lot of whole grains and and and then 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.979
 If you go to the next step then look 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.659
 one of the calories you need though 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.700
 my goal 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.259
 What should I really want 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.119
 how much to take micronutrients 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.090
 fat how much protein like many 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.860
 carbohydrates but I believe in her 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.850
 that now only by praise but that 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.159
 plug in what decreases 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.579
 although he does not take back more 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.000
 needs and i say so if you 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.080
 wanted to build muscle that you guys 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.950
 everything is calculated that he is good 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.230
 and look that he takes back enough 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.690
 losing weight does exactly the other thing 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.610
 direction but keep your fingers away 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.440
 that exaggerated would have made 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.430
 just completely normal very easy peasy 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.150
 just make a healthy diet 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.220
 potatoes wholegrain lentils 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.500
 quinoa couscous rice all the stuff 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.959
 Last drop omits oil from the salad 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.049
 tastes just as moderate and 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.590
 a little bit sugar a bit 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:44.530
 even a bit of salt pepper and and and 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.489
 the schades total is easy because I have 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.040
 my science do it all 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.470
 but just like me 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.750
 said and you are fast 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.099
 Successes are really fast here 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.720
 will see after a month already that 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.970
 Take your husband for example now 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.799
 wanted that defined her in any case 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.340
 the abdominal muscles will see more than 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.010
 before 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.799
 and you do not have to go big deficit 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.739
 if you are 3000 now 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.280
 Kilokalorien on the need would have 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.549
 I'll see it 27 28 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.600
 between 26 and 28 because then you can 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.450
 After training the right performance 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.420
 bring slowly but loses 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.739
 continuously on weight and builds 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.639
 still a bit, of course 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:31.239
 muscles on as a discussion but does 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:33.160
 no science on it this scene at 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.459
 cuts me is how the needs sau da 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.290
 I stop the video with the camera 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.660
 not waterproof is good 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.239
 Write me the comments who this 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.220
