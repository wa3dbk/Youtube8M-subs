00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and you get one of them like a plane

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.330 
and you get one of them like a plane
coming<00:00:44.969> over<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> map<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.129> like

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
coming over so it's like a map just like

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.700 
coming over so it's like a map just like
launch<00:00:47.610> which<00:00:48.270> make<00:00:49.170> different<00:00:49.530> things

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
launch which make different things

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.180 
launch which make different things
happened<00:00:50.070> during<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> game<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:52.590> as<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.100> can

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
happened during the game so as you can

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.939 
happened during the game so as you can
see<00:00:53.460> there's<00:00:54.059> things<00:00:54.360> appeal<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:55.020> windows

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
see there's things appeal I out windows

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
see there's things appeal I out windows
everywhere<00:00:56.600> everywhere<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.690> look<00:00:57.840> there's

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
everywhere everywhere you look there's

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.290 
everywhere everywhere you look there's
windows<00:00:58.320> high<00:00:58.530> ground<00:00:59.090> people<00:01:00.090> come<00:01:00.270> from

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
windows high ground people come from

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
windows high ground people come from
down<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.530> fly<00:01:01.770> cursor<00:01:02.010> done

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
down there so this is a fly cursor done

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.950 
down there so this is a fly cursor done
and<00:01:02.399> domination<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> CR

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and domination and I think this is CR

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.660 
and domination and I think this is CR
air<00:01:04.199> can't<00:01:04.500> remember<00:01:04.769> there's<00:01:05.220> where<00:01:05.460> one

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
air can't remember there's where one

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.380 
air can't remember there's where one
flag<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:07.650> come<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390

flag it's just that you come up here and
some<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.630> would<00:01:10.170> probably<00:01:10.500> want<00:01:10.530> know

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
some of you would probably want know

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.320 
some of you would probably want know
this<00:01:11.450> but<00:01:12.450> yeah<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.320> go<00:01:13.500> by<00:01:13.860> out<00:01:13.979> lap<00:01:14.330> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
this but yeah it can go by out lap and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.399 
this but yeah it can go by out lap and
go<00:01:15.540> all<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> way<00:01:15.720> about<00:01:15.900> don't<00:01:16.140> where<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
good shortcut to the flag which is that

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.840 
good shortcut to the flag which is that
you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:22.220> is<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.460> see<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> lot

yeah it's basically I don't really know
what<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.570> only<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.350> see

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
what it's only think it's just on see

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.429 
what it's only think it's just on see
I'm<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.159> quite<00:01:41.340> sure<00:01:41.369> oh<00:01:41.990> no<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
I'm not quite sure oh no it's just a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.889 
I'm not quite sure oh no it's just a
very<00:01:43.950> rarely<00:01:44.220> map<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.729> show<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.479> China

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
very rarely map on show it's like China

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.870 
very rarely map on show it's like China
towers<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.619> don't<00:01:47.159> means<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.430> know<00:01:47.579> he<00:01:47.700> can

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
towers but don't means you know he can

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.420
