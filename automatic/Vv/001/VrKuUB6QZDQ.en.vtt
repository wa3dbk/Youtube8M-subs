00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.109
 "My poor cost comes 44 years old and a new photo accessory 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.109
 force 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.740
 yes, I'm responsible 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.859
 good and 350 vehicles police Hamburg 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.579
 my parents have said that they have been with the winds for hours 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.630
 Cars back the world for residues on the carpet 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.970
 and 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.489
 I feel like I'm knocking gasoline in my blood and if it's the right word for it 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.050
 I once did an internship in a carpentry shop 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.070
 one and a half weeks 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.880
 Wood is not my medium but cars are the same and pretty much coupled 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.240
 my world had been like it was today 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.440
 thereby also still got 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.380
 Police mountain vehicles have seen action in september pulling the walls 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.760
 From each they are always conspicuous to the police one looks 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.900
 and that is well before we realize it and therefore we also value it in life 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.270
 the value of what vehicles buy more 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.640
 Press representatives are still the city on the Lech 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.190
 the vehicles are conspicuous everywhere 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.470
 on the other hand is a point where we also look at the exterior vehicles 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.470
 We also pay attention in longer operation 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.690
 Norderstedt EM economics in the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.670
 Economic efficiency is also very important to us in the background 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.740
 very big topic of this mix job economy to suns 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.060
 also be in proportion 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.400
 consumer 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.580
 Squaring friendliness downtime the cell phone great criteria the more 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.840
 Profitability behind it 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.450
 after the taste of the bottom 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.240
 Degener accompanies 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.740
 and now 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.170
 I have every morning 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.470
 that's proud 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.450
 to be responsible of very very large occurrences of Veit 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.710
 with over a thousand vehicles 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.640
 Another point of not daily motivating people around me 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.950
 around 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.100
 Each of his own characters but the most important is 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.660
 the goal of this faux-pas 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.819
 the great 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.739
 positive to taxes 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.309
 be agile in the city center 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.459
 and 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.089
 there saw police patrol cars 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:22.779
 especially here, the bull is usually several vehicles to say yes for 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.769
 very responsible for these protests I have my professional dove 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.579
 as they look into the vehicles 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.609
 But if they then as a means of transport through the city so go with 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:33.949
 blue light 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.369
 and siren sda Cook then exactly and then see 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.629
 in places 9 vehicle 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:41.340
 have to say
