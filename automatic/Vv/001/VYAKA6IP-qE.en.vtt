lot and if you were wondering if you
ever<00:06:51.409> were<00:06:51.979> wondering<00:06:52.459> how<00:06:52.669> we<00:06:52.729> did<00:06:53.269> these<00:06:53.419> I

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:53.479 
ever were wondering how we did these I

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.259 
ever were wondering how we did these I
don't<00:06:53.719> think<00:06:53.989> we<00:06:54.139> ever<00:06:54.259> went<00:06:54.469> over<00:06:54.859> it<00:06:55.269> but

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:56.269 
don't think we ever went over it but

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:59.289 
don't think we ever went over it but
this<00:06:56.449> was<00:06:56.629> actually<00:06:56.809> a<00:06:57.489> Blackie<00:06:58.489> Chan<00:06:58.669> design

00:06:59.289 --> 00:06:59.299 
this was actually a Blackie Chan design

00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:03.279 
this was actually a Blackie Chan design
idea<00:06:59.719> so<00:07:00.939> it's<00:07:01.939> really<00:07:02.119> simple<00:07:02.479> I'm<00:07:03.019> not<00:07:03.199> gonna

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289 
idea so it's really simple I'm not gonna

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.869 
idea so it's really simple I'm not gonna
do<00:07:03.559> it<00:07:03.679> cuz<00:07:03.799> I<00:07:03.829> don't<00:07:04.009> have<00:07:04.099> the<00:07:04.249> supplies<00:07:04.519> with

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 
do it cuz I don't have the supplies with

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.579 
do it cuz I don't have the supplies with
me<00:07:05.059> and<00:07:05.269> it'd<00:07:05.419> be<00:07:05.449> quicker<00:07:05.809> to<00:07:05.929> just<00:07:06.109> explain

00:07:06.579 --> 00:07:06.589 
me and it'd be quicker to just explain

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.279 
me and it'd be quicker to just explain
it<00:07:06.769> but<00:07:07.309> you<00:07:07.849> basically<00:07:08.239> take<00:07:08.509> a<00:07:08.569> torch<00:07:08.869> put<00:07:09.169> it

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:09.289 
it but you basically take a torch put it

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.939 
it but you basically take a torch put it
on<00:07:09.439> the<00:07:09.589> wall<00:07:09.799> and<00:07:10.099> then<00:07:10.489> place<00:07:10.939> a<00:07:11.359> an<00:07:12.349> item

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:12.949 
on the wall and then place a an item

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.039 
on the wall and then place a an item
frame<00:07:13.189> on<00:07:13.459> the<00:07:13.579> wall<00:07:13.609> behind<00:07:13.939> it<00:07:14.359> and<00:07:14.599> then

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:15.049 
frame on the wall behind it and then

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:19.649 
frame on the wall behind it and then
this<00:07:15.259> was<00:07:15.679> I<00:07:16.399> believe<00:07:16.729> a<00:07:17.209> white<00:07:18.169> carpet<00:07:18.559> piece

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:19.659 
this was I believe a white carpet piece

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:22.119 
this was I believe a white carpet piece
so<00:07:20.659> he<00:07:20.869> went<00:07:21.019> ahead<00:07:21.109> and<00:07:21.379> placed<00:07:21.589> that<00:07:21.799> in<00:07:22.039> the

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:22.129 
so he went ahead and placed that in the

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:28.119 
so he went ahead and placed that in the
item<00:07:22.399> frame<00:07:23.469> click<00:07:24.469> the<00:07:24.819> left<00:07:26.259> trigger<00:07:27.259> a<00:07:27.709> few

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:28.129 
item frame click the left trigger a few

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:30.519 
item frame click the left trigger a few
times<00:07:28.369> to<00:07:29.029> make<00:07:29.389> it<00:07:29.539> go<00:07:29.749> to<00:07:29.809> the<00:07:29.989> top<00:07:30.199> and<00:07:30.439> it

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:30.529 
times to make it go to the top and it

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.199 
times to make it go to the top and it
basically<00:07:30.679> looks<00:07:31.219> like<00:07:31.309> a<00:07:31.429> little<00:07:31.729> sconce
