the<00:00:18.930> old<00:00:19.080> system<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:19.680> much<00:00:20.070> better<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:21.090> could

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the old system was much better you could

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.810 
the old system was much better you could
read<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.720> videos<00:00:22.199> 5<00:00:22.500> stars<00:00:22.830> now<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.550> just

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
read the videos 5 stars now you can just

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.380 
read the videos 5 stars now you can just
like<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> videos<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:26.430> isn't<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
like like the videos which isn't the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.209 
like like the videos which isn't the
same<00:00:27.630> i<00:00:28.140> think<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.710> sucks<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:30.380> new<00:00:31.380> layout<00:00:31.890> i

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
same i think it sucks and new layout i

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.580 
same i think it sucks and new layout i
think<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> old<00:00:32.850> one<00:00:33.239> was<00:00:33.660> much<00:00:33.870> more<00:00:34.050> simple

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
think the old one was much more simple

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.080 
think the old one was much more simple
and<00:00:34.800> much<00:00:35.160> better<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.790> better<00:00:36.540> looking<00:00:36.809> also

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
and much better and better looking also

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
and much better and better looking also
