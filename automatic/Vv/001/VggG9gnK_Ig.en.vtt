kind<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.639> skills<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.089> was<00:00:15.179> learning<00:00:15.389> back<00:00:15.780> as<00:00:15.960> a

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
kind of skills I was learning back as a

back<00:00:16.619> as<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.800> teenager<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.810> made<00:00:18.810> choices<00:00:19.800> at<00:00:20.100> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
back as a teenager I made choices at a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.150 
back as a teenager I made choices at a
level<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:21.170> different<00:00:22.170> subjects<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.070> I'm

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
level for different subjects so I'm

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.279 
level for different subjects so I'm
having<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.730> go<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:23.970> slightly<00:00:24.630> inside<00:00:24.960> rooms

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
having to go in slightly inside rooms

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.990 
having to go in slightly inside rooms
I've<00:00:25.529> got<00:00:25.680> support<00:00:26.010> from<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> academic<00:00:26.760> staff

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000

to<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> exodus<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.149> what

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
to to the exodus so they can see what

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.850 
to to the exodus so they can see what
it's<00:00:39.420> all<00:00:39.510> about<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.350> not<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.739> my

skills and that starts right at the very
performative<00:00:56.610> ages<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:58.020> me<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> started<00:00:58.590> off<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
performative ages for me I started off a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.410 
performative ages for me I started off a
go-kart<00:00:59.129> racing<00:00:59.309> when<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.760> teenager<00:01:00.120> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
go-kart racing when I was a teenager so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.170 
go-kart racing when I was a teenager so
be<00:01:00.930> able<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.289> take<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.609> engineering<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
be able to take on the engineering and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.030 
be able to take on the engineering and
the<00:01:03.239> Masters<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.690> my<00:01:03.780> physics<00:01:04.110> at<00:01:04.229> school<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the Masters in my physics at school and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.429 
the Masters in my physics at school and
actually<00:01:05.369> develop<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.820> into<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.659> vocational

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
actually develop that into a vocational

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.560 
actually develop that into a vocational
subject<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.010> why<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> chose<00:01:08.369> engineering

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
subject that's why I chose engineering

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.940 
subject that's why I chose engineering
the<00:01:09.570> former<00:01:10.080> student<00:01:10.409> competition<00:01:10.830> was

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the former student competition was

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.410 
the former student competition was
actually<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.520> big<00:01:11.729> influence<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.270> me

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
actually a really big influence for me

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.899 
actually a really big influence for me

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and I was looking to do engineering

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.179 
and I was looking to do engineering
anywhere<00:01:15.600> cuz<00:01:15.810> I'd<00:01:15.930> studied<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.680> GCSE

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
anywhere cuz I'd studied it at GCSE

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.330 
anywhere cuz I'd studied it at GCSE
level<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.990> was<00:01:19.229> originally<00:01:19.530> interested<00:01:19.890> in

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
level and I was originally interested in

level and I was originally interested in
the<00:01:20.430> automotive

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
the automotive

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.319 
the automotive
course<00:01:22.899> I<00:01:23.170> since<00:01:23.439> changed<00:01:23.920> my<00:01:24.070> degree<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.299> a

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
course I since changed my degree to a

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.419 
course I since changed my degree to a
mechanical<00:01:26.259> engineering<00:01:26.679> degree<00:01:26.799> to<00:01:27.219> give<00:01:27.340> me

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
mechanical engineering degree to give me

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.760 
mechanical engineering degree to give me
a<00:01:27.460> bit<00:01:27.640> more<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:28.000> a<00:01:28.119> broad<00:01:28.359> understanding<00:01:28.770> of

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
a bit more of a broad understanding of

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.950 
a bit more of a broad understanding of
engineering<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:30.909> didn't<00:01:31.360> understand

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
engineering and I didn't understand

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.600 
engineering and I didn't understand
exactly<00:01:32.079> where<00:01:32.439> I<00:01:32.500> wanted<00:01:32.829> to<00:01:32.950> work<00:01:33.130> five

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
exactly where I wanted to work five

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.840 
exactly where I wanted to work five
years<00:01:33.880> ago<00:01:34.149> so<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:35.619> definitely<00:01:36.069> dollar<00:01:36.549> gret

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
years ago so I'm definitely dollar gret

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.429 
years ago so I'm definitely dollar gret
changing<00:01:37.450> because<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.750> M<00:01:37.840> inch<00:01:38.020> course<00:01:38.289> has

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
changing because the M inch course has

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.590 
changing because the M inch course has
been<00:01:38.590> fantastic<00:01:38.799> in<00:01:39.280> Samael<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.390> for<00:01:42.600> more

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
been fantastic in Samael and for more

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.569 
been fantastic in Samael and for more
basically<00:01:43.840> it's<00:01:44.259> great<00:01:44.409> for<00:01:44.500> you<00:01:44.590> save<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.920> and
