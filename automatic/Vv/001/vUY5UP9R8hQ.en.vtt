00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
because you can't share it so it's only

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.630

how well he can possible that ball might

as soon as you add in the context of the

180 degree pass it becomes increasingly

180 degree pass it becomes increasingly
difficult<00:03:05.810> for<00:03:06.410> even<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.739> good<00:03:07.040> passer<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:08.030> pass

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
difficult for even a good passer to pass

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.930 
difficult for even a good passer to pass
the<00:03:08.390> ball<00:03:08.569> so<00:03:08.900> you'll<00:03:09.620> be<00:03:09.799> unable<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.549> do<00:03:10.700> those

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
the ball so you'll be unable to do those

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.960 
the ball so you'll be unable to do those
rapid<00:03:11.540> kind<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.019> 180<00:03:12.380> passes<00:03:12.980> now<00:03:13.190> without<00:03:13.910> the

ball going awry as I mentioned there's a

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.460 
ball going awry as I mentioned there's a

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
lot about button pressing this year as

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.440 
lot about button pressing this year as
well<00:03:18.590> what<00:03:18.799> we're<00:03:18.920> calling<00:03:19.070> user<00:03:19.430> skill<00:03:19.910> you

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
well what we're calling user skill you

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.280 
well what we're calling user skill you
need<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.720> be<00:03:20.870> able<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.739> time<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.700> amount<00:03:23.000> of

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
need to be able to time the amount of

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.259 
need to be able to time the amount of

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
sort of push on your pass to be able to

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.120 
sort of push on your pass to be able to
get<00:03:26.390> at<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.570> right<00:03:26.720> distance<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:27.829> think

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
get at the right distance and I think

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.440 
get at the right distance and I think
there's<00:03:28.280> some<00:03:28.370> good<00:03:28.400> videos<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.209> from

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
there's some good videos of that from

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.300 
there's some good videos of that from
our<00:03:29.540> testbed<00:03:29.900> actually<00:03:30.350> online<00:03:30.650> showing<00:03:31.010> that

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
our testbed actually online showing that

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.880 
our testbed actually online showing that
the<00:03:31.970> idea<00:03:32.090> really<00:03:32.510> is<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.810> make<00:03:33.109> sure<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.620> you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
the idea really is to make sure that you

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.949 
the idea really is to make sure that you
know<00:03:34.010> good<00:03:34.519> passes<00:03:35.030> can<00:03:35.209> pass<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.570> ball<00:03:35.750> well

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
know good passes can pass the ball well

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.229 
know good passes can pass the ball well
as<00:03:36.200> long<00:03:36.709> as<00:03:36.829> they've<00:03:36.980> got<00:03:37.010> time<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.670> pass<00:03:37.910> and

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
as long as they've got time to pass and

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.000 
as long as they've got time to pass and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
pass but that will deteriorate based on

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.740 
pass but that will deteriorate based on
abilities<00:03:43.340> as<00:03:43.700> well<00:03:44.000> as<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.299> know<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.600> amount

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
getting asked a lot about is the chip

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.520 
getting asked a lot about is the chip
shots<00:03:51.109> so<00:03:51.670> in<00:03:52.670> fifa<00:03:53.239> 10<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.630> was<00:03:53.780> relatively

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
shots so in fifa 10 it was relatively

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.890 
shots so in fifa 10 it was relatively
easy<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.160> in<00:03:55.760> one-on-ones<00:03:56.299> with<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.569> keeper

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
easy to in one-on-ones with the keeper

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
so I think you've already answered a

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.610 
so I think you've already answered a
question<00:04:04.970> about<00:04:05.120> custom<00:04:06.049> audio<00:04:06.319> that<00:04:06.530> was

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
question about custom audio that was

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.680 
question about custom audio that was
something<00:04:06.799> people<00:04:07.190> were<00:04:07.400> asking<00:04:07.790> for<00:04:08.000> as<00:04:08.209> well

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
something people were asking for as well

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.979 
something people were asking for as well
as<00:04:08.870> FIFA<00:04:09.410> Fiesta<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.069> ability<00:04:10.489> to<00:04:10.989> save

as FIFA Fiesta the ability to save

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.199 
as FIFA Fiesta the ability to save
replays<00:04:12.889> locally<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:13.549> there's<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.819> couple<00:04:13.970> of

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
replays locally so there's a couple of

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.180 
replays locally so there's a couple of
things<00:04:14.420> that<00:04:14.720> we've<00:04:15.170> already<00:04:15.319> done<00:04:15.650> but

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
things that we've already done but

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.800 
things that we've already done but
chipping<00:04:16.909> the<00:04:17.000> keeper<00:04:17.299> was<00:04:17.419> something<00:04:17.720> we

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
chipping the keeper was something we

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.659 
chipping the keeper was something we

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
heard a lot about so this year what

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:20.580 
heard a lot about so this year what
we're<00:04:19.820> doing<00:04:20.030> is

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
we're doing is

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.370 
we're doing is
chipping<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.639> a<00:04:21.940> hard<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.419> shot<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.810> take<00:04:23.020> so

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
chipping is a hard a shot to take so

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.780 
chipping is a hard a shot to take so
we're<00:04:23.530> making<00:04:23.860> sure<00:04:23.889> that<00:04:24.280> when<00:04:24.430> you're<00:04:24.520> under

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
we're making sure that when you're under

player comes to the fore and you need to

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.890 
player comes to the fore and you need to
make<00:04:30.400> sure<00:04:30.580> you're<00:04:30.760> concentrating<00:04:31.150> or<00:04:31.750> your

player on the pitch is concentrating

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.010 
player on the pitch is concentrating
your<00:04:33.370> you're<00:04:34.120> being<00:04:34.330> careful<00:04:34.479> about<00:04:34.810> what

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
your you're being careful about what

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.110 
your you're being careful about what
chances<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:35.680> take<00:04:35.710> as<00:04:36.490> well<00:04:36.699> as<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.910> keeper

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
chances you take as well as the keeper

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.560 
chances you take as well as the keeper
as<00:04:37.300> well<00:04:37.479> it's<00:04:37.630> got<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.780> much<00:04:37.990> better<00:04:38.199> sense<00:04:38.800> of

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
as well it's got a much better sense of

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.330 
as well it's got a much better sense of
being<00:04:40.570> able<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.900> read<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.169> trajectory<00:04:42.160> of<00:04:42.250> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
being able to read the trajectory of the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.210 
being able to read the trajectory of the
ball<00:04:42.610> so<00:04:43.030> he<00:04:43.900> will<00:04:44.050> expect<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.650> if<00:04:44.830> he's<00:04:45.010> in<00:04:45.130> a

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
ball so he will expect it if he's in a

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.740 
ball so he will expect it if he's in a
position<00:04:45.370> like<00:04:45.669> that<00:04:45.820> as<00:04:46.120> well<00:04:46.150> as<00:04:46.360> being<00:04:46.510> able

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
position like that as well as being able

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.020 
position like that as well as being able
to<00:04:46.840> get<00:04:46.960> back<00:04:47.169> so<00:04:47.500> we're<00:04:48.340> pretty<00:04:48.520> confident

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
to get back so we're pretty confident

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.850 
to get back so we're pretty confident
we've<00:04:49.270> addressed<00:04:49.840> most<00:04:50.229> of<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.500> instances

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
we've addressed most of the instances

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.950 
we've addressed most of the instances
where<00:04:51.220> those<00:04:52.120> kind<00:04:52.389> of<00:04:52.419> things<00:04:52.570> can<00:04:52.690> happen

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
where those kind of things can happen

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.280 
where those kind of things can happen
but<00:04:53.950> we<00:04:54.070> will<00:04:54.250> be<00:04:54.400> watching<00:04:54.550> we<00:04:55.150> also<00:04:55.300> have<00:04:55.479> a

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
but we will be watching we also have a

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.260 
but we will be watching we also have a
system<00:04:56.950> in<00:04:57.070> place<00:04:57.100> this<00:04:57.490> year<00:04:57.550> which<00:04:57.910> should

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
system in place this year which should

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.440 
system in place this year which should
allow<00:04:58.810> us<00:04:59.169> to<00:04:59.290> update<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.919> gameplay<00:05:00.400> from<00:05:00.460> our

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
allow us to update the gameplay from our

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.590 
allow us to update the gameplay from our
studio<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.350> if<00:05:02.620> there<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.310> an<00:05:03.910> exploit<00:05:04.479> or

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
studio so if there is an exploit or

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.090 
studio so if there is an exploit or
something<00:05:04.960> like<00:05:05.050> that<00:05:05.110> happening<00:05:05.650> we<00:05:05.860> hope

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
something like that happening we hope

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.909 
something like that happening we hope
that<00:05:07.000> we'll<00:05:07.180> be<00:05:07.210> able<00:05:07.330> to<00:05:07.870> make<00:05:08.350> sure<00:05:08.620> it<00:05:08.770> can

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
that we'll be able to make sure it can

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.500 
that we'll be able to make sure it can
be<00:05:09.040> addressed<00:05:09.280> remotely<00:05:09.910> which<00:05:10.060> I<00:05:10.210> think<00:05:10.419> will

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
be addressed remotely which I think will

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.029 
be addressed remotely which I think will
be<00:05:10.660> a<00:05:10.870> great<00:05:11.200> news<00:05:11.440> for<00:05:11.590> everyone<00:05:11.830> that's
