00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.770

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.260
 aloha me again one of his 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.000
 has mentioned videos and thus again 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.190
 triggered a huge subscriber wave 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.710
 you have a subscriber wave there 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.900
 seems okay thanks also for yours 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.740
 lovely greetings 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.300
 if you still do not know her 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.609
 we should take a look then 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.140
 in the video description, and if they 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.289
 Subscribed then greets are in any case 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.790
 nice back in front of me okay i could 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.140
 still greet if you do not subscribe 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.649
 or if you already know so greet 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.649
 just everybody 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.250
 I would like to know how you interact with people 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.530
 bypasses the experience that you live vegan 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.840
 and then on the stupid arguments 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.719
 put like vegetarian eat my food 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.820
 the food away or something you discuss 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.079
 there seriously with or how are you going 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.359
 generally with people in this 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.550
 discussion about how we do it with the following 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.710
 Maybe it's my planet 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.290
 the rainforest away or then you put 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.900
 I eat in my garden or I like 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.090
 no hay that always stops something like that 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.439
 I actually have arguments 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.619
 pretty soon the experience was made 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.119
 that people want to say something like that 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.560
 not really serious about it 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.869
 discuss and did not want to 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.290
 what to say first what to say 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.810
 Has 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.479
 that should be funny and that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.780
 It was the way she said it 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.610
 I heard the first hundred times 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.950
 honestly i can talk about every vegetarian 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.320
 will laugh just like everyone else 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.970
 other funny jokes or saying lets 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.500
 it was asked for example as 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.409
 the one who had noticed that me 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.290
 vegan coffee that's what I'm doing there 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.880
 How to cook stones would not make you funny 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.579
 a serious answer to this 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.890
 saying would be no no I it no hay 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.950
 no grass silage no genetically modified 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.469
 soybean splits antibiotics crop 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.640
 and no meat-and-bone meatmeal 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.050
 or so springs no fear but 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.280
 I usually do not feel like that either 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.319
 to take it seriously 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.450
 if, however, first 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.999
 get behind pay as it will 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.969
 yes rainforests cut down then huge 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:25.139
 fields with soya grow from those then 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:26.310
 tofu or soy milk is made and how 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.109
 I am generally in such a way 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.609
 I can actually behave discussion 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.319
 do not say that always comes 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.370
 also a bit on mine 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.349
 conversation partner 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.780
 For example, if someone does not already 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.819
 understand why I say the poor if 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.239
 he from his freshly designed geese 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.430
 told and now with a why those are 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.049
 to eat there reacts then I start yes 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.180
 it's completely different than at 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.189
 somebody sorry for the animals 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.260
 but who simply thinks that he will be 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.400
 In general, I need white 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.230
 to take care that I mine 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.230
 do not attack or conversation partners 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.750
 overwhelm him with arguments but 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.159
 just my motivation and mine 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.870
 to be understood visually 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.000
 I do not think anyone of them 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.980
 can convince that it would be right 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.019
 to become vegetarian or vegan 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.319
 rather you can put the other on this 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.699
 draw attention to the subject or even him 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.329
 get animated about this topic 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.819
 inform 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.769
 but it's not possible 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.269
 Western decision its life 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.400
 or nutritionally 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.409
 that at least everyone thinks 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.989
 me that we are waiting for you 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.099
 you were really persuaded vegetarian 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.079
 or to become vegan 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.909
 or have you mostly? 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.009
 myself would be informed 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.069
 be interested in what is more important to you 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:40.019
 health status or the animals 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.939
 interesting question actually would 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.280
 i mean my health mine 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.620
 Main motivation vegan live too 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.229
 want or not give it up 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.939
 are the animals but that does not mean either 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:53.069
 that I make my health suffer 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.689
 would only be to spare the animals in the 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.609
 It's the same reason that I have both 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.530
 does not exclude the contrary I am 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.019
 He even better because I have no products 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.459
 food and yes and no animal needs for me 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.459
 suffer a little here 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.099
 thought game for you all accepted 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.489
 humans would be pure carnivores so 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.199
 with short ladies clown three scenes and 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.389
 so on, okay, we might be there 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.239
 also not quite so progressive because 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:21.659
 it is pretty hard my cat 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.800
 but to keep that screwdriver 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.960
 completely ignored 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.150
 we are just like today 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.680
 just stop carnivores with which 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.340
 eyes would ye extent animal facilities 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.530
 see 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.210
 after all, there are so many people that 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.940
 if everyone would go hunting 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.620
 the pictures for about two weeks 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.250
 I'll answer your answers 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.750
 very curious 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.250
 okay that was it again 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.870
 I forgot she was always over 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.550
 look and did him a nice greeting 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.440
 to let and write again 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.130
 few questions for the next time in the 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.940
 Comments 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.940
 bye bye
