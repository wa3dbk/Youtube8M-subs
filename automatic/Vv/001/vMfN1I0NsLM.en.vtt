thought why not you know try to make a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.950 
thought why not you know try to make a
little<00:00:35.520> more<00:00:35.700> dynamic<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.300> know<00:00:36.450> even<00:00:36.870> though

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
little more dynamic you know even though

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.610 
little more dynamic you know even though
it's<00:00:37.110> been<00:00:37.290> years<00:00:38.040> since<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.489> use<00:00:38.670> air<00:00:38.910> dry<00:00:39.149> clay

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
it's been years since I use air dry clay

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.010 
it's been years since I use air dry clay
to<00:00:40.620> try<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.860> make<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.719> do<00:00:42.840> better

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to try to make it you know to do better

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.500 
to try to make it you know to do better
so<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:44.040> I'm<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.930 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
let<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> back<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.860> head<00:00:47.039> right

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
with clay again the main reason I'm

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.590 
with clay again the main reason I'm
doing<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.490> because<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.420> make

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
doing this is because it's going to make

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.010 
doing this is because it's going to make
the<00:01:33.869> gel<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.650> very<00:01:34.920> very<00:01:35.310> thick

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
the gel is going to be very very thick

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
the gel is going to be very very thick
it's<00:01:37.020> gonna<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.680> solid<00:01:38.130> clay<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.670> it's

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
it's gonna be like solid clay and it's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's gonna be like solid clay and it's
gonna<00:01:38.850> take<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> lot<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:39.689> clay<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.290> I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.830 
gonna take up a lot of my clay and I
don't<00:01:41.189> want<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.700> don't<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.210> plus<00:01:42.630> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
don't want to I don't want that plus you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.539 
don't want to I don't want that plus you
know<00:01:42.960> has<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.320> dry<00:01:43.560> properly<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.220> can't<00:01:44.460> have

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
know has to dry properly you can't have

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.929 
know has to dry properly you can't have
a<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.880> hugely<00:01:45.540> thick<00:01:46.049> area<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:47.729> that

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
a really hugely thick area like that

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.410 
a really hugely thick area like that
anyways<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.000> shows<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
anyways so just this kind of shows you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.210 
anyways so just this kind of shows you
that<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.720> even<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> cover<00:01:53.100> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that you can even if you have a cover to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.740 
that you can even if you have a cover to
the<00:01:53.310> clay<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.880> stop<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.299> modify<00:01:54.720> your

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the clay you can stop and modify your

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.319 
the clay you can stop and modify your
armature<00:01:55.259> again<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.729> how<00:01:56.850> much<00:01:56.969> void

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
armature again do you see how much void

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
armature again do you see how much void
that's<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> take<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.350> now<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.950> little

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
that's going to take up now that little

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.480 
that's going to take up now that little
bit<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.610> did<00:01:59.899> this<00:02:00.899> way<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.490> it

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
bit that I did this way I can just it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.209 
bit that I did this way I can just it
will<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.119> really<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.290> thick<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.920> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
will be is really really thick like it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.190 
will be is really really thick like it
was<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.719> was<00:02:06.930> pretty<00:02:07.110> much

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
was going to be this was pretty much

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.219 
was going to be this was pretty much
quiet<00:02:07.619> right<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.690> lowered<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.750> forehead

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
quiet right here I lowered the forehead

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.690 
quiet right here I lowered the forehead
area<00:02:10.259> right<00:02:10.679> here

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
area right here

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.180 
area right here
so<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.060> won't<00:02:12.209> be<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.599> way<00:02:15.890> give<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> place

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
so it won't be in the way give a place

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.270 
so it won't be in the way give a place
for<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.459> eyes<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.030> stuff<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.330> be<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.830> this

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
for the eyes and stuff to be and this

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.210 
for the eyes and stuff to be and this
will<00:02:20.459> be<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.239> jaw<00:02:22.260> snout<00:02:22.800> type

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
will be the like the jaw snout type

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:36.040 
will be the like the jaw snout type
thing<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.989> probably<00:02:25.290> could<00:02:25.440> be<00:02:25.470> even<00:02:25.950> bigger

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.600 

okay<00:02:37.050> obviously<00:02:37.410> they<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.040> close<00:02:38.220> up<00:02:38.430> all<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
okay obviously they can close up all the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.970 
okay obviously they can close up all the
way<00:02:38.790> because<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.180> did<00:02:39.630> increase<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.380> surface

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
way because I did increase the surface

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.000 
way because I did increase the surface
area<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:42.450> total<00:02:42.780> surface<00:02:43.140> area<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.680> this

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
area the total surface area of this

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.640 
area the total surface area of this
armature<00:02:44.640> now<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.840> I'll<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.110> close<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.350> up

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
armature now so I'll just close that up

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.990 
armature now so I'll just close that up
in<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.830> slowly<00:02:49.340> okay<00:02:50.340> now<00:02:50.519> I'm<00:02:50.700> going<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.880> try<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
in a slowly okay now I'm going to try to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.449 
in a slowly okay now I'm going to try to
balance<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:52.110> out<00:02:52.290> some<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.950> structure

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
balance this out some of the structure

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.460 
balance this out some of the structure
like<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.239> up<00:02:54.390> real<00:02:54.569> high<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:55.260> real

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
like this is up real high this is real

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.220 
like this is up real high this is real
low<00:02:55.650> I'll<00:02:56.250> try<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.580> cut<00:02:56.880> away<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.630> little<00:02:58.080> bit

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
low I'll try to cut away a little bit

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.789 
low I'll try to cut away a little bit
from<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.700> high<00:02:59.850> areas<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.569> add<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:01.230> low<00:03:01.410> areas

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
from the high areas and add to low areas

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.949 
from the high areas and add to low areas
I<00:03:02.010> can't<00:03:02.459> dig<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.790> too<00:03:02.970> much<00:03:03.120> because<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.630> want

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
I can't dig in too much because I want

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.570 
I can't dig in too much because I want
just<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.590> some<00:03:04.769> kind<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.010> structure<00:03:05.310> to

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
just to have some kind of structure to

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.870 
just to have some kind of structure to
it

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.620 
it
but<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.569> know<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:07.049> really<00:03:07.410> really<00:03:07.560> thick

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
but I know this is really really thick

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.120 
but I know this is really really thick
okay<00:03:09.630> now<00:03:09.780> for<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.019> cool<00:03:10.530> part<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.010> video

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
okay now for the cool part of the video

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.539 
okay now for the cool part of the video
in<00:03:11.549> my<00:03:11.819> opinion<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:13.110> time-lapse<00:03:13.560> section<00:03:14.370> I

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
in my opinion the time-lapse section I

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.060 
in my opinion the time-lapse section I
really<00:03:15.420> love<00:03:15.690> time-lapse<00:03:16.320> because<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:16.769> think

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
really love time-lapse because I think

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.400 
really love time-lapse because I think
it's<00:03:17.220> very<00:03:18.000> educational<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:19.109> be<00:03:19.200> able<00:03:19.350> to

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
it's very educational to be able to

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.920 
it's very educational to be able to
watch<00:03:19.620> something<00:03:20.060> take<00:03:21.060> place<00:03:21.359> in<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.720> manner

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
watch something take place in a manner

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.289 
watch something take place in a manner
that<00:03:22.049> ain't<00:03:22.380> naturally<00:03:22.890> possible<00:03:23.489> like<00:03:24.269> a

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
that ain't naturally possible like a

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.479 
that ain't naturally possible like a
flower<00:03:24.630> blooming<00:03:24.930> or<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:26.160> know<00:03:26.250> something

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
flower blooming or you know something

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:26.960 
flower blooming or you know something
like<00:03:26.640> that

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
like that

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.270 
like that
I<00:03:27.150> forgot<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.260> mention<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.620> earlier<00:03:28.829> in<00:03:29.190> this

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
I forgot to mention it earlier in this

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.390 
I forgot to mention it earlier in this
video<00:03:29.459> but<00:03:29.850> I'm<00:03:29.940> making<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.660> monkey<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.400> right

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
video but I'm making a monkey and right

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.009 
video but I'm making a monkey and right
now<00:03:32.519> I'm<00:03:32.670> just<00:03:32.730> blocking<00:03:33.269> everything<00:03:33.570> out

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
now I'm just blocking everything out

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.960 
now I'm just blocking everything out
trying<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.590> get<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.920> basic<00:03:35.190> shapes<00:03:35.760> and

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
definitions of a monkey you know the the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
in the last video I asked everybody what

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.360 
in the last video I asked everybody what
you<00:04:03.810> know<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:03.959> should<00:04:04.290> make<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.799> was<00:04:04.950> really

you know I should make and I was really

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.069 
you know I should make and I was really
wanting<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.760> do<00:04:05.850> an<00:04:05.970> alien<00:04:06.269> obviously<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:06.959> was

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
wanting to do an alien obviously I was

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.620 
wanting to do an alien obviously I was
leaning<00:04:07.440> towards<00:04:07.709> an<00:04:07.889> alien<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.880> few<00:04:09.299> of<00:04:09.420> y'all

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
leaning towards an alien a few of y'all

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.750 
leaning towards an alien a few of y'all
are<00:04:09.959> wanting<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:10.980> see<00:04:11.100> something<00:04:11.400> other<00:04:11.579> than

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
are wanting to see something other than

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.140 
are wanting to see something other than
an<00:04:11.880> alien<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:13.280> someone<00:04:14.280> even<00:04:14.519> suggested<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.090> do

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
an alien and someone even suggested I do

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.979 
an alien and someone even suggested I do
you<00:04:15.870> know<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.019> human<00:04:16.350> make<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.100> make<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.370> human<00:04:17.989> so

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
you know a human make it make a human so

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:19.909 
you know a human make it make a human so
I<00:04:19.019> thought<00:04:19.260> this<00:04:19.350> would<00:04:19.500> be<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.650> good

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
I thought this would be a good

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.250 
I thought this would be a good
compromise<00:04:20.430> between<00:04:20.609> everything<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:22.049> make<00:04:22.229> a

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
compromise between everything to make a

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.470 
compromise between everything to make a
monkey<00:04:22.560> it's<00:04:23.039> not<00:04:23.250> an<00:04:23.370> alien<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:24.030> it's

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
monkey it's not an alien and it's

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.150 
monkey it's not an alien and it's
not<00:04:24.660> really<00:04:24.870> human<00:04:25.200> but<00:04:25.500> it's<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.710> distant

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
not really human but it's a distant

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.600 
not really human but it's a distant
cousin<00:04:26.370> so<00:04:26.850> it's<00:04:27.090> kind<00:04:27.390> of<00:04:28.310> working<00:04:29.310> with<00:04:29.460> you

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
cousin so it's kind of working with you

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.030 
cousin so it's kind of working with you
you<00:04:29.790> know<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.000> mean<00:04:30.240> I'm<00:04:30.960> trying<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.290> take<00:04:31.890> the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
you know I mean I'm trying to take the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.700 
you know I mean I'm trying to take the
feedback<00:04:32.280> up<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.700> channel<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.180> everything

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
feedback up the channel and everything

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.980 
feedback up the channel and everything
but<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:34.950> am<00:04:35.220> an<00:04:35.430> absolute<00:04:35.550> fan<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.300> aliens<00:04:36.780> and

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
but I am an absolute fan of aliens and

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.800 
but I am an absolute fan of aliens and
expect<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.710> see<00:04:37.890> more<00:04:38.130> of<00:04:38.280> them<00:04:38.660> because<00:04:39.660> I

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
expect to see more of them because I

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.930 
expect to see more of them because I
because<00:04:40.650> they're<00:04:40.770> easy<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.250> do<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.670> you<00:04:41.730> can't

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
because they're easy to do and you can't

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.530 
because they're easy to do and you can't
go<00:04:42.090> wrong

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
go wrong

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.980 
go wrong
I<00:04:42.570> can<00:04:43.500> definitely<00:04:43.920> mess<00:04:44.400> up<00:04:44.580> this<00:04:44.790> monkey<00:04:45.240> but

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
I can definitely mess up this monkey but

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.360 
I can definitely mess up this monkey but
you<00:04:46.020> can't<00:04:46.320> really<00:04:46.530> mess<00:04:46.710> up<00:04:46.740> an<00:04:47.010> alien

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
you can't really mess up an alien

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.630 
you can't really mess up an alien
because<00:04:47.520> anything<00:04:48.180> can<00:04:48.330> be<00:04:48.450> an<00:04:48.540> alien<00:04:49.640> that's

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
because anything can be an alien that's

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.020 
because anything can be an alien that's
