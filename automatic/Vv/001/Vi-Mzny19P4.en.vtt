00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.570
 all welcome on will cook faithful 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.240
 we realized today a 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.780
 little recipe of sand and coco hyper 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.299
 easy 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.350
 it's gone for the recipe we'll have 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.490
 need 150 g of butter 75 g of sugar 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.250
 75 g grated coconut 150 g flour 1 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.699
 egg yolk a pinch of fleur de sel 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.980
 and 1 packet of vanilla sugar 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.100
 it will also require an egg for the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.160
 gild this recipe 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.640
 she is really very simple then on 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.550
 flour 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:49.370
 I put the compo rap and a pinch of 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:51.960
 fleur de sel sugar in all the butter 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.789
 then the butter thinks to take it out 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:02.129
 half an hour before starting the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:04.920
 recipe is then the egg yolk and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.720
 now they just have to put the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.159
 vanilla sugar and a mixture is actually 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.760
 it's the same recipe that we find 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.979
 in bakeries 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.540
 except this one I did it to me at the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.619
 coconut and usually we 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.479
 Almonds 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.290
 so now we're going to mix all that 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.030
 to get a ball at once the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.259
 beautiful ball got we will come so 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.259
 flatten and cover with paper 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.970
 movie and now it's missing 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.619
 that she has disposed so in the refrigerator 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 for 30 minutes 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.170
 he should not hesitate to rework 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.970
 as soon as it comes out of the fridge and do not hesitate 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.680
 not to leave her in that a little bit more 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.340
 long to have something of 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.390
 well close then re I sprinkle so 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:56.090
 the work plan of farid as well as the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.829
 roll and then I lethal 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.180
 then with my cookie cutter I come 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.180
 detailed circles 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.160
 with the spatula 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.200
 I recover the discs and froze features 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:20.050
 directly on a plate with 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.970
 parchment paper and the balls of dough 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.340
 which remains to me so I go 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:31.060
 rework to reform the ten cases 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.010
 so I put them in a ball I get back 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.950
 in all the flour that ensure the 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.680
 worktop and with the roller 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.870
 disposable so now we're going 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.280
 to be able to make small patterns so I 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.890
 retrieve my circle and I come so 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.400
 press lightly on the top of the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.520
 sand and then I can take a 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:00.220
 spatula is and make marks 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:05.489
 so here we can do traits and 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.489
 then do gay rhombus 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:17.890
 and there you really do the motives 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.050
 that you want one now I fight 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.580
 my work 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.260
 then is worth choosing to put a young 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.880
 lot and a road from the east if you 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:40.690
 wish and then I'm basting 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:43.630
 so but sandblasted then my oven is in 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.180
 preheat to 175 degrees we're going 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.370
 bake them about 15 between 15 and 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.380
 20 minutes 1.6 in your kitchen 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.440
 it is very hot in this case 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.650
 put the shortbreads in the fridge before 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.170
 bake them go it's gone 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.420
 our sands and are cooked and cooled on 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.600
 will immediately go to the tasting 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.630
 so I show the back and I'm going 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.280
 immediately chew 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.010
 the shortbread and crispy one 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.450
 find again the taste of the fleur de sel 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.880
 I really hope you will redo 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.620
 this recipe at home the recipe 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.959
 works very well with powder 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.760
 peanuts or powder 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.600
 hazelnuts or almond so that's it to 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.040
 you to see 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.200
 so I hope you will leave me 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.460
 a little green thumb I also hope that 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.290
 you are going to have you do not hesitate 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.729
 still done and I find you very 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.530
 fast on fast cooking for 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.530
 recipes certainly has easier to
