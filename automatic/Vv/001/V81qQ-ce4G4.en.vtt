the<00:01:45.990> street<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.790> don't<00:01:47.790> think<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.150> picking<00:01:48.420> up

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
the street I don't think it's picking up

the street I don't think it's picking up
on<00:01:48.660> camera<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> that's<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:55.160> this<00:01:56.160> is<00:01:56.550> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
on camera so that's that this is the

fact<00:02:00.050> let<00:02:01.050> me<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.410> prove<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.550> waterproof

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
fact let me just prove it's waterproof

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.550 
fact let me just prove it's waterproof
ways<00:02:03.690> by<00:02:04.020> putting<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.470> in<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> snow<00:02:06.410> there<00:02:07.410> you

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
ways by putting it in the snow there you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.020 
ways by putting it in the snow there you
go

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.990 

and<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.450> falls<00:02:12.660> through<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:12.990> snow<00:02:17.000> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and it falls through the snow and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
LED and like I said it's got a 100 and a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.949 
LED and like I said it's got a 100 and a
10<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.320> 10<00:02:32.209> notice<00:02:33.209> it's<00:02:33.510> pretty

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
lit up better with the newer one because

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.790 
lit up better with the newer one because
it's<00:02:40.530> more<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.920> white<00:02:41.130> light<00:02:41.850> versus<00:02:42.810> the
