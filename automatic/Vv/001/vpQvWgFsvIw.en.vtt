00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
bike really we just needed some setup

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.869 
bike really we just needed some setup
time<00:00:48.960> he<00:00:49.739> said<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.070> weekend<00:00:50.429> was<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.670> first

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
time he said this weekend was the first

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.099 
time he said this weekend was the first
time<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.030> actually<00:00:51.179> laid<00:00:51.449> eyes<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.960> bike

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
time you actually laid eyes on the bike

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:53.869 
time you actually laid eyes on the bike
let<00:00:52.350> alone<00:00:52.530> write<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.070> around<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:53.609> so<00:00:53.760> you're

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
let alone write it around here so you're

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.939 
let alone write it around here so you're
just<00:00:54.210> short<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.539> qualifying<00:00:54.960> only<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.499> few

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
just short of qualifying only by a few

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.739 
just short of qualifying only by a few
seconds<00:00:56.339> was<00:00:56.429> even<00:00:56.730> tenth<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.210> think<00:00:57.629> there's

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
seconds was even tenth I think there's

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.360 
seconds was even tenth I think there's
like<00:00:57.780> half<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> second<00:00:58.499> maybe<00:00:58.559> three<00:00:58.920> tents<00:00:59.190> but

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
like half a second maybe three tents but

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.360 
like half a second maybe three tents but
yeah<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.390> mean<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.679> first<00:01:01.949> bike<00:01:02.159> that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
yeah I mean it's the first bike that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.220 
yeah I mean it's the first bike that
Richards<00:01:02.699> built<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.569> I<00:01:03.659> got<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.140> know

that's a lot a lot of stuff you could do

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.830 
that's a lot a lot of stuff you could do
and<00:01:19.110> adjust<00:01:19.620> and<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.730> is<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.910> steep<00:01:21.420> steep

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and adjust and so is a steep steep

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.960 
and adjust and so is a steep steep
learning<00:01:21.990> curve<00:01:22.170> without<00:01:23.010> time<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.550> testing

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
learning curve without time to testing

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.460 
learning curve without time to testing
at<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> bike<00:01:24.300> really<00:01:24.630> dialed<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.050> it<00:01:25.230> it's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
at the bike really dialed in it it's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.720 
at the bike really dialed in it it's
hard<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.800> believe<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.220> you're<00:01:26.400> even<00:01:26.520> out

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
think we're gonna give it another shot

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.150 
think we're gonna give it another shot
maybe<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> little<00:01:39.300> testing<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.890> some<00:01:41.070> of

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
maybe do a little testing get some of

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.040 
maybe do a little testing get some of
the<00:01:41.220> little<00:01:41.430> little<00:01:41.880> niggling<00:01:42.270> issues<00:01:42.660> that's

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
the little little niggling issues that's
