00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
temperature rise why are things cold why

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.209 
temperature rise why are things cold why
are<00:01:55.590> things<00:01:55.740> hot<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.939> all<00:01:57.119> about<00:01:57.329> movement

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
are things hot it's all about movement

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.730 
are things hot it's all about movement
when<00:01:59.219> molecules<00:01:59.850> stop<00:02:00.689> moving<00:02:01.320> or<00:02:01.439> when<00:02:01.619> they

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
when molecules stop moving or when they

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.649 
when molecules stop moving or when they
slow<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.729> very<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:03.360> movement

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
slow down or have very little movement

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.950 
slow down or have very little movement
the<00:02:04.350> temperature<00:02:04.799> drops<00:02:05.119> when<00:02:06.119> molecules<00:02:06.360> are

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the temperature drops when molecules are

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.290 
the temperature drops when molecules are
moving<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.530> lot<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.039> they're<00:02:08.160> very<00:02:08.310> active<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
moving a lot and they're very active the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.540 
moving a lot and they're very active the
temperature<00:02:09.750> goes<00:02:09.989> up<00:02:10.229> because<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.190> more

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
temperature goes up because the more

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.280 
temperature goes up because the more
molecules<00:02:12.360> move

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
molecules move

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.619 
molecules move
atoms<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.280> molecules<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:15.299> more<00:02:15.510> they

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
atoms and molecules the more they

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.210 
atoms and molecules the more they
interact<00:02:16.110> with<00:02:16.230> each<00:02:16.439> other<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.860> more<00:02:16.890> they

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
interact with each other the more they

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.490 
interact with each other the more they
bump<00:02:17.519> into<00:02:18.000> each<00:02:18.030> other<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:19.170> more<00:02:19.349> they

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
bump into each other and the more they

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.110 
bump into each other and the more they
bump<00:02:19.709> into<00:02:19.860> each<00:02:20.010> other<00:02:20.370> at<00:02:20.579> the<00:02:20.640> more<00:02:20.879> heat

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
bump into each other at the more heat

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.630 
bump into each other at the more heat
decree<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.680> when<00:02:22.860> molecules<00:02:23.069> are<00:02:23.519> moving

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
decree so when molecules are moving

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.780 
decree so when molecules are moving
slower<00:02:24.480> there's<00:02:25.470> less<00:02:25.739> interaction<00:02:26.310> less

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
slower there's less interaction less

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.819 
slower there's less interaction less
friction<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.569> therefore<00:02:27.930> less<00:02:28.170> temperature

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
friction and therefore less temperature

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.460 
friction and therefore less temperature
and<00:02:29.099> when<00:02:29.610> things<00:02:29.849> stop<00:02:30.329> moving<00:02:30.900> completely

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
and when things stop moving completely

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.670 
and when things stop moving completely
when<00:02:32.040> there<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.340> zero<00:02:32.790> movement<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
when there is zero movement that is the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.089 
when there is zero movement that is the
temperature<00:02:34.890> known<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.640> absolute<00:02:36.269> zero

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
temperature known as absolute zero

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.440 
temperature known as absolute zero
nothing<00:02:38.099> moves<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.970> not<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.359> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
nothing moves it's not that the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.759 
nothing moves it's not that the
temperature<00:02:39.840> stops<00:02:40.109> things<00:02:40.379> from<00:02:40.590> moving

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
temperature stops things from moving

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.800 
temperature stops things from moving
it's<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.190> things<00:02:41.459> stopped<00:02:42.030> moving<00:02:42.420> and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
it's that things stopped moving and

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.020 
it's that things stopped moving and
therefore<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.769> temperature<00:02:43.920> went<00:02:44.909> to

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
therefore the temperature went to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.420 
therefore the temperature went to
absolute<00:02:45.390> zero<00:02:45.629> nothing<00:02:46.530> moves<00:02:46.709> nothing<00:02:46.980> can

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
absolute zero nothing moves nothing can

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.880 
absolute zero nothing moves nothing can
move<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:48.030> not<00:02:48.180> possible<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.530> for<00:02:49.739> those<00:02:49.829> of

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
move it's not possible so for those of

move it's not possible so for those of

you that are experiencing a depression

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.849 
you that are experiencing a depression
raise<00:02:52.049> your<00:02:52.200> hand<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:55.290> may<00:02:55.530> feel<00:02:55.799> like

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
raise your hand it may feel like

little bit of movement is going to raise
the<00:03:55.709> temperature<00:03:55.889> just<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.669> tad<00:03:56.879> bit<00:03:56.909> and<00:03:57.780> when

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
the temperature just a tad bit and when

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.599 
the temperature just a tad bit and when
you<00:03:57.989> raise<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.169> temperature<00:03:58.500> things<00:03:59.310> start

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
you raise the temperature things start

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.879 
you raise the temperature things start
moving<00:03:59.879> more<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.180> more<00:04:00.329> interactions<00:04:01.109> more

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
moving more and more interactions more

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.610 
moving more and more interactions more
thoughts<00:04:02.250> more<00:04:02.879> warmth<00:04:03.329> that<00:04:04.139> will<00:04:04.319> allow<00:04:04.560> you

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
thoughts more warmth that will allow you

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.580 
thoughts more warmth that will allow you
to<00:04:04.769> take<00:04:05.099> another<00:04:05.370> little<00:04:05.639> step<00:04:05.940> causing<00:04:06.900> more

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
to take another little step causing more

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.159 
to take another little step causing more
movement<00:04:08.069> causing<00:04:08.819> higher<00:04:09.299> interaction

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
movement causing higher interaction

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.740 
movement causing higher interaction
causing<00:04:10.829> higher<00:04:11.010> temperature<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.540> keep

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
causing higher temperature and you keep

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.189 
causing higher temperature and you keep
building<00:04:13.139> and<00:04:13.560> building<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.489> building

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199 
building and building and building

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.649 
building and building and building
momentum<00:04:16.199> you<00:04:16.769> get<00:04:17.039> your<00:04:17.489> body<00:04:17.909> and<00:04:18.269> your<00:04:18.419> mind

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
momentum you get your body and your mind

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.779 
momentum you get your body and your mind
little<00:04:19.169> by<00:04:19.560> little<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:20.070> take<00:04:20.250> these<00:04:20.459> tiny

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
little by little to take these tiny

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.480 
little by little to take these tiny
steps<00:04:21.380> which<00:04:22.380> requires<00:04:22.770> energy<00:04:23.039> but<00:04:23.370> we're

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
steps which requires energy but we're

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.100 
steps which requires energy but we're
not<00:04:23.610> talking<00:04:23.909> about<00:04:24.090> massive<00:04:24.570> snaps<00:04:24.810> we're

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
not talking about massive snaps we're

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.960 
not talking about massive snaps we're
not<00:04:25.200> going<00:04:25.440> from<00:04:25.590> absolute<00:04:26.039> zero

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
the temperature of the Sun we're going

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.750 
the temperature of the Sun we're going
from<00:04:29.520> 40<00:04:30.060> below<00:04:30.240> zero<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:31.170> 38<00:04:31.590> below<00:04:31.710> zero<00:04:32.130> and

from 40 below zero to 38 below zero and

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.470 
from 40 below zero to 38 below zero and
then<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.210> 35<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.170> then<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.740> 30<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.250> then<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.000> 21

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
then to 35 and then to 30 and then to 21

then to 35 and then to 30 and then to 21
and<00:04:36.750> then<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.470> 14<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.910> on<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.360> so<00:04:39.540> on<00:04:39.570> and

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
and then to 14 and so on and so on and

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.230 
and then to 14 and so on and so on and
so<00:04:40.110> on<00:04:40.140> little<00:04:40.680> by<00:04:40.800> little<00:04:41.070> we're<00:04:41.310> raising<00:04:41.520> the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
so on little by little we're raising the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.370 
so on little by little we're raising the
temperature<00:04:42.600> I've<00:04:43.530> been<00:04:43.710> out<00:04:43.830> here<00:04:43.860> now<00:04:44.100> for

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
temperature I've been out here now for

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.460 
temperature I've been out here now for
48<00:04:46.380> minutes<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.920> I<00:04:47.430> am<00:04:47.460> toasty<00:04:48.090> know<00:04:49.050> part<00:04:49.380> of

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
48 minutes and I am toasty know part of

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.260 
48 minutes and I am toasty know part of
me<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.620> cold<00:04:50.190> even<00:04:50.400> though<00:04:50.580> my<00:04:50.790> face<00:04:51.030> is

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
me is cold even though my face is

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.720 
me is cold even though my face is
exposed<00:04:51.660> it's<00:04:52.050> warm<00:04:52.380> because<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.130> rest<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.610> me

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
exposed it's warm because the rest of me

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.120 
exposed it's warm because the rest of me
is<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:54.510> well<00:04:54.690> insulated<00:04:55.080> that<00:04:55.530> there's<00:04:55.770> enough

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
is so well insulated that there's enough

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.740 
is so well insulated that there's enough
blood<00:04:56.400> to<00:04:56.460> go<00:04:56.730> to<00:04:56.790> my<00:04:56.940> face<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.360> keep<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.630> warm

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
blood to go to my face to keep it warm

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.590 
blood to go to my face to keep it warm
so<00:04:57.900> I'm<00:04:58.110> actually<00:04:58.410> really<00:04:58.620> comfortable<00:04:59.100> so

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
so I'm actually really comfortable so

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.960 
so I'm actually really comfortable so
you<00:05:00.600> need<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:01.290> get<00:05:01.530> yourself<00:05:01.710> moving<00:05:02.430> because

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
you need to get yourself moving because

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.390 
you need to get yourself moving because
that's<00:05:03.210> how<00:05:03.420> you<00:05:03.480> raise<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.990> temperature

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
that's how you raise the temperature

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.980 
that's how you raise the temperature
outside<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:06.150> inside<00:05:07.280> little<00:05:08.280> tiny<00:05:08.610> steps<00:05:09.000> get

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
outside and inside little tiny steps get

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.100 
outside and inside little tiny steps get
the<00:05:10.140> molecules<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.920> you<00:05:11.400> moving<00:05:12.300> get<00:05:12.840> them<00:05:12.990> in

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
the molecules of you moving get them in

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.680 
the molecules of you moving get them in
motion<00:05:13.290> get<00:05:14.040> them<00:05:14.190> interacting<00:05:14.490> raise<00:05:15.450> the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
motion get them interacting raise the

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.840 
motion get them interacting raise the
temperature<00:05:16.170> get<00:05:16.740> outside<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.490> enjoy

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
temperature get outside and enjoy

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.900 
temperature get outside and enjoy
yourself<00:05:18.540> okay<00:05:19.140> I'm<00:05:20.010> off<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.370> finish<00:05:20.520> up<00:05:20.760> my

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
yourself okay I'm off to finish up my

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.919 
yourself okay I'm off to finish up my
run<00:05:21.120> feeling<00:05:21.480> nice<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:21.690> toasty<00:05:22.200> see<00:05:22.800> you
