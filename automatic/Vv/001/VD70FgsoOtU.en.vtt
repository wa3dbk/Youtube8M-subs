00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.180
 Nick Heidfeld and for the automotive and industrial sectors 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.849
 to newspapers organized in Frankfurt 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.910
 Flexible use under pressure and race exit 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.869
 the bipolar Schalke are talking on a topic and are in Tyrol for 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.119
 a single s &amp; t 89 ​​housing available 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:30.039
 at a supply voltage between three comma 8 and 24 volts can 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.469
 Sensors for static magnetic fields and alternating fields up to ten kilos of hearts 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.620
 be used 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.840
 the output voltage Schalke depends on the magnetic fields stronger and the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.840
 Polarity Northeim or he advises 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.450
 the integrated contract prior to comparison with the concerns of the magnetic field strength 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.450
 the sheikh Schwerin 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.339
 the field strength of the South Pole exceeds the specified switching point 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.060
 so the expenditure goes up to 4 0 increased 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.200
 The full-back celebrated as soon as the field strength of the North Pole under the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.200
 specified switching points are value 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.780
 if you did not apply a magnetic field output state percent 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.440
 how different than usual 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.000
 It developed for use in the German North Sea for industry and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.140
 Household applications 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.229
 They can be used at ambient temperatures from -40 to 40 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.229
 150 ° C 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.850
 In their active time compensations leads over the whole 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.870
 Digestive tract exited area 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.870
 also Konstantin behavior 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.840
 Furthermore 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.210
 470 against mechanical stress effect 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.010
 Therefore, a look role as the hottest of Nicolas is the most reliable why 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.310
 have switch off depending on the two previous years of a timely
