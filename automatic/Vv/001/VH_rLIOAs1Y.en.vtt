00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
this is fantastic see this is the way

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
this is fantastic see this is the way
that<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.039> should<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.120> Enderdragon

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
that it should that the the Enderdragon

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.729 
that it should that the the Enderdragon
should<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.079> been<00:00:58.170> killed

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
should have been killed

should have been killed
also<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.879> easier<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.329> hit<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.660> thing

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
also it's way easier to hit this thing

I'm chasing the dragon around I'm okay
they<00:01:55.760> obviously<00:01:55.940> don't<00:01:56.270> do<00:01:56.450> any<00:01:56.630> damage

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
they obviously don't do any damage

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.240 
they obviously don't do any damage
however<00:01:59.230> supposedly<00:02:00.230> um<00:02:02.110> snowballs<00:02:03.110> do<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.220> I

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
however supposedly um snowballs do so I

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.300 
however supposedly um snowballs do so I
guess<00:02:04.550> that's<00:02:04.910> kind<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.480> same<00:02:05.690> concept<00:02:06.310> so

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
guess that's kind of the same concept so

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.950 
guess that's kind of the same concept so
where<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.030> at<00:02:08.149> dragon<00:02:08.540> oh<00:02:09.850> yeah<00:02:10.850> oh<00:02:11.090> yeah<00:02:11.210> Oh

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
seriously i it's actually taking a lot

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.840 
seriously i it's actually taking a lot
of<00:02:21.500> snowballs<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.160> I'm<00:02:22.250> really<00:02:22.400> glad<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.760> we

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
of snowballs so I'm really glad that we

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.880 
of snowballs so I'm really glad that we
didn't<00:02:23.120> try<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.300> actually<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:24.680> because

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
didn't try to actually do that because

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.340 
didn't try to actually do that because
we<00:02:25.160> did<00:02:25.310> consider<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.880> for<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.090> while<00:02:26.240> trying<00:02:27.200> to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
we did consider it for a while trying to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.810 
we did consider it for a while trying to
come<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.800> end<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:27.980> actually<00:02:28.160> kill<00:02:28.640> him

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
come to the end and actually kill him

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.080 
come to the end and actually kill him
using<00:02:29.180> snowballs<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:31.190> it's<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.580> taking<00:02:31.940> too

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
using snowballs but it's it's taking too

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.550 
using snowballs but it's it's taking too
many<00:02:32.210> so<00:02:32.570> I'm<00:02:32.690> really<00:02:32.810> glad<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.110> we<00:02:33.290> decided

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
many so I'm really glad that we decided

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.580 
many so I'm really glad that we decided
