maybe going around the edges of the
frame<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.970> can<00:04:53.000> be<00:04:53.240> messy<00:04:53.539> if<00:04:53.900> you<00:04:54.080> want

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
frame you can be messy if you want

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.680 
frame you can be messy if you want
that's<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:55.160> distress<00:04:55.550> ink<00:04:55.759> will<00:04:55.910> Stickles

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
that's the distress ink will Stickles

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.080 
that's the distress ink will Stickles
tend<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:57.740> come<00:04:57.979> out<00:04:58.160> a<00:04:58.550> little<00:04:59.320> thicker<00:05:01.090> than

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
tend to come out a little thicker than

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:10.170 
tend to come out a little thicker than
the<00:05:02.150> regular<00:05:02.570> stickles

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.730 

so<00:05:10.870> you're<00:05:11.020> not<00:05:11.080> going<00:05:11.229> to<00:05:11.289> get<00:05:11.380> as<00:05:11.500> much

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
so you're not going to get as much

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:23.890 
so you're not going to get as much
control

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.629 

it's<00:05:24.320> all<00:05:24.470> right<00:05:24.500> so<00:05:24.710> that<00:05:24.830> will<00:05:24.949> dry<00:05:25.160> actually

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
it's all right so that will dry actually

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.310 
it's all right so that will dry actually
kind<00:05:25.850> of<00:05:25.910> flat<00:05:26.180> right<00:05:26.419> now<00:05:26.540> it<00:05:26.660> looks<00:05:26.690> poufy

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
kind of flat right now it looks poufy

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.040 
kind of flat right now it looks poufy
but<00:05:28.130> it'll<00:05:28.430> actually<00:05:28.550> drive<00:05:29.000> nicer<00:05:29.840> than<00:05:29.990> that

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
but it'll actually drive nicer than that

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.010 
but it'll actually drive nicer than that
you'll<00:05:30.410> see<00:05:30.620> in<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.860> pictures<00:05:31.630> and<00:05:32.630> then<00:05:32.780> just
