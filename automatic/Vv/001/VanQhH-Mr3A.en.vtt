 however the developers 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.320
 they want the players to ask 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.930
 if the cannibal tribe of the island is the 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.420

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.070
 the player the cannibals can doubt in 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.989

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.910
 from the distance trying 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.100

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.830
 security and from time to time it

 render 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.349

 called mods in English or others 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.260
 players and so on at its launch 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.080
 commercial the game had two modes 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.239
 main survival in which the 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.370
 players must acquire resources to 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.230
 keep your health and hunger and creative 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.480
 where players have access 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.010
 unlimited to the resources of the game the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.890
 ability to fly and do not require 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.849
 maintain your health and hunger 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.590
 independently of these modes of 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.930
 game you can also define the 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.209
 difficulty of the game being the most 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.489
 quiet the pacific that unlike 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.410
 of the other difficulties does not allow 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.150
 monsters appear in the game that 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.849
 can interact with the player 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.280
 there is also a third game mode 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.500
 the hardcore end in English that is 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.389
 similar to survival mode with the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.699
 difference that this can only be 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.860
 played on the difficult difficulty and that the 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.690
 player possesses only one life so 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.139
 when he dies the game ends and the 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.139
 world 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.199
 number 1 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.700
 I took the role of a survivor of 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.470
 plane crash stopped somewhere 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.480
 of the Pacific Ocean 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.550
 the terrifying experience encounters 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.160
 both above and below a 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.110
 endless environment come face to face with 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.850
 some of the most life scenarios that 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.720
 will result in an experience 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.030
 different every time you play scavenger 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.490
 discover survive, you must fight 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.260
 for finding food and water too 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.300
 will have to find the way to power 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.160
 get tools in shipwrecks 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.380
 at the bottom of the sea ​​and on the shores of 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.600
 the beaches can go from island to island 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.760
 looking for boat parts and tools 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.100
 that will allow you to survive more comfortable 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.220
