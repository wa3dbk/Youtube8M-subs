00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello i am laurence of society 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.450
 in the end and today I want you 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.460
 help choose a good knife from 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.940
 cooking to choose a good knife from 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.650
 cooked 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.029
 There are several things to take in 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.529
 account there is first of all steel and how 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.880
 it's going to be work and the quality of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.350
 steel how it will work there 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.500
 and the handle we will start there the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.910
 steel work a good knife he 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 should you choose it 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.620
 with full quality ie 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.630
 that you see the blade will extend 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.700
 to the heels of the neck 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.079
 why a full one is important 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.969
 because you have to know that a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.450
 poorly balanced knife ie too much 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.079
 heavy 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.789
 in fact you will have to make a gesture 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.770
 muscle to compensate for it and ultimately 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.879
 you are tired and do not have a 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.949
 very fluid gesture 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.660
 another very important point for 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.969
 to choose a good knife is to do 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.609
 pay attention to the thickness of the blade in 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.359
 function of the used knife for the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.890
 chef's knife 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.480
 the thickness of the blade is very 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.330
 important because it's a knife 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.640
 multi-purpose that will serve also 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.380
 well for vegetables fruits and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.430
 the thickness of the blade allowing it 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 to have strength 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.920
 the blade must be strong so 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.680
 a leader with a thick soul 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.630
 less than 2 mm and a half will not have the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.670
 enough resistance and your blade is going 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.180
 break the last important point it's 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.979
 the handle 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.869
 you have to know that the knife is the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.760
 extension of your hand so you have to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.190
 that you have it 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.510
 well in hand so it's important and there 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.310
 it's very personal 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.000
 you have to have a good grip 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.620
 hand you're comfortable with it 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.280
 do not slip or spin in 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.680
 your hand then the material choice 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.300
 is important because you have to choose 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.510
 a material that will withstand 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.240
 hot or cold temperatures at 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.880
 shocks to everything you're going to do to him 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.810
 to undergo daily so that he can 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.670
 last in time 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.010
 to finish i'm going to show you the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.150
 actions to adopt to make the best use of 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.840
 your chef's knife 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.770
 so you have to use it with a strong one 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.300
 pendulum 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:17.930
 ie working with the heel 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.500
 beyond the blade leave the tip on the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.390
 board 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.830
 you now have all the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.390
 ingredients to properly choose your 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.390
 knife and to use it well
