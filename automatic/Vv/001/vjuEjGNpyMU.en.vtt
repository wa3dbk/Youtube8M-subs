00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.230
 that's what we know in the last match 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.300
 we saw some fans already catching 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.639
 foot and because of the performance 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.289
 Brazilians, but if you think that old 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.480
 story a victory in a classic one 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.080
 victory over palm trees may change 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.060
 everything and what changes in your opinion what 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.340
 You said there, ask me after the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.220
 I particularly played I could not 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.650
 listen and listen and it was not the first 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.140
 The person who is saying this was 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.640
 and I believe that the supporter has 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.730
 who understand that the team is very 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.739
 focused on the team always comes with the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.590
 goal of representing the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.300
 saints always win but not always the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.399
 The team will not always show the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 The team will play well too. 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.000
 we have self-criticism and we only know that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.379
 we did not go so well in this game but 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.180
 played enough to win and that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.340
 You know why it was important to win. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.480
 even because it was in the zone of 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.629
 demotion 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.609
 so I believe that fans can 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.939
 have patience that the team will even with 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.100
 the embezzlement team will evolve in 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.350
 place today in training people missed 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.450
 to complete 22 is for both teams 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.320
 leading in sports this difficulty 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 there is a lack of labor in the saints 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.180
 tatÃ¡ cast further with very short 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.080
 players who went to serve the selection and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.290
 injured players got smaller still 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.570
 but with group that has the professor muricy 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.640
 will do everything there so that you can start the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.470
 better of each one so that we do not 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.049
 may regret the absence of the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.579
 other players because you already have a game 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.439
 very important I said a classic 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.939
 Sunday, then we have to forget these 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.560
 absences without focusing is to try to organize 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.189
 team to make a good game in the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.259
 Sunday for the KC thinks the only thing 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.880
 good of not having many 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.680
 players available that Muricy ends 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.020
 having no doubt can not even have to 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.990
 and this is it, and it goes with this 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.880
 team does not have two or until he knows the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.489
 team that will put in sight the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.319
 interview of him and how I said the cast 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.000
 It is reduced to serving players 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.720
 selection an injured player finishes 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.640
 disturbing our team, right? 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.160
 that our goal is to be there in 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.190
 up and end up giving up some 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.170
 matches at the beginning of each Brazilian 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.510
 liberators were key 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.120
 because we got the title but now it 's 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.250
 focus on this Brazilian and even with 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.440
 embezzlement because we have to give strength 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.150
 who is entering because you are 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.220
 here in the saints has quality for power 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.610
 the team of the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.160
 and saints and again beat the arouca 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.810
 cast is reduced but the game is back 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.420
 train and wanted me to be the 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.180
 importance of his return at this time 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.970
 the half-field such a gap is a player 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.820
 who at a young age but is a player 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.930
 round and experienced we can say so 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.090
 I hope he can be adapting 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.170
 to play and we'll help on Sunday because 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.650
 all 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.630
 reinforcement is fundamental even because the 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.540
 cast is reduced we have few 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.820
 players and I believe that if he can 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.080
 play the teacher muricy put it goes 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.820
 help us a lot 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.880
 even because he is crazy to be able 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.200
 return to play and back to danilo 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.110
 should strengthen the team 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.489
 I did not know this is it seems that the saints 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.430
 achieved in that process 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.320
 playing on Sunday is a fundamental 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.500
 player who is in great shape 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.780
 It will help us a lot and as I said all 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.330
 it was everything everything reinforcement at that moment is 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.519
 important for team of saints 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.870
 going strong on Sunday and forgetting 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.870
 side absences
