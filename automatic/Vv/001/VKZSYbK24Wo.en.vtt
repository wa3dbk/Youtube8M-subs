00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.920
 now 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.320
 i 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.700
 hi friends how are you are the best and 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.710
 when they are brought a few calls 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.740
 pedestals and basically what we are 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.599
 it is to add as you can see then the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.190
 pedestals to put then the swords 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.690
 as you can see 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.610
 we can change the color of 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.750
 different animations and all that and 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.060
 let's tell what we have to be 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.250
 simply a craft on three sides of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.960
 this way and a gold ingot of that 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.820
 way will give us the short pedestal 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.860
 block as we have this block 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.650
 we simply put it where we want in 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 my case then and there when we give 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.820
 Right click with a sword 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.230
 automatic before to put click 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.910
 right again let's take our 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.770
 back sword this is very good 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.450
 let's say they just sleep something like that already 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.550
 that starts the mine running then 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.350
 simply because they are running they take their 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.449
 sword and they go there can have their 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.890
 collection of swords the one of orlÃ© of 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.080
 diamond the wood what you 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.850
 want and can choose yours and good 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.920
 Well, they are already running to the mine 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.230
 no and well, they can also have it 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.540
 their taste as you can see basically 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.909
 we put our sword then we go to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.870
 duck that way 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.670
 in this way we have to be 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.340
 crouching to access then the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.750
 pedestal menu since we are crouched 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.229
 right click and it's automatically 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.840
 open this and here we can put it on fx 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.979
 if we give it then there automatically is 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.150
 to put as if it were a sword 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.620
 Haunted 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.120
 we speak light beam light pink 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.630
 basically it's lightning 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.160
 the sky we give loading loading consulting 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.250
 Well, our sword will be floating 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.470
 circling the morro local t90 0690 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.690
 basically just rotating the pedestal 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.690
 90 degrees 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.610
 as you could see and well basically 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.750
 here we can change the color of lightning 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.580
 we can do it very, very opaque as 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.160
 you can see there we can do it too 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.030
 very pro very clear that the truth I believe 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.680
 that looks better clear 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 and we can remove him that is floating 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.490
 nothing we can not have like this 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.140
 automatically and everything will work the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.360
 same way we simply remove the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.740
 sword is going to remove the beam we put the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.190
 automatic sword before to put everything 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.660
 as we have it put no and good 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.580
 basically we can also increase the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.560
 speed in the turns if you give 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.030
 we give here floating is going to spin very 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.319
 quickly if we increase the 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.850
 speed says we remove all the 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.980
 speed then it will automatically give 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.980
 turns slowly and well very well 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.769
 here as you can see, we have to be 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.409
 the ocarina of time a pedestal and it 's you 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.170
 they will say how to change it simply because 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.030
 we give right click equally they give 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.700
 click here you change the basic to ocarina 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.379
 of time in that way 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.129
 it's very easy we can change all of them to 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.910
 ocarina of time the truth is very good 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.100
 how can you see 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.780
 and as I say, maybe this is 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.060
 your house and you to go out and choose the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.280
 sword they want we go with the order 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.920
 and they were already running they return there 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.290
 is now and so can 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.580
 do several things with this mode 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.670
 practically no they can not either 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.810
 can cross the swords of that but 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.350
 the rays and can cross them if 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.940
 fly 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.470
 and they can also do types of 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.210
 decorations with the rays if they want no 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.910
 I know the truth there are many things that 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.910
 can you think the rays are limited 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.270
 and basically that's what the mode of 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.590
 they are moix so simple but good 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.959
 it got attention then they're going to be 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.670
 certain because they like this mode and they go 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.810
 to see how it is installed and good friends 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.770
 basically the first thing that we have to 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.970
 do to install this mode is 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.680
 simply enter the forum that 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.940
 I leave in the description is entering 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.450
 Well, here everything is going to come 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.860
 coming as the monkey that and here 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.950
 Well when they have to click on 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.370
 download mediafire this is simply 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.600
 the goal and useful is basically the goal and 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.360
 useful if necessary for it to work 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.769
 the short pedestal is like something that 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.230
 added to the mode clear then so 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.730
 we are going here in download some that we 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.370
 Send mediafire and list as we have 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.470
 the goal came back and useful simply because 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.330
 we got him down here there will be a few 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.340
 images as you can see there can 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.130
 make state altars there with the 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.560
 sword I do not know what they want then you can 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.600
 We went down and here you will be well now 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.450
 the way you can see there is 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.950
 let's do here mediafire again and 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.709
 now if the short pedestal is like 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.780
 you can see let's go download and ready to 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.390
 this way since it will remain then 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.980
 downloaded the sun pedestal now 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.290
 just as you can see here it 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.120
 remember minecraft for tibet hit and 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.520
 useful then we need minecraft 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.780
 force we entered the second forum that 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.010
 I leave in the description that this one 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.010
 we give in the says releases 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.220
 let's wait for it to open 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.039
 and you will always always have 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.720
 that download the first the first 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.130
 downloading the one that is up is 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.660
 which will have to download since 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.880
 is going to be the most recent and the one 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.770
 updated to the whole not then 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.500
 make sure you download the first one that is 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.870
 in this case it is this I give click 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.680
 let's wait for this page to open and 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.050
 Now we just look for the one that says 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.720
 universal as you can see here the one 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.400
 says beats is universal I recommend the 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.530
 that you want this because it's going to 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.000
 give the recommended universal and we 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.240
 will send us to the beaches 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.550
 we hope five are two advertising 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.419
 and we're going to have to give here you can 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.319
 jump advertising that way 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.479
 it has already been downloaded automatically 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.669
 force and now we can install it 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.500
 our module then what are we going to 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.150
 do is put all the files at 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.210
 Desktop to install better 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.800
 in this way and then there are people who 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.650
 have problems with the minecraft force 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.509
 then just so good we 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.599
 let's go first start percent app 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.610
 data percent on each side gives them 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:50.130
 appears to run for the windows xp 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.099
 and we 're going roaming then 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.169
 we're just going to minecraft point 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:57.599
 admin minecraft right click to open with 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.130
 windows archi see here deleted the 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.360
 folder men times that are uppercase 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.460
 we select it we are going to eliminate the 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.770
 come on that if we minimize the folder well 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.389
 we will need it later and good 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.190
 now we are going to install first the 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.560
 minecraft force 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.880
 ok let's open minecraft after 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.770
 install it so they see that everything 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.880
 it works perfect what we have to 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.170
 do is select all the files 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.610
 that inside of minecraft force and 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.400
 also pass them to the bottom jar of this 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.139
 way and we will accept it 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.460
 and list is the sleeve forza now 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.289
 we close everything 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.400
 now we open minecraft to prove that 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.580
 minecraft force well it's fine 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.580
 installed 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.430
 and how do you see that is the minecraft 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.900
 that is added as that bar when loading and 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.610
 the minecraft works automatically 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.099
 force now if we close minecraft 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.919
 we open percent silver percent 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:47.650
 again we're going to minecraft point 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:50.139
 here there will be a mods folder if it is not 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.150
 because he believes in it and since he believes in that 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.009
 folder simply open it and 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.800
 inside they are going to put the pedestal sun and the 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:59.620
 goal and useful in this way nothing more than 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.180
 we drag file zip and ready then if 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.650
 you want to get in then it starts 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.659
 point again they will notice that there 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.759
 a new meta folder and this folder 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:08.650
 meta inf is a folder that comes inside 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:10.779
 of the minecraft force as you can see there 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.029
 is then that is not going to eliminate 

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:14.139
 navas are going to eliminate the first and ready 

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:16.720
 let's open minecraft to see 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:20.130
 that everything is working perfect 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.130
 that there is no problem 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.160
 now we create a world in creative super 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.160
 flat 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:32.660
 and I'm just going to show you that everything 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:35.540
 it's perfect, we're not going to see them 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.310
 As you can see, the pedestal is already
