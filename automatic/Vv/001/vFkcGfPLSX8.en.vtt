here is actually sometimes installers

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.000 
here is actually sometimes installers
will<00:00:31.480> put<00:00:31.630> a<00:00:31.660> different<00:00:32.079> board<00:00:32.469> in<00:00:32.770> there

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
will put a different board in there

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.030 
will put a different board in there
different<00:00:33.460> model<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.410> cabinet<00:00:35.860> so

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.280 
different model in the cabinet so
actually<00:00:36.370> when<00:00:36.489> I<00:00:36.610> look<00:00:36.760> at<00:00:36.880> mine<00:00:37.090> I<00:00:37.450> can<00:00:38.110> see

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
actually when I look at mine I can see

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.600 
actually when I look at mine I can see
actually<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.710> model<00:00:38.890> is<00:00:39.220> going<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.460> be

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
actually the model is going to be

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.630 
actually the model is going to be
something<00:00:39.940> different<00:00:40.420> it's<00:00:40.540> a<00:00:40.600> PC<00:00:40.989> 1832<00:00:41.980> but

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
something different it's a PC 1832 but

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.310 
something different it's a PC 1832 but
most<00:00:42.820> of<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.060> DSC<00:00:43.510> alarm<00:00:43.750> systems<00:00:44.110> use<00:00:44.290> the

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
most of the DSC alarm systems use the

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.920 
most of the DSC alarm systems use the
same<00:00:44.649> kind<00:00:44.860> of<00:00:44.920> battery<00:00:45.280> and<00:00:45.399> that's<00:00:45.579> this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
same kind of battery and that's this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.770 
same kind of battery and that's this
lead-acid<00:00:46.930> 12<00:00:47.739> volt<00:00:48.120> anywhere<00:00:49.120> from<00:00:49.239> 7<00:00:49.630> to<00:00:49.750> 9

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
lead-acid 12 volt anywhere from 7 to 9

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.799 
lead-acid 12 volt anywhere from 7 to 9
amp<00:00:50.320> hour<00:00:50.500> battery<00:00:51.450> so<00:00:52.450> what<00:00:52.570> we're<00:00:52.660> going<00:00:52.750> to

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
amp hour battery so what we're going to

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.660 
amp hour battery so what we're going to
do<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.050> take<00:00:53.200> this<00:00:53.380> out<00:00:53.590> today<00:00:53.920> it's<00:00:54.460> really

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
do to take this out today it's really

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.950 
do to take this out today it's really
simple<00:00:54.969> you<00:00:55.149> actually<00:00:55.420> don't<00:00:55.600> really<00:00:55.840> need

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
simple you actually don't really need

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.260 
simple you actually don't really need
any<00:00:56.140> tools<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.710> speak<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.219> we're<00:00:58.090> going<00:00:58.210> to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
any tools to speak of we're going to

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.910 
any tools to speak of we're going to
start<00:00:58.510> off<00:00:58.630> by<00:00:58.660> disconnecting<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.559> molex

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
start off by disconnecting the molex

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.530 
start off by disconnecting the molex
connector<00:01:00.370> here<00:01:00.579> this<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:00.910> a<00:01:00.940> 2<00:01:01.149> pin<00:01:01.390> molex

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
connector here this is a 2 pin molex

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.299 
connector here this is a 2 pin molex
connector<00:01:02.230> make<00:01:02.440> sure<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.680> power<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:02.980> off<00:01:03.100> by

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
connector make sure the power is off by

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.120 
connector make sure the power is off by
the<00:01:03.370> way<00:01:03.550> and<00:01:03.960> really<00:01:04.960> online<00:01:05.409> yours<00:01:05.920> may<00:01:06.100> be

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
the way and really online yours may be

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.709 
the way and really online yours may be
clipped<00:01:06.490> in<00:01:06.640> but<00:01:06.850> mine<00:01:07.000> really<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.390> batteries

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
clipped in but mine really the batteries

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:09.389 
clipped in but mine really the batteries
just<00:01:07.780> sitting<00:01:08.170> here<00:01:08.289> inside<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.740> cabinet<00:01:09.100> so

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399
