00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.560
 hey here is florian friedrich from 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.119
 florian fun lessons in my 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.199
 I had walking bass video number one 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.569
 you of the different possibilities 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.029
 tells of a walking bass 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.949
 line is built in this video wants 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.749
 I like to handle the scales he 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.489
 and the great exercises show like that 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.679
 scale in your walking line 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.390
 maybe you can integrate yourself 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.129
 I already did not remind you of one 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.660
 such a good sounding example shown 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.820
 and I did that quite deliberately 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.829
 so that you think yourself but 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.329
 somehow, the scales have to be 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.730
 also listen well how can I get that 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.769
 and so you yourself on the search for 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.269
 I want new possibilities gest 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.519
 not everything before hardly 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.530
 you learn a lot more and much better when 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.570
 you find out yourself I find 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.730
 join in and make sure that 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.210
 you get on the right track so 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.129
 scale I had you playing before like 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.140
 It sounds like you are just the first 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.390
 four tones of a scale or the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.579
 scale of the respective chords plays 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.259
 and in many cases you end up with the 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.409
 last note in tact already on the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.060
 Ground tone of the next cord and the 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.579
 Does not sound so good or better 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.810
 not so fluid because of this note 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.110
 then I play it twice 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 time ago 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.770
 the trick is there and that is now 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.540
 very important, he realizes that too calm 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.550
 for other styles of trick 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.310
 it is that you are in a rhythm or 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.160
 a clock actually on the 4 already 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.900
 give where you want to go you get up 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.480
 the four of a pact mostly one 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.530
 Stress or plaster by doing a sorrow 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.210
 where it goes 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.080
 often you play at the place to 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.080
 for example a quint 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.320
 or the bottom second as sorry 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.860
 depending on where you want to go and that's why 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.870
 it unfavorable if you already on the sound 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.940
 Country you want to go to, if you like 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.710
 scale ladders in your walking bass line 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.280
 then take care that you 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.170
 as possible to the next accord hinspiels 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.240
 because then a walking line gets 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.400
 the right drive and for the listener 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.590
 and his fellow musicians will do the song a lot 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.180
 more clearly if you use scales 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.800
 is still a thing very much 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.930
 important the key 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.040
 we take again as autumn leaves 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.990
 example song I have up here 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.180
 again it is in e minor 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.920
 Just play the e 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.230
 minor scale through the whole song 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.320
 no matter which chords you catch 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.420
 on the bottom of the page, playing 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.420
 just up to the top and back again 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.829
 hooton 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.130
 and so on you realize that most 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.890
 sounds fit but I am now about 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.780
 the tones find that do not fit so well 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.180
 at the point out why it's funny 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.100
 sounds look at the chord playing 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.750
 the scale or the apache of the accord 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.470
 and compare that to the note 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.690
 was funny 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.920
 In this way you do not just train 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.080
 again your hearing but you catch 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.790
 now on the scales so the scale 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.250
 to bring in the harmonious context 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.480
 and we were able to help a short time 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.610
 I feel like a bit weird 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.190
 example up here the d played though 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.600
 in the chord schema a b7 account is 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.780
 and that does not actually contain a de 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.730
 but a disco or a dominant 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.530
 court is so I have the waltons over 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.880
 played this dominant chord and that 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.880
 is not so very right so on 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.230
 try to take care of such places 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.790
 what you're playing or singing 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.920
 inwardly together 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.299
 and then if you play by then then 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.370
 you will probably intuit that 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.380
 right ones make a cool thing 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.870
 is that anger in our example here 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.760
 the playing down of scales better 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.680
 works as the play 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.780
 this is because the chord 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.980
 connection in quartens go up so a 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:38.250
 minor 7d 7 gamer seven and ten manager 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.560
 7 play from the high a of seven 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.900
 on 14 14 bund on the opposite side 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.230
 Just follow the e minor 7 scale 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.230
 below 

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:02.719
 and you see you always land well 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.279
 sounding sounds also try if 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.050
 that works if you are from others 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:10.419
 for example, from notes 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.419
 high c so the terz of 07 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.490
 in the pdf are again a few exercises 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.809
 and with scales to what the words 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.279
 I'm talking to you about sounds 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:23.599
 called some interesting examples 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.460
 it will be interesting if 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.059
 they sound within a song 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.339
 to change 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:30.469
 the song all the things you are is the 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:32.119
 for example so that you can do anything 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.589
 again for free on florian fun 

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:35.360
 teaching point de downloads 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.860
 I'll be right for the news letter
