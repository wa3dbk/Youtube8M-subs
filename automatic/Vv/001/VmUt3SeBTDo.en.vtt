00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.240
 welcome to the next 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.809
 edition video game myths like pasta 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.269
 punch I'll start again with the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.880
 I am five minutes of playing for this 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.230
 have chosen and become you 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.740
 again say if they are true or false 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.630
 are 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.170
 have fun gta 3 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.330
 ghost town grand theft auto is one thing 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.140
 the most successful video game series this 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.289
 ever gave 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.130
 but in the 2001 published litter 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.610
 gta 3 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.170
 there should be a ghost town 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.870
 mostly under the term ghost room 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.000
 Well-known one only reaches it with 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.850
 a special plane in the cathedral 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.820
 It can only be over in a small spot 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.270
 the sea and fly out 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.710
 to be reached one finds the one comes 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.579
 a teaching takes place 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.590
 It has skyscrapers for purposes 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.210
 billboard by searchers no cars 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.859
 long 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.600
 some thought it was just a question 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.930
 graphic error but there was such a city 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.330
 ghost town real gr 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.640
 this myth was the city where sound 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.250
 However, there was this city 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.189
 created for the trailer to gta 3 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.680
 The filmmaker creates this city far 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.930
 outside the normal gta 3 terrain 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.479
 and no one would ever find her 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.159
 and that's why they let in the game and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.370
 No further effort was made 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.320
 hide or destroy 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:40.100
 So this myth was ghost town 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:43.380
 exists pokémon leo xiii 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.990
 this myth he created in the new 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.840
 pokémon edition 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.820
 most of which is pokémon coc with ruby 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.000
 sapphire or emerald fiery red or 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.860
 leaf green associated it should 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.860
 have supernatural powers and 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.260
 his opponents should be incredibly strong 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.160
 killing as a treasure chest and fighting 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.470
 but make the rumors about the 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.890
 spoken are so diverse incredibly 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.680
 was there really this program 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.470
 there is not even this pokémon it would be 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.150
 also not very logical from the makers 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.880
 a pokémon to develop something easy 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.890
 every other pokemon conquers the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.290
 game maker so from nintendo 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.210
 reacted immediately and said that this 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.110
 pokémon never gave and will never give 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.510
 some room manufacturers so of 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.820
 rushed version pokémons have this 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.100
 pokémon reingebracht and therefore it is 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.880
 currently available and videos on 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.080
 youtube gives 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.780
 however, this pokémon was there 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:52.860
 usually in pokémon never second life 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:56.100
 the cornfield in second life online 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.070
 3d infrastructure game at the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.110
 registered users in the form of avatar 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.060
 there are the 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.260
 possibility of virtual worlds too 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.220
 create 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.599
 there will be buildings or entire cities 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.480
 identical to the virtual will be after 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.189
 chosen by the real world 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.260
 it's unbelievably big thing you 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.000
 can build 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.920
 but if you look at the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.560
 rules that the game pretends to be online 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.040
 you can not just kicked or warned 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.200
 become 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.129
 There is still something else 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.720
 one should not be more spacious 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.099
 stick to the rules and really against 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.810
 all rules are violated 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:39.120
 this is how you get the cornfield into the confectionery 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.470
 is a huge field just take one 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.129
 shining screen and one 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.190
 scarecrow stands around a rum only 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.079
 cereals you come from this 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.440
 Cornfield that only a certain size 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.420
 did not get out but did this exist 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.109
 Kornfeld a player forever in it 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.290
 in fact, this story captured 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.000
 is actually true as a developer 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.370
 have actually made such a way 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.180
 and really bad players too 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.010
 punish 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.250
 they should never come out again 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.090
 as a kind of prison see what you for 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.440
 Best of her life in the game held there 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.269
 so far we did not know that 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.560
 really needs to do everything around in 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.690
 to land in this environment 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.060
 but it is already registered ten 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.870
 players enter the field in this field 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.610
 have landed 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:34.320
 the cornfield exists super smash 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.479
 brothers sunny and tales the awesome 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.940
 smash brothers parts are very well known 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.039
 Miele became 2001 for gamecube 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.080
 published and was at seven 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.710
 millions sold that copy 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.479
 most successful game on this console 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.620
 many nintendo characters were there 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:55.590
 like browser curry or pokémon figures 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.229
 but there are two characters to give the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.900
 you did not usually want to reach 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.419
 could not unlock namely sunny 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.419
 and two players from the winner 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.840
 row there were sunny and tales in the 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.840
 actually it was supposed to play 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.940
 Free yourself by special 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.750
 mission does no harm in the 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.820
 single levels get but sunny and 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.630
 Never lose your temper in this game 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.449
 playable 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.280
 This was a myth of some makers 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.800
 Just to allow a picture 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.900
 many wanted many players worldwide 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.500
 have tried sonic hotels 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.270
 to play that off have failed 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.699
 nintendo then brought the 2003 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.580
 explanations out no sunny and tales 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.800
 never existed because they did not exist then 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.090
 with sega had agreed if she 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:52.160
 want to bring in something that means 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.960
 So sunny and there was never there 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.570
 street fighter 2 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.300
 cheng long it's called street 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.780
 fighter a special final opponent waiting 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.139
 would 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.080
 namely cheng long you should him 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:09.080
 By reaching all the opponents of the wall 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.400
 Street Fighter waiting in the campaign 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.710
 simply defeated without harm at all 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.520
 to get something scary of course 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.820
 hard and the last opponents 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.520
 proven 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.919
 one should endure over ten rounds 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.160
 have to be met without once 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:28.500
 and then you should kill him 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.169
 but no player could spend that 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.610
 but is there really the means by there 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.710
 is cheng long 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.650
 this nonsense it was a 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.930
 Aprilscherz the editors of 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.120
 American game magazine GM 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.360
 She wanted to give this rumor to the world 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.370
 set because in the game there is use 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.500
 this sentence is massive Hashchenko 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.930
 decide Russia 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.090
 But that was not a secret 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.870
 boss opponents meant but only 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:00.509
 pure special attacks cheng long which 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.870
 later translated as dragon punch 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:05.099
 the american game magazine 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.110
 Manufacturers thought that that one 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:09.750
 Good joke is and made him 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.539
 many players tried in vain 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.639
 this is called league to reach and say 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:19.740
 posted when it came out that it was all 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:22.979
 Men broke Chenglong never did it well 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:26.610
 Those were the rents for this week me 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:28.259
