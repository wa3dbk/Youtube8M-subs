00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
horizon is an imaginary line well we had

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.530 
horizon is an imaginary line well we had
it<00:04:13.859> before<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.430> didn't<00:04:14.699> nobody<00:04:14.819> cut<00:04:15.120> well<00:04:15.359> one

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
it before you didn't nobody cut well one

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.550 
it before you didn't nobody cut well one
person<00:04:15.750> guy<00:04:16.049> tried

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
horizon is in the measuring line yes the

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.420 
horizon is in the measuring line yes the
question<00:04:18.599> is<00:04:18.870> what<00:04:19.109> imaginary<00:04:19.620> line<00:04:19.889> yeah

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
question is what imaginary line yeah

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.370 
question is what imaginary line yeah
well<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.760> horizon<00:04:21.090> this<00:04:21.209> one<00:04:21.359> yeah

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
well the horizon this one yeah

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.840 
well the horizon this one yeah
that's<00:04:22.620> not<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.860> answer<00:04:22.890> though<00:04:23.220> is<00:04:23.610> still

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
that's not the answer though is still

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.490 
that's not the answer though is still
wrong<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.540> lies<00:04:24.690> 100<00:04:25.080> injuries<00:04:25.290> because

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
wrong and it lies 100 injuries because
