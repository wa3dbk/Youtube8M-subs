really good so I bought a 9.6 for this

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.390 
really good so I bought a 9.6 for this
and<00:01:20.670> i<00:01:21.270> also<00:01:21.299> bought<00:01:21.689> an<00:01:21.840> extra<00:01:22.170> mag<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:23.220> i

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and i also bought an extra mag which i

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.050 
and i also bought an extra mag which i
completely<00:01:23.580> suggest<00:01:24.540> buying<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.990> mag<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
completely suggest buying this mag it's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.319 
completely suggest buying this mag it's
i<00:01:27.060> think<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.360> hundred<00:01:27.600> babies<00:01:28.790> but<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> winds

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
i think a hundred babies but it winds

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.569 
i think a hundred babies but it winds
itself<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.200> automatically<00:01:32.189> feeds<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
itself so it automatically feeds and

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.280 
itself so it automatically feeds and
okay<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.640> obviously<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.780> your<00:01:36.960> firing

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
okay so obviously you have your firing

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.649 
okay so obviously you have your firing
you<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.740> safe<00:01:39.049> semi-auto<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:41.659> that's

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you have safe semi-auto and that's

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.649 
you have safe semi-auto and that's
that's<00:01:43.049> always<00:01:43.380> good<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:45.060> pretty<00:01:45.420> much

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that's always good and so pretty much

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.020

great gun for a beginner it really is
consistent<00:03:14.230> in<00:03:14.320> battles<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.340> could<00:03:15.520> take

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
consistent in battles and you could take

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.960 
consistent in battles and you could take
this<00:03:15.880> anywhere<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.510> professional<00:03:17.080> fields<00:03:17.560> and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
this anywhere to professional fields and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.710 
this anywhere to professional fields and
still<00:03:18.970> be<00:03:19.090> fine<00:03:20.910> there<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:22.000> go<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.180> markings

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
still be fine there you go to markings

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.199 
still be fine there you go to markings
and<00:03:23.050> yet<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.600> if<00:03:25.600> you<00:03:25.900> don't<00:03:26.080> have<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.410> 9.6<00:03:27.340> it'll

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
and yet so if you don't have a 9.6 it'll

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:36.540 
and yet so if you don't have a 9.6 it'll
be<00:03:28.300> fine<00:03:28.540> because<00:03:29.940> here

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.440 

I'm<00:03:37.550> taking<00:03:38.390> off<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:39.610> battery<00:03:40.610> top<00:03:41.060> right<00:03:41.300> now

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
I'm taking off the battery top right now

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.700 
I'm taking off the battery top right now
here<00:03:44.450> we<00:03:44.570> go<00:03:44.690> so<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.680> battery<00:03:46.040> it's<00:03:46.850> just<00:03:47.710> the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
here we go so the battery it's just the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.010 
here we go so the battery it's just the
back<00:03:49.130> fits<00:03:49.700> in<00:03:49.850> like<00:03:49.880> this<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.450> then<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:50.840> pop

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
back fits in like this and then you pop

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.949 
back fits in like this and then you pop
it<00:03:51.230> out<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:52.390> then<00:03:53.390> so<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.320> take<00:03:54.560> this<00:03:54.740> off<00:03:54.950> and

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
it out and then so you take this off and

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.170 
it out and then so you take this off and
here's<00:03:56.959> your<00:03:57.080> battery<00:03:57.500> so<00:03:58.340> honestly<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:59.030> can

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
here's your battery so honestly it can

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.960 
here's your battery so honestly it can
be<00:03:59.300> almost<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.930> lot<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:01.250> can<00:04:01.400> be<00:04:01.520> a<00:04:01.550> lot<00:04:01.910> of

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
be almost a lot it can be a lot of

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.900 
be almost a lot it can be a lot of
batteries<00:04:02.480> I'm<00:04:02.740> pretty<00:04:03.740> sure<00:04:03.980> 9.6<00:04:04.670> is<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
batteries I'm pretty sure 9.6 is the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.570 
batteries I'm pretty sure 9.6 is the
highest<00:04:05.270> i've<00:04:05.990> yet<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.500> test<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:06.980> 10<00:04:08.020> but<00:04:09.580> you

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
highest i've yet to test the 10 but you

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.940 
highest i've yet to test the 10 but you
can<00:04:10.760> go<00:04:10.910> 8.4<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:11.930> it'll<00:04:12.140> still<00:04:12.500> be<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.680> great

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
can go 8.4 and it'll still be a great

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.240 
can go 8.4 and it'll still be a great
gun<00:04:13.270> um<00:04:14.270> I<00:04:15.020> would<00:04:15.140> say<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.440> FPS<00:04:15.860> is<00:04:16.070> right

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
gun um I would say the FPS is right

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.759 
gun um I would say the FPS is right
around<00:04:16.780> 300<00:04:18.370> 310<00:04:19.750> but<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.959> can<00:04:21.049> also<00:04:21.140> drop<00:04:21.560> if

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
around 300 310 but it can also drop if

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.820 
around 300 310 but it can also drop if
you're<00:04:21.919> using<00:04:22.160> like<00:04:23.710> 2.4<00:04:24.710> since<00:04:25.100> 2.8<00:04:26.620> but<00:04:27.620> with

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
you're using like 2.4 since 2.8 but with

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.120 
you're using like 2.4 since 2.8 but with
a<00:04:27.860> 2.2<00:04:28.400> you're<00:04:28.550> fully<00:04:28.790> charged<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.560> i<00:04:30.560> would<00:04:30.950> say

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
a 2.2 you're fully charged I i would say

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.050 
a 2.2 you're fully charged I i would say
you<00:04:31.190> can<00:04:31.400> get<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:31.669> up<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.850> 3<00:04:33.700> so<00:04:34.700> you<00:04:34.820> had<00:04:34.910> to

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
you can get it up to 3 so you had to

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.680 
you can get it up to 3 so you had to
consist<00:04:35.450> of<00:04:35.570> gone<00:04:36.070> it's<00:04:37.690> aesthetically
