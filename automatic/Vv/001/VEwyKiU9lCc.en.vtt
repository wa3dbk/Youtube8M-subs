my<00:00:48.000> last<00:00:48.210> videos<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.870> think<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.710> was<00:00:49.980> working<00:00:50.399> on

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
my last videos I think I was working on

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.819 
my last videos I think I was working on
this<00:00:50.670> area<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.600> both<00:00:51.809> sides<00:00:52.110> replacing

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
this area here on both sides replacing

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
this area here on both sides replacing
the<00:00:52.890> metal<00:00:53.190> underneath<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.760> brace<00:00:54.210> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the metal underneath this brace this

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.400 
the metal underneath this brace this
guess<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.850> that's<00:00:56.850> been<00:00:57.120> taken<00:00:57.510> care<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
guess it that's been taken care of and I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.880 
guess it that's been taken care of and I
guess<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.770> been<00:00:58.890> reinstalled

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
guess it's been reinstalled

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.410 
guess it's been reinstalled

all that metal away from there and that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690 
all that metal away from there and that
was<00:01:18.750> had<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.110> welded<00:01:19.409> back<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:20.009> built<00:01:20.490> back

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
was had to be welded back up built back

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.390 
was had to be welded back up built back
up<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:22.049> then<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.259> squared<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:22.890> back<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
up and then I squared it all back out I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.740 
up and then I squared it all back out I
did<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> same<00:01:24.000> thing<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> other<00:01:24.540> side

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
did the same thing to the other side

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.190 
did the same thing to the other side
only<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> severe<00:01:29.869> replace<00:01:30.869> these

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
only it was not a severe replace these

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.319 
only it was not a severe replace these
angles<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> top<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.939> they've<00:01:33.150> been

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
angles for the top because they've been

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.210 
angles for the top because they've been
cut<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> welded<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:34.740> went<00:01:34.950> ahead<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
cut and welded on so we went ahead and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.550 
cut and welded on so we went ahead and
replaced<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.729> let's<00:01:36.180> go<00:01:36.390> there's<00:01:36.900> actually

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
replaced that let's go there's actually

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.710 
replaced that let's go there's actually
a<00:01:37.590> piece<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.950> wood<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> go<00:01:38.340> from<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.600> this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
a piece of wood to go from here for this

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.929 
a piece of wood to go from here for this
one<00:01:39.900> back<00:01:40.110> here<00:01:41.810> I'm<00:01:42.810> replacing<00:01:43.229> those<00:01:43.939> with

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
one back here I'm replacing those with

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.030 
one back here I'm replacing those with
these<00:01:45.119> bars<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> B<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.740> notice

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
these bars here and B if you notice

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.560 
these bars here and B if you notice
they've<00:01:47.220> been<00:01:47.369> cut

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.990 

I<00:01:50.600> cut<00:01:51.469> him<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.890> clamp<00:01:52.310> them<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.609> the<00:01:52.670> top

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
I cut him and I clamp them to the top

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.940 
I cut him and I clamp them to the top
edge<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.390> door<00:01:53.719> andrey<00:01:54.469> welded<00:01:54.859> them

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
edge of the door andrey welded them

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.120 
edge of the door andrey welded them
again<00:01:56.049> so<00:01:57.049> they<00:01:57.200> should<00:01:57.409> be<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.530> perfect<00:01:57.950> match

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
again so they should be a perfect match

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.340 
again so they should be a perfect match
at<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.460> top<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:58.880> door<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.479> that's<00:01:59.750> kind

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
at the top of the door and that's kind

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.219 
at the top of the door and that's kind
of<00:02:00.380> what<00:02:00.530> i'm<00:02:00.619> going<00:02:00.859> going<00:02:01.520> for<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.049> top

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
of what i'm going going for so the top

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.440 
of what i'm going going for so the top
edge<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.649> door<00:02:03.890> will<00:02:04.189> match<00:02:04.819> up<00:02:04.850> with<00:02:05.270> this

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
edge of the door will match up with this

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.449
