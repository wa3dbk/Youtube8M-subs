looks<00:03:31.140> like<00:03:31.379> so<00:03:31.819> just<00:03:32.840> go<00:03:33.840> from<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.409> and<00:03:35.720> then

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
looks like so just go from that and then

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.759 
looks like so just go from that and then
you're<00:03:36.810> going<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:36.959> take<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.109> last<00:03:37.349> ball<00:03:37.590> and

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
you're going to take the last ball and

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.319 
you're going to take the last ball and
just<00:03:37.889> kind<00:03:38.129> of<00:03:38.159> like<00:03:38.310> flatten<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.909> top<00:03:39.150> in

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
just kind of like flatten it on top in

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.750 
just kind of like flatten it on top in
the<00:03:39.420> middle<00:03:39.659> of<00:03:39.810> those<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.680> then<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.579> can<00:03:41.670> go

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
the middle of those and then you can go

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.210 
the middle of those and then you can go
ahead<00:03:41.879> and<00:03:42.000> put<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.239> on<00:03:42.540> your<00:03:42.690> hello<00:03:42.930> kitty

the frosting that we made then go ahead

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.339
