00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 and my closet 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 the kite models mode the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.179
 today the theme of the way 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.920
 any woman with seek seek was 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.380
 any woman any body type 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 but it is always advisable to talk about 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.740
 when they are shorter, they do not use 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.570
 bucaneras work because because no 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 we want to see more high and authenticity 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.820
 therefore occupy a buccaneer of 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.740
 high contact always when we talk 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.960
 when we are when they are shorter and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.460
 with the longer world always use a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.880
 detail that they did not name it use 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.520
 always a jeans or an ins tight law 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.300
 black as the egg like me when you 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.300
 you are like this 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.460
 the difference of mind the book sands 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.309
 with different tacos here we have with this 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.800
 taco that is like with platform with rubber 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.350
 that holds very comfortable foot very well 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.780
 eye that is very important also looks 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.940
 Comfortable is super as always when 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.859
 we talk about buccaneer is about the knee 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.989
 when they are not on the knee they are not 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.019
 They look for what a maxi and boot is 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.119
 then we could call it 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.530
 like these when they are at the knees two 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.740
 centimeters of the knees can 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.259
 people use it in lower than 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.880
 that the bucaneras are really up 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.369
 of the knees you look at you have you 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.750
 had a breath of air and there it is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.610
 what you recommend for which we are 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.950
 shorter calls of the short call when 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.079
 the lowest clear with a heel to bucanera 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.959
 with high cue never with a low cue 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.360
 because obviously it makes us cut ourselves and 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:32.520
 see just shorter it did not come out let's throw it 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.259
 stylize true with up can you move 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.209
 the model also with a black boot 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.670
 it's always important as the 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:41.009
 that when they are low they never put on a 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.439
 jeans of another color because what it does 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.619
 is shorten to put on a jeans like a 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.500
 laws of black pants in Tokyo 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.569
 do is lengthen the clear because here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.130
 we have the clear good cut hugs to 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.950
 everyone for that very reason cuts a lot is very 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.719
 optically visible that you leave that makes 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.990
 that's what this boot does 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.000
 bucanera 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.340
 above the knee will lengthen what 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.290
 can occupy a higher pillar person 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.600
 and the bucaneras is for example the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.610
 we can use to paste for a meal 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.020
 because they are elegant but 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.970
 also a postcard with jeans the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.890
 buccaneers day and night obviously 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.990
 depending on the occasion if we have 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.310
 something important obviously that we are going to 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.230
 go with tacos always always by 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.670
 excellence and by berna obviously more 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.040
 use those that are a little bit more 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.740
 interview flesh or have the eye angle 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.230
 also when they are thighs wide 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.050
 occupy a well stylized buccane well 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.020
 tight to the knee as it is brown or 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.950
 tighter life than the bee here 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.540
 here we are seeing a very warm 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.150
 also coffees that can combine 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.760
 also with a skirt with skirt and 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.920
 different colors that can occupy if 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.890
 well obviously the short buccaneer 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.930
 Visibly short, that's why he has 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:58.490
 to be adjusting their tensions 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:01.640
 if I am thick-legged much more 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.640
 much more 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.810
 look here the bbc put a 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.209
 of taco bajo that is now more than more 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.269
 looking for are boots because the bucanera 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.390
 let's talk about the one on the boot above the 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.390
 knee 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:27.430
 if I want to contact and down some 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.500
 black socks 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.879
 for the figure I want because one always 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.159
 is not I do not like the look was 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.900
 because I'm short those myths the street 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.819
 we can also body type can 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.620
 use bucaneras depending on the 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.689
 clothes that you wear because you eye that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.939
 visually he's going to cut them for that 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.620
 I teach them to put some laws 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.169
 or a black pants that will lengthen you 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.060
 and a buccaneer that is two centimeters 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.560
 above the knee of the short girls is 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.299
 two centimeters above the knee at 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.310
 get here alone mix or there's one that 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.689
 be up two centimeters no I do not know 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.269
 over the knee twice can 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.950
 occupy the tall and the thinnest ones and what 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.159
 same and for example we can abuse with 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.990
 with long back you can observe little 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.090
 obviously they will release it 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.980
 as there will be all kinds of occasions and therefore 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.430
 As I told you, it can be occupied during the day or 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.560
 at night 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.570
 Now it's different when we can 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.430
 occupy with a short dress and the mouth 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.460
 and the long I think not to go over 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.370
 the limits always have to be something 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:27.320
 subtle today in two things first that no 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.970
 is writing to people on twitter and 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.620
 there is one thing because you what 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.210
 they found that they were very expensive because 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.250
 Of course, this is not what we started with 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.080
 honey and they are expensive but they are those can 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.860
 find some relationships achieved not 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:45.530
 I will find the pattern to look for 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.240
 also the buccaneer comes in saron is 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.100
 good to see in different varieties of 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.080
 colors we have it from the muse of also 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.510
 It's suede with leather with applications 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.110
 leather in which pretty from the duck 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.550
 area of how happy they are as always 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.110
 you have to look for comfort 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.670
 also what the commode said here 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:06.080
 we can see in different versions of 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.910
 tacos that this one is as high but to the 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.020
 time it's not in a cue stick what is not 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.020
 it bothers you like old age 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:23.950
 in this way because people also 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.540
 in mind that the buccaneer almost like 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.990
 they sense they are like 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.840
 pretty woman so this comes from the 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.850
 2010 2011 either is not that the boom now 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.070
 of the woman has always existed the theme 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.510
 of the house that we do not dare 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.310
 to occupy them look for ice cream because 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.150
 they really impose is to continue in fashion 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.790
 We are still fashionable but if not 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.860
 we keep a short skirt not too 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.140
 way is that if you can occupy it but 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.720
 but always using and knowing how to combine 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.610
 the clothes because it meant if not to pass 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.030
 over the limit so I say if it's very 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.010
 high the boot and a very short mini it 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.830
 is going to see a bit they say that malice go 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:06.090
 to later now I always keep that very 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.090
 important the worrying attitude 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.430
 because the ways although it calls a lot 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.530
 the attention is a boot over the knee 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.010
 which is very impressive then you have to 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.890
 be with the attitude to look at what you 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.020
 asked with backs is super good if 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.700
 we dare not use the mini but 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.770
 Look how pretty is they see you with skirts 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.390
 but it still covers a little but the cut 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.040
 it makes you that area 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.170
 clear a plant with your hands that you're 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.440
 with the mallet so low and now go to isabel 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.180
 the buccaneer but as I said, I think 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.610
 that goes for a comfort issue too 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.170
 that is, here she does with a back and does not 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.850
 is going to see if it's going to cut or going to 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.650
 lengthen the leg then in this case 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.230
 you can occupy a tall person a 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.150
 person lowers the logic of alumina now 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.700
 what is important as we talk about the 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.490
 attitude know who minutes to use it 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.830
 If it's a day, a little landa, another heel 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.170
 planito when they are skinny and more 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.210
 High recommended for haitã el taco 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:03.050
 flat with the vaquitas recommended a 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.050
 high cue 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:10.160
 with us 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.160
 thank you very much
