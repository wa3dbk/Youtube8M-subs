00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
so this is my 29 gallon biocube we are

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.160 
so this is my 29 gallon biocube we are
at<00:00:04.650> week<00:00:05.069> two<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.910> half<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.359> guess<00:00:06.569> we'll

snow<00:01:31.610> um<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.060> think<00:01:33.149> I<00:01:33.540> got<00:01:33.750> about<00:01:34.229> 10<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.100> these

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
snow um I think I got about 10 and these

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.020 
snow um I think I got about 10 and these
are<00:01:36.149> the<00:01:36.300> eight<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:37.220> managed<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.369> find<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
are the eight that managed to find on

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.969 
are the eight that managed to find on
the<00:01:39.300> live<00:01:39.479> rock<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.050> just<00:01:40.080> jumbled<00:01:40.830> them

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the live rock and I just jumbled them

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.889 
the live rock and I just jumbled them
around<00:01:41.220> together<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:42.800> fed<00:01:43.800> them<00:01:43.979> some<00:01:44.899> seaweed

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
around together I fed them some seaweed

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.060 
around together I fed them some seaweed
and<00:01:46.380> that's<00:01:46.710> what<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:48.649> middle<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:49.860> right

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
and that's what that middle thing right

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.040 
and that's what that middle thing right
there<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.729> probably<00:01:51.149> whatever<00:01:51.630> they<00:01:51.840> left

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
there is probably whatever they left

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:02.180 
there is probably whatever they left
their<00:01:59.300> I've<00:02:00.300> been<00:02:00.509> doing<00:02:00.840> tests<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:01.950> water

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
their I've been doing tests on the water

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.969 
their I've been doing tests on the water
parameters<00:02:02.520> now<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.300> salinity<00:02:04.140> right<00:02:04.530> now<00:02:04.740> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
parameters now the salinity right now is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.020 
parameters now the salinity right now is
one<00:02:05.220> point<00:02:05.429> zero<00:02:05.550> two<00:02:05.880> five<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.819> that's<00:02:08.819> where

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
one point zero two five and that's where

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.960 
one point zero two five and that's where
I<00:02:09.060> wanted<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> be<00:02:10.130> maybe<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.280> little<00:02:11.430> lower<00:02:11.640> but

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
I wanted to be maybe a little lower but

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.830 
I wanted to be maybe a little lower but
um<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.700> ammonia's<00:02:15.209> down<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.730> new<00:02:18.150> tricks<00:02:18.510> are

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
um the ammonia's down the new tricks are

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.080 
um the ammonia's down the new tricks are
down<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.560> nitrates<00:02:20.069> are<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.280> little<00:02:20.520> high<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.060> I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
down the nitrates are a little high so I

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.250 
down the nitrates are a little high so I
need<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.420> do<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.569> water<00:02:21.989> change<00:02:23.569> but<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:24.959> far<00:02:25.200> I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
need to do a water change but so far I

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.400 
need to do a water change but so far I
think<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.709> tangka<00:02:26.069> cycling<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.200> maybe<00:02:28.200> with

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
think the tangka cycling and maybe with

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.570 
think the tangka cycling and maybe with
these<00:02:28.620> extra<00:02:28.980> 10<00:02:29.190> pounds<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.550> live<00:02:29.730> rock<00:02:31.580> it'll

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
these extra 10 pounds of live rock it'll

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.250 
these extra 10 pounds of live rock it'll
make<00:02:32.610> that

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
make that

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
make that
the<00:02:34.560> cycling<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.640> filtration<00:02:36.390> faster<00:02:37.260> better

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.160 

now<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.610> live<00:02:44.819> rock<00:02:45.060> i<00:02:45.209> got<00:02:45.390> from<00:02:45.629> a<00:02:45.689> local

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170

down under they were selling it for 699

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.360 
down under they were selling it for 699
and<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.519> guess<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.849> lady<00:02:54.090> like<00:02:54.390> me<00:02:55.099> she<00:02:56.099> gave<00:02:56.310> me

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
a discount she said that uh branches

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.849 
a discount she said that uh branches
stuff<00:03:01.530> over<00:03:01.769> there<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.010> called<00:03:02.099> tonga<00:03:02.940> rock

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
stuff over there is called tonga rock

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.330 
stuff over there is called tonga rock
there's<00:03:04.859> once<00:03:05.129> a<00:03:05.340> word<00:03:05.609> and<00:03:05.939> there<00:03:07.129> he<00:03:08.129> said

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
there's once a word and there he said

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.520 
there's once a word and there he said
that<00:03:08.519> was<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:08.879> 1299<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:09.870> she<00:03:09.989> gave<00:03:10.200> me<00:03:10.230> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
that was for 1299 but she gave me the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.550 
that was for 1299 but she gave me the
699<00:03:11.250> do<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.760> guess<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:13.049> then<00:03:13.170> she<00:03:13.319> didn't

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
699 do I guess and then she didn't

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.099 
699 do I guess and then she didn't
charge<00:03:13.799> taxes<00:03:14.549> so<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.359> think<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.720> got<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> good

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
charge taxes so I think I got a good

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:24.890 
charge taxes so I think I got a good
deal<00:03:16.260> on<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.709> live<00:03:16.889> rock<00:03:21.920> how<00:03:22.920> much<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.690> have<00:03:24.690> a

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
deal on the live rock how much to have a

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.960 
deal on the live rock how much to have a
change<00:03:25.230> in<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.620> tank<00:03:25.920> yet<00:03:26.220> other<00:03:26.489> than<00:03:26.579> that

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
change in the tank yet other than that
