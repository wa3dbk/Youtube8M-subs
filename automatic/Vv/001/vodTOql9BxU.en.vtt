the end I'm going to tell you which one
I<00:00:06.420> like<00:00:06.690> in<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.200> reasons<00:00:07.560> why<00:00:07.880> this<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.120> hot

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
I like in the reasons why this is hot

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.740 
I like in the reasons why this is hot

titanium<00:00:13.200> dioxide<00:00:13.730> they're<00:00:14.730> made<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:14.940> way

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
titanium dioxide they're made that way

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.779 
titanium dioxide they're made that way
to<00:00:15.360> prevent<00:00:15.809> redness<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.470> skin<00:00:16.590> hot

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
to prevent redness on the skin hot

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.480 
to prevent redness on the skin hot
waxes<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.449> contain<00:00:18.900> Rajan's<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.529> reasons<00:00:19.859> in

order to find out whether the type of

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.609 
order to find out whether the type of
wax<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.910> choose<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.390> use<00:00:24.600> as<00:00:24.930> hot<00:00:25.170> wax<00:00:25.410> is

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
wax that you choose to use as hot wax is

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.500 
wax that you choose to use as hot wax is
biodegradable<00:00:26.460> you'd<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.029> go<00:00:27.119> back<00:00:27.330> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
biodegradable you'd have to go back to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.609 
biodegradable you'd have to go back to
the<00:00:27.599> manufacturer<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.529> ask<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.630> wax<00:00:31.349> is

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the manufacturer and ask so wax is

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.940 
the manufacturer and ask so wax is
plastic<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:32.850> melted<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.829> 113<00:00:34.829> degrees

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
plastic that when melted to 113 degrees

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.910 
plastic that when melted to 113 degrees
it<00:00:35.399> turns<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:35.910> liquid<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:37.200> waxes<00:00:37.649> are

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
it turns into liquid so waxes are

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.700 
it turns into liquid so waxes are
actually<00:00:38.550> insoluble<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.629> water<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:40.559> they<00:00:40.680> are

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
actually insoluble in water but they are

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.940 
actually insoluble in water but they are
solvable<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.760> things<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.809> such<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> clean<00:00:43.620> or

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
solvable and things like such a clean or

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.670 
solvable and things like such a clean or
dissolve<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.000> hot<00:00:45.480> 2x<00:00:45.719> generally<00:00:46.200> needs<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
dissolve it so hot 2x generally needs to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.380 
dissolve it so hot 2x generally needs to
be<00:00:46.800> used<00:00:47.070> at<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> higher<00:00:47.579> temperature<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
be used at a higher temperature so that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.049 
be used at a higher temperature so that
it<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.200> applied<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.370> cooled<00:00:50.700> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
it can be applied on and then cooled and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.590 
it can be applied on and then cooled and
then<00:00:51.270> flipped<00:00:51.660> off<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.260> removes<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> hair<00:00:53.600> so

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
then flipped off and removes the hair so

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.740 
then flipped off and removes the hair so
this<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.440> hot<00:00:55.800> wax<00:00:56.039> goes<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.610> hot<00:00:57.329> wax

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
this is how hot wax goes on hot wax

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
this is how hot wax goes on hot wax
is<00:00:57.899> put<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> spatula<00:00:58.920> normally<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
figure 8 and it has thick edges that the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.050 
figure 8 and it has thick edges that the
therapist<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.750> flick<00:01:04.229> up<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.589> edge<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.129> help

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
therapist can flick up the edge and help

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.480 
therapist can flick up the edge and help
to<00:01:06.270> remove<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.810> patch<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.280> here

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
to remove the patch you can see here

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.219 
to remove the patch you can see here
she's<00:01:08.729> testing<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> patch<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:10.080> whether

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
she's testing the patch to see whether

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
she's testing the patch to see whether
it's<00:01:10.500> dry<00:01:10.770> enough<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> wait

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it's dry enough and you do have to wait

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.320 
it's dry enough and you do have to wait
for<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> sit<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.700> flick<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.180> an

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
for it to sit and then you flick up an

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.240 
for it to sit and then you flick up an
edge<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.409> tends<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> thing<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
edge and that tends to be the thing that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
edge and that tends to be the thing that
some<00:01:17.759> clients<00:01:18.150> don't<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.630> therapists<00:01:19.530> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
some clients don't like therapists that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.590 
some clients don't like therapists that
use<00:01:19.920> hot<00:01:20.220> wax<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.790> often<00:01:21.119> use<00:01:21.150> cold

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
use hot wax can often use cold

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.330 
use hot wax can often use cold
compresses<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> hot<00:01:22.860> wax<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.310> harden

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
compresses to get the hot wax to harden

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.580 
compresses to get the hot wax to harden
to<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> state<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.479> order<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.930> pull<00:01:25.140> off<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.439> hot

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to a state in order to pull off the hot

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.039 
to a state in order to pull off the hot
wax<00:01:25.770> easily<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> cold

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
wax easily so this is what a cold

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.580 
wax easily so this is what a cold
compress<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.680> look<00:01:28.829> like<00:01:29.570> hot<00:01:30.570> wax<00:01:30.840> does<00:01:31.229> sit

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
compress can look like hot wax does sit

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.580 
compress can look like hot wax does sit
on<00:01:31.829> surfaces<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.450> pot<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.350> do

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
on surfaces and on the pot so you do

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.149 
on surfaces and on the pot so you do
have<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.799> clean<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> off<00:01:35.400> with<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.990> chemical

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
have to clean it off with a chemical

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.030 
have to clean it off with a chemical
type<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.369> dissolving<00:01:39.210> product<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.710> this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
type of dissolving product so in this

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.469 
type of dissolving product so in this
case<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.490> could<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.729> using<00:01:42.119> something<00:01:42.329> like

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
case you could be using something like

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.469 
case you could be using something like
dissolve<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.619> such<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> clean<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.270> have

dissolve it or such a clean you do have

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.389 
dissolve it or such a clean you do have
to<00:01:45.630> wear<00:01:45.810> gloves<00:01:46.200> when<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.740> clean<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.280> this

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
to wear gloves when you clean with this

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.609 
to wear gloves when you clean with this
product<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.899> don't<00:01:49.200> want<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> get<00:01:49.500> it

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.760 
just been taken out but there is no skin
sting<00:05:29.610> so<00:05:30.210> that's<00:05:30.450> why<00:05:30.600> it's<00:05:30.780> like<00:05:30.930> half<00:05:31.350> as

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770
