hose

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.540 

we<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:18.990> now<00:01:19.080> take<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.350> air<00:01:19.650> hose<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:22.550> put

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
we will now take the air hose and put

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.250 
we will now take the air hose and put
that<00:01:23.730> into<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.300> air<00:01:24.870> pump<00:01:26.090> which<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
that into the air pump which is going to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.980 
that into the air pump which is going to
be<00:01:28.380> plugged<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:31.310> as<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
be plugged in and as you can see the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.749 
be plugged in and as you can see the
bubbles<00:01:34.350> immediately<00:01:35.330> start<00:01:36.330> bubbling<00:01:36.960> up

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.590 

we'll<00:01:42.329> then<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.719> to<00:01:43.640> place<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.789> cap<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
we'll then you to place the cap on the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.760 
we'll then you to place the cap on the
reservoir<00:01:45.960> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.120 

take<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> plant<00:01:51.049> insert<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> plant<00:01:52.409> into<00:01:52.770> our

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
take the plant insert the plant into our

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.540 
take the plant insert the plant into our
aqwal

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.840 

and<00:01:57.640> finally<00:01:58.500> placing<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.890> ruffle<00:02:00.280> into<00:02:00.670> our

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
and finally placing the ruffle into our

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.770 
and finally placing the ruffle into our
recipe

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
recipe

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.710 
recipe
all<00:02:03.380> right<00:02:03.500> how<00:02:03.830> this<00:02:04.070> works<00:02:04.369> is<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.540> roots

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
all right how this works is the roots

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.440 
all right how this works is the roots
are<00:02:05.810> suspended<00:02:06.320> over<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.830> nutrient<00:02:07.310> solution

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
are suspended over the nutrient solution

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.120 
are suspended over the nutrient solution
which<00:02:08.450> allows<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.020> roots<00:02:09.170> taking<00:02:09.800> as<00:02:09.920> much

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
which allows the roots taking as much

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.760 
which allows the roots taking as much
food<00:02:10.340> as<00:02:10.520> they<00:02:10.670> need<00:02:10.930> this<00:02:11.930> means<00:02:12.170> less<00:02:12.470> work

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
food as they need this means less work

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.180 
food as they need this means less work
for<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.069> plant<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:14.380> more<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.590> more<00:02:15.920> energy

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
for the plant and more that more energy

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.490 
for the plant and more that more energy
goes<00:02:16.580> into<00:02:16.730> put<00:02:16.970> into<00:02:17.390> producing<00:02:18.050> new<00:02:18.230> leaves

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
goes into put into producing new leaves

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.979 
goes into put into producing new leaves
and<00:02:18.709> stems<00:02:19.870> with<00:02:20.870> less<00:02:21.830> energy<00:02:22.640> being<00:02:22.850> wasted

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
and stems with less energy being wasted

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.290 
and stems with less energy being wasted
it<00:02:23.989> results<00:02:24.680> in<00:02:24.770> less<00:02:24.950> stress<00:02:25.340> for<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.030> plant

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
it results in less stress for the plant

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.160 
it results in less stress for the plant
and<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.920> translates<00:02:28.400> into<00:02:28.670> more<00:02:29.000> yield<00:02:29.300> in<00:02:29.569> a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
and that translates into more yield in a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.540 
and that translates into more yield in a
smaller<00:02:30.500> space<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.100> in<00:02:31.850> less<00:02:32.060> time

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
smaller space and in less time

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.320 
smaller space and in less time
why<00:02:34.550> we<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:36.100> air<00:02:37.100> pump<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.000> bubbles

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
why we have the air pump and the bubbles

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.479 
why we have the air pump and the bubbles
okay<00:02:39.110> well<00:02:40.750> first<00:02:41.750> off<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.500> main<00:02:42.680> reason<00:02:43.280> is

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
okay well first off the main reason is

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.580 
okay well first off the main reason is
to<00:02:43.700> keep<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.090> nutrient<00:02:44.660> solution<00:02:44.750> aerated

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
to keep the nutrient solution aerated

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.630 
to keep the nutrient solution aerated
which<00:02:46.310> will<00:02:47.000> keep<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.360> plant<00:02:47.600> happy<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:49.430> also

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
which will keep the plant happy it also

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.990 
which will keep the plant happy it also
aids<00:02:50.239> in<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.810> circulation<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.160> nutrient

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
aids in the circulation of the nutrient

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.559 
aids in the circulation of the nutrient
solution<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.720> will<00:02:54.640> keep<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.760> from<00:02:55.910> setting

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
solution and will keep it from setting

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.500 
solution and will keep it from setting

which you and your family can enjoy it
now<00:03:30.270> if<00:03:30.630> all<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.080> isn't<00:03:31.290> enough<00:03:31.710> for<00:03:31.860> you

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
now if all this isn't enough for you

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.180 
now if all this isn't enough for you
well<00:03:32.850> think<00:03:33.270> about<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:34.010> why<00:03:35.010> would

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
well think about it like this why would

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.270 
well think about it like this why would
you<00:03:35.280> do<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:35.430> well<00:03:36.770> first<00:03:37.770> off<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.070> would<00:03:38.190> be

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
you do this well first off you would be

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.990 
you do this well first off you would be
reducing<00:03:38.730> your<00:03:38.820> eco<00:03:39.120> footprint<00:03:39.540> by<00:03:41.000> reducing

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
reducing your eco footprint by reducing

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.050 
reducing your eco footprint by reducing
the<00:03:42.270> amount<00:03:42.330> of<00:03:43.340> produce<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.520> a<00:03:44.730> truck

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
the amount of produce that a truck

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.300 
the amount of produce that a truck
driver<00:03:45.270> delivers<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.020> store<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:47.070> will<00:03:47.160> be

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
driver delivers to the store you will be

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.420 
driver delivers to the store you will be
one<00:03:47.520> less<00:03:47.700> person<00:03:48.000> who<00:03:48.690> they<00:03:48.840> have<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.080> supply

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
one less person who they have to supply

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.790 
one less person who they have to supply
now<00:03:50.430> it's<00:03:51.270> also<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.660> great<00:03:51.930> way<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.230> encourage

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
now it's also a great way to encourage

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.820 
now it's also a great way to encourage
children<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.730> appreciate<00:03:53.820> nature<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.960> this

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
children to appreciate nature and this

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.800 
children to appreciate nature and this
is<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.070> beauty<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.400> deep<00:03:56.940> water<00:03:57.120> culture<00:03:57.330> and

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
is the beauty of deep water culture and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.830 
is the beauty of deep water culture and
hydroponics<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:58.770> general<00:03:59.360> children<00:04:00.360> can<00:04:00.690> get

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
hydroponics in general children can get

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.070 
hydroponics in general children can get
into<00:04:01.110> it<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.520> it's<00:04:02.520> a<00:04:02.670> science<00:04:03.090> they're

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
into it and it's a science they're

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.020 
into it and it's a science they're
fascinated<00:04:05.780> now<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.640> who<00:04:08.640> wouldn't<00:04:08.880> want

growing like NASA go ahead Sunday who
knows<00:04:21.000> we<00:04:21.270> might<00:04:21.420> be<00:04:21.630> going<00:04:21.840> on<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.170> moon
