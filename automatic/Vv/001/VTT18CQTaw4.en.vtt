00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.110
 hydraulic coffee that we need to 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.170
 these recipes for these recipes 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.140
 We need the following ingredients 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.940
 one tablespoon of milk 60 milliliters of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.050
 brandy plus a little more for doping 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.370
 about 115 grams of white sugar 135 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.030
 grams of special flour for 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.010

 a sachet of coffee fell one 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.960
 teaspoon of yeast and a good egg 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.200
 we can start with the preparation of 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200
 the recipe 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.680
 one 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.750
 The first thing we are going to do is take the 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.960
 egg and we crack it and we use it in a 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.690
 bowl to beat by third parties for the 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.870
 yolk because how is it to beat is 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.230
 perfect and we're going to take a pinch of 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.230
 sugar 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.100
 and we're going to book there and we're going to 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.990
 book is and now we are going to give 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.390
 beat and we're going to beat everything until 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.190
 get a foamy mass the second 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.590
 step that I'm going to perform is to catch in a 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.110
 glass and throw the 65 grams of 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.760
 butter that needs the dough I'm going 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.090
 to use a teaspoon of jail 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.800
 there you see a perfect teaspoon and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.410
 Now what we are going to do is take this 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.690
 put it in the microwave until 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.400
 all the butter is fused 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.980
 also beat the eggs will be left 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.960
 with this sparkling aspect it is worth what 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.020
 let's do now is add the rest 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.990
 of sugar in this way we are going to 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.690
 add the 60 milliliters of brandy 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.140
 there it goes perfect and we are going to add the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.590
 half of the flour 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.180
 there goes we will see little by little 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.920
 we are going to hand them a bit 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.470
 it's not going to fall and the only thing that we 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.870
 would be missing is Caesar the teaspoon of 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:35.400
 yeast to the hands a little 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.400
 and I take the spoonful 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.360
 and from that one teaspoon of yeast in 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.600
 powder 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.940
 ok you have already seen there is perfect no 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.620
 you need more and now we will beat again 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.629
 until everything is well mixed 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.430
 once already well mixed everything 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.650
 we will do now is butter caesar 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.250
 with the dissolved coffee 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.360
 and there it goes perfect 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.240
 we are all good 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.240
 and we will also make the flour 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.660
 go up all the flour that was left and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.319
 now we will continue moving until 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.090
 get a homogeneous mass 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.150
 now we have put the preheated oven 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.879
 at 180 degrees and now let's take the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.859
 mold the cupcakes and we're going to use the 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.409
 mass within each of the 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.569
 wrappings once already well distributed the 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.340
 mass what we're going to do is put this 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.400
 in the oven and we 're going to bake it for 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.469
 approximately 20 minutes now for 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.659
 do the topping let's take and mix 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:39.120
 the rest of the ingredients that are a 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.650
 teaspoon of milk 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.549
 there it goes 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.209
 a teaspoon of brandy let's see it 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.209
 we are going to open 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.140
 20 grams of milk powder but we throw 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.140
 all 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:10.500
 everything inside 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.500
 perfect 50 grams of butter 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.560
 80 grams of icing sugar 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.960
 Once we put the icing sugar we have 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.180
 Poured a pinch of coffee powder and 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.069
 now at slow speed let's go 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.719
 beating for 1 minute and once 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.529
 after a minute we will increase the 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.330
 speed 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.710
 we have taken the cupcakes out of the oven like this 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.569
 that what we're going to do now is 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.360
 let it cool for approximately 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.009
