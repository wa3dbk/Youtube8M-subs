going to go ahead and move on to our
third<00:00:38.850> prestige<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.110> end<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.530> look

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
third prestige at the end of this look

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.520 
third prestige at the end of this look
at<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.670> only<00:00:41.820> lost<00:00:42.000> 18<00:00:42.570> games<00:00:42.899> during<00:00:43.260> one

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
at that I only lost 18 games during one

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560 
at that I only lost 18 games during one
whole<00:00:43.770> prestige<00:00:44.280> that's<00:00:45.000> pretty<00:00:45.390> ridiculous

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
whole prestige that's pretty ridiculous

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.220 
whole prestige that's pretty ridiculous
if<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.020> ask<00:00:46.110> making<00:00:46.500> 4.71<00:00:47.190> win-loss<00:00:47.730> ratio

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
if you ask making 4.71 win-loss ratio

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.119 
if you ask making 4.71 win-loss ratio
pretty<00:00:49.230> happy<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.559> where<00:00:49.710> that's<00:00:49.890> sitting

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
pretty happy with where that's sitting

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.529 
pretty happy with where that's sitting
right<00:00:50.219> now<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.399> think<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.940> testament<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
right now I think it's a testament to

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.350 
right now I think it's a testament to
the<00:00:51.809> team's<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.199> roll<00:00:52.410> with<00:00:52.760> 2.01<00:00:53.760> kill<00:00:54.180> death

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the team's I roll with 2.01 kill death

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.180 
the team's I roll with 2.01 kill death
ratio<00:00:54.449> now<00:00:55.379> what<00:00:55.530> we're<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> do<00:00:55.920> now<00:00:56.070> is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
ratio now what we're going to do now is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.380 
ratio now what we're going to do now is
we're<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> roll<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:56.670> into<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.180> next

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
we're going to roll right into this next

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.119 
we're going to roll right into this next
procedure<00:00:57.840> actually<00:00:58.320> recorded<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:58.949> the
