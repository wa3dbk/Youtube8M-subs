00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
that I've already bought the team

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.810 
that I've already bought the team
associated<00:00:09.840> RC<00:00:10.380> 10<00:00:10.559> B<00:00:10.740> 5<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.190> rear<00:00:11.370> motor<00:00:11.519> car

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
associated RC 10 B 5 the rear motor car

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.320 
associated RC 10 B 5 the rear motor car
and<00:00:12.059> it's<00:00:13.019> super<00:00:13.740> durable<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.400> good<00:00:14.820> car<00:00:15.059> but

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
and it's super durable a good car but

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330 
and it's super durable a good car but
everyone<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.350> mid<00:00:16.529> motor<00:00:16.710> crazy<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.190> just

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
everyone the mid motor crazy is just

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.040 
everyone the mid motor crazy is just
taken<00:00:17.609> over<00:00:17.670> here<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.510> think<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.869> lot<00:00:19.020> of

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
taken over here and I think in a lot of

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.410 
taken over here and I think in a lot of
cases<00:00:19.609> where<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.210> lot<00:00:21.390> of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
cases where you do have a lot of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.330 
cases where you do have a lot of
traction<00:00:21.689> specifically<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.710> surfaces<00:00:23.160> like

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
traction specifically on surfaces like

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.269 
traction specifically on surfaces like
carpet<00:00:23.789> or<00:00:24.000> sugared<00:00:24.570> up<00:00:24.660> high<00:00:24.869> bite<00:00:25.279> blue

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
carpet or sugared up high bite blue

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.939 
carpet or sugared up high bite blue
groove<00:00:26.490> type<00:00:26.670> surfaces<00:00:27.180> mid<00:00:28.170> motor<00:00:28.380> cars<00:00:28.680> are

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
groove type surfaces mid motor cars are

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.220 
groove type surfaces mid motor cars are
going<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.670> faster<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> jumped<00:00:31.199> on

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
going to be faster and so I jumped on

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.939 
going to be faster and so I jumped on
the<00:00:31.289> bandwagon

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
the bandwagon

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.560 
the bandwagon
I<00:00:32.070> would<00:00:32.399> knew<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> was<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> 2014

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
I would knew I was going to the 2014

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.340 
I would knew I was going to the 2014
cactus<00:00:34.140> classic<00:00:34.530> at<00:00:34.680> SRS<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:36.230> thought<00:00:37.230> you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
cactus classic at SRS and thought you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.319 
cactus classic at SRS and thought you
know<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.860> wanted<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.489> mid<00:00:38.610> motor<00:00:38.820> car<00:00:39.090> I

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
know what I wanted a mid motor car I

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
know what I wanted a mid motor car I
wanted<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.930> most<00:00:40.020> durable<00:00:40.379> car<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.680> could<00:00:40.860> find

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
wanted the most durable car I could find

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.220 
wanted the most durable car I could find
and<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.910> got<00:00:42.059> my<00:00:42.149> hands<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> b5<00:00:42.809> em<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and so I got my hands on a b5 em and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.920 
and so I got my hands on a b5 em and
that's<00:00:43.500> where<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.739> raced<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.180> now<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.809> before

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that's where I raced it now just before

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.840 
that's where I raced it now just before
anybody<00:00:46.350> asks<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.920> got<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.219> butt<00:00:47.370> kicked<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
anybody asks I got my butt kicked and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.310 
anybody asks I got my butt kicked and
you<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> didn't

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you know it is what it is I didn't

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.660 
you know it is what it is I didn't
really<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.559> any<00:00:49.739> clean<00:00:49.920> runs<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> car

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
really have any clean runs but the car

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.950 
really have any clean runs but the car
didn't<00:00:50.940> break<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> car<00:00:51.719> was<00:00:51.870> actually

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
didn't break and the car was actually

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.360 
didn't break and the car was actually
really<00:00:52.289> hooked<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.829> drove<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.160> well

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
really hooked up and drove really well

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.029 
really hooked up and drove really well
but<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.510> know<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:55.020> driver<00:00:55.350> error<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.739> guess

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
but you know just driver error I guess

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.330 
but you know just driver error I guess
but<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> car<00:00:57.300> itself<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.660> really<00:00:57.870> good

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
but the car itself is really good

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.959 
but the car itself is really good
something<00:00:59.340> that's<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.699> interesting

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
something that's really interesting

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.170 
something that's really interesting
about<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.870> b5m<00:01:01.609> especially<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.000> super

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
about the b5m especially and these super

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.060 
about the b5m especially and these super
high<00:01:03.420> bike<00:01:03.600> surfaces<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.229> at<00:01:04.320> least<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.619> cactus

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
high bike surfaces or at least at cactus

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.399 
high bike surfaces or at least at cactus
anyways<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.670> lot<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> guys<00:01:06.720> had<00:01:06.990> gone<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
anyways a lot of the guys had gone to

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.200 
anyways a lot of the guys had gone to
flat<00:01:07.830> front<00:01:08.189> arms<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.700> actually<00:01:08.939> went<00:01:09.090> away

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
flat front arms they actually went away

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.210 
flat front arms they actually went away
from<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> Gullwing<00:01:10.110> arms<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.740> come<00:01:10.950> with

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
from the Gullwing arms that come with

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.910 
from the Gullwing arms that come with
the<00:01:11.400> kit<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:13.320> big<00:01:13.500> difference<00:01:13.860> between

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the kit so the big difference between

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.999 
the kit so the big difference between
the<00:01:14.189> b5<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> b5m<00:01:15.420> other<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:16.439> obviously

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
the b5 and the b5m other then obviously

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.539 
the b5 and the b5m other then obviously
it's<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> mid<00:01:17.790> motor<00:01:18.000> car<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.890> car<00:01:20.130> comes<00:01:20.430> with

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
it's a mid motor car the car comes with

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.179 
it's a mid motor car the car comes with
gullwing<00:01:21.090> front<00:01:21.360> arms<00:01:21.680> in<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.770> different<00:01:23.040> shock

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
tower to match the arms and it comes

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.230

and Kody Newman Dahl who is one of the
one<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> engineers<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.070> really<00:01:41.400> had<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
one of the engineers that really had a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.210 
one of the engineers that really had a
big<00:01:41.729> hand<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> mid<00:01:42.479> motor<00:01:42.689> car<00:01:43.130> kids<00:01:44.130> an

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
big hand in the mid motor car kids an

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.480 
big hand in the mid motor car kids an
amazing<00:01:44.610> driver<00:01:45.079> super<00:01:46.079> smart<00:01:46.380> he<00:01:46.740> he

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
amazing driver super smart he he

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.620 
amazing driver super smart he he
basically<00:01:47.610> said<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.240> reason<00:01:48.420> they

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
basically said that the reason they

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.539 
basically said that the reason they
ended<00:01:48.780> up<00:01:48.840> using<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.229> aluminum<00:01:49.590> chassis<00:01:49.619> they

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
ended up using the aluminum chassis they

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.249 
ended up using the aluminum chassis they
would<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.880> preferred<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.780> used<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
would have preferred to have used a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.249 
would have preferred to have used a
composite<00:01:52.770> chassis<00:01:52.979> because<00:01:53.790> there's<00:01:54.509> no<00:01:54.689> you

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
composite chassis because there's no you

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080 
composite chassis because there's no you
know<00:01:55.290> with<00:01:55.500> aluminum<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.070> bends<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.670> you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
know with aluminum if it bends it's you

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.880 
know with aluminum if it bends it's you
know<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.659> might<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.229> notice<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
know it's you might not notice it a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.679 
know it's you might not notice it a
composite<00:01:59.729> chest<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.180> either<00:02:00.270> broke<00:02:00.509> or<00:02:00.630> not

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
composite chest is either broke or not

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.010 
composite chest is either broke or not
broken<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.469> do<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.860> idea<00:02:02.869> but<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
broken and I do like that idea but the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.240 
broken and I do like that idea but the
reason<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:04.350> use<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.560> aluminum<00:02:04.860> chassis<00:02:04.890> is

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
reason they use the aluminum chassis is

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
reason they use the aluminum chassis is
they<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.490> couldn't<00:02:05.790> get<00:02:05.850> enough<00:02:06.000> ribbing<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
they just couldn't get enough ribbing to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.260 
they just couldn't get enough ribbing to
create<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.560> strength<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.099> rigidity<00:02:08.700> that

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
create the strength and rigidity that

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.420 
create the strength and rigidity that
they<00:02:09.420> wanted<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> rear<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.560> car<00:02:10.770> so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
they wanted in the rear of the car so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.680 
they wanted in the rear of the car so
they<00:02:11.550> ended<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.790> going<00:02:11.910> aluminum<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.569> it's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
they ended up going aluminum so it's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.970 
they ended up going aluminum so it's
just<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.900> simple

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
just that simple

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.160 
just that simple
overall<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.790> car<00:02:14.970> works<00:02:15.210> really<00:02:15.450> good<00:02:15.720> right

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
overall the car works really good right

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.630 
overall the car works really good right
out<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.440> box<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:16.890> built<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.220> basically

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
out of the box I just built it basically

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.130 
out of the box I just built it basically
I<00:02:17.820> built<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.180> car<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.780> completely

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
I built the car and to be completely

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.100 
I built the car and to be completely
honest<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.650> was<00:02:19.890> being<00:02:20.370> lazy<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.910> when<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.990> was

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
honest I was being lazy and when I was

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.200 
honest I was being lazy and when I was
at<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.260> Reedy<00:02:22.440> race<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.950> had<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.880> chance<00:02:24.060> to

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
at the Reedy race I had the chance to

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.370 
at the Reedy race I had the chance to
ask<00:02:24.240> Brian<00:02:24.480> Mayfield<00:02:24.960> what<00:02:25.110> he<00:02:25.200> thought<00:02:25.320> about

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
ask Brian Mayfield what he thought about

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.290 
ask Brian Mayfield what he thought about
shock<00:02:25.740> packages<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.460> he<00:02:26.580> told<00:02:26.820> me<00:02:26.970> flat-out

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
shock packages and he told me flat-out

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.760 
shock packages and he told me flat-out
he<00:02:27.510> said<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.720> know<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> lot<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.260> times<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.620> take

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
he said you know a lot of times you take

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.860 
he said you know a lot of times you take
the<00:02:28.890> shock<00:02:29.100> package<00:02:29.340> off<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:30.330> your<00:02:30.510> rear<00:02:30.720> motor

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the shock package off of your rear motor

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.510 
the shock package off of your rear motor
car<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.410> it'll<00:02:31.890> work<00:02:31.950> right<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.310> your<00:02:32.400> mid

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
car and it'll work right in your mid

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520 
car and it'll work right in your mid
motor<00:02:32.670> car<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.780> exactly<00:02:34.290> what<00:02:34.500> I

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
motor car and so that is exactly what I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.970 
motor car and so that is exactly what I
did<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:34.950> pulled<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.430> shock<00:02:35.640> package<00:02:35.880> off<00:02:36.210> of<00:02:36.420> my

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
did I pulled the shock package off of my

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.890 
did I pulled the shock package off of my
b5<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.340> put<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.910> b5<00:02:39.210> m<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.720> car

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
b5 and put it on the b5 m and the car

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.120 
b5 and put it on the b5 m and the car
was<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> good<00:02:40.260> right<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> box<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.890> didn't

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
was a good right of the box I didn't

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.830 
was a good right of the box I didn't
change<00:02:41.340> anything<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:42.030> didn't<00:02:42.570> change<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
change anything I didn't change the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.740 
change anything I didn't change the
trail<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.530> didn't<00:02:44.160> change<00:02:44.540> absolutely<00:02:45.540> nothing

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
trail I didn't change absolutely nothing

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.000 
trail I didn't change absolutely nothing
I<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:45.840> took<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.110> shocks<00:02:46.320> off<00:02:46.500> put<00:02:46.770> them<00:02:46.860> on

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
I just took the shocks off put them on

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.040 
I just took the shocks off put them on
drove<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.730> car<00:02:47.910> out<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.180> box<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.960> was

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
drove the car out of the box and it was

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.620 
drove the car out of the box and it was
really<00:02:49.320> really<00:02:49.560> good<00:02:50.120> two<00:02:51.120> quick<00:02:51.390> things

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
really really good two quick things

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.920 
really really good two quick things
about<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.320> b5m<00:02:52.890> build<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.880> built<00:02:54.150> very<00:02:54.630> very

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
about the b5m build it built very very

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.430 
about the b5m build it built very very
well<00:02:55.170> very<00:02:55.860> similar<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.459> my<00:02:56.580> b5<00:02:57.440> obviously

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
well very similar to my b5 obviously

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.100 
well very similar to my b5 obviously
it's<00:02:59.430> got<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.940> aluminum<00:03:00.180> chassis<00:03:00.209> but<00:03:00.630> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
it's got the aluminum chassis but the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.050 
it's got the aluminum chassis but the
two<00:03:01.590> things<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.040> noticed<00:03:02.430> more<00:03:02.880> than

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
two things that I noticed more than

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.240 
two things that I noticed more than
anything<00:03:03.270> were<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.690> turnbuckles<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:05.040> ball

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
anything were the turnbuckles the ball

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.940 
anything were the turnbuckles the ball
cups<00:03:05.520> seemed<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.880> fit<00:03:06.180> better<00:03:06.680> over<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.800> ball

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
cups seemed to fit better over the ball

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.710 
cups seemed to fit better over the ball
studs<00:03:08.250> they're<00:03:08.790> just<00:03:08.910> less<00:03:09.090> friction<00:03:09.360> they're

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
studs they're just less friction they're

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.930 
studs they're just less friction they're
just<00:03:09.900> more<00:03:10.050> free<00:03:10.230> even<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.160> my<00:03:11.310> rear<00:03:11.520> motor<00:03:11.670> car

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
just more free even on my rear motor car

the<00:04:46.850> mid<00:04:47.030> motor<00:04:47.270> car<00:04:47.570> better<00:04:47.930> than<00:04:48.170> the<00:04:48.260> rear

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440

the mid motor car better than the rear
motor<00:04:48.560> car<00:04:48.860> probably<00:04:49.610> just<00:04:49.910> cuz<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.090> had<00:04:50.210> more

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
on power steering you know obviously

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.350 
on power steering you know obviously
there's<00:04:51.710> more<00:04:51.860> weight<00:04:52.070> farther<00:04:52.670> forward<00:04:53.000> I

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
there's more weight farther forward I

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.140 
there's more weight farther forward I
did<00:04:53.990> try<00:04:54.200> running<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.590> car<00:04:54.800> at<00:04:55.190> cactus<00:04:55.910> with<00:04:56.120> a

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
did try running the car at cactus with a

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.060 
did try running the car at cactus with a
shorty<00:04:56.570> all<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.810> way<00:04:56.900> back<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:57.410> shorty<00:04:57.860> all<00:04:57.980> the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
shorty all the way back a shorty all the

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.040 
shorty all the way back a shorty all the
way<00:04:58.130> forward<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:58.640> finally<00:04:59.570> I<00:04:59.600> settled<00:04:59.990> on

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
way forward and finally I settled on

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.900 
way forward and finally I settled on
saddles<00:05:00.560> four<00:05:00.920> millimeters<00:05:01.400> from<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.640> rear

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
saddles four millimeters from the rear

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.600 
saddles four millimeters from the rear
with<00:05:02.510> the<00:05:02.780> shorty<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.320> car<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.830> actually<00:05:04.370> like

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
with the shorty the car I actually like

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.740 
with the shorty the car I actually like
the<00:05:04.670> way<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:04.850> car<00:05:04.940> drove<00:05:05.240> better<00:05:05.510> with<00:05:05.690> the

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
the way the car drove better with the

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.540 
the way the car drove better with the
shorty<00:05:06.110> but<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:06.530> just<00:05:06.680> did<00:05:06.830> crazy<00:05:07.040> wheelies<00:05:07.520> in

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
shorty but it just did crazy wheelies in

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.950 
shorty but it just did crazy wheelies in
the<00:05:07.700> back<00:05:07.850> straight<00:05:08.090> anytime<00:05:08.450> you<00:05:08.600> really<00:05:08.810> got

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
the back straight anytime you really got

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.540 
the back straight anytime you really got
into<00:05:09.170> the<00:05:09.260> throttle<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:09.740> that<00:05:09.860> just<00:05:10.100> you<00:05:10.430> know

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
into the throttle and that just you know

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.910 
into the throttle and that just you know
it's<00:05:10.970> not<00:05:11.090> gonna<00:05:11.240> cut<00:05:11.480> it<00:05:11.830> nothing<00:05:12.830> really

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
it's not gonna cut it nothing really

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.940 
it's not gonna cut it nothing really
