00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 of good very good to all and welcome 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.950
 to my channel happy new year I am 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.080
 dashiell and this is going to be a small 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.080
 quiz a little test to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.580
 celebrate that we are already in 2014 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.840
 It is also worth mentioning that this is one of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.240
 the many absurd games and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.010
 tremendously ridiculous that I usually go up 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.720
 sometimes not ridiculous because the game 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.130
 this is wrong because it is entertaining what 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.210
 it's ridiculous that it's so banking that it's not 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.490
 get to play well 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.529
 Well, well, I'm going to pay attention 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.119
 give it right away to play people 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.250
 that more scores perform in this 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.230
 I'll give you some prize to some 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.300
 the one that you do not ask because I do not have 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.829
 idea is a very absurd game I'm going to have 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.899
 me three attempts to try to do my 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.480
 better score and those people who 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.739
 send me images on twitter I'm sorry 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.719
 is that it is the only place where I 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.730
 you can send the image of truth 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.350
 I would try to put it by more means but 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.850
 is that I can not explain it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.440
 I'm just going to give it to play and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.600
 you will see what it is about 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.480
 we have to try to see the biggest 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.079
 possible amount of imagining what liquid 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.969
 you want to put alcohol, carbonated water, let's go 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.260
 to hit enter and the account will start 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.040
 behind 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.759
 already come up you see a red bar of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.560
 lifetime 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.439
 that is the bar that we have to be 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.810
 eating so that it does not go down by pressing anything 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.180
 and the s to drink is the caixa l then 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.409
 how much we leave the truth low if the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.909
 low bar of course our 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.710
 character will enter an ethyl coma in 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.780
 a coma that you want to imagine 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.360
 please only perform these things in 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.330
 video game 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.869
 this is a simulator for poinsettia like this 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.869
 that here we are 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.820
 uy 10 with 3 liters has been my record 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.350
 immediately the next one begins 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.090
 so come 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.310
 you as you commented you have to 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.259
 try it too and the people then 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.070
 which score higher do not know 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.740
 how many will be 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.060
 I would try to give him a prize 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.409
 it will surely be something a game 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.560
 obviously because what else can I 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.940
 offer me and more or less simple games 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.580
 I'll see, I do not even know what video games 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.500
 they can be but well I'm like that 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.330
 good desire and I think it's a good idea 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.369
 is more likely soon when 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.440
 buy me a game and see what 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.880
 better then I have one that I burned myself 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.880
 about not wanting to use this time to 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.000
 that less is that this already costs to fail 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.950
 This game tires me believe that you tired mother 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.790
 mine I'm going to have a people is 15 a 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.250
 esquince of languages what you already have and a 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.010
 ex 13 also an ex 13 I will have the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.569
 tongue pasta my mother 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.239
 this is already red is that it looks like 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.700
 final that this game if you play it is 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.890
 normal although I'm not living or a 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.569
 liter of alcohol seems like it will be 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.550
 drunk when it ends that what 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:46.820
 you have done a lot of sport 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:48.950
 I'm going to give him the room I'm fatal to 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.930
 throughout this year 2014 surely 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.520
 We are staying at specific moments 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.370
 that I 'm not even going to increase when 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.590
 be and there are many times at best neither 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.880
 even commented on videos already 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.720
 better not taiz in your profile 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.730
 google + 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.830
 and others because I sent some game 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.470
 This is why the fans do not treat 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.480
 even more light or whoever carries 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.560
 longer and somewhat random because I 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.560
 I usually buy many games 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.630
 that I bought many games and there are times 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.160
 that there are some that I'm not going to play 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.260
 because I do not have time then then in 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.090
 Once they stay there, they are lost 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.830
 in time and times that I usually 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.140
 give away many games because I will also give 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.550
 games for you and with this 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.830
 I want to congratulate you again years I do not 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.170
 I try again this mother is red 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.510
 I think that now I'm going to buy myself a 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.570
 fried chicken that would have gone down some 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.040
 how many calories good basically what 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.990
 I feel I know that the game a little absurd 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.300
 but today January 1 you will understand that 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.370
 I also want to relax a bit though 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.320
 be the least done with this 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.150
 game but basically I wanted 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.239
 congratulate them again thank you for watching 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.430
 the video will try to see what prizes 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.440
 I can give and what I said I 'm sorry 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.700
 twitter basically you're going to have at 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.709
 the indications the pack of 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.720
 description you send me the photo for 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.940
 next I'll see what other things I can 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.560
 doing it better creates an exclusive email 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.209
 for these things he comforted me until the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.959
 the gamer remains four minutes 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.959
 of grace chao
