00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Welcome to the first gameplay 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.620
 from the witch 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.269
 yes, I have something really nice right now 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.910
 for you here could again very 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.969
 nice animations of mine, of course 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.279
 and here you see again the stats from 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.350
 the witch on level 1 and told the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.939
 improvement on level 2 I have now 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.619
 We deliberately chose this image 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.560
 can see the difference between 1 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.730
 and 2 in that means 25 damage makes them 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.750
 per second is not really now 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.880
 a lot plus 5 is wrong 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.140
 Level two more than the two goes too 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.630
 not right now if we have the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.000
 20, for example, an archer level 5 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.010
 Do 20 things like this now 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.540
 So it really does hurt a lot 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.660
 Do not make it come naturally 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.149
 that she awakens her little ones and dead ones 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.739
 and then attack them with something 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.329
 for a damage that is then attack 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.110
 actually not really find out 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.989
 so far 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.960
 she attacks the ground and air is aimed at her 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.989
 even the undead, the only reason 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.910
 here as far as I decipher previously 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.409
 could see the living space is 12 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.630
 Clearly that means it is actually 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.869
 for anyone who has the clear buck can 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.979
 Let's put such a thing in 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.000
 and I mean, at least, it has to be clear 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.710
 that has already been done on october 1 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.869
 is also no matter and training time 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.700
 is 20 minutes and she has one 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.750
 damage the rest you can do everything 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.939
 I need you to recognize myself 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.170
 not to show and exactly from this 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.119
 Because we jump already 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.380
 right in the first attack therefore the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.490
 I have directly over the share function 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.659
 from the dear Simon from the clear head too 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.009
 you can also get there 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.720
 drop by is really right 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.680
 class clear it is my first clear 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.650
 been as I was, and here you can see 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.119
 the wonderful power only with golems 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.040
 the beautiful tanks are then forwarded 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.600
 there are still packers stage 4 a few o'clock 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.950
 set and of course the football may 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.040
 Not missing you can already see that 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.520
 Stage 6 wall breakers the right way 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.470
 switch 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.189
 here comes naturally then again later 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.750
 16 or the stats of which come then 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.399
 even later not in this one 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.250
 video but you will get there then 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.189
 is the thing so she's already there 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.960
 So you see the green circles around them 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.970
 they have a bit of a turn 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.400
 there is now the second and always 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.440
 if she always takes short shots 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.660
 himself died with their billy goat 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.550
 stop them and wake up and dead 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.550
 yes, just counting the moment so awaken 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.860
 12345 every five seconds so in 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.380
 About every five seconds you see that 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.930
 yes , she wakes you up in a circle 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.360
 around and dead are four pieces that are 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.170
 By the way, already level two witches the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.750
 attack here 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.680
 So you see, you are really strong 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.380
 you do not see her here like her 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.370
 Green shoots that's all right now 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.590
 we have that right again 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.970
 time simon has been lucky in 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.710
 In this case what is luck but it is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.660
 perfect for this video you have run 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.730
 See that perfectly the witch is there 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.690
 whole defense buildings are coming 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.850
 not to her 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.950
 that means she is completely untouched 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.310
 and does every five seconds so attacks 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.220
 on 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.440
 ceases to shoot conjures attacks 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.900
 continue on 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.910
 stop attacking summons shoots 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.400
 farther, and are always four and death that 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.540
 does not mean the horseman archery 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.720
 revive but enliven them 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.420
 just around and dead or resp 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.420
 simply brings units from the earth 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.440
 always having four skeletons with you 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.610
 sword in hand how much damage 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.110
 who are doing now and how exactly that 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.590
 I do not have that yet 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.390
 I can not see if I can 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.560
 that someday find out will be there 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.480
 I'll tell you as soon as I know more 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.959
 of course the appropriate ones 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.250
 provide information 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.360
 otherwise it looks really real 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.280
 nice that I mean you really fat 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.690
 from how they really attack 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.430
 she is not strong as I said that 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.820
 is already a stage on the already one 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.590
 on level 2 you can see it there too 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.950
 nicknamed the Cannon Elf cannon and the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.720
 United States 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.080
 they shoot together and then 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.250
 that's it, that's it 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.269
 facebook-side of also a bit 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.769
 played crazy because I have only 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.790
 So constantly get notifications 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.680
 Congratulations to whoever is there 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:08.190
 just showed up here 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:11.070
 further attack with level 1 witches 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.959
 hessen and the tank vorickt as 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.160
 the brickbreaker made up there we see 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.300
 Incidentally, bring the wall again 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.830
 they we have provided since that here 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.519
 There are no six burglars that have 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.040
 we provided there 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.330
 the wallbreakers also have golden ones 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.010
 So they do not bomb like me 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.470
 speculated had red bombs but 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.030
 also golden bombs so we see again 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.990
 Golem there nice 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.430
 in the inferno attracts the 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.690
 packers continue to line up the rows 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.350
 archer queen already has 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.750
 blown away 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.639
 the archers queen please 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.260
 nonsense the archers Queen of the 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.910
 opponent has already blown away that wanted 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.700
 Of course I say and there are the 23 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.840
 are they even there right now 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.550
 the three witches really perfect 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.990
 placed so to speak, there's just about 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.790
 nothing off except the xbox but the 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.450
 export is taking care of it 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.190
 now its caught by the moerser 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.240
 taura wm have stood and got perfect 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.980
 then from the back always nice again 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 units supported so I can 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.800
 do not really imagine that high 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.840
 level players who will often use 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.830
 it is actually more of a unity 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.020
 which one if maybe one 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.520
 takes along and puts behind it and looks 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.950
 that they always keep a few behind 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.440
 skeletons after yes and that's it 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.260
 actually so far from the witch me 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.970
 Hope of course you liked and 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.440
 I find myself somehow fed but me 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.090
 have my opinion to yours 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.000
 Opinion is in demand so down in 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.360
 the comments in and I'll do it 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.830
 do not really want to say yeah supplies 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.830
 I say makes good
