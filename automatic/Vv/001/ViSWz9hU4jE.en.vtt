00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 there is nothing in the morning for endesa 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.990
 better than entering the house and feeling the 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.469
 fresh morning scent 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.380
 take yeast flour a pinch of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.320
 cinnamon that goes very well with i 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.090
 muffin is important to add an outlet 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.250
 of salt to ensure that the muffins do not 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.050
 they are too sweet 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 this is the cork musco vado ie 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.890
 unrefined cane sugar has a 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.199
 rich and spicy flavor ideal for the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.779
 muffin preparation and now ours 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.790
 neither crunchy muesli nor half 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.079
 now keeping the other half like 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.300
 seal given a nice stir 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.520
 add some fresh cut pears 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.260
 at the end and remember to 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.670
 peel them there is nothing worse than 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.710
 when it is intent on eating a muffin 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.789
 and you end up chewing a huge one 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.899
 piece of peel cut into four pieces 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:57.059
 along the core and slice them finely 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.949
 generally the muffins contain half 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.320
 fat of cupcakes sugars 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.330
 once the ingredients are mixed 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.409
 dry punish those moist 2 whole eggs 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.409
 well combine milk 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.979
 add the melted butter 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:23.000
 mix well and add it to yours 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.829
 dough begin to stir do it 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.500
 always love the muffins are 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.060
 fragile and delicate creatures not worked 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.509
 too much the compound that will have to become 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:39.280
 dense and easy to pour now that 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.280
 the dough is nice and creamy 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:50.090
 take the pan and pour it in 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.360
 cups and fill them for two thirds one 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.159
 beautiful spoonful you understand that a good 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.720
 dough because the penalties are distributed 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.130
 evenly both above and below 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.099
 beat the pan gently and gently 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.770
 both sides leveling the mixture i 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:08.810
 muffins will have a uniform cooking 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.399
 take the muesli and positioner in 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.010
 top so as to create a double 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.290
 soft texture of pears e 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.819
 the crunchy one of the seal from 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.480
 machine an appearance is still a taste 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.090
 the sweetest you go to the oven at 180 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.569
 degrees for 25 minutes 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.569
 wonderful 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.520
 they also have an exquisite scent 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.620
 beautiful crispy flakes, take them out 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.200
 and let them cool 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.360
 I wouldn't mind becoming a vegetarian 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.989
 once or twice a week if there 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.459
 they were always these wonderful muffins 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.459
 that smell good 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.819
 a vegetarian breakfast capable of 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.050
 put the wings on the morning pears 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.050
 and months are a real vegetarian delight 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.050
 magnificent
