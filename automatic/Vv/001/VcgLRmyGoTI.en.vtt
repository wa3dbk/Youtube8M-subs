the suspension on with your clickers on
your<00:00:21.730> dirt<00:00:21.880> bike<00:00:22.060> but<00:00:22.780> before<00:00:23.290> you<00:00:23.410> do<00:00:23.530> that

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
stiffen the rebound you just need a flat

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.700 
stiffen the rebound you just need a flat
blade<00:01:03.370> screwdriver<00:01:03.760> and<00:01:04.299> you<00:01:04.930> turn<00:01:05.199> them<00:01:05.439> in

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
blade screwdriver and you turn them in

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.879 
blade screwdriver and you turn them in
to<00:01:06.780> stiffen<00:01:07.780> them<00:01:08.049> you<00:01:08.380> can<00:01:08.530> hear<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:08.859> click

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:10.889 
to stiffen them you can hear it click

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:15.809 
to stiffen them you can hear it click
and<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:13.450> can<00:01:13.479> also<00:01:13.810> feel<00:01:14.259> it<00:01:14.429> turn<00:01:15.429> them<00:01:15.639> in

and you can also feel it turn them in

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:17.489 
and you can also feel it turn them in
stiffens<00:01:16.270> them<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:16.630> then<00:01:16.749> if<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.289> want<00:01:17.469> to

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
stiffens them and then if you want to

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:23.129 
stiffens them and then if you want to
soften<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:18.539> and<00:01:19.539> just<00:01:20.170> turn<00:01:20.319> it<00:01:20.439> back<00:01:20.619> out<00:01:22.139> then

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:23.139 
soften it and just turn it back out then

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:26.099 
soften it and just turn it back out then
for<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.560> compression<00:01:24.359> there's<00:01:25.359> clickers<00:01:25.929> on

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
for the compression there's clickers on

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.359 
for the compression there's clickers on
the<00:01:26.259> bottom<00:01:27.209> you<00:01:28.209> just<00:01:28.240> got<00:01:28.659> a<00:01:28.829> pull<00:01:29.829> back<00:01:30.100> that

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
the bottom you just got a pull back that

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.249 
the bottom you just got a pull back that
rubber<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:31.270> then<00:01:31.420> there's<00:01:31.630> clickers<00:01:32.079> there

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
rubber and then there's clickers there

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.099 
rubber and then there's clickers there
to<00:01:32.499> out<00:01:32.770> would<00:01:33.009> be<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.429> softest<00:01:33.939> and<00:01:34.270> all<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
to out would be the softest and all the

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.260 
to out would be the softest and all the
way<00:01:35.200> in<00:01:35.349> be<00:01:35.709> the<00:01:35.950> stiffest<00:01:38.880> adjusting<00:01:39.880> the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
way in be the stiffest adjusting the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.219 
way in be the stiffest adjusting the
rear<00:01:40.479> shock<00:01:40.779> goes<00:01:41.499> the<00:01:41.679> same<00:01:41.950> but<00:01:42.939> on<00:01:43.899> the

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
rear shock goes the same but on the

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.719 
rear shock goes the same but on the
bottom<00:01:45.569> you<00:01:46.569> can<00:01:46.749> see<00:01:46.779> the<00:01:47.319> clicker<00:01:48.159> is<00:01:48.189> right

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
bottom you can see the clicker is right

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.679 
bottom you can see the clicker is right
here<00:01:49.209> this<00:01:50.049> is<00:01:50.649> actually<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.340> rebound<00:01:51.939> but

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
here this is actually the rebound but

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.989 
here this is actually the rebound but
you<00:01:52.869> can<00:01:53.020> still<00:01:53.829> go<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.099> same<00:01:54.310> way<00:01:54.340> turn<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.880> in

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
you can still go the same way turn it in

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:58.889 
you can still go the same way turn it in
stiffen<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:55.599> turn<00:01:56.079> it<00:01:56.200> out<00:01:56.349> and<00:01:56.380> soften<00:01:57.039> it<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
stiffen it turn it out and soften it and

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.029 
stiffen it turn it out and soften it and
then<00:01:59.169> the<00:01:59.739> compression<00:02:00.340> is<00:02:01.329> on<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:01.869> top<00:02:02.109> turn

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
then the compression is on the top turn

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.460 
then the compression is on the top turn
it<00:02:03.219> right<00:02:03.399> here<00:02:03.849> and<00:02:04.889> then<00:02:06.749> most<00:02:07.749> motocross

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
it right here and then most motocross

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.919 
it right here and then most motocross
bikes<00:02:08.770> now<00:02:09.099> have<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.789> high<00:02:10.239> compression<00:02:10.780> or

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
bikes now have the high compression or

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.460 
bikes now have the high compression or
high<00:02:11.170> speed<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:13.270> just<00:02:13.300> need<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> wrench<00:02:14.170> and

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
high speed you just need a wrench and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.400 
high speed you just need a wrench and
then<00:02:14.860> turn<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.760> whole<00:02:16.060> aisle

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
then turn this whole aisle

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.810 
then turn this whole aisle
diameter<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:20.600> nut<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.280> will<00:02:22.400> Justin

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
diameter of the nut and that will Justin

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.630 
diameter of the nut and that will Justin
for<00:02:23.240> high-speed<00:02:23.740> compression<00:02:24.740> also<00:02:25.070> don't

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
for high-speed compression also don't

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.550 
for high-speed compression also don't
forget<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:26.060> try<00:02:26.720> new<00:02:26.900> things<00:02:26.930> with<00:02:27.380> your

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
forget to try new things with your

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.550 
forget to try new things with your
suspension<00:02:28.280> when<00:02:28.700> you're<00:02:28.820> at<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> track<00:02:29.560> even

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
suspension when you're at the track even

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.740 
suspension when you're at the track even
if<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.770> think<00:02:31.040> it's<00:02:31.160> working<00:02:31.570> try<00:02:32.570> adjusting

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
if you think it's working try adjusting

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.220 
if you think it's working try adjusting
the<00:02:33.260> clickers<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.860> see<00:02:34.730> what<00:02:34.880> changes<00:02:35.600> you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
the clickers and see what changes you

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.250 
the clickers and see what changes you
