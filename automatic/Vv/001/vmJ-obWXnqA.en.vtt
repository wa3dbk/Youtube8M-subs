00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.650
 the ascent from the south Atlantic to the north 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.889
 is going to be a bit long I tell myself that it takes 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.190
 that I'm busy there it's in the process of 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.980
 to cook 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.980
 opposite the saas and the milk 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.240
 but a poor 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.240
 keep the garlic water in the dough 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.940
 and I started making pancakes 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.750
 at around 5,000 cities still from 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.820
 the arrival is a little candlemas 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.960
 before the time alessandro the epicurean 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 practice your culinary skills 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.630
 but 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.630
 m 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.950
 and if that was it the sold globe a 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.480
 cooking history 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.340
 a question in the left hand is what 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.230
 is the recipe for a good sold globe 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 in this portrait shot in November 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.360
 last few days before departure 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.070
 of the event 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.810
 if franÃ§ois gabart did not know the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.460
 answer he had a little idea of 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.129
 lawyers my strengths I thought 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 the envied passion all the energy that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.060
 I can put in this race 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.560
 because I have an energy pack and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.180
 I think it's important because we 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.530
 need it I do not know if this is the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.580
 best ship of the fleet but what 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.220
 is sure it's the best 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.860
 boat for me and michel desjoyeaux 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.660
 work with me and is necessarily his 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.060
 way of sailing has a great influence on 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.590
 the annual water Sunday is 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.100
 will let her say before the future 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.420
 winner begins his long procession 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.700
 in the sand channel of olonne 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.540
 at the same time aboard a boat 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.740
 relieved of his keel 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.880

 Gale 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.660
 a gesture hailed an organism 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.870
 attacks for fossils as Gervais 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.270
 a small mistake to tell him from there 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.890

 for now it was all 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.060
 actually come to see discuss about 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.380
 always important to play in seas 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.380
 a little bit about that hill
