played<00:03:11.660> by<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.840> same<00:03:12.140> actor<00:03:12.350> oh<00:03:12.769> oh<00:03:13.360> there's<00:03:14.360> a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
played by the same actor oh oh there's a

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.570

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
very strong similarity in that really

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.870 
very strong similarity in that really
visually<00:03:17.000> yeah<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.989> mean<00:03:18.140> they're<00:03:18.739> opposite<00:03:19.670> of

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
visually yeah I mean they're opposite of

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.330 
visually yeah I mean they're opposite of
their<00:03:20.209> sorority<00:03:20.630> is<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.050> fact<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.350> that's

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
their sorority is the fact that that's

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.870 
their sorority is the fact that that's
about<00:03:22.850> 35<00:03:23.510> years<00:03:23.780> difference<00:03:24.320> in<00:03:24.530> there<00:03:24.920> and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
about 35 years difference in there and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.930 
about 35 years difference in there and
the<00:03:26.239> ages<00:03:26.890> I'm<00:03:27.890> not<00:03:28.100> sure<00:03:28.220> which<00:03:28.370> way<00:03:28.550> really

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
the ages I'm not sure which way really

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.090 
the ages I'm not sure which way really
but<00:03:29.660> because<00:03:29.989> who<00:03:30.140> knows<00:03:30.290> how<00:03:30.530> old<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.830> wizard

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
but because who knows how old the wizard

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.640 
but because who knows how old the wizard
is<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.430> suppose<00:03:31.790> he<00:03:31.910> might<00:03:32.090> be<00:03:32.410> 950<00:03:33.410> as<00:03:33.470> well

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
is I suppose he might be 950 as well

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.410 
is I suppose he might be 950 as well
maybe<00:03:33.890> out<00:03:34.040> why<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.220> always<00:03:34.760> get<00:03:34.910> these<00:03:35.030> parts

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
maybe out why I always get these parts

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.330 
maybe out why I always get these parts
that<00:03:35.480> people<00:03:35.660> are<00:03:35.959> at<00:03:36.050> 950<00:03:36.709> years<00:03:36.860> old

like<00:04:43.710> Doctor<00:04:44.710> Who<00:04:44.740> but<00:04:45.250> maybe<00:04:45.460> is<00:04:45.760> other

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
like Doctor Who but maybe is other

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.390 
like Doctor Who but maybe is other

journey<00:04:53.080> was<00:04:53.620> completely<00:04:54.070> different<00:04:54.160> from

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
journey was completely different from

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.370 
journey was completely different from
Doctor<00:04:54.640> Who's<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.240> usually<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:55.780> just<00:04:55.810> think

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
Doctor Who's so usually you just think

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.810 
Doctor Who's so usually you just think
about<00:04:56.470> that<00:04:56.710> journey<00:04:57.040> that<00:04:57.160> you're<00:04:57.400> about<00:04:57.669> to

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
about that journey that you're about to

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.510 
about that journey that you're about to
go<00:04:57.970> on<00:04:58.150> with<00:04:58.720> your<00:04:58.960> character<00:04:59.590> and<00:05:02.520> although

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
go on with your character and although

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.210 
go on with your character and although
it's<00:05:03.760> quite<00:05:03.910> interesting<00:05:04.330> that<00:05:05.010> part<00:05:06.010> of

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
it's quite interesting that part of

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.560 
it's quite interesting that part of
radagast<00:05:07.830> kind<00:05:08.830> of<00:05:08.919> was<00:05:09.070> kind<00:05:09.880> of<00:05:09.970> chromatic

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
radagast kind of was kind of chromatic

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.469 
radagast kind of was kind of chromatic
to<00:05:10.750> begin<00:05:11.050> with<00:05:11.260> and<00:05:12.130> then<00:05:12.460> as<00:05:12.669> it<00:05:12.850> develops<00:05:13.300> I

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
to begin with and then as it develops I

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.210 
to begin with and then as it develops I
think<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:13.810> gets<00:05:13.930> darker<00:05:14.500> I<00:05:14.680> haven't<00:05:14.979> seen<00:05:15.130> the

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
think it gets darker I haven't seen the

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.510 
think it gets darker I haven't seen the
second<00:05:15.550> film<00:05:15.729> but<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:15.970> have<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.150> feeling<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:17.320> is

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
second film but I have a feeling it is

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.710 
second film but I have a feeling it is
darker<00:05:18.520> trying<00:05:18.910> to<00:05:19.000> remember<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.479> you<00:05:19.600> know

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
darker trying to remember the you know

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.020 
darker trying to remember the you know
the<00:05:19.840> scenes<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.229> did<00:05:20.640> because<00:05:21.640> they<00:05:21.790> were<00:05:21.850> about

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
the scenes I did because they were about

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.850 
the scenes I did because they were about
to<00:05:22.210> knife<00:05:22.390> years<00:05:22.690> ago<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.140> was<00:05:23.290> third<00:05:23.650> one

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
to knife years ago and I was third one

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.340 
to knife years ago and I was third one
coming<00:05:24.160> out<00:05:24.280> Natan<00:05:24.760> and<00:05:25.479> I<00:05:25.600> think<00:05:26.140> there<00:05:26.320> is

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
coming out Natan and I think there is

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.270 
coming out Natan and I think there is
that<00:05:26.470> parallel<00:05:27.160> by<00:05:27.850> coincidence<00:05:28.680> in<00:05:29.680> a<00:05:30.070> kind

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
that parallel by coincidence in a kind

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.070 
that parallel by coincidence in a kind
of<00:05:30.370> comic<00:05:30.760> early<00:05:31.090> element<00:05:31.510> and<00:05:31.660> in<00:05:31.780> a<00:05:31.870> later

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
of comic early element and in a later

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.820 
of comic early element and in a later
darker<00:05:32.530> piece<00:05:33.479> we<00:05:34.479> shall<00:05:34.660> find<00:05:34.990> out<00:05:35.229> yes

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
darker piece we shall find out yes

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.730 
darker piece we shall find out yes
that's<00:05:36.310> true<00:05:36.520> it's<00:05:37.210> funny<00:05:37.720> mentioned<00:05:38.169> the

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
that's true it's funny mentioned the

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.350 
that's true it's funny mentioned the
comedic<00:05:39.040> side<00:05:39.250> because<00:05:39.610> before<00:05:39.970> I<00:05:40.030> even<00:05:40.150> saw

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360
