00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.549
 very good to all subscribers and 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.280
 cerredo I will teach how to make a 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.680
 chroma or a render as what to call 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.600
 in minecraft so you do not know what it is 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.530
 a chroma a render is this that has for 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.480
 green background example and trimming by 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.520
 example the person and with that we can already 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.910
 do montage or video or any 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.600
 thing as me show you how to make a 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.980
 chroma and apart it will also be used 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.280
 for video you can also use 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.499
 for what is photos for you to do 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.690
 your miniatures and that's what I 'm going 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.969
 to explain if they want another video because if 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.069
 you want in another video because I explain how 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.269
 do it in videos that also very easy 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:52.909
 The first thing you have to do is 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.100
 download the textures pack I'll 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.499
 I give here a couple of textures that I've made 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.610
 with basic colors and the most used ones 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:03.180
 to have chroma 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.550
 we give it and we're going to be we do not put in 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.620
 any map 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.380
 and here we are and now what what 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.530
 we would have to do as you see here 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.320
 green wool put the colors more 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.780
 used to make purple chroma is 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.479
 green yellow blue blue dark 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.440
 and well I'm going to make it green 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.450
 first thing we have to do is do 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.360
 a surface of two envelopes 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.600
 something and where will we support what we're going to 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.600
 do 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.110
 for example I said on this hill 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.240
 well we have our our 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.759
 finished now the only thing we would have 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.690
 what to do is for example I first 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.070
 what I am going to do 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.270
 exposes for example a pumpkin 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.740
 a zone network block 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.740
 and a ladder for example 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.560
 Well, we would not put it like that 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.170
 as you see 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.000
 and now we would only have to do is 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.950
 give f1 to remove what 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.480
 Interface 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.940
 and now the only thing we had to do 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.840
 is to take the photos or record the video 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.950
 why 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.950
 what you see 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.640
 to see well 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.040
 efe 2 to take the photo and now for 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.250
 example I'm going to draw a network circuit 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.250
 are 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.490
 well i will put 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.819
 here on piston 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.999
 pray around here and a torch 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.269
 when I'm almost going to give a little more height 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.269
 here 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.120
 Y 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.190
 well better and now the same process 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.060
 before we put where we want to go 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.580
 the photo and now we give it to f2 and we take out 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.910
 the good photo now I see you with photoshop 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.520
 which in this case is going to be gym 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.400
 well we are already in gym as well you know 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.260
 is a free program is similar to 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.380
 photoshop and I really like it more than 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.850
 photoshop but good for tastes colors 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.550
 what we will have to do is 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.510
 select by color as you see here 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.330
 this tool 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.390
 from here we touch the threshold or whatever 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.610
 that would be the tolerance we can put 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.610
 about 25 would be fine and just 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.220
 we select the color of the chroma 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.920
 we give to suppress and how she gets 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.030
 transparent we already had 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.230
 our 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.230
 to see us selected and 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.090
 cut 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.090
 and this for example 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.870
 already with this we could begin to 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.590
 work pool for example we could 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.470
 put 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.600
 our thumbnail for our videos 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.250
 for example as you see later on the 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.250
 right here we can invest 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.810
 as you see here we can put our 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.900
 video title 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.020
 one example is not much seasick 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.020
 head 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.300
 and I'm going to give red color for example a 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.300
 thing also not very currada 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.889
 and we would only have to give the fund for 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.389
 example this fund and the only thing that 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.340
 we would have to do is pass it to the 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.300
 back and put our background 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.370
 our previous and little more already 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.400
 we would have our miniature and good 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.680
 I will show the other picture that we took 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.490
 circuit so you can see that it works 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.490
 equally good 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.520
 we select the same as before 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.630
 with the color selection tool 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.630
 we give to suppress 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.020
 there it would be and for you to see the cut 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.500
 that has made the rest a perfect 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.500
 there you can see it 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.820
