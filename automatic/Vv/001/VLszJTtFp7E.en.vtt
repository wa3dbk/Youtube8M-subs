this thing's sturdy follow me and I'll
show<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.050> how<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:50.780> started<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:51.930> cutting<00:00:52.199> all

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
show you how in I started by cutting all

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:13.730 
show you how in I started by cutting all
four<00:00:52.680> legs<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.399> roughly

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.679 

my<00:01:14.740> next<00:01:15.039> step<00:01:15.189> was<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.640> cut<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.180> stretches

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
my next step was to cut the stretches

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:34.880 
my next step was to cut the stretches
for<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:16.930> sides<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.680> rough<00:01:17.890> length

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.960 

I<00:01:36.260> set<00:01:37.260> a<00:01:37.290> stop<00:01:37.530> lock<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.100> 12<00:01:38.370> inches<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
I set a stop lock up at 12 inches and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:49.220 
I set a stop lock up at 12 inches and
cut<00:01:39.390> five<00:01:39.659> cross<00:01:40.110> braces

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:02:04.180 

damn<00:01:50.230> splinters

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.580 

I<00:02:04.250> set<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.060> miter<00:02:05.240> saw<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.510> ten<00:02:05.780> degrees<00:02:06.110> and

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
I set the miter saw to ten degrees and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.050 
I set the miter saw to ten degrees and
cut<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.890> stretches<00:02:07.280> from<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.520> sides<00:02:07.730> to

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
cut the stretches from the sides to

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.870 
cut the stretches from the sides to
final<00:02:08.360> length<00:02:08.510> I<00:02:09.040> like<00:02:10.040> to<00:02:10.160> mark<00:02:10.310> all<00:02:10.490> my<00:02:10.610> cuts

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
final length I like to mark all my cuts

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.700 
final length I like to mark all my cuts
so<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.090> get<00:02:11.270> all<00:02:11.420> my<00:02:11.570> angles<00:02:11.870> cut<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.530> right

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
so I get all my angles cut in the right

00:02:12.710 --> 00:03:00.490 
so I get all my angles cut in the right
direction

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.130 

next<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.520> mark<00:03:01.850> all<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> legs<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.690> cut<00:03:02.960> them

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
next I mark all the legs and cut them

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:33.800 
next I mark all the legs and cut them
down<00:03:03.320> to<00:03:03.380> their<00:03:03.650> final<00:03:03.830> length

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.420 

somehow<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.960> made<00:03:35.319> two<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> legs<00:03:35.830> too<00:03:36.130> short

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
somehow I made two of the legs too short

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.610 
somehow I made two of the legs too short
so<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.790> had<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:36.970> start<00:03:37.210> over<00:03:37.330> and<00:03:37.690> make<00:03:38.020> two<00:03:38.260> new

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
so I had to start over and make two new

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:50.920 
so I had to start over and make two new
ones

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.459 

I<00:03:51.879> used<00:03:52.879> my<00:03:53.030> pocket<00:03:53.390> hole<00:03:53.510> jig<00:03:53.540> on<00:03:53.900> all<00:03:54.230> the

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:54.469 
I used my pocket hole jig on all the

00:03:54.469 --> 00:04:10.300 
I used my pocket hole jig on all the
side<00:03:54.650> stretchers

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.479 

I<00:04:11.200> assemble<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.230> sides<00:04:12.560> with<00:04:12.890> glue<00:04:13.220> and

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
I assemble the sides with glue and

00:04:13.489 --> 00:05:02.890 
I assemble the sides with glue and
pocket<00:04:14.120> screws

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.680 

I'm<00:05:03.710> horrible<00:05:04.280> free-handing<00:05:04.940> screws<00:05:05.419> sighs

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
I'm horrible free-handing screws sighs

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.420 
I'm horrible free-handing screws sighs
marked<00:05:06.020> everything<00:05:06.380> before<00:05:06.860> I<00:05:06.889> pre-drilled
