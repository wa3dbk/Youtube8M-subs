to be before Floriana feelin in Spain oh
it's<00:00:57.420> very<00:00:57.630> difficult<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.140> say<00:00:58.490> because<00:00:59.490> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
it's very difficult to say because the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.770 
it's very difficult to say because the
two<00:01:00.120> guys<00:01:00.390> are<00:01:00.630> very<00:01:01.110> very<00:01:01.410> fast<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.540> but<00:01:03.540> they

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
two guys are very very fast and but they

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.810 
two guys are very very fast and but they
have<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.320> front<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.680> them<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.280> will

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
have to be in front of them so it will

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.580 
have to be in front of them so it will
be<00:01:05.970> difficult<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.840> possible<00:01:07.259> it's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
be difficult but it's possible it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
be difficult but it's possible it's
impossible<00:01:08.009> of<00:01:08.640> course<00:01:08.940> those<00:01:09.210> three<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.750> not

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
impossible of course those three and not

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.999 
impossible of course those three and not
gonna<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> all<00:01:10.650> their<00:01:10.680> own<00:01:10.890> way

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
gonna have it all their own way

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
little bit common problems with

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.940 
little bit common problems with
suspension<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.170> then<00:01:54.170> we<00:01:54.289> changed<00:01:54.679> something

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
suspension and then we changed something

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.309 
suspension and then we changed something
at<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.580> second<00:01:56.179> qualifying<00:01:56.569> work<00:01:56.840> better<00:01:57.020> I

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
at the second qualifying work better I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.830 
at the second qualifying work better I
can<00:01:57.979> go<00:01:58.130> good<00:01:58.369> lap<00:01:58.549> times<00:01:58.819> and<00:01:59.119> every<00:01:59.810> time

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
can go good lap times and every time

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.320 
can go good lap times and every time
would<00:02:00.289> look<00:02:00.470> at<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:00.740> time<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.280> last<00:02:02.030> lap<00:02:02.299> was

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
would look at that time so last lap was

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.870 
would look at that time so last lap was
that<00:02:03.319> was<00:02:03.619> little<00:02:04.009> bit<00:02:04.130> hard<00:02:04.399> for<00:02:04.459> me<00:02:04.700> because

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
that was little bit hard for me because

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.090 
that was little bit hard for me because
I<00:02:05.330> had<00:02:05.479> no<00:02:05.630> slip<00:02:05.869> screen<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.350> was<00:02:06.619> also<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:06.979> good

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
I had no slip screen and was also a good

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.960 
I had no slip screen and was also a good
time<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.019> maybe<00:02:09.019> I<00:02:09.170> can<00:02:09.410> go<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.619> gut<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.580> boot

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
time so maybe I can go to gut the boot

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.699 
time so maybe I can go to gut the boot
position<00:02:11.390> but<00:02:11.510> now<00:02:11.780> I'm<00:02:11.930> second<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.530> that's

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
position but now I'm second and that's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
was not good yeah maybe because the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.180 
was not good yeah maybe because the
track<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.390> wide<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.049> it's<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.010> difficult

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
track is so wide and it's a difficult

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.729 
track is so wide and it's a difficult
track<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.790> five<00:02:20.180> weeks<00:02:20.420> not<00:02:20.569> riding<00:02:20.930> sex

qualify<00:02:22.160> was<00:02:22.310> really<00:02:22.489> good<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.860> find<00:02:24.860> faced

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
qualify was really good I find faced

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.960 
qualify was really good I find faced
ways<00:02:25.690> but

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.530 

by<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.690> finest<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:31.790> can<00:02:32.000> be<00:02:32.120> better<00:02:32.300> but

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
by the finest it can be better but

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.490 
by the finest it can be better but
efficient<00:02:33.500> fives<00:02:33.740> must<00:02:34.040> repent<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.610> finish<00:02:35.510> 7<00:02:36.290> 6

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500

plus<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:37.340> ok<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.910> think<00:02:38.570> it's<00:02:38.750> good<00:02:39.380> enough<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.110 

it<00:02:44.620> seems<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.040> everyone<00:02:45.549> fences<00:02:45.969> their

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
it seems that everyone fences their

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.089 
it seems that everyone fences their
chances<00:02:46.540> here<00:02:46.810> in<00:02:46.959> Bruno<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.500> I'm<00:02:47.799> sure<00:02:48.069> the

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
chances here in Bruno and I'm sure the

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.000 
chances here in Bruno and I'm sure the
rest<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.730> 24<00:02:49.209> do<00:02:49.420> as<00:02:49.569> well<00:02:49.810> let's<00:02:50.500> see<00:02:50.709> it's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
rest of the 24 do as well let's see it's
