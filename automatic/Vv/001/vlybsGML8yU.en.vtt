00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.050 
reflection here then you kind of see it
there<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.380> go<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.940> that<00:03:31.180> allows<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.960> to<00:03:33.060> take

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
there you go and that allows you to take

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.570 
there you go and that allows you to take
pictures<00:03:34.330> very<00:03:34.660> easily<00:03:35.070> whether<00:03:36.070> it's<00:03:36.280> still

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
pictures very easily whether it's still

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.130 
pictures very easily whether it's still
photography<00:03:37.480> or<00:03:38.640> videos<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:40.510> that's<00:03:40.930> another

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
photography or videos so that's another

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.180 
photography or videos so that's another
benefit<00:03:41.560> of<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.770> fly<00:03:41.950> grip<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:43.020> i<00:03:44.190> think

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
benefit of the fly grip and i think

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.740 
benefit of the fly grip and i think
that's<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.550> i<00:03:45.610> think<00:03:45.820> that's<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.270> for<00:03:46.300> now<00:03:46.570> i'm

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
that's it i think that's it for now i'm

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.000 
that's it i think that's it for now i'm
going<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.900> be<00:03:46.990> doing<00:03:47.140> some<00:03:47.410> more<00:03:47.590> videos
