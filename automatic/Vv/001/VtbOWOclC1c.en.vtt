 it is not necessary to drill the cartridge 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.719
 all we have to do is place a debate 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.820
 each color to be able to inject 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.280
 the easiest way to be able to locate colors using the anger that brings

 to modify in an act 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.420
 piece of white toilet paper we will realize that you are not 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.170
 painting magenta 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.470
 Which means 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.390
 in that position of the cartridge 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.930
 the panorama is invited 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.890
 with a syringe 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.010
 and we are going to introduce it in this way 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.390
 this kind of cartridges syngenta 3 ml little crazy 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.020
 and we are going to 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.679
 inject in this way 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.200
 playing with the syringe up and down 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.720
 because it's done like this 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.270
 so that the ink we are going to act the fine sponge that only down or only 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.710
 above 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.030
 playing with the subsidiary 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.310
 3 mm 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.700
 like the syringe 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.960
 we cover 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.950
 and we are going to locate now where it's going 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.180
 and in this case 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.619
 on this side of the cartridge 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.829
 also operation we introduce the drug 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.359
 we fight 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.359
 many are two pelé we realize that it is the yellow color 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.489
 come on then the yellow color 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.389
 and the same operation 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:24.939
 we introduce the syringe 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.789
 3 ml tip 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:27.999
 injecting 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.999
 in this way from top to bottom 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.449
 in only 3 of almería 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.789
 we are going to require 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.349
 it means that we only need what is the cyan color 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.949
 and we would be storify it recharges in this mobile position every home 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.149
 they knew 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:49.669
 and in the same way 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.959
 it is advisable to recharge 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.209
 no more 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.609
 Slowly as possible 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.999
 because it may be that the cartridge has ink still at an angle that before the 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.189
 3 ml 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.759
 Well, not anymore 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.709
 no longer need more tip in this case the same 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.709
 they already know 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.799
 like the syringe 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.030
 and another advantage that the president has ink profile and all quote from this 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.349
 type of label 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.039
 in this case it is necessary to place the label cartridges we notice 30 place 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.399
 this ticket 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.389
 that brings remove ink and all 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.559
 which baldoví face for a next recharge where it goes 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.169
 each color 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.579
 we occupy in this way here 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.209
 not only does it account for the next time we required the cartridge 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.929
 it's already located where it's going 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:40.979
 each color 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.149
 and this is the procedure for recharging the HP cartridge and 28 expired
