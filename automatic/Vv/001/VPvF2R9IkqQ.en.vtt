00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 visit the whales to the south coast of 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.330
 state the spectacle that every year 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.620
 attracts people from all corners of the country 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.420
 now comes the presence of other animals 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.429
 some in canton and draws attention 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.590
 because they are difficult to find in 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.120
 Other Bahia beaches are much less 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.130
 friendly and left a lot of people scared 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.080
 but what is really worrying is the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.800
 number of whales stranded in the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.010
 only this year have been seven but only the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.660
 winter arrive for them to appear 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.609
 returning to their origins in the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.579
 archipelago of bollards that whales 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.010
 reproduce and remain until the month of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.800
 November when they return to Antarctica 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.739
 who has seen a mammal of this size 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.789
 save the scene in the civilian memory animals is 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.379
 free with no one is catching on them 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.989
 italy and by the time he comes he goes 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.760
 So this was very exciting for me. 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.690
 The problem is that during the season 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.809
 many whales end up stranding in 2010 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.079
 the humpback whale institute recorded 96 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.909
 cases the highest number in ten years 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.610
 already in 2011 were 39 last year 47 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.130
 whales stranded in 2013 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.520
 just at the beginning of the season there were already ten 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.310
 stranded from these seven in the bay being six 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.290
 them at the southern end of the state 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.530
 if we consider that last year the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.479
 people had 47 on the brazilian coast and 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.759
 most of the stranding occurs in the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.340
 truth in August / September then descend 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.130
 carli already scares people a bit the number 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.220
 of dead whales may be even greater 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.100
 in most cases it happens exactly 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.950
 what was caught in this video are they 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.420
 devoured by sharks which in this case 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.570
 are of the tiger species 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.229
 the Institute estimates that between 10 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.149
 and 15% of the animals arrive to the beach 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.460
 basically with whales and dolphins are 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.649
 two care and keep the animal wet 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.930
 all the time that is very sensitive to 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.360
 increase the temperature and maintain the skin 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.369
 protected from the sun beyond the whales 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.710
 the institute also have 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.590
 registered in dolphin khalis and 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.110
 but this season a species 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.750
 quite different has appeared here on the river 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.140
 and has drawn the attention of 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.530
 residents 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.660
 roriz this is the southern navy a male 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.230
 young woman who measures about a meter 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.510
 seventy and weighs approximately 80 kilos 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.150
 he is not stranded and has made the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.220
 joy of those who have already warned you 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.690
 was also very great satisfaction was 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.550
 hot emotion 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.620
 It was the first time I saw an animal 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.360
 rare to appear here in the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.090
 brazil it only exists in the rio grande do 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.580
 south it is most common in uruguay 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.560
 so he must have climbed up the coast 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.840
 time of year we are having reports 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.400
 also in the holy spirit of wolves 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.709
 marine appearing 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.390
 We could see this animal. 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.180
 saw that he is very chubby too 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.680
 nurtured gives a good look and we 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.239
 wait what time he feels the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.470
 Moment is going to get his way. 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.470
 return person
