thinking about putting a clip from one

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.399 
thinking about putting a clip from one
of<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.879> first<00:03:52.000> scenes<00:03:52.209> like<00:03:52.569> an<00:03:52.720> easy<00:03:53.019> yeah

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
of the first scenes like an easy yeah

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.479 
of the first scenes like an easy yeah
like<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.560> teaser<00:03:53.829> in<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.069> next<00:03:54.250> few<00:03:54.400> weeks

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
like a teaser in the next few weeks

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.789 
like a teaser in the next few weeks
because<00:03:55.420> I've<00:03:55.930> got<00:03:56.079> I've<00:03:56.230> got<00:03:56.260> some<00:03:56.560> videos

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
because I've got I've got some videos

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.089 
because I've got I've got some videos
coming<00:03:57.099> out<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.400> after<00:03:58.329> that<00:03:58.480> I<00:03:59.319> think<00:03:59.950> would

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
coming out and after that I think would

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.280 
coming out and after that I think would
be<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.250> good<00:04:00.370> time<00:04:00.549> so<00:04:00.970> what<00:04:01.269> is<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:01.540> about<00:04:01.659> DC

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
be a good time so what is it about DC

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.020 
be a good time so what is it about DC
that<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.620> like<00:04:02.829> better<00:04:03.069> than<00:04:03.280> I'll<00:04:03.730> tell<00:04:03.939> you

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
that you like better than I'll tell you

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.610 
that you like better than I'll tell you
Paul<00:04:04.180> DC<00:04:04.629> characters<00:04:05.049> don't<00:04:05.260> like<00:04:05.439> kill

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
Paul DC characters don't like kill

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.140 
Paul DC characters don't like kill
people<00:04:05.650> first<00:04:06.340> off<00:04:06.519> they<00:04:06.730> don't<00:04:06.879> like<00:04:06.970> murder

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
people first off they don't like murder

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.880 
people first off they don't like murder
people<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.019> makes<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.290> stories<00:04:08.590> like<00:04:08.739> what

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
people so it makes the stories like what

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.679 
people so it makes the stories like what
more<00:04:09.010> interesting<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.489> feel<00:04:09.670> like<00:04:09.790> they're

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
more interesting I feel like they're

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.509 
more interesting I feel like they're
like<00:04:10.720> more<00:04:11.049> gritty<00:04:11.290> realistic<00:04:11.620> characters<00:04:12.250> I

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
like more gritty realistic characters I

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.830 
like more gritty realistic characters I
think<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:13.000> comedy<00:04:13.359> just<00:04:13.510> works<00:04:13.659> better

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
think the comedy just works better

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.050 
think the comedy just works better
because<00:04:14.109> DC<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:14.829> so<00:04:15.010> inherently<00:04:15.280> like<00:04:15.760> dark

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
because DC is so inherently like dark

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.150 
because DC is so inherently like dark
and<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.570> kind<00:04:17.049> of<00:04:17.079> serious<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:17.739> like<00:04:17.919> when

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
and and kind of serious that like when

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.710 
and and kind of serious that like when
you<00:04:18.250> make<00:04:18.400> fun<00:04:18.579> of<00:04:18.639> it<00:04:18.820> in<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.970> parody<00:04:19.389> it<00:04:19.539> kind

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
you make fun of it in a parody it kind

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.460 
you make fun of it in a parody it kind
of<00:04:19.750> just<00:04:19.900> works<00:04:20.079> better

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
of just works better
