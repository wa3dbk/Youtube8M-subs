research and found these incredible

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.870 
research and found these incredible
ghost<00:01:17.390> stories<00:01:17.810> out<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.500> 14<00:01:18.950> I<00:01:19.250> would<00:01:19.610> say

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
ghost stories out of the 14 I would say

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.320 
ghost stories out of the 14 I would say
I<00:01:20.210> thoroughly<00:01:20.930> enjoyed<00:01:21.620> ten<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.580> them<00:01:22.820> but

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
I thoroughly enjoyed ten of them but

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.690 
I thoroughly enjoyed ten of them but
there<00:01:23.480> was<00:01:23.600> really<00:01:23.780> only<00:01:23.930> one<00:01:24.500> that<00:01:24.920> I<00:01:24.950> found<00:01:25.310> a

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
there was really only one that I found a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.180 
there was really only one that I found a
complete<00:01:26.180> miss<00:01:26.450> for<00:01:26.690> me<00:01:26.840> which<00:01:27.230> I<00:01:27.470> believe<00:01:27.920> was

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
complete miss for me which I believe was

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.280 
complete miss for me which I believe was
a<00:01:28.250> translated<00:01:28.790> work<00:01:29.120> so<00:01:29.420> I'm<00:01:29.540> not<00:01:29.600> sure<00:01:29.810> if<00:01:30.140> it

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
a translated work so I'm not sure if it

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.530 
a translated work so I'm not sure if it
lost<00:01:30.560> something<00:01:31.010> in<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.130> translation<00:01:31.300> but<00:01:32.300> it

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
lost something in the translation but it

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.860 
lost something in the translation but it
was<00:01:32.690> this<00:01:32.840> one<00:01:33.110> here<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.590> liason<00:01:33.830> drug<00:01:34.310> by<00:01:34.870> Jonas

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
was this one here a liason drug by Jonas

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.780 
was this one here a liason drug by Jonas
lie<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.680> I<00:01:37.180> just<00:01:38.180> wasn't<00:01:39.140> very<00:01:39.890> invested<00:01:40.700> in

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
lie that I just wasn't very invested in

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.730 
lie that I just wasn't very invested in
I<00:01:41.060> thought<00:01:41.300> it<00:01:41.450> was<00:01:41.540> quite<00:01:41.780> strange<00:01:42.110> about<00:01:42.680> a

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
I thought it was quite strange about a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.670 
I thought it was quite strange about a
fisherman<00:01:42.980> who<00:01:43.460> harpoons<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.600> seal<00:01:44.960> at<00:01:45.380> some

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
fisherman who harpoons a seal at some

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.880 
fisherman who harpoons a seal at some
point<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.190> seal<00:01:46.430> gets<00:01:46.820> away<00:01:47.500> something<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.770> do

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
point the seal gets away something to do

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.890 
point the seal gets away something to do
with<00:01:49.040> some<00:01:49.250> kind<00:01:49.490> of<00:01:49.730> curse<00:01:50.659> or<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.730> demonic

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
with some kind of curse or a demonic

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
really really good and then the ending

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.920 
really really good and then the ending
ruins<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.470> but<00:02:43.980> most<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.340> these<00:02:44.520> had

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
threshold for scare these might be a

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.170 
threshold for scare these might be a
little<00:03:07.470> more<00:03:07.620> chilling<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.370> others<00:03:08.760> than<00:03:09.060> they

into<00:03:23.580> ghost<00:03:23.790> stories<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.270> general<00:03:24.600> how<00:03:24.750> do<00:03:24.810> you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
into ghost stories in general how do you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.590 
into ghost stories in general how do you
feel<00:03:25.050> about<00:03:25.260> short<00:03:25.800> ghost<00:03:26.100> stories

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
feel about short ghost stories

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.699 
feel about short ghost stories
personally<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.630> think<00:03:27.750> short<00:03:28.200> ghost<00:03:28.410> stories

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
personally I think short ghost stories

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.090 
personally I think short ghost stories
work<00:03:29.100> better<00:03:29.400> than<00:03:30.209> longer<00:03:30.540> ones<00:03:30.870> in<00:03:31.320> general

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
work better than longer ones in general

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.910 
work better than longer ones in general
but<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.970> depends<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.870> what<00:03:33.930> they're<00:03:34.350> going<00:03:34.530> for

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
but it depends on what they're going for

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.259 
but it depends on what they're going for
what<00:03:35.160> they're<00:03:35.280> trying<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.549> achieve<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.239> how

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
what they're trying to achieve and how

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.390
