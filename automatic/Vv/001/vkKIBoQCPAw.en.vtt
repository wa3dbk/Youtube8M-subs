00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.750 
you can see here it is now letting me
broadcast<00:03:40.109> live<00:03:40.650> on<00:03:40.889> blog<00:03:41.160> TV<00:03:41.370> now<00:03:41.609> we're

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
broadcast live on blog TV now we're

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.000 
broadcast live on blog TV now we're
going<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.910> check<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.329> latency<00:03:43.049> check<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
going to check the latency check the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.259 
going to check the latency check the
latency<00:03:44.400> right<00:03:44.549> here<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.650> we'll<00:03:46.650> see<00:03:47.120> are<00:03:48.120> we

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
latency right here and we'll see are we

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.430 
latency right here and we'll see are we
going<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.900> way<00:03:48.930> we're<00:03:49.109> going<00:03:49.200> to<00:03:49.290> check

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
going so the way we're going to check

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.470 
going so the way we're going to check
the<00:03:49.530> latency<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.100> we<00:03:50.609> have<00:03:50.730> another<00:03:50.970> computer

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
the latency is we have another computer

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.000 
the latency is we have another computer
that<00:03:52.079> is<00:03:52.410> connected<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.120> dsl<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.079> we're

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
that is connected to the dsl and we're

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.620 
that is connected to the dsl and we're
going<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.190> see<00:03:56.430> what<00:03:56.760> kind<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.120> lag<00:03:57.359> we

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
going to see what kind of lag we

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.930 
going to see what kind of lag we
experience

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
experience

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.050 
experience
amazing<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:01.370> so<00:04:02.370> as<00:04:02.490> you<00:04:02.610> can<00:04:02.700> tell<00:04:02.760> it's<00:04:03.000> like

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
amazing and so as you can tell it's like

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.060 
amazing and so as you can tell it's like
30<00:04:03.450> seconds<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:03.840> lat<00:04:04.190> Little<00:04:05.190> Miss<00:04:06.530> but<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.860> is

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
30 seconds of lat Little Miss but it is

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.610 
30 seconds of lat Little Miss but it is
a<00:04:08.510> continuous<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:10.380> it's<00:04:10.500> nothing<00:04:10.800> too<00:04:11.040> bad<00:04:12.620> so

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
a continuous so it's nothing too bad so

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.590 
a continuous so it's nothing too bad so
yeah<00:04:13.710> so<00:04:13.980> we'll<00:04:14.100> be<00:04:14.220> able<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:14.430> streamline<00:04:15.180> from

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
yeah so we'll be able to streamline from

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.710 
yeah so we'll be able to streamline from
the<00:04:15.690> road<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.610> I'm<00:04:17.610> excited<00:04:18.180> I'm<00:04:18.660> really

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
the road and I'm excited I'm really

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.200 
the road and I'm excited I'm really
excited
