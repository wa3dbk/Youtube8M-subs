00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.480
 the bad weather in Sierra Nevada provokes 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.330
 the cancellation of the route planned by the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.130

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.920
 safety comes first and it was not plan 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.050
 finish the bones on the asphalt 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.300
 For this reason we decided to visit this 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.099

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.000

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.240
 Alhambra what was a real city 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.980
 walled with a rich palace fortress 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.930
 where the monarch and his court were staying 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.410
 Nazari of the Kingdom of Granada 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.360
 a few centuries ago nowadays 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.690
 It is considered the heritage of the 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.690
 humanity 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.720
 the narrow streets lead us to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.430

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.980

 of the moment something unique the bikes are 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.210
 our conversation how could it be 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 otherwise not in vain they have 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.310
 taken to know us and to enjoy 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.310
 this meeting 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.220
 we continue our walk through the city not 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.380
 without first going to visit the cafeteria 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.480

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.480
 with an exquisite patisserie 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.400
 nightfall and we return to sing where the 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.230
 rest of the group of friends awaits us 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.280
 to share some biker dinners and some 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.280
 spectacular tapas 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.760
 but 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.790
 the next day we did not find water in 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.960
 the road but 150 kilometers of snow 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.960
 this is the southern winter
