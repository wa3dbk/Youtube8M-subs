 mirjam the rich are richer again 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.969
 is that possible yes that is indeed the case 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.410
 I think it is mainly because of the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.580
 stock market going really well and see 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.020
 for example with charlene de 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.990
 carvalho heineken 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.490
 which is really 33 percent extra piece 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.160
 purely because of her ability 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.720
 benefits from the stock prices so okay 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.130
 get rich so rich not because they have something 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.109
 have figured out just because the stock market 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.910
 Pops tomorrow is yes it is also true duel 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.650
 that you make money with money so that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.410
 plays along again but it has too 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.890
 make absolute with favorable stock prices 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.600
 the number five hundred annually 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.460

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.059
 step is this year at 500 and what they 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.010
 capacity the lower limit this year is 54 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.140
 million is that is also what we DJ 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.530

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.910

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.530
 the Netherlands of 10 less that he is on it 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.210
 but in America actually found this 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.710
 well yes there it will be a bit more 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.930

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.000

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.799
 satisfied again to even said of

 Rich songs like this never seem like that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.970

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.159
 and with the ladies come immink whole 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.450

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.680
 at the back man well we are six difficult 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.290
 Tracing that they sometimes proved 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.079
 but yes she definitely has a lot of money 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.090
 in with 200 million and she is the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.250
 widow of jan bols hotel magnate and 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.409

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.030

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.320
 upset village suddenly last year from 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.490
 is absolutely none of what we have 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.520
 nothing inherited because all the money 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.170

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.530
 but yes you can try and fall 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.520
 Of course you would also for numbering 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.979

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.830
 charlene the carvalho heineken who stands 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.840
