given you some basic drawing techniques

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.690 
given you some basic drawing techniques
and<00:00:09.300> tools<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.250> we've<00:00:11.490> done<00:00:11.639> some

life<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.869> I've<00:00:19.109> set<00:00:19.350> up<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:20.010> my<00:00:20.130> table

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
life so I've set up here on my table

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.200 
life so I've set up here on my table
this<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:22.010> plaster<00:00:23.010> Paris<00:00:23.400> sculpture<00:00:24.090> that

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
this little plaster Paris sculpture that

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.870 
this little plaster Paris sculpture that
I'm<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.449> high<00:00:24.630> school<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.650> small<00:00:26.250> book<00:00:26.490> here

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
I'm in high school is a small book here

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.730 
I'm in high school is a small book here
and<00:00:27.029> then<00:00:27.539> we've<00:00:27.660> got<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.840> wooden<00:00:28.109> giraffe<00:00:28.439> his

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
and then we've got a wooden giraffe his

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.460 
and then we've got a wooden giraffe his
name<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.099> Jeffrey<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.019> don't<00:00:31.019> really<00:00:31.109> know<00:00:31.349> if

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
name is Jeffrey I don't really know if

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.720 
name is Jeffrey I don't really know if
it's<00:00:31.529> Jeffrey<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.130> we're<00:00:32.399> going<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.550> use<00:00:32.700> him

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it's Jeffrey but we're going to use him

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
it's Jeffrey but we're going to use him
so<00:00:33.360> what<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.860 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
and<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.180> where<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.570> apply<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and this is where we can apply the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.020 
and this is where we can apply the
gesture<00:00:37.410> drawing<00:00:37.770> technique<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.910> know

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
gesture drawing technique you know

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.959 
gesture drawing technique you know
basically<00:00:39.710> before<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.739> go<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.219> final<00:00:41.579> drawing

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
basically before I go to a final drawing

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.810 
basically before I go to a final drawing
I<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.300> want<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.480> kind<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.780> lay<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.020> what<00:00:43.820> this

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I just want to kind of lay out what this

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790 
I just want to kind of lay out what this
the<00:00:45.450> book<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.960> sculpture<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.500> draft

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the book and the sculpture and the draft

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.069 
the book and the sculpture and the draft
has<00:00:46.980> given<00:00:47.340> me<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.670> kind<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.969> get<00:00:48.239> where<00:00:49.050> I

want to lay everything out ok and see

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.950 
want to lay everything out ok and see
these<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> straight<00:00:54.390> lines<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.870> we

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
these are the straight lines that we

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.260 
these are the straight lines that we
practice<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.500> warm<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
practice and warm up just going here and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.569 
practice and warm up just going here and
I'm<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:58.829> trying<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.070> do<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
I'm just all I'm trying to do is get the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.040 
I'm just all I'm trying to do is get the
gesture<00:01:00.000> right<00:01:00.120> now<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
gesture right now now see this is a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.260 
gesture right now now see this is a
sphere<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.370> bust<00:01:02.609> out<00:01:02.820> into<00:01:03.149> my

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
sphere I can just bust out into my

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.899 
sphere I can just bust out into my
spiral<00:01:03.690> technique<00:01:04.280> get<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
spiral technique get that there and I

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.940 
spiral technique get that there and I
drop<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> straight<00:01:06.540> line<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.500> my<00:01:07.650> spiral

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
drop a straight line here do my spiral

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.260 
drop a straight line here do my spiral
technique<00:01:09.200> here<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.729> kind<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> an<00:01:12.150> odd

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
technique here so this is kind of an odd

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.690 
technique here so this is kind of an odd
shape<00:01:12.299> sculpture<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.890> see<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.400> kind<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
shape sculpture but see if I kind of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.300 
shape sculpture but see if I kind of
look<00:01:14.970> at<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> spiral<00:01:15.869> technique<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.619> see

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
look at it in the spiral technique I see

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.830 
look at it in the spiral technique I see
that<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> kind<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.939> wraps<00:01:18.180> around<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.689> gets

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that it kind of wraps around and gets

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.929 
that it kind of wraps around and gets
bigger<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.290> gets<00:01:19.470> smaller<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.729> I'm<00:01:20.909> going

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
bigger and gets smaller so all I'm going

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.310 
bigger and gets smaller so all I'm going
to<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:22.100> come<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.780> just<00:01:24.780> kind<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.020> pick<00:01:25.170> out

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
to do come in here just kind of pick out

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.109 
to do come in here just kind of pick out
the<00:01:25.470> shave<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> big<00:01:26.700> knot<00:01:26.909> up

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
the shave and it's got a big knot up

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.399 
the shave and it's got a big knot up
there<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> goes<00:01:27.990> back<00:01:28.320> god<00:01:29.189> I'm<00:01:29.310> not<00:01:29.460> here

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
like this ya know the way I've drawn it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.609 
like this ya know the way I've drawn it

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
that's alright because see I'm doing a
concept<00:01:42.270> drawing<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.020> doing<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.409> gesture

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
concept drawing I'm just doing a gesture
