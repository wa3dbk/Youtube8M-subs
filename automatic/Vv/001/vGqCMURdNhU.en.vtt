 maybe a few 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.079
 first reason so viruses 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.539
 the second reason is 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.369
 well nbu aging thousand system folders and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.369
 it is not clear 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.579
 the third reason is the apparatus already 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.509
 temperature rise 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.259

 there are of course and powerful tools to teach 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.240
 tools paid as a rule cube 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.050
 buy buyers 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.950
 no sense was that is 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.450
 No, of course ed therefore us 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.880
 we move on the site 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.040
 patience is no longer a lesson 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.070
 and crossbar daddy at home on the street 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.810

 new 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.789
 reading something else 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.259
 At the moment there is a version 3 24 May 8 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.820
 this moment further 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.660
 download files 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.430

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.899
 sunflower seeds 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.240
 this is a free program 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.470
 I am glad that our channel should be made on 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.310
 unpack the process of forging palkin yes yes 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.360
 we want 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.420
 you know we have a place for example 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.130
 Desktop 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.730
 At this stage I do not want 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.730
 fence I swam a network of clinics 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.099
 further that is in the bunker all daddy 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.729
 us first assessment we can now 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.019
 we have to act 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.760
 here's what the bride does next 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.039
 64 bit versions and third goal 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:26.789
 not in the version that is it 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:28.879
 under operating system 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.329
 basically 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.370
 exposure of persons 8 6 that is to drink two bits 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.489
 invest 6 4 start with a four year 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.889
 here at the moment does not allow 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.889
 he launched this version 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:43.829
 here we are 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.540
 opened suggested not to read yet 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.029
 buy these two chances 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.609
 and then what we do that is the first thing to us 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.889
 you need that loss of tons per year color 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.449
 ooo setting he 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.169
 change the language so that we already understand 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:00.699
 how and where 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.809
 so what are we doing so that we can 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.769
 see tel free 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.669
 further the question is proposed 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.349
 files and folders that we describe 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.439
 we can chant them 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.359
 can not analyze the moment 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.269
 there is also a sentence 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.389
 here it is system files and folders let 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:20.939
 they often 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.389
 here already cooked options she whit 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.279
 does not change as you can just 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.769
 to just blunt the honor of the father 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.869
 standard 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.199
 and we press the analysis and we analyze that is 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.069
 custom 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.259
 Daddy their rules that us 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:36.579
 need that interfere with work 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.509
 but 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.229
 we were offered our closure 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:43.949
 a balcony that is certainly better than 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.869
 procurement program is not worth 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:48.269
 the amount of prices is more thorough but here 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.769
 we analyzed found the right moment 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.549
 pavel and documents 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.549
 not used or just plain 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.869
 a total of 470 million it is clear that what 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.099
 marked the beginning of you 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.879
 group proposes to set m good 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.249
 agree all the first stage she 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:08.379
 builds 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.689
 that is, we will clean the system for now 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.509
 system talk was like 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:14.719
 then there is an application 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.219
 applications but shopkeeper 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:19.389
 also we carry out the analysis we have all this 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.430
 Svendsen together 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.629
 to clean 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.360
 to the registry transitions figures and old 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.249
 there is such a thing 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:29.119
 they hit say the program which 

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:31.389
 keeps all mouths absolutely all data 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.069
 But about programs skirmish tons you 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.669
 computer with them need to be careful with us 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.570
 In principle, ticks all standard 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.680
 Astana 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.300
 and what's the problem 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.919
 dreams can search for problems click 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.479
 Worked in Moscow went search problems as 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.220
 I have someone from the assessment system 7 km 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.449
 there is 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.009
 I went them a little 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.169
 yours may be if but never 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.559
 numerically clean 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:58.880
 just be a year 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.439
 will search for a long time 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.879
 Well Well, we click to fix after that 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.930
 as we have already found all the problems clearly 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.750
 further that is to fix us 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.470
 offers to keep a backup 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.639
 be sure to keep backup 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.280
 copies as if and if to leave some 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.650
 file 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.039
 system file 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.569
 just simply impossible 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.960
 restore the system as a window nettops like 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.159
 roughly speaking 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.179
 we can have this rule 

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:27.319
 recover our investors well in 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.269
 copy of the head remembered Coons 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:30.539
 do 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.869
 we start thous fix marked 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:34.279
 all we have right 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.830
 at the moment we have a sharp 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.159
 brushed himself 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.169
 the problem is so mad 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.499
 that is, m 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:45.169
 everything is a computer then there will be it 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.589
 job discharge 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.960
 on this stage planochka service 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.610
 We watch programs that are installed 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.800
 that he can be sick that is what is the norm that he 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.430
 need to do very often away 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.400
 a shortcut from the desktop to forget by 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.300
 sambo program 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.419
 that is, I after being inadvertently 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:05.729
 current program 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.240
 price again believe clean registries 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.279
 do otherwise 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.610
 together they are different to you mishlin 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.789
 I just need to 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.110
 male principle at this stage that is 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.899
 I use you for free 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:21.889
 it turned out like it was finally better 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:22.459
 good luck to you
