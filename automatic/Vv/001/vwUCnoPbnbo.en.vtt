when<00:00:00.420> I<00:00:00.450> tried<00:00:00.719> to<00:00:00.810> turn<00:00:00.960> it<00:00:01.110> over<00:00:01.230> wasn't

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
when I tried to turn it over wasn't

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.929 
when I tried to turn it over wasn't
running<00:00:01.860> right<00:00:02.010> it<00:00:02.129> was<00:00:02.250> like<00:00:02.370> it<00:00:02.520> was<00:00:02.639> off

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
running right it was like it was off

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.660 
running right it was like it was off
time<00:00:03.330> the<00:00:03.720> power<00:00:03.959> wasn't<00:00:04.230> there<00:00:04.560> then<00:00:05.430> later

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
time the power wasn't there then later

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.639 
time the power wasn't there then later
on<00:00:05.940> as<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.240> was<00:00:06.330> trying<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.540> get<00:00:06.690> gas<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.410> was

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
on as I was trying to get gas to it was

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.530 
on as I was trying to get gas to it was
shooting<00:00:08.429> flame<00:00:08.730> out<00:00:09.000> which<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.389> an

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
shooting flame out which is an

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.680 
shooting flame out which is an
indicative<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.849> problem<00:00:11.849> with<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> timing

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
indicative of a problem with the timing

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.890 
indicative of a problem with the timing
but<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.929> refused<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.650> accept<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.250> first

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
but I refused to accept that at first

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.430 
but I refused to accept that at first
fortunately<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.929> had<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.080> friend<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.379> mine

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
fortunately I had a friend of mine

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.840 
fortunately I had a friend of mine
suggested<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.070> remove<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> distributor<00:00:17.550> cap

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
suggested I remove the distributor cap

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.910 
suggested I remove the distributor cap
maybe<00:00:18.210> check<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> crack<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.470> did<00:00:19.710> I

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
maybe check for a crack so I did I

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.370 
maybe check for a crack so I did I
didn't<00:00:20.730> find<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> crack<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.539> wrote<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.050> ok

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
didn't find the crack I wrote it was ok

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.790 
didn't find the crack I wrote it was ok
but<00:00:22.550> what<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.609> did<00:00:23.760> discover<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
but what I did discover is that the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.609 
but what I did discover is that the
shaft<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.340> saw<00:00:26.580> turn<00:00:26.970> around<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.560> I'm

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
shaft as you saw turn around so so I'm

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.599 
shaft as you saw turn around so so I'm
trying<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.859> figure<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.220> what's<00:00:29.400> wrong<00:00:29.550> with

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
trying to figure out what's wrong with

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.929 
trying to figure out what's wrong with
it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.330 
it
and<00:00:32.719> so<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> am<00:00:34.050> down<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> engine

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
and so there I am down the engine

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.970 
and so there I am down the engine
compartment<00:00:35.550> right<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> discovered<00:00:37.680> when<00:00:37.920> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
compartment right so I discovered when I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.729 
compartment right so I discovered when I
pull<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> distributor<00:00:38.460> off<00:00:39.620> that<00:00:41.059> that

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
pull the distributor off that that

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.080 
pull the distributor off that that
that's<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.040> turning<00:00:44.340> around<00:00:44.430> that's<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
that's just turning around that's the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.760 
that's just turning around that's the
reason<00:00:45.360> why<00:00:45.450> my<00:00:45.480> trucks<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.140> running<00:00:46.469> now<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
reason why my trucks not running now I

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.100 
reason why my trucks not running now I
got<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> take<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.730> take<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> distributor<00:00:49.050> out

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
got to take it take the distributor out

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.889 
got to take it take the distributor out
to<00:00:49.260> figure<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.680> why<00:00:49.890> that's<00:00:50.219> doing<00:00:50.550> that

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
to figure out why that's doing that

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.119 
to figure out why that's doing that
hopefully<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.199> something<00:00:52.320> easy<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.860> shaft

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
hopefully it's something easy the shaft

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.430 
hopefully it's something easy the shaft
broken<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.550> distributor<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:55.289> know<00:00:55.379> I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
broken the distributor if not you know I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.930 
broken the distributor if not you know I
maybe<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> gear<00:00:55.920> broke<00:00:56.129> where<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> cams<00:00:56.699> out

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
maybe the gear broke where the cams out

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.130 
maybe the gear broke where the cams out
who<00:00:57.120> knows<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:57.570> that's<00:00:57.719> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> cost

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
who knows what that's going to cost

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.819 
who knows what that's going to cost
right<00:00:59.149> anyway<00:01:00.149> that's<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.199> fun<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.530> having

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
right anyway that's the fun I'm having

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.730 
right anyway that's the fun I'm having
today<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> thought<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> simple<00:01:07.380> case

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
today so I thought it was a simple case

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
today so I thought it was a simple case
of<00:01:07.770> replacing<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.750> o-ring<00:01:11.240> on<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
of replacing this o-ring on the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.130 
of replacing this o-ring on the
distributor<00:01:12.960> shaft<00:01:13.729> housing<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.049> put<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
distributor shaft housing here put it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
distributor shaft housing here put it
down<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.470> there<00:01:16.619> because<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.950> come<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.610> find

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
down in there because it's come to find

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
down in there because it's come to find
out<00:01:18.950> if<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:21.110> hold<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:24.080> I'm<00:01:25.080> use

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
out if I hold that on there I'm use

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.070 
out if I hold that on there I'm use
these<00:01:25.680> pliers<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:27.330> course<00:01:27.540> I'm<00:01:27.780> holding

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
these pliers here of course I'm holding

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.460 
these pliers here of course I'm holding
the<00:01:28.140> camera<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.689> as<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.020> I'm<00:01:31.259> holding

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the camera so as you can see I'm holding

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.660 
the camera so as you can see I'm holding
that<00:01:31.650> shaft<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:33.170> anyhow<00:01:35.119> this<00:01:37.670> turning

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that shaft there anyhow this turning

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.340 
that shaft there anyhow this turning
here<00:01:38.909> isn't<00:01:39.270> supposed<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.689> happening<00:01:39.930> when

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
here isn't supposed to be happening when

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.870 
here isn't supposed to be happening when
I'm<00:01:40.530> holding<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> shaft<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.340> bottom<00:01:41.729> it's

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
I'm holding the shaft in the bottom it's

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.609 
I'm holding the shaft in the bottom it's
turning<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.270> top<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:45.229> don't<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.409> why

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
turning up top here so I don't know why

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.760 
turning up top here so I don't know why
it's<00:01:46.920> doing<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:48.320> understand<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.649> all

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
it's doing that I understand that at all

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.630 
it's doing that I understand that at all
anyhow<00:01:52.770> I'm<00:01:52.829> gonna<00:01:52.950> have<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> replace<00:01:53.399> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
anyhow I'm gonna have to replace this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.130 
anyhow I'm gonna have to replace this
distributor<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.630> can't<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
distributor because I can't get the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.480 
distributor because I can't get the
housing<00:01:55.530> out<00:01:55.649> without<00:01:55.950> taking<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.310> all

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
housing out without taking this all

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.760 
housing out without taking this all
apart<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:58.049> don't<00:01:58.200> feel<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.469> doing<00:01:58.680> all

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
apart I just don't feel like doing all

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
apart I just don't feel like doing all
that
