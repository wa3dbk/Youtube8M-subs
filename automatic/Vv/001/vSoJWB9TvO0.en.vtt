00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
really like the regular scope but we're

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.660

gonna give it a shot either way and see
how<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.660> what<00:00:54.809> about<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.110> what

how we do here but what about you what
is<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.500> favorite<00:00:55.949> scoop<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.760> game<00:00:57.149> i

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
is your favorite scoop on this game i

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
is your favorite scoop on this game i
really<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> variable<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:59.190> notch<00:00:59.550> i

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730

really like the variable first notch i
think<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.000> kind<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> cool<00:01:00.480> scope<00:01:00.859> it

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
think that's kind of a cool scope it

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.889 
think that's kind of a cool scope it
does<00:01:02.100> come<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.609> pretty<00:01:02.850> handy<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.690> i<00:01:03.719> know<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.809 
people cause it's a lot of fun usually
if<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.350> know<00:01:58.409> we'd<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.069> an<00:01:59.189> update<00:01:59.520> like

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
if I know we'd have like an update like

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.550 
if I know we'd have like an update like
you<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.360> big<00:02:00.840> update<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.319> start

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
you have a really big update to start

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.789 
you have a really big update to start
the<00:02:01.679> game<00:02:02.659> but<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.869> haven't<00:02:04.049> had<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.439> yet<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the game but we haven't had one yet and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.160 
the game but we haven't had one yet and
I<00:02:04.890> feel<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.459> is<00:02:05.579> because<00:02:05.959> they've<00:02:06.959> got

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
I feel like that is because they've got

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949 
I feel like that is because they've got
to<00:02:07.259> fix<00:02:07.439> all<00:02:07.709> the<00:02:07.890> spawns<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.759> really<00:02:09.539> do<00:02:09.720> think

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
to fix all the spawns I really do think

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.990 
to fix all the spawns I really do think
that<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.379> like<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.860> big<00:02:11.129> big<00:02:11.489> thing<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.849> it's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
that is like a big big thing and it's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.580 
that is like a big big thing and it's
got<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> take<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> while<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:12.900> that's<00:02:13.200> why<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.379> feel

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
got to take a while so that's why I feel

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.869 
got to take a while so that's why I feel
like<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:13.830> don't<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.250> update<00:02:14.519> yanks<00:02:14.760> i'm

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
like we don't have the update yanks i'm

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.550 
like we don't have the update yanks i'm
pretty<00:02:15.090> sure<00:02:15.269> usually<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.720> an<00:02:15.780> update<00:02:16.079> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
pretty sure usually get an update the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.710 
pretty sure usually get an update the
first<00:02:16.829> day<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.549> know<00:02:17.880> cuz<00:02:18.090> people<00:02:18.450> got<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
first day you know cuz people got the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720 
first day you know cuz people got the
game<00:02:18.900> early<00:02:19.069> they<00:02:20.069> usually<00:02:20.220> get<00:02:20.430> an<00:02:20.519> update

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
game early they usually get an update

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.490 
game early they usually get an update
pretty<00:02:21.000> early<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:22.079> fixes<00:02:22.349> everything

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
pretty early and it fixes everything

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.050 
pretty early and it fixes everything
that's<00:02:22.920> all<00:02:23.069> all<00:02:23.099> these<00:02:23.370> problems<00:02:23.579> to<00:02:23.910> play

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
that's all all these problems to play

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.970 
that's all all these problems to play
that<00:02:24.239> but<00:02:24.420> because<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.079> not<00:02:25.230> here<00:02:25.410> yet<00:02:25.440> I

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
that but because it's not here yet I

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.100 
that but because it's not here yet I
honestly<00:02:26.519> think<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.239> know<00:02:27.329> messing

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
honestly think that you know messing

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.300 
honestly think that you know messing
with<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> spawns<00:02:28.650> fixing<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.069> spawns

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
with the spawns fixing the spawns

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.900 
with the spawns fixing the spawns
because<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.440> big<00:02:31.440> deal<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:32.040> really<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.579> so

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
because it is a big deal it really is so

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.520 
because it is a big deal it really is so
I<00:02:33.180> hope<00:02:33.630> that's<00:02:33.900> what<00:02:34.079> they're<00:02:34.200> doing<00:02:34.410> I'm

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
I hope that's what they're doing I'm

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.140 
I hope that's what they're doing I'm
hoping<00:02:34.739> that's<00:02:34.860> why<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.099> only<00:02:35.459> days<00:02:35.760> take<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
hoping that's why the only days take it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.089 
hoping that's why the only days take it
so<00:02:36.299> long<00:02:36.480> because<00:02:36.750> once<00:02:37.290> they<00:02:37.440> fix<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.829> spawns

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
so long because once they fix the spawns

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.819 
so long because once they fix the spawns
oh<00:02:38.489> my<00:02:38.700> god<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.060> game<00:02:39.299> is<00:02:39.660> gonna<00:02:40.590> be

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
oh my god this game is gonna be

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.740 
oh my god this game is gonna be
incredible<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:42.090> I'm<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.720> excited

incredible it really is I'm so excited
for<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.410> because<00:02:43.590> that's<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.010> only

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
for that because that's the only

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.280 
for that because that's the only
downside<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.000> game<00:02:45.209> right<00:02:45.360> now<00:02:45.420> it's<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
downside to this game right now it's the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.180 
downside to this game right now it's the
bad<00:02:46.440> spawns<00:02:47.090> it's<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.359> not<00:02:48.780> not<00:02:49.440> good<00:02:49.739> so

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
bad spawns it's just not not good so

00:02:50.190 --> 00:03:01.309 
bad spawns it's just not not good so
it's<00:02:50.609> not<00:02:50.760> good<00:02:59.780> what<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.870> kill<00:03:01.049> with<00:03:01.109> twice

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
it's not good what you kill with twice

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.490 
it's not good what you kill with twice
what<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.709> kill<00:03:01.950> me<00:03:02.040> twice<00:03:02.359> what<00:03:03.359> is<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.810> what

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
what you kill me twice what is for what

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.300 
what you kill me twice what is for what
