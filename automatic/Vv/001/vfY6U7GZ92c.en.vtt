00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.110
 have you ever wondered what to do 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.870
 this cable actually needs you 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.340
 called y plug are wonderful then you are 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.230
 you're right here with this video 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.030
 I warmly welcome you to 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
 This video is about how 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.680
 you have two amplifiers on one output 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.109
 then so now a cd player 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.939
 computer a mixer a mobile phone completely 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.980
 no matter how you stop two 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.840
 amplifier goes on to do it 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.840
 have fun in this video today 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.640
 u 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.350
 used for a notebook or mobile phone 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.960
 you are then usually a child im 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.600
 Connecting cable this is the one 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.980
 end in the headphone output of the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.470
 cell phones or just stop or even stop 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.170
 Notebooks are coming and on the other 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.550
 side we have these exits bin 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.460
 Here they come to the stop 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:47.530
 amplifiers make this easy 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:50.300
 So it is the computer muddy 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.619
 amplifier connected and the whole 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.200
 signal it also a second one 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.930
 we pass on the amplifier 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.560
 We take a trick now 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.630
 just a second interest body and that 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.420
 in any exit of the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.740
 amplifier most amplifiers 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.530
 have an exit like for example 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.200
 for the take out or or even dvd 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.120
 player or something like that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.120
 I also take a car here 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.879
 here we pass on the signal 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.879
 Here's the other end of Kabin's interest 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.409
 Keep that up until the next one 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.480
 reinforce and choose us here 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:47.150
 x-any input from i take now 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:50.000
 Just cd here and then that's it 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.569
 even the signal comes from now 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.549
 computer from the headphone output to the 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.200
 first amplifier will then 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.480
 forwarded to the next 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.150
 amplifier and that was the whole thing too 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.709
 already the man two amplifiers at one 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.919
 output to stand or 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:11.659
 a headphone jack from the notebook is 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:14.569
 not really not rocket science 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.799
 difficult so I hope so 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.750
 I could do one or the other now 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.980
 help has, after all, a 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.480
 I wished for that yesterday 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.799
 some he makes like two amplifiers 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.599
 a cd player or something then 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.340
 Can do it with this method 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.760
 Of course you can show that, too 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.340
 do 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.049
 no problem but if you go now 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.269
 for example a mixer or something like that 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.069
 you should already use the y plug 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.069
 when I say that the volume 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:44.199
 clear everything that was it for this 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.199
 Video much fun or shock
