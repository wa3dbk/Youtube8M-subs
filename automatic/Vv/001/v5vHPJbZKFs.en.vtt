00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.760
 thesis number four 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.889
 That is how dr father and mother finds us 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.000
 deal with arguments 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.639
 and the procedure 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.859
 my name is gerlach i am thesis 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.689
 coach since 2003 the goal is one 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.490
 professor as a supervisor at one 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.779
 german college for an external 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.119
 dissertation 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.240
 So it's not about a one 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.460
 to accomodate foreign college 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.140
 there are prerequisites for this 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.090
 formal requirement is 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.930
 i need a university degree with the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.730
 note 2 3 and better then there is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.020
 personal requirements i need 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.980
 time and energy and I need 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.640
 Methodological competence, either I have the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.530
 already or I own it to me 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.250
 Let's look at the ways to get there 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.020
 basically five ways away is number 1 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.329
 my supervisor of the master thesis or 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.520
 Diploma work is also the care 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.040
 my doctoral thesis 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.630
 the way 2 the colleague of my supervisor 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.110
 becomes dr father or dr mother the way 3 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.479
 is a known professor or one 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.720
 professor of his mentors chefs 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.460
 known friend's family member 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.850
 becomes supervisor of the doctoral thesis 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.860
 he stimulates 4 i speak the expert in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.100
 my subject because I myself 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.960
 expert in the subject bin the way 5 is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.890
 a so-called cold response so 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.540
 without contacts 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.659
 that is not recommended though 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.900
 sometimes the only one because we look 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.960
 we have the hurdles of professors in 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.430
 usually little time they have too 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.500
 little motivation 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.799
 this is a country project it takes 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.840
 long and the exit is uncertain so 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.540
 whether you are looking for your own research 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.750
 gain your own reputation 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.259
 uncertainty is a risk and professors 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.880
 internal doctoral students prefer because of the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.550
 you can support them because they are in the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.920
 look there are many arguments for 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.190
 supervisor 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.860
 I have great data as a candidate 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.870
 or the access to it I have great 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.490
 contacts 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.210
 I have already done something inside 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.910
 i need little care we look 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.890
 give us a closer look at the arguments 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.500
 I have great data or access 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.350
 in addition in my company there are such 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.750
 data or i can collect such data 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.710
 in the company with customer partners and 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.820
 so on I can ask people how 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.110
 hardly anyone else comes in 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.120
 I have great contacts 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.310
 I work with people who 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.480
 are relevant or about you 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.460
 win an interview partner 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.530
 many argument 3 i have turned down 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.150
 already done something 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.960
 which means I have something already on the subject 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.470
 released 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.150
 I am certified in this area 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.140
 I give lectures on the topic 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.500
 iks the killer argument 4 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.210
 i need little care i am 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.850
 used to structured work 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.140
 I prepare documents so that little 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.840
 to be considered by the side of 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.670
 mentor I already have a precise 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.110
 Presentation of the project and I have 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.090
 I have already raised the level of research 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.680
 So I've already dealt with it 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.600
 that shows the seriousness 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.810
 Let 's take a look at this now 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.610
 Step 1 I put the topic area 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.190
 firmly 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:41.950
 parenting online marketing event 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.060
 marketing metrics systems 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.580
 programming languages ​​whatever me 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.620
 I'm interested in researching 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.959
 potential caregivers on the internet so on 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.310
 colleges 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.600
 I research the main topics of the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.980
 Candidates I can see that in the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.180
 Publication I sketch 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.800
 research project my research project 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.630
 with research question data input and 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.340
 Working topic I make an appointment 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.120
 best with a contact person so 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.160
 not cold and I present then 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.250
 my sketch with the goal the caretaker 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.340
 to win 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.340
 how can studio help with the search 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.300
 We can search for candidates 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.449
 Can evaluate candidates together 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.949
 We can work together to make a sketch for that 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.310
 to create a research project 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.460
 We can do the conversation together 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.370
 to prepare 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.789
 we can share the exposé 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.750
 work and we can research all 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.289

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.199
 that we do not do your work 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.509
 intellectual work but we 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.080
 consider it as a sparring partner as 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:58.030
 We are not looking for coaches either 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.699
 doctor fathers that can only be self 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.460
 but we can do it 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.830
