breastfeeding mind you um but I think

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.189 
breastfeeding mind you um but I think
that<00:00:28.980> that's<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.060> most<00:00:30.090> important<00:00:30.630> thing<00:00:30.840> for

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199

them<00:00:31.410> right<00:00:31.830> now<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.730> me<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:33.059> it's

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
them right now and for me because it's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.330

allowing me to bond with them it's

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.090

I could before

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.040 
I could before
like<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.630> just<00:02:07.900> recently<00:02:08.170> shaved<00:02:08.920> my<00:02:09.640> whole

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
like I just recently shaved my whole

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.380 
like I just recently shaved my whole
private<00:02:11.050> area<00:02:11.410> because<00:02:11.890> prior<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.150> was

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
private area because prior to that I was

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.050 
private area because prior to that I was
a<00:02:13.450> little<00:02:13.600> nervous<00:02:14.170> with<00:02:14.470> my<00:02:14.800> incision<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:16.030> I

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
a little nervous with my incision so I

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.090 
a little nervous with my incision so I
didn't<00:02:16.330> really<00:02:16.420> want<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.720> shave<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.470> top<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:17.980> it

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
didn't really want to shave on top of it

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.540 
didn't really want to shave on top of it
because<00:02:18.250> my<00:02:18.520> incision<00:02:19.410> line<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:20.740> lower<00:02:21.160> than

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
because my incision line is lower than

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.220 
because my incision line is lower than
the<00:02:21.700> incision<00:02:22.150> line<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> surgery<00:02:23.050> which

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
the incision line of the surgery which

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.130 
the incision line of the surgery which
is<00:02:23.380> already<00:02:23.800> pretty<00:02:24.040> low<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.750> since<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:25.959> was

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
is already pretty low so since that was

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.960 
is already pretty low so since that was
still<00:02:26.470> healing<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.130> really<00:02:27.520> didn't<00:02:27.760> want<00:02:27.910> to

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
still healing I really didn't want to

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.120 
still healing I really didn't want to
you<00:02:28.270> know<00:02:28.300> take<00:02:28.720> any<00:02:28.930> chances<00:02:29.380> by<00:02:29.530> shaving<00:02:29.830> but

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
you know take any chances by shaving but

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.550 
you know take any chances by shaving but
a<00:02:30.310> couple<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.700> days<00:02:30.850> ago<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.360> did<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.260> went

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
a couple of days ago I did and it went

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.290 
a couple of days ago I did and it went
fine

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
fine

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.920 
fine
so<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.380> started<00:02:35.760> exfoliating<00:02:36.760> on<00:02:37.060> my<00:02:37.630> belly

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
so I started exfoliating on my belly

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.220 
so I started exfoliating on my belly
where<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.739> did<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.550> stretch<00:02:39.850> marks<00:02:40.269> so<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.080> I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
where I did have stretch marks so that I

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.400 
where I did have stretch marks so that I
can<00:02:41.410> apply<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.709> oil<00:02:41.980> on<00:02:42.340> top<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:44.019> the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
can apply the oil on top of that and the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.229 
can apply the oil on top of that and the
way<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.680> I've<00:02:44.769> been<00:02:44.800> exfoliating<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.820> just

way that I've been exfoliating is just
dry<00:02:46.600> brushing<00:02:47.140> which<00:02:47.350> is<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:47.800> getting<00:02:47.980> a

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
let's get back to the video which by the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.229 
let's get back to the video which by the
way<00:03:57.650> when<00:03:58.069> it<00:03:58.159> comes<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.519> breastfeeding<00:03:59.000> I

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
way when it comes to breastfeeding I

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.780 
way when it comes to breastfeeding I
really<00:03:59.900> have<00:04:00.170> not<00:04:00.409> been<00:04:00.470> pumping<00:04:01.190> as<00:04:01.370> much<00:04:01.609> as

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
really have not been pumping as much as

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.089 
really have not been pumping as much as
I<00:04:01.909> should<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.540> it's<00:04:03.440> probably<00:04:03.799> because<00:04:04.010> I

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
I should and it's probably because I

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.369 
I should and it's probably because I
feel<00:04:04.430> like<00:04:04.459> I'm<00:04:04.879> breastfeeding<00:04:05.150> all<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:06.019> time

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
feel like I'm breastfeeding all the time

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.360 
feel like I'm breastfeeding all the time
already

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
already

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.180 
already
I<00:04:07.400> mean<00:04:07.670> having<00:04:08.000> twins<00:04:08.389> it's<00:04:09.170> like<00:04:09.440> like<00:04:10.010> right

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
I mean having twins it's like like right

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.879 
I mean having twins it's like like right
now<00:04:10.370> for<00:04:10.400> instance<00:04:10.690> Adriana<00:04:11.690> got<00:04:12.230> milk<00:04:12.620> and

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
now for instance Adriana got milk and

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.369 
now for instance Adriana got milk and
Ava's<00:04:13.609> still<00:04:13.760> sleeping<00:04:14.389> so<00:04:14.569> since<00:04:15.230> they

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
Ava's still sleeping so since they

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.830 
Ava's still sleeping so since they
didn't<00:04:15.709> get<00:04:15.799> milk<00:04:16.039> at<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.280> same<00:04:16.489> time

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
didn't get milk at the same time

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.750 
didn't get milk at the same time
sometimes<00:04:17.840> I'm<00:04:18.380> doing<00:04:18.440> it<00:04:18.919> like<00:04:19.130> back<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.430> back

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
sometimes I'm doing it like back to back

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.250 
sometimes I'm doing it like back to back
to<00:04:19.970> back<00:04:20.090> which<00:04:20.359> feels<00:04:20.660> like<00:04:20.780> I'm<00:04:21.019> always

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
to back which feels like I'm always

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.040 
to back which feels like I'm always
doing<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:21.919> so<00:04:22.610> it's<00:04:22.970> much<00:04:23.240> better<00:04:23.449> if<00:04:23.720> I<00:04:23.870> have

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
doing it so it's much better if I have

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.839 
doing it so it's much better if I have
them<00:04:24.199> in<00:04:24.320> sync<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:25.010> try<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.310> feed<00:04:25.639> them

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
them in sync and I try to feed them

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.060 
them in sync and I try to feed them
together<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:27.020> try<00:04:27.229> to<00:04:27.289> do<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.620> as<00:04:27.740> much<00:04:27.919> as

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
together and I try to do that as much as

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.620 
together and I try to do that as much as
possible<00:04:28.280> but<00:04:28.669> it<00:04:28.789> doesn't<00:04:29.030> always<00:04:29.150> work<00:04:29.270> out

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
possible but it doesn't always work out

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.350 
possible but it doesn't always work out
that<00:04:29.690> way<00:04:30.020> but<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:31.070> really<00:04:31.340> do<00:04:31.639> need<00:04:31.849> to<00:04:31.910> try<00:04:32.240> to

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
that way but I really do need to try to

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.360 
that way but I really do need to try to
pump<00:04:32.900> more<00:04:33.199> because<00:04:33.590> it's<00:04:33.830> gonna<00:04:33.979> give<00:04:34.190> me<00:04:34.340> a

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
pump more because it's gonna give me a

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.210 
pump more because it's gonna give me a
lot<00:04:34.490> more<00:04:34.699> flexibility<00:04:35.419> in<00:04:35.740> doing<00:04:36.740> things<00:04:36.979> and

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
lot more flexibility in doing things and

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.740 
lot more flexibility in doing things and
leaving<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.610> house<00:04:37.760> and<00:04:38.120> running<00:04:38.389> errands

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
leaving the house and running errands

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.550 
leaving the house and running errands
and<00:04:38.960> whatnot

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
and whatnot

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.950 
and whatnot
so<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.580> have<00:04:40.729> to<00:04:40.910> definitely<00:04:41.389> work<00:04:41.570> on<00:04:41.780> that

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
so I have to definitely work on that

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.349 
so I have to definitely work on that
more
