00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.080
 beiges today I 'm doing it from a 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.460
 different point of view I'm in the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.859
 table instead of being in front of the table 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.570
 and I wanted to do it because this is a 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.849
 Farewell month this is a month of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.410
 farewell to the plate will be the last 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.689
 that I recorded on this plate since we 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.850
 we change the truth that gives me enough 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.260
 I remember that first video that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.000
 I recorded here on this plate or in this 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.640
 kind of dish because it does not stop being 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.350
 the living room of a house with a cardboard wall 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 back and you're no no more 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.280
 mystery but good to evolve a 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.050
 heap the channel from that day and the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 really it is giving me some grief 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.010
 say goodbye to this dish but good 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.720
 idea is that the thing go more than the thing 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.100
 go better and throughout the month and grace 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.080
 discovering what these will be 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.160
 improvements but good we go to the beginning 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.990
 of the month that we are going to have 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.610
 long this month 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.280
 first one thing that I had pending and 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.930
 are the Spanish authors here we have 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.729
 several titles of Spanish authors that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.479
 I have been sending some in the last 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.770
 month 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.390
 others that I have for several 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.390
 months as is the case of omerta that already 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.400
 play and good are are several games 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.260
 Spaniards who will go through it for the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.360
 channel along this month some in 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.780
 analysis others let's take some 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.820
 part of it and good is something that had 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.700
 pending for a long time and wanted 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.170
 dedicating a month to Spanish authors is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.479
 true that throughout the months that 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.790
 the channel always appears some 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.890
 the odd game of Spanish author 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.210
 but I wanted a month to dedicate it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 especially this does not mean that no 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.170
 there will be other games in the channel 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.700
 authors from outside of Spain but yes that 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.650
 it's going to be a specially dedicated month 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.030
 this to these authors so if you are 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.039
 seeing these Spanish authors who 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.830
 You know that this month we're going to talk about 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.590
 your games this on the one hand 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.090
 of this I have also another surprise another 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.179
 our ad I will set aside for here 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.560
 role but not the role in the way that 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.670
 you are used to other channels of 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.380
 the usual way we will not do 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.720
 games are not going to analyze games or 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.330
 much less because we are neophytes 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.250
 in the subject we are some of the role 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.470
 we played very little the role and as 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.540
 I say we are newbies what we are going to 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.510
 to do is a small series a small 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.400
 series that mixes fiction and reality 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.340
 in which we will try to discover 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.500
 what is the role the series surely 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.120
 start over this month 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.040
 and well I do not want to disclose much 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.390
 attentive to the channel because I think that you 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.220
 will like apart from all 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.840
 usual sections including the new 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.420
 newscast the playful the new format 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.280
 As you know, it will include two months 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.959
 we will premiere this in this month of 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.940
 June I also take this opportunity to invite you to 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.590
 listen to the apecast podcast I leave the link 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.109
 down here you can access the web where 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.510
 is the last ap podcast and all the 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.980
 we make them live 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.540
 I also invite you to listen to them live 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.299
 and participate in the chat to interact 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.950
 with us and well we laugh 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.909
 and then in terms of days this month the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.030
 truth is that the thing is a bit 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.920
 Paradita we have Celebes dry in 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.450
 some forms that are basically 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.170
 Days of throwing a weekend 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.269
 playing colom without stopping I will not do 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.430
 nothing very special there because as I say 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.920
 it's to play and it's already good 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.989
 I will take the small lake small but 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.370
 china the chin pro and good the idea is 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.690
 record a bit the impressions of the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.190
 people who are there and record some 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.900
 starting with a little thing to make it a 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.449
 quick assembly of how the event has been 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.130
 one last thing I left the best for 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.920
 the 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.320
 this month we also have exclusivity 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.660
 we have three exclusives that he has given us 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.490
 it's three exclusives that you're only going to be able to 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.490
 see here in analysis paralysis here in 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:39.580
 Spanish and I'm talking about the first 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.580
 expansion for empire colonists 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.989
 the Dragon 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.989
 Y 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.270
 the first ex com in Spanish 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.380
 all right 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.430
 full 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.910
 that's all be aware of the channel and we 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.780
 we see in the next video that I have 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.780
 to disassemble the set 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.990
 hello perodic here I am with a video 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.270
 more good I should say better with a 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.100
 pretty special video because today you 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.860
 I welcome the analysis dish 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.180
 paralysis yes I know it's not a big deal but 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.560
 what I could enable here in the 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.050
 catacumbas of house I have put a little 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.240
 of light a table the rug by the way is 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.740
 good quality and the only thing that makes 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.300
 lack is something of heating because the 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.840
 it's really cold and good 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.460
 there are leaks 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.110
 that will fix it little by little 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.940
 also what you need is a bit of 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.760
 decoration because as you can see the walls 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.440
 they are a little things and here I have something 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.760
 to start 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.760
 my dear pimp
