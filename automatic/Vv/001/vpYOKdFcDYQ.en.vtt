00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 the two and a half hours together in waiting 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.210
 the transfer market now 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.670
 still the news protagonist 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.139
 all rumors and negotiations 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.849
 that maybe next week 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.549
 they will go to port 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.340
 But let's start as usual from those 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.260
 who criticize the club and players do not 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.590
 Rome may be fans of the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.289
 worse are said Lazio foses one 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.210
 beaten a heavy sentence who knows 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.119
 we will discuss during our course 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.619
 broadcast we will do it with two guests 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.020
 that they came to find in the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.969
 study 1 of milan good evening 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.559
 faithful of the sports courier with the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.440
 monica wax good evening to ours 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.890
 viewers and good evening also ad 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.469
 andrea rota consultant and deepen 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.329
 then also these dynamics but we will have 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.149
 way to deepen all the items 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.850
 coming from various retreats we will do it 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.649
 directly with alberto saints from 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 editorial staff is paris saint germain e 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.489
 barcelona seemed in the last hours 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.469
 probably the paris in will have the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 better but we compliment 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.229
 stern for the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 milestone reached for the trophy of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.710
 best player of the tournament 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.600
 let's start right from the juventus 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.320
 let us be furious with the words of beppe 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.250
 marotta 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.830
 we must believe that neither jovetic 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.750
 n diamonds at this point will come to 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.420
 turin on jovetic paypal quoto robinho 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.280
 bojan is the same niang and and who has 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.290
 marked with sheets or even with 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.520
 balotelli in the field then another mistake 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.409
 or just on the occasion of 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.600
 presentation of the Milan shirts 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.750
 adriano galliani has closed 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.450
 definitely the doors to the negotiation 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.910
 for accounts but let's take a step back 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.440
 let's go back to juve andrea to conclude 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.690
 the speech 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.399
 la juve is certainly for the moment the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.289
 the team the queen of the market 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.470
 who moved first 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.990
 perhaps only one is missing 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.539
 pawn or an external seen that in 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.850
 defense we looked at the purchases 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.860
 insertion in attack in defense 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.380
 to the insertion of bona angel 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.140
 practically to them only the outside but 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.270
 there, too, there would be a tug of war 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.780
 another arm wrestling maybe kolarova 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.020
 the juventus and isla passes to the inter 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.060
 must agree I draw inspiration from 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.890
 previous transmission waiting 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.400
 transfer market because with our guests 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.060
 we practically talked about the duo though 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.040
 we want the toraz from whom we can 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.910
 wait more and all my guests e 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.090
 they told me thriving but I am a lot 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.700
 wary of Spanish football because e 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.130
 on the Spanish because 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.830
 and a soccer obviously contaminated only 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.990
 from two real madrid and barcelona teams 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.180
 the best remain at the real madrid al 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.850
 barcelona the milan tried in 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.960
 clumsy or surely little 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.630
 edifying 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.910
 the bojan experiment that turned out to be a 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.160
 baby playing among the greats also for 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.560
 a proper morphological question 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.480
 enough and video certainly is but 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.740
 we will see now we go to the editorial office alberto 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.090
 many real tiziano leave so many pawns 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.040
 of the department one can the risks a 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.150
 overbooking that can create you 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.940
 problems at the level 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.510
 he wanted to go 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.370
 to the inter they continue to meet 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.570
 it seems the two companies still have a 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.540
 agreement was not reached 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.240
 basha the relationships between initiate presented 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.460
 tonight right in the retreat of 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.570
 pinzolo we'll talk about it right after the 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.570
