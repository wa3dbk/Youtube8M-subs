urban warfare in the future the system
can<00:05:32.010> only<00:05:32.130> improve<00:05:32.389> in<00:05:33.389> addition<00:05:33.780> to

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
can only improve in addition to

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.840 
can only improve in addition to
scattering<00:05:34.199> after<00:05:34.620> a<00:05:34.650> shot<00:05:34.949> you<00:05:35.610> can<00:05:35.639> imagine

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
scattering after a shot you can imagine

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.969 
scattering after a shot you can imagine
all<00:05:36.090> sorts<00:05:36.120> of<00:05:36.389> unscripted<00:05:36.840> behavior<00:05:37.380> for

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
all sorts of unscripted behavior for

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.100 
all sorts of unscripted behavior for
example<00:05:38.400> rather<00:05:39.240> than<00:05:39.389> following<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.780> precise

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
example rather than following a precise

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.370 
example rather than following a precise
script<00:05:40.530> you<00:05:41.160> could<00:05:41.310> have<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.520> robots

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
script you could have the robots

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.540 
script you could have the robots
intelligently<00:05:43.380> execute<00:05:43.950> high-level

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
intelligently execute high-level

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.969 
intelligently execute high-level
instructions<00:05:45.020> for<00:05:46.020> example<00:05:46.440> you<00:05:46.680> could<00:05:46.800> tell

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
instructions for example you could tell

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.560 
instructions for example you could tell
one<00:05:47.160> robot<00:05:47.460> to<00:05:47.639> act<00:05:47.790> like<00:05:47.910> a<00:05:47.940> hostage<00:05:48.330> and

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
one robot to act like a hostage and

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.440 
one robot to act like a hostage and
another<00:05:48.930> robot<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.380> act<00:05:49.500> like<00:05:49.650> a<00:05:49.680> terrorist

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
another robot to act like a terrorist

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.000 
another robot to act like a terrorist
another<00:05:51.450> great<00:05:51.690> addition<00:05:52.080> would<00:05:52.320> be<00:05:52.530> to<00:05:52.860> have

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
another great addition would be to have

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.070 
another great addition would be to have
the<00:05:53.160> robots<00:05:53.550> detect<00:05:53.910> soldiers<00:05:54.300> motion<00:05:54.690> and<00:05:54.900> to

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
the robots detect soldiers motion and to

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.350 
the robots detect soldiers motion and to
react<00:05:55.350> appropriately<00:05:55.850> since<00:05:56.850> the<00:05:56.970> robots<00:05:57.240> are

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
react appropriately since the robots are

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.340 
react appropriately since the robots are
smart<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:57.810> aware<00:05:58.020> of<00:05:58.050> their<00:05:58.260> surroundings

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
smart and aware of their surroundings

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:11.510 
smart and aware of their surroundings
the<00:05:59.010> possibilities<00:05:59.580> are<00:05:59.610> endless

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.610
