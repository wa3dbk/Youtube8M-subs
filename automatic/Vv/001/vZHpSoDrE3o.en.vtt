I've been to this conference for three
days<00:02:43.590> holy<00:02:44.040> cow<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.670> got<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> whole<00:02:45.180> list<00:02:45.330> of

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
days holy cow I got a whole list of

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.900 
days holy cow I got a whole list of
things<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:46.680> we<00:02:46.800> got<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.130> change<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
things that we got to change the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.380 
things that we got to change the
resistance<00:02:48.270> will<00:02:48.630> be<00:02:49.160> powerful<00:02:50.180> if<00:02:51.180> we<00:02:51.360> are

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
resistance will be powerful if we are

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.570 
resistance will be powerful if we are
frozen<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.380> our<00:02:52.560> models<00:02:53.010> relative<00:02:53.459> to

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
create learning environments if we're

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.250 
create learning environments if we're

great university is then we're in for a
