you<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> lot<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> my<00:01:40.530> German<00:01:40.890> order<00:01:41.220> might

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
you on a lot so my German order might

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.030 
you on a lot so my German order might
now<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.700> depends<00:01:42.119> sort<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.840> which<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> get

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
now it depends sort of which can I get

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.359 
now it depends sort of which can I get
in<00:01:44.250> gold<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:45.890> I've<00:01:46.890> already<00:01:47.130> got<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
in gold and when I've already got the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.240 
in gold and when I've already got the
the<00:01:47.759> golden<00:01:48.119> FAL<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.710> that's<00:01:49.890> alright<00:01:50.130> I'm

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the golden FAL so that's alright I'm

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.800 
the golden FAL so that's alright I'm
most<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> way<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> couple<00:01:51.450> more

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
most of the way there just a couple more

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.639 
most of the way there just a couple more
gold<00:01:52.079> guns<00:01:52.369> shouldn't<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.430> too<00:01:53.610> hard<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.909> do

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
gold guns shouldn't be too hard to do

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.999 
gold guns shouldn't be too hard to do
not<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.250> difficult<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.939> uh<00:01:58.009> it's

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
not not that difficult it's uh it's

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.039 
not not that difficult it's uh it's
pretty<00:01:59.310> it's<00:02:00.270> gonna<00:02:00.390> take<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> long<00:02:00.840> time<00:02:00.869> I

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
pretty it's gonna take a long time I

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.590 
pretty it's gonna take a long time I
decided<00:02:01.880> instead<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.479> like

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
decided instead of going for like

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.190 
decided instead of going for like
submachine<00:02:04.350> guns<00:02:04.680> or<00:02:05.479> shotguns<00:02:06.479> or<00:02:06.899> like

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
submachine guns or shotguns or like

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.109 
submachine guns or shotguns or like
machine<00:02:07.590> guns<00:02:07.619> I'd<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.670> assault

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
machine guns I'd go for the assault

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.029 
machine guns I'd go for the assault
rifles<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.810> Diamond<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.830> most

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
rifles to Diamond because the most

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.630 
rifles to Diamond because the most
assault<00:02:11.430> rifles

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
assault rifles

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.830 
assault rifles
as<00:02:12.730> soon<00:02:12.970> as<00:02:13.090> I'm<00:02:13.270> done<00:02:13.420> with<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.750> can

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
as soon as I'm done with that I can

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.440 
as soon as I'm done with that I can
basically<00:02:14.110> do<00:02:14.500> anything<00:02:14.530> cuz<00:02:15.210> this<00:02:16.210> all

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
basically do anything cuz this all

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.780 
basically do anything cuz this all
rifles<00:02:16.860> they're<00:02:17.860> they're<00:02:18.310> harder<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.760> use

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
rifles they're they're harder to use

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.760 
rifles they're they're harder to use
than<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.450> submachine<00:02:19.959> guns<00:02:20.230> because<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.620> got

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
than the submachine guns because you got

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.920 
than the submachine guns because you got
a<00:02:20.800> guy<00:02:21.700> sort<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:21.970> keep<00:02:22.180> your<00:02:22.270> distance<00:02:22.450> but<00:02:22.900> you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
a guy sort of keep your distance but you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.510 
a guy sort of keep your distance but you
can<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.590> also<00:02:23.709> get<00:02:23.920> up<00:02:24.040> close<00:02:24.280> with<00:02:24.490> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
can you can also get up close with the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.100 
can you can also get up close with the
occasional<00:02:25.330> one<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.890> that's<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.160> sort<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:28.110> bit

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
occasional one so that's a sort of a bit

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.710 
occasional one so that's a sort of a bit
of<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.590> disadvantage<00:02:30.370> with<00:02:30.970> them<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.540> got<00:02:31.690> to

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
of a disadvantage with them you got to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.820 
of a disadvantage with them you got to
keep<00:02:32.020> like<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> distance<00:02:32.770> but<00:02:33.130> stay<00:02:33.630> sort<00:02:34.630> of

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
keep like a distance but stay sort of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.130 
keep like a distance but stay sort of
its<00:02:35.830> way<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.160> assault<00:02:36.820> rifles<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.720> this<00:02:37.930> game

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
its way of assault rifles on this game

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.330 
its way of assault rifles on this game
they<00:02:38.380> seem<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.800> bit<00:02:38.950> different<00:02:39.130> than

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
they seem to be a bit different than

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.240 
they seem to be a bit different than
they<00:02:39.430> used<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.760> be<00:02:40.020> but<00:02:41.020> yeah<00:02:41.590> there<00:02:42.040> are<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.160> lot

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
they used to be but yeah there are a lot

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.890 
they used to be but yeah there are a lot
harder<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.670> get<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:42.880> in<00:02:43.239> diamond<00:02:43.720> than

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
harder to get in in diamond than

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.280 
harder to get in in diamond than
submachine<00:02:44.739> guns<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.100> think<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:46.330> get<00:02:46.570> quite<00:02:47.260> a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
submachine guns I think and get quite a

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.900 
submachine guns I think and get quite a
lot<00:02:47.470> headshots<00:02:47.860> what<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.310> one<00:02:48.459> got<00:02:48.640> em<00:02:48.730> having

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
lot headshots what the one got em having

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.449 
lot headshots what the one got em having
trouble<00:02:49.180> with<00:02:49.270> at<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.540> moment<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.110> scar

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
trouble with at the moment is the scar

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.960 
trouble with at the moment is the scar
scar-h<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.850> do<00:02:52.810> not<00:02:53.080> like<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.260> going<00:02:53.620> it's

demolition<00:03:45.880> map<00:03:46.360> lot<00:03:47.350> easier<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.769> play<00:03:47.920> that

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
demolition map lot easier to play that

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.330 
demolition map lot easier to play that
on<00:03:48.130> out<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.959> yeah<00:03:50.500> that's<00:03:50.769> that's<00:03:51.070> basically

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340

really good enough especially

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.310 
really good enough especially
you<00:04:25.820> doing<00:04:26.060> distant<00:04:26.450> shots<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:26.930> takes<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.200> lot
