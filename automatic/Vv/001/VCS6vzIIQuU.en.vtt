00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:16.240
 motorola defy 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.369
 525 broken as we see the dawn sensor 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.820
 plus scotch so as not to fall apart here in 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.360
 general condition is stressful but 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.980
 a bunch 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:32.220
 we will repair proceed to the analysis 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.220
 remove the back cover remove the battery 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:44.579
 church t5 unscrew the bolts on the tanks 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:51.850
 phone we hide the phone with a pick 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:54.930
 dropped a button we already forgotten more 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.930
 one side at the end 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.690
 anything then of course you must 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.690
 extract 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.680
 our big cover was removed 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.960
 often tofik 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.869
 boards we hook up the display 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.570
 the whole thing is the installation 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:57.789
 connect our new touch check it 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:02.240
 curve performance of films and 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:07.850
 setting idle 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.540
 at sharp corners the train itself is neat 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:16.630
 load it 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.630
 This is so that the battery contacts come up 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:31.790
 our apparatus turns on waiting for it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.790
 loading the device we booted 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.700
 check all the scrolls so what 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.700
 fine 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.290
 check your wai parts for how long 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.329
 what you want in your interest 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.390
 well that's what make sure by 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:03.370
 all over all corners around but we are here 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:07.939
 can't stop the date what's worth here 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:12.129
 protection so that it is in principle a sensor 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.129
 ready touch buttons work too 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.840
 and can not check everything that is already 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.900
 will man overcome on his 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:29.359
 phone so that we can disable all 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:33.159
 and go to the already complete assembly set 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.159
 our frame is warming up 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.900
 temperature of 70 degrees to 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.110
 the perimeter is well warmed by them easily 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.860
 glass shot 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.860
 about ten minutes 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:54.480
 gently starts to peel off 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.480
 raise 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.990
 well warmed video 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:29.670
 unstuck our sensor to decide solve 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.370
 frame 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:38.600
 from old here glue on to it all 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:41.730
 it was smooth and cleaned paste well 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.960
 double sided tape give a good ball 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.630
 so that she keeps herself well everywhere 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.050
 of course 30 idle to its function is broken 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.650
 this phone but have to sacrifice 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:01.230
 this is the most dense pasted tape 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.000
 that is, to be all good our frame 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.700
 plastered 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.390
 stick our chances remove protective 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:14.070
 film and gently install and 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.930
 I slip the loop I glue the frame 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.960
 it is good that all sat fingers not 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.950
 we leave everything on the inside 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:28.620
 Well we press so that there is not 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:30.950
 no dirt on the phone everything is fixed 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.950
 there 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.730
 connect our 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:52.270
 set the seals and close 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:57.770
 the cover also put a button and 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:06:06.950
 snap lock cover already 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:08.930
 finally everything is twirled gather 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:14.290
 then we will remove this chain far 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.830
 ratings clear the phone we tighten the bolts 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:22.760
 those that go 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:25.430
 the middle and the rains are on the sides took 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.290
 all bolts are twisted that is at the end 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:33.490
 middle and sides and launch the machine 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:36.470
 the device turned on waiting for loading 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:41.560
 Our phone is loaded, everything works as 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.560
 worked we put on the back with a cap 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.250
 the principle of repair is too early to be considered complete 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.950
