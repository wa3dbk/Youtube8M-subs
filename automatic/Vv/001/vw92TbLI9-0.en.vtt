get a couple more kills so now the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.419 
get a couple more kills so now the
armory<00:00:12.630> being<00:00:12.840> placed<00:00:13.080> again<00:00:13.920> quite<00:00:14.099> rice<00:00:14.309> in

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
armory being placed again quite rice in

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.709 
armory being placed again quite rice in
a<00:00:14.490> really<00:00:14.730> nice<00:00:14.820> position<00:00:15.059> has<00:00:15.420> some<00:00:15.570> more

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
a really nice position has some more

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.480 
a really nice position has some more
factories<00:00:16.109> being<00:00:16.379> planted<00:00:16.560> down<00:00:16.800> as<00:00:16.980> really

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
factories being planted down as really

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.830 
factories being planted down as really
nice<00:00:17.640> saturation<00:00:18.150> all<00:00:18.240> together<00:00:18.359> looks<00:00:18.750> like

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
nice saturation all together looks like

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.170 
nice saturation all together looks like
he's<00:00:18.960> got<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.109> siege<00:00:19.320> tankinson<00:00:19.680> vultures<00:00:20.180> he

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
he's got a siege tankinson vultures he

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.490 
he's got a siege tankinson vultures he
can<00:00:21.300> maybe<00:00:21.510> well<00:00:21.869> he's<00:00:22.109> got<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> lot<00:00:22.470> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
can maybe well he's got a lot of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.320 
can maybe well he's got a lot of
dragoons<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> work<00:00:23.730> through<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.029> if<00:00:24.150> he<00:00:24.210> can

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
dragoons to work through but if he can

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.000 
dragoons to work through but if he can
get<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.570> cliffside<00:00:24.869> edge<00:00:25.199> kind<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.859> work

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
get that cliffside edge kind of work

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.380 
get that cliffside edge kind of work
right<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.220> he<00:00:26.519> could<00:00:26.609> work<00:00:26.789> against<00:00:27.119> g5

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
right here he could work against g5

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.880 
right here he could work against g5
that's<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.750> thing<00:00:27.900> about<00:00:27.960> tau<00:00:28.320> crosses<00:00:28.800> you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that's one thing about tau crosses you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.620 
that's one thing about tau crosses you
really<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.580> robotics<00:00:30.029> facility<00:00:30.150> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
really have to go robotics facility and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.749 
really have to go robotics facility and
that<00:00:31.080> shuttle<00:00:31.380> sooner<00:00:31.560> than<00:00:31.769> later<00:00:32.520> because

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that shuttle sooner than later because

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.250 
that shuttle sooner than later because
you<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.120> worry<00:00:33.390> about<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.660> spot<00:00:34.140> in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
you have to worry about that spot in

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.830 
you have to worry about that spot in
particular<00:00:34.790> and<00:00:35.790> as<00:00:35.940> well<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> thought<00:00:36.690> there

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
particular and as well I thought there

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.910 
particular and as well I thought there
was<00:00:36.930> something<00:00:37.110> orange<00:00:37.469> right<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:37.890> that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
was something orange right there at that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280 
was something orange right there at that
location<00:00:38.460> maybe<00:00:38.760> was<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.329> missed<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.079> see

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
location maybe was I missed it you see

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290 
location maybe was I missed it you see
me<00:00:40.350> labor<00:00:40.890> images<00:00:41.280> from<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.579> observer<00:00:41.879> but

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
me labor images from that observer but

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.750 
me labor images from that observer but
that<00:00:42.450> shuttle<00:00:42.870> or<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> sorry<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> dropship

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that shuttle or that sorry the dropship

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.209 
that shuttle or that sorry the dropship
able<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> cycle<00:00:45.239> around<00:00:45.420> losing<00:00:46.320> one<00:00:46.739> vulture

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
able to cycle around losing one vulture

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
able to cycle around losing one vulture
and<00:00:47.460> that's<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> alert<00:00:48.600> g5

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and that's really going to alert g5

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.709 
and that's really going to alert g5
unfortunately<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> think<00:00:49.920> otherwise<00:00:50.719> maybe

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
unfortunately I think otherwise maybe

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
unfortunately I think otherwise maybe
the<00:00:51.899> distraction<00:00:52.350> area<00:00:52.500> tackle<00:00:52.829> pay<00:00:53.010> off

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the distraction area tackle pay off

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.709 
the distraction area tackle pay off
though<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.820> some<00:00:54.030> Mouse<00:00:54.210> vultures

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
though because some Mouse vultures

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.420 
though because some Mouse vultures
wandering<00:00:55.020> directly<00:00:55.379> into<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> secondary<00:00:56.010> g5

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
wandering directly into the secondary g5

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.610 
wandering directly into the secondary g5
completely<00:00:57.000> unprepared<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.690> oh<00:00:57.899> man

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
completely unprepared for this oh man

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
completely unprepared for this oh man
losing<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.309> probes<00:00:59.699> losing<00:01:00.390> more<00:01:00.629> head<00:01:00.780> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
losing more probes losing more head is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.049 
losing more probes losing more head is
secondary<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.620> think<00:01:02.609> you'd<00:01:02.699> already<00:01:02.850> move

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
secondary I think you'd already move

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.429 
secondary I think you'd already move
some<00:01:03.210> troops<00:01:03.390> back<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.809> running<00:01:03.989> headlong

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
some troops back and running headlong

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.960 
some troops back and running headlong
some<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> chickens<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.670> into<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
some of the chickens right into a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.789 
some of the chickens right into a
minefield<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.930> shuttle<00:01:07.260> still<00:01:07.500> hanging

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
minefield and the shuttle still hanging

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.890 
minefield and the shuttle still hanging
out<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.060> natural<00:01:09.390> secondary<00:01:09.720> now

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
out here at that natural secondary now

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.510 
out here at that natural secondary now
going<00:01:10.260> download<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.100> chink<00:01:11.369> in

running into a supply block block right

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.609 
running into a supply block block right
there<00:01:24.659> which<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> hurt<00:01:25.500> him

this is going to get less and less

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.250 
this is going to get less and less

kills but still having to back out
ultimately<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.190> think<00:02:46.280> he's<00:02:46.520> getting<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.790> little

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
ultimately I think he's getting a little

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.820 
ultimately I think he's getting a little
bit<00:02:47.060> overzealous<00:02:47.330> with<00:02:48.230> his<00:02:48.380> attack<00:02:48.650> here

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
bit overzealous with his attack here

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.320 
bit overzealous with his attack here
moving<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.280> siege<00:02:49.520> tanks<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:49.940> don't<00:02:50.090> think<00:02:50.239> he's

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
moving to siege tanks I don't think he's

as weapons one should be coming online
it<00:03:23.720> looks<00:03:23.870> like<00:03:23.989> actually<00:03:24.260> he's<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.380> little<00:03:24.590> bit

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
it looks like actually he's a little bit

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.920 
it looks like actually he's a little bit
off<00:03:24.830> it<00:03:25.400> should<00:03:25.640> at<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.510> rate<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.720> movement

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
off it should at the rate of movement

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.840 
off it should at the rate of movement
though<00:03:27.230> maybe<00:03:27.410> come<00:03:27.680> online<00:03:27.950> as<00:03:28.370> he's<00:03:28.610> moving

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
though maybe come online as he's moving

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.610 
though maybe come online as he's moving
across<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.239> field<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.600> g5<00:03:29.959> already<00:03:30.440> has<00:03:30.590> a

across the field the g5 already has a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.500 
across the field the g5 already has a

forward starting to take a bit of map
control<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.970> guess<00:03:35.720> he<00:03:35.900> really<00:03:36.440> kind<00:03:36.739> of

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
control I guess he really kind of

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.560 
control I guess he really kind of
triggered<00:03:37.100> this<00:03:37.250> really<00:03:37.850> knew<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.120> was<00:03:38.209> coming

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
triggered this really knew it was coming

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.030 
triggered this really knew it was coming
out<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.049> think<00:03:39.320> with<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.650> amount<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.890> your

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
out and I think with the amount of your

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.930 
out and I think with the amount of your
goons

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
goons

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.120 
goons
just<00:03:41.660> right<00:03:41.900> he<00:03:42.080> should<00:03:42.320> be<00:03:42.350> in<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.710> safe

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
just right he should be in a safe

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.710 
just right he should be in a safe
situation<00:03:43.400> i'm<00:03:43.790> not<00:03:43.940> sure<00:03:44.060> i<00:03:44.090> was<00:03:44.270> doing<00:03:44.480> for

and<00:03:59.510> quite<00:03:59.690> rice<00:03:59.870> now<00:04:00.050> pressing<00:04:00.290> out<00:04:00.500> looks

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
and quite rice now pressing out looks

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.960 
and quite rice now pressing out looks
like<00:04:00.860> he<00:04:00.950> does<00:04:01.160> have<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.460> twelve<00:04:01.730> o'clock

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
like he does have that twelve o'clock

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
expansion running for him I again I

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.470 
expansion running for him I again I
still<00:04:04.340> think<00:04:04.520> he<00:04:04.610> should<00:04:04.790> continue<00:04:05.060> with<00:04:05.360> the

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
still think he should continue with the

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.550 
still think he should continue with the
aggression<00:04:05.810> looks<00:04:05.960> like<00:04:06.080> he's<00:04:06.230> loading<00:04:06.470> up

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
aggression looks like he's loading up

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.070 
aggression looks like he's loading up
