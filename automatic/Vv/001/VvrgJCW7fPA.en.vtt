guess<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> little<00:01:52.770> bit<00:01:52.860> different<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.460> i

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
guess is a little bit different so i

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.569 
guess is a little bit different so i
thought<00:01:54.479> i<00:01:54.540> would<00:01:54.890> go<00:01:55.890> ahead<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.340> one

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
thought i would go ahead and do this one

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.130 
thought i would go ahead and do this one
but<00:01:56.820> i<00:01:56.969> think<00:01:57.299> they're<00:01:57.450> gonna<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> lot<00:01:58.079> more

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
but i think they're gonna be a lot more

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.429 
but i think they're gonna be a lot more
infrequent<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.399> i<00:01:59.640> even<00:02:00.509> decide<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.259> continue

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
infrequent if i even decide to continue

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.010 
infrequent if i even decide to continue
to<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:01.920> them<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.430> without<00:02:03.299> further<00:02:03.689> ado
