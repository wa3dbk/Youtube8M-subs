00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
anything like that the sound the sound

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.830 
anything like that the sound the sound
is<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.590> good<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.850> doesn't<00:00:57.360> need<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.570> work

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
is is good it doesn't need to be work

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.180 
is is good it doesn't need to be work
down<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> little<00:00:58.230> bit<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.680> mean<00:00:58.859> that's<00:00:59.039> kind

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
down a little bit but I mean that's kind

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
down a little bit but I mean that's kind
of<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.460> trend<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.120> these<00:01:00.329> emulators<00:01:00.660> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
of the trend with these emulators is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.979 
of the trend with these emulators is
that<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.309> sound<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.879> always<00:01:03.180> draws<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.780> some

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
that the sound will always draws be some

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.620 
that the sound will always draws be some
crackling<00:01:04.710> when<00:01:05.580> nothing<00:01:06.030> she<00:01:06.619> noticeable<00:01:07.619> I

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
crackling when nothing she noticeable I

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.050 
crackling when nothing she noticeable I
mean<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.720> doesn't<00:01:09.990> take<00:01:10.229> away<00:01:10.380> from<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:11.070> from

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
mean it doesn't take away from the from
