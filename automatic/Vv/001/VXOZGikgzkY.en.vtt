00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
so where to you know I generally don't

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.380 
so where to you know I generally don't
like<00:00:05.069> getting<00:00:05.279> involved<00:00:05.549> these<00:00:05.819> things<00:00:06.120> but

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
like getting involved these things but

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.150 
like getting involved these things but
this<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.660> really<00:00:06.899> exciting<00:00:07.080> welcome<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.130> the

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
this is really exciting welcome to the

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.100 
this is really exciting welcome to the
wacky<00:00:08.550> world<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.910> murder<00:00:09.150> what<00:00:09.630> do<00:00:09.690> we<00:00:09.780> do<00:00:09.900> next

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
wacky world of murder what do we do next

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.839 
wacky world of murder what do we do next
Ben's<00:00:10.769> plan<00:00:11.130> was<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.460> overload<00:00:11.820> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
Ben's plan was to overload the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.060 
Ben's plan was to overload the
simulation<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.929> can<00:00:12.960> still<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.740> but<00:00:13.950> not

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
simulation you can still do that but not

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.010 
simulation you can still do that but not
if<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.519> know<00:00:14.670> our<00:00:14.790> every<00:00:14.910> move<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.690> can

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
if is in know our every move you can

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.040 
if is in know our every move you can
make<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> stealthy<00:00:16.980> again<00:00:17.250> right<00:00:17.640> yes<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:19.020> I

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
make a stealthy again right yes but I

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.420 
make a stealthy again right yes but I
need<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.289> get<00:00:19.470> back<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.830> ship<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> can

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
need to get back to the ship so I can

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.189 
need to get back to the ship so I can
find<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.699> way<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> cut<00:00:21.029> them<00:00:21.150> off<00:00:21.300> well<00:00:21.869> that's

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
find a way to cut them off well that's

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.929 
find a way to cut them off well that's
done<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.250> matter<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.519> finding<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
done it's just a matter of finding the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.880 
done it's just a matter of finding the
weakest<00:00:24.269> engine<00:00:24.630> simulation<00:00:25.199> okay<00:00:25.680> then

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
weakest engine simulation okay then

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
weakest engine simulation okay then
let's<00:00:26.550> head<00:00:26.699> home

turned on us huh what's the plan I'm

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.870 
turned on us huh what's the plan I'm
gonna<00:02:36.740> check<00:02:36.890> on<00:02:37.040> kinzie<00:02:37.430> you're<00:02:37.760> gonna

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
gonna check on kinzie you're gonna

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.070 
gonna check on kinzie you're gonna
secure<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.360> doors<00:02:43.300> Kinsey<00:02:44.300> we're<00:02:44.900> not
