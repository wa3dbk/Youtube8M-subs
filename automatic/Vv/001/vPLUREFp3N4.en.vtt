00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:13.170
 I would like to talk about the essence of pixel today. 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.760
 Somewhat because people are good at 5 cameras and then it is easy and 2000 won 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.420
 I do not have it. 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.410
 Nowadays, smartphones do not cost 10 million won. 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:28.949
 4 full- bodied I came out of Nokia's I shoulder shoulder 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:33.930
 The nephew writes Startled, oh Ice ng edaga 40 million won cows 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.989
 It will come out better than its dslr, which is called a moderate camera 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.910
 People are so amateur 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.449
 People who do not even have a poodle and do not have a concept for this pixel 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.840
 many 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:49.500
 Do not you just come vaguely 3630 800 comics in language will also expand prank 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.670
 no 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:59.670
 Full boil completely good piped Did not nice 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.109
 And the higher good that I'll only come 4000 as something important takin 100000000 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.370
 I have come. 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:09.810
 The problem is that if the pixels are high, 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.930
 What will come out good pictures today, I'll try it for a second group that's 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:21.950
 It's nice. 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:23.180
 Only you gon do I lie naked, not that the same relationship between picture and sinter west gate 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.600
 Not at all 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:36.740
 Yes, but stupid people are so big that they are bigger than the bow. 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.759
 Then, if you cut it down, it would be very intense and high resolution 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.530
 It will come out 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.500
 Yes , it will be great . Yes, it is clear. 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.039
 It did not fit lift Yes 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.920
 50 million won four eyes saw many cases of the Sacheon 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:58.520
 There are 50 million points. 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:04.220
 There are four hundred and thirty million points, and one size is the same. 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:09.170
 The pixel high one picture can not emerge better why 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:14.180
 That's what it's about, but it's the same size. 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:20.120
 I owe fifty million special collections and owe 40 million bucks. 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:25.040
 High pixel is only the size of paper size is pretty 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:29.060
 Substantially higher pixel in the picture is not unique to chapter better 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:34.160
 Place on a4 paper notes and mighty drawing 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.350
 When you draw a picture on a non-foiled farmland, place such b4 paper 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.540
 Jineyo draw drawing better 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.400
 This means you can not draw a bigger ambassadors that can take more precise pictures 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.630
 That's right. 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:52.280
 I want to avoid is not knowing what had happened linen stand looking agree when looking to fix it 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.390
 There are 6 images like this to jp . 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.410
 When a comparison 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:03.920
 4. Give the first large 800-megapixel ah yes then 18 million pixels Large 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:10.670
 5184 times 3456. That's right. 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.960
 Let's raise a nurse Well enough to shake the internet draws a horizontal 700 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.420
 Yes. 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:24.780
 Yes , whether it is smoly, medium, or 1 large, the picture is exactly the same. 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.620
 If you do not talk about is reduced to 700 or less based on the pixel crusher washi 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.830
 same 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:34.350
 So the d800 is 3630 mega pixels so much more 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:40.980
 The information in the earlier 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:47.870
 It means you can not put it in, you do not even pick up a much bigger picture. 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:52.290
 So 16 million pixels is smaller than 36 million pixels 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:04:00.170
 It's just that you can expand it to size. 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:02.610
 The corresponding size of 16.2 million pixels is 36 million or 40 million 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:09.540
 80 million are all the same. 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:10.320
 I 'm sure. I 'm sure I 'm 18 million and cut the class now. 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:18.379
 I left it. 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:24.379
 Yogeo special counsel is right and because I'm the same ttokgatjyo 800 megapixels 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:25.940
 And then there are six, four, four , four, four, four , 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.190
 You are the same. 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.900
 It's the same. 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:38.390
 If you do this size 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:42.920
 What's more, when pixels are high, there is a resize 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:48.440
 Did you have a recall here or did you eat anything like that? 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:51.710
 Exactly I mean, it was concluded that re-rise car going up to the Internet 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.360
 All those pictures 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.250
 Such pictures that are not actually 10 million but less than 1 million pixels 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.600
 Because I'm looking at there 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:08.860
 You can not think I did all of the pixels depend on the proven led foreign 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:12.980
 So, in the end, dslr was also the initial dslr 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:19.520
 Plenty of parking roneun haneungeo visited on the Internet 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:21.320
 What do you such money should not even jugu d100 d200 or Canal 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.220
 Notes Standy Standy 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:29.870
 Nowadays, something that can not be seen is a camen. 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:36.500
 When you take a picture with such a camera and upload it to a regular website 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:41.270
 You can say that photos are cold even though they are not new rocks these days 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:45.140
 Then the greater the squat like that people know the pixel 4 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:50.420
 The lens is on the bridge. Oh, then the men will go . That 's very important. 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:55.160
 So the pants are really expensive and I bought the d800e 4 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:59.300
 Whan I bought one because of money shortage manual lens surface that old music 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:04.370
 There are people who are af if they go back to the things they are about 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:06.680
 What d3x Tussauds reported yiraetneunde pixel lens with a huge increase Sore 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.190
 So rather than pecking 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:14.690
 Where are you 2 3 0 0 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:19.220
 d800e 85 wins and the wrong dimension 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.090
 Bout rather more old disks of fact, is not it rather where da Pass 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.380
 There 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:29.360
 When you see it with your eyes, it looks much better. 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:32.840
 Take a sin'm rattling their point between the lens that has but that 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:37.370
 When things were small in size, 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:42.980
 This does throw a lot of high-resolution passed Blackcurrant 3000 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:47.630
 When people say that the pixels are bigger in the shake correction 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:52.220
 I always say that it is a disadvantage out whenever new models 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:55.160
 Hands down this important time naohmyeonseo also jotnya a7 a7 a7r the 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:07:00.290
 I'm talking about a lot of shaking . 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:03.770
 I see the shake. The bigger the pixel, the bigger the better. 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:10.390
 Because it grows , it 's the taste of it. 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:12.920
 Read on, so old cameras look better 

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:16.580
 When you come out very well 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:21.950
 There's a lot of things going on there. 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:26.360
 I 've never seen anything like that before. 5 As you know, 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:27.140
 I think it comes out well to mobile phones is now well come to the same talk 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.360
 I 'm talking. 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:36.530
 It's an angle and it's like that. 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:40.130
 It looks more like a device, but it does not. 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:45.260
 I'm just going to skip over acne. 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:47.600
 High did look better thing is clear we are talking sipeungeon pixels 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:52.700
 The picture does not come out well . 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:56.629
 So please choose the camera when it's ah it's high pixel into several parties are vertically 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:08:01.729
 One is too salty at all, so this is wrong 

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:04.150
 Of course, it would be great if you were to pull out a photo of a door every day . 

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:04.150
 right
