00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
like step stuff with it because you

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.230 
like step stuff with it because you
could<00:06:11.480> doll<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.230> chips<00:06:12.520> and<00:06:13.520> I<00:06:13.670> honestly

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.210 
could doll the chips and I honestly
think<00:06:14.540> that<00:06:14.690> the<00:06:14.990> sharpened<00:06:15.470> tips<00:06:15.740> gives<00:06:16.070> it

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
think that the sharpened tips gives it

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.420 
think that the sharpened tips gives it
more<00:06:16.400> of<00:06:16.460> that<00:06:16.580> realism<00:06:18.100> so<00:06:19.100> and<00:06:19.310> you<00:06:19.400> don't

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
more of that realism so and you don't

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.030 
more of that realism so and you don't
