question<00:00:24.900> that's<00:00:25.900> how<00:00:26.110> I<00:00:26.140> start<00:00:26.560> off<00:00:26.710> by<00:00:26.860> start

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
question that's how I start off by start

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.609 
question that's how I start off by start
off<00:00:27.250> of<00:00:27.490> an<00:00:27.579> apartment<00:00:28.000> and<00:00:28.900> my<00:00:29.500> only

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
off of an apartment and my only

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.049 
off of an apartment and my only
workspace<00:00:30.009> was<00:00:30.250> a<00:00:30.279> little<00:00:30.640> corner<00:00:30.939> of<00:00:30.969> a

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059 
workspace was a little corner of a

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.549 
workspace was a little corner of a
hallway<00:00:31.270> outside<00:00:31.599> in<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.200> middle<00:00:32.380> of<00:00:32.410> winter

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
hallway outside in the middle of winter

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.459 
hallway outside in the middle of winter
so<00:00:33.340> it<00:00:33.550> wasn't<00:00:33.880> best<00:00:34.510> technicians<00:00:35.079> to<00:00:35.200> start

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
so it wasn't best technicians to start

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.479 
so it wasn't best technicians to start
off<00:00:35.590> but<00:00:36.160> what<00:00:36.309> I've<00:00:36.460> learned<00:00:36.730> is<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:38.489> you're

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
off but what I've learned is if you're

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.979 
off but what I've learned is if you're
starting<00:00:39.730> off<00:00:39.940> starting<00:00:40.329> off<00:00:40.450> small<00:00:40.629> it's

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989
