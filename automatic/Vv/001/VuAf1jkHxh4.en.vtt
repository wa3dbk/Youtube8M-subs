looks like he was just kind of clearing
out<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.319> servings<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.189> front<00:00:08.460> he<00:00:08.580> might

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
out the servings in the front he might

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.730 
out the servings in the front he might
have<00:00:08.849> seen<00:00:09.059> those<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.230> looks<00:00:10.410> like<00:00:10.469> he's

this<00:00:23.970> might<00:00:24.240> be<00:00:24.420> enough<00:00:24.740> probably<00:00:25.740> not<00:00:25.890> but

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this might be enough probably not but

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.740 
this might be enough probably not but
i'll<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.630> i<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.900> kill<00:00:28.109> some<00:00:28.320> units

don't think I can take that she need a
couple<00:00:41.340> more<00:00:41.550> Zerg<00:00:41.820> means<00:00:43.969> ten<00:00:44.969> more<00:00:45.120> should

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
couple more Zerg means ten more should

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.799 
couple more Zerg means ten more should
do<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:49.969> don't<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.780> say

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
a nice little creep highway and all I'm

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.979 
a nice little creep highway and all I'm
doing<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.099> moving<00:03:01.879> them<00:03:02.150> all<00:03:02.299> one<00:03:02.569> direction

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
doing is moving them all one direction

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.780 
doing is moving them all one direction
shift<00:03:03.260> clicking<00:03:03.500> out<00:03:03.739> one<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.250> then<00:03:04.579> moving

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
shift clicking out one and then moving

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.490 
shift clicking out one and then moving
them<00:03:05.060> all<00:03:05.239> again<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:05.930> that's<00:03:06.079> going<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.319> leave

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
them all again so that's going to leave

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.619 
them all again so that's going to leave
one<00:03:06.739> Overlord<00:03:07.190> at<00:03:07.340> each<00:03:07.579> spot<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.209> now<00:03:08.569> you

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
one Overlord at each spot and now you

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.339 
one Overlord at each spot and now you
have<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:09.079> nice<00:03:09.379> little<00:03:09.709> creep<00:03:10.010> highway<00:03:10.400> that

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
have this nice little creep highway that

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.839 
have this nice little creep highway that
didn't<00:03:12.349> take<00:03:12.500> too<00:03:12.530> long<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:12.860> Booty<00:03:13.190> produce<00:03:13.700> it

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
didn't take too long to Booty produce it

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.039 
didn't take too long to Booty produce it
they<00:03:14.209> actually<00:03:14.360> go<00:03:14.690> down<00:03:14.810> pretty<00:03:15.230> fast<00:03:17.049> you

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
they actually go down pretty fast you

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.479 
they actually go down pretty fast you
need<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.350> spread<00:03:18.620> these<00:03:18.799> out<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.069> little<00:03:19.340> bit

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
need to spread these out a little bit

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.920 
need to spread these out a little bit
more<00:03:19.670> not<00:03:19.880> sure<00:03:20.000> what<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.150> guys<00:03:20.420> doing<00:03:20.750> and

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
more not sure what that guys doing and

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.479 
more not sure what that guys doing and
before<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:21.530> do<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.859> make<00:03:22.040> sure<00:03:22.069> you<00:03:22.310> actually

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
before you do is make sure you actually

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.220 
before you do is make sure you actually
generate<00:03:23.060> creep<00:03:23.359> with<00:03:23.540> them<00:03:23.720> looks<00:03:23.959> like<00:03:24.109> i

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
generate creep with them looks like i

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.979 
generate creep with them looks like i
missed<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.560> couple<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:24.920> them<00:03:25.100> but<00:03:25.989> overlords

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
missed a couple of them but overlords

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.860 
missed a couple of them but overlords
are<00:03:27.350> awesome<00:03:28.099> in<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.400> regard<00:03:28.730> i<00:03:28.970> was<00:03:29.780> just

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
going to try to pick them off but i'm

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.440 
going to try to pick them off but i'm
going<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.250> go<00:03:31.310> kill<00:03:31.519> them<00:03:31.639> and<00:03:31.849> if<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.180> are

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
going to go kill them and if you are

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.030 
going to go kill them and if you are
spawning<00:03:32.900> creep<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.349> they<00:03:33.500> get<00:03:33.650> shot<00:03:33.859> they

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
spawning creep and they get shot they

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.890 
spawning creep and they get shot they
will<00:03:34.220> still<00:03:34.400> run<00:03:34.549> away<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.299> if<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.569> just<00:03:35.750> want

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
will still run away so if you just want

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
will still run away so if you just want
them<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.019> stay<00:03:36.260> there<00:03:36.440> just<00:03:36.620> make<00:03:36.739> sure<00:03:36.889> to

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
them to stay there just make sure to

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.740 
them to stay there just make sure to
hold<00:03:37.069> position<00:03:37.549> as<00:03:37.730> well<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.299> that's<00:03:38.630> what

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
hold position as well and that's what

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.789 
hold position as well and that's what
I'm<00:03:38.840> just<00:03:38.989> going<00:03:39.109> to<00:03:39.139> go<00:03:39.200> ahead<00:03:39.349> and<00:03:39.530> do<00:03:39.620> for

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
I'm just going to go ahead and do for

this<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:42.829> for<00:03:43.220> this<00:03:43.400> expansion<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:45.109> can

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
this is for this expansion so I can

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.559 
this is for this expansion so I can
saturate<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.489> get<00:03:46.639> some<00:03:46.819> gas<00:03:47.030> for<00:03:47.269> my

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
saturate it and get some gas for my
