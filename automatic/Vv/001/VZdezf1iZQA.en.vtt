we'll<00:00:40.020> play<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> view<00:00:40.770> controller<00:00:40.860> em<00:00:41.460> we

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
we'll play in the view controller em we

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.639 
we'll play in the view controller em we
can<00:00:42.059> put<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> anywhere<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:42.870> long<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.500> not

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
can put it anywhere as long as it's not

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.220 
can put it anywhere as long as it's not
inside<00:00:44.070> another<00:00:44.460> action<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> another<00:00:45.750> action

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
inside another action and another action

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.350 
inside another action and another action
is<00:00:46.440> something<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.100> has<00:00:47.250> braces<00:00:47.520> opening<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
is something that has braces opening and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.229 
is something that has braces opening and
closing<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:50.309> let's<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.640> put<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.850> right<00:00:50.879> above

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
closing so let's just put it right above

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.639 
closing so let's just put it right above
the<00:00:51.449> viewed<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.809> unload<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.350> doesn't<00:00:52.559> really

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the viewed it unload it doesn't really

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.500 
the viewed it unload it doesn't really
matter<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:53.670> make<00:00:53.820> sure<00:00:53.850> they're<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.210> inside

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
matter just make sure they're not inside

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.319 
matter just make sure they're not inside
actions<00:00:54.930> again<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:56.070> open<00:00:56.460> braces<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.059> close

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
actions again so open braces and close

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.599 
actions again so open braces and close
braces<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.199> before<00:00:58.399> alright<00:00:59.399> our

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
tutorial we were setting the position

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.760 
tutorial we were setting the position
and<00:01:49.950> then<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.060> width<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.450> height<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.619> let's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and then the width and height so let's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.700 
and then the width and height so let's
just<00:01:52.979> make<00:01:53.100> them<00:01:53.280> both<00:01:53.399> 0<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.710> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
just make them both 0 for now and the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.069 
just make them both 0 for now and the

the<00:01:58.950> height<00:01:59.159> let's<00:01:59.729> make<00:01:59.969> 50<00:02:01.520> will<00:02:02.520> close

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the height let's make 50 will close

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.100 
the height let's make 50 will close
square<00:02:04.079> brackets<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.799> semicolon<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> first

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
square brackets and semicolon so first

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.710 
square brackets and semicolon so first
let's<00:02:07.469> set<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> horizontal<00:02:07.950> access<00:02:08.879> now<00:02:09.569> if

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
let's set the horizontal access now if

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.210 
let's set the horizontal access now if
you<00:02:09.810> want<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.080> set<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> position<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.009> button

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you want to set the position of a button

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.809 
you want to set the position of a button
and<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.520> want<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.790> Center<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.180> exactly<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
and you want to Center it exactly in the

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.479 
and you want to Center it exactly in the
screen<00:02:13.090> what<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.930> do<00:02:14.109> is<00:02:14.319> we<00:02:15.069> go<00:02:15.219> into<00:02:15.400> our

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
screen what you do is we go into our

screen what you do is we go into our
calculator<00:02:15.790> will<00:02:16.749> subtract<00:02:17.139> 3<00:02:17.439> 20<00:02:17.829> which<00:02:18.189> is

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
calculator will subtract 3 20 which is

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:19.979 
calculator will subtract 3 20 which is
the<00:02:18.430> horizontal<00:02:18.700> dimensions<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.689> iphone

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
the horizontal dimensions of the iphone

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.739 
the horizontal dimensions of the iphone
screen<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.859> 3<00:02:21.099> 20<00:02:21.430> minus<00:02:21.939> the<00:02:22.329> width<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.659> a

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:22.749 
screen so 3 20 minus the width of a

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.259 
screen so 3 20 minus the width of a
button<00:02:22.930> which<00:02:23.499> is<00:02:23.560> 100<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.099> leaves<00:02:24.909> us<00:02:25.090> with

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
button which is 100 and leaves us with

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.410 
button which is 100 and leaves us with
220<00:02:26.019> if<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.439> divide<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.829> by<00:02:27.010> two<00:02:27.639> will<00:02:28.180> get

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
220 if we divide that by two will get

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.240 
220 if we divide that by two will get
110<00:02:29.139> and<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:31.150> we<00:02:31.269> set<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.599> 210<00:02:32.290> for<00:02:33.219> a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
110 and if we set the 210 for a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.059 
110 and if we set the 210 for a
horizontal<00:02:33.879> access<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:35.709> will<00:02:35.829> be<00:02:35.920> exactly

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
horizontal access it will be exactly

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.190 
horizontal access it will be exactly
centered<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.819> screen<00:02:37.150> will<00:02:37.780> do<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.019> same

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
more advanced but you only need to

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.740 
more advanced but you only need to
release<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.419> variable<00:04:08.379> or<00:04:08.530> instance<00:04:08.979> if<00:04:09.509> on<00:04:10.509> the

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
release a variable or instance if on the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.240 
release a variable or instance if on the
first<00:04:10.989> line<00:04:11.229> if<00:04:11.979> you<00:04:12.340> have<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.669> lock<00:04:12.969> in<00:04:14.250> this

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
first line if you have a lock in this

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.699

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.140 
case we're not using a lock for the
button<00:04:18.039> so<00:04:18.430> we<00:04:18.459> do<00:04:18.789> not<00:04:18.909> need<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.239> release<00:04:19.479> it

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
the title and when we tap it it will

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.510 
the title and when we tap it it will
