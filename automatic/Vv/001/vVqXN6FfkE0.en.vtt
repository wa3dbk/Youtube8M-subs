00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
ventilation they didn't understand what

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.530 
ventilation they didn't understand what
it<00:00:31.589> was<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.099> what<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.790> this

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
it was but what it is is that this

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.200 
it was but what it is is that this
ventilation<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:34.920> connected<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
ventilation is not connected to the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.960 
ventilation is not connected to the
bottom<00:00:36.600> part<00:00:36.810> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> kid<00:00:37.200> box<00:00:37.880> what<00:00:38.880> is

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
bottom part of the kid box what is

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.810 
bottom part of the kid box what is
trying<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.380> what<00:00:41.130> is<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.430> for

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
trying to do is what is what is this for

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.990 
trying to do is what is what is this for
is<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.530> heat<00:00:43.860> from<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.460> metal<00:00:44.850> is

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
is is that the heat from the metal is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.030 
is is that the heat from the metal is
not<00:00:45.300> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.690> inside<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.620> kid<00:00:46.800> box

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
not going to go inside of the kid box

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.170 
not going to go inside of the kid box
that's<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.970> is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that's what it is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.150 
that's what it is
okay<00:00:48.720> so<00:00:48.780> air<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> go<00:00:49.710> through<00:00:49.950> here

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
okay so air is going to go through here

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.910 
okay so air is going to go through here
instead<00:00:50.970> of<00:00:51.030> whenever<00:00:51.720> this<00:00:52.020> heats<00:00:52.380> up<00:00:52.650> is

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
instead of whenever this heats up is

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.550 
instead of whenever this heats up is
going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> get<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.060> heat<00:00:54.270> inside<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
going to get the heat inside so that's I

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.020 
going to get the heat inside so that's I
don't<00:00:55.830> want<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.460> that's<00:00:56.700> why<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
don't want that so that's why I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.780 
don't want that so that's why I
separator<00:00:57.720> here<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.040> pure<00:00:59.220> water<00:00:59.400> so<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
separator here in a pure water so the

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.050 
separator here in a pure water so the
air<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.090> through<00:01:00.150> anyway<00:01:01.760> another<00:01:02.760> thing<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
air go through anyway another thing this

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.210 
air go through anyway another thing this
is<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.300> trapdoor<00:01:03.829> variations<00:01:04.829> thereof<00:01:05.070> which

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
is the trapdoor variations thereof which

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.859 
is the trapdoor variations thereof which
is<00:01:05.339> make<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> frame<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.180> put<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> piece<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> wood

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
is make a frame and put a piece of wood

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.970 
is make a frame and put a piece of wood
right<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> it'll<00:01:09.000> hold<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:10.080> door<00:01:10.320> okay

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
right here so it'll hold on my door okay

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.540 
right here so it'll hold on my door okay
so<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.280> don't<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:11.550> all<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.670> way<00:01:11.790> down<00:01:12.150> okay

got a wire box cage thing that I made in

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.930 
got a wire box cage thing that I made in
that<00:01:38.820> thing<00:01:39.330> just<00:01:39.570> hangs<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.430> over<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> screws

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.600 
and that is for proper training if you
want<00:01:49.870> to<00:01:49.930> use<00:01:50.050> it<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.320> way<00:01:50.530> or<00:01:50.770> if<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.400> want

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
want to use it that way or if you want

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.150 
want to use it that way or if you want
to<00:01:51.670> let<00:01:51.850> them<00:01:52.000> get<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> bath<00:01:53.200> outside<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:54.040> can

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
to let them get a bath outside you can

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.160 
to let them get a bath outside you can
put<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.370> pin<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:54.940> here<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:55.570> box<00:01:55.840> will<00:01:56.020> be

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
put a pin in here and the box will be

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.030 
put a pin in here and the box will be
out<00:01:56.440> here<00:01:56.770> okay<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.660> can<00:01:58.840> use<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.380> like

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
out here okay and you can use that like

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.040 
out here okay and you can use that like
that<00:02:00.250> or<00:02:00.460> for<00:02:00.610> truck<00:02:00.910> training<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.840> young

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
that or for truck training the young

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.250 
that or for truck training the young
birds<00:02:02.400> opening<00:02:03.400> my<00:02:03.580> door<00:02:03.870> opens<00:02:04.870> a<00:02:04.960> hundred

birds opening my door opens a hundred
percent<00:02:05.350> okay<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.840> can<00:02:08.020> see<00:02:08.670> that's<00:02:09.670> uh

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:10.620 
percent okay you can see that's uh

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.740 
percent okay you can see that's uh
that's<00:02:11.620> how<00:02:11.860> much<00:02:12.100> open<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.060> open<00:02:13.270> all<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.630> way

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
drop down flat to the bottom that's why

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.940 
drop down flat to the bottom that's why
the<00:02:57.340> box<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.940> lift<00:02:58.209> up<00:02:58.420> from<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.720> ground<00:02:59.020> okay

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
key box is wired with wire so if it's

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.520 
key box is wired with wire so if it's
too<00:03:12.850> cold<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.360> don't<00:03:13.390> want<00:03:13.660> too<00:03:13.780> much<00:03:13.900> air<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.380> go
