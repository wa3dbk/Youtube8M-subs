00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.850
 hi all this lip today a 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.550
 new video and this time it's 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.260
 on the presentation episode of the front 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.470
 turcot so today video 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.840
 obviously concerning the bihan of the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.040
 pvp selection that took place 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.879
 so we can see a summary of 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.860
 points and the first three winners 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.469
 alpha arsenal group winners with 13 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.850
 points chrome rex had 12 points 8 under 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.850
 the waters with 10 points unfortunately 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.930
 foam gamer with a 9 points so he has 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.570
 been eliminated in the group 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.149
 bravo we have to rename 14.10 tino 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.719
 with 13 points ultra gamer with 11 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.370
 points 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.240
 opening unfortunately with six 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.560
 points so I watch your videos 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.299
 finally your comments on 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.909
 different videos and you've been 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.830
 Many in to comment 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.689
 about the ultra gamer that has 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.520
 hugely enraged and yet he had 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.580
 said it's someone who rages 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.409
 a lot and then I obviously 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.400
 noticed in the comments that not 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.259
 badly of people asking me if there was a 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.640
 place for the low pbp so I 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.930
 the impression that these people do not have 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.930
 watched the videos 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.399
 and did not know that in fact the pvp had 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.500
 already occurred and was done in advance 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.500
 so that's something that has to be 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.090
 still be very careful but not 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.340
 put a comment simply I 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.070
 will participate and then as I 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.560
 were saying in the first episode in the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.799
 first video episode 2 presentations 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.689
 and although it was that there was 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.200
 some changes there have been some 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.939
 changes especially for the second 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.310
 for the fine session number two then 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.709
 there the sixth and the fifth do not have 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.260
 point and this is the first four who 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.060
 have the points 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.269
 and then the first without reporting to this 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.180
 moment there two points so we have 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.000
 here the six players then there was a 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.560
 little change concerning chrome rex 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.709
 and ultra gamer who was not 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.959
 unfortunately not present and yet 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.450
 they were warned 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.970
 several days to the advanced as each 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.820
 by a date and a time to respect 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.329
 so unfortunately he was not there 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.810
 so I replaced them by ultimate 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.720
 shadow that was basically meant to be 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.340
 in the group 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.829
 bravo who were not there so he had 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.120
 been replaced and the return of kids 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:03.630
 gamer who has also replaced a 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.040
 nobody so then ultimate shadow 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.170
 unfortunately since it is 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.900
 arrived directly at the second session 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.560
 so that others know the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.230
 location of the chests of the classy stuff and 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.260
 and so on unfortunately he did it 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.880
 last with zero point says snow which 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.780
 unfortunately did two matches 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:30.440
 the first two games he made 1-0 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.910
 by doing he finished 5th with 6 points 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.400
 and we ride with aaron arsenal kids 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.430
 gamer and wiz 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:45.890
 so that's really played at last 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.020
 match so now we have the six 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.810
 people who are part of the adventure 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.420
 so we have from east 27 sir 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.300
 of arles ex arsenal gameiro 8 solo on 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.610
 pvp tournament winner myself and the 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.800
 master 2 so people may have 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.680
 noticed that digital phoenix was 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.210
 normally here unfortunately he does not 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.570
 can not be part of this 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:17.690
 adventure because he lost his VIP title 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:20.270
 for such and such reason that I would not say 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.770
 not and it is not worth the me 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.470
 ask me in the comments I do not 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.350
 not answer as you can 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:32.600
 see there is middle east d3 small stormy 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:36.170
 the master 2 late ex arsenal and yes this 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.100
 polo or who the unknown noob so 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:43.810
 now it basically concerns 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:49.970
 the course of the adventured co-op then 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:52.550
 proposed me your challenges at the level of 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.980
 difficulty because yes I had thought of the 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.260
 base to make an adventure into difficult 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.490
 but hey I think it can give 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.130
 few problems later during 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.360
 adventure in what they do without them 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.760
 challenges I had thought of doing a la tour 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.010
 hell 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:19.070
 ie make a tour of all 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:22.360
 possible blocks of the game do the harvest 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.740
 all CDs all vinyl records 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.070
 also but hey I think that's it 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:32.390
 would also pose some problems but 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.639
 if not after all huh it's up to you to me 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.659
 tell the challenges 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:42.069
 where was so after is what there is a 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:45.340
 limited lifetime ie a 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:48.550
 total number of life or so each 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.990
 person has so much and so much life and by 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.779
 example if a person died 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.300
 going for example arsenal gamer we have 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:59.199
 all each 5 screws and arsenal manners five 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.389
 time is it eliminated or is it 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.029
 that it is the mount that finally stops 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:07.719
 brief on this month I hope you 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:09.580
 will know how many to give 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:13.599
 challenges so that the ch allen be a little 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.569
 higher because you saw that I 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.930

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:22.000
