00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
you're sweating a lot when you go to the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.400 
you're sweating a lot when you go to the
gym<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.220> when<00:02:38.640> you're<00:02:39.290> working<00:02:40.290> out

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
gym so that when you're working out

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.950 
gym so that when you're working out
you're<00:02:40.920> replenishing<00:02:41.700> back<00:02:41.910> those<00:02:42.300> fluids

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
you're replenishing back those fluids

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.380 
you're replenishing back those fluids
okay<00:02:43.200> also<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.730> afford<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.240> buy<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
okay also if you can afford to buy a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.780 
okay also if you can afford to buy a
Gatorade<00:02:45.810> for<00:02:46.110> example<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.400> take<00:02:47.550> half

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
Gatorade for example you can take half

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.610 
Gatorade for example you can take half
of<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:48.000> Gatorade<00:02:48.360> okay<00:02:48.750> cut<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.170> into<00:02:49.290> half

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
of a Gatorade okay cut it into half

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440 
of a Gatorade okay cut it into half
because<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.280> still<00:02:50.490> has<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.670> lot<00:02:50.820> of<00:02:50.910> sugars<00:02:51.270> in

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
because it still has a lot of sugars in

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.050 
because it still has a lot of sugars in
it<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.750> mixing<00:02:52.350> with<00:02:52.410> half<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.920> water<00:02:53.430> now

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
it and mixing with half of water now

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.940 
it and mixing with half of water now
this<00:02:54.270> is<00:02:54.360> gonna<00:02:54.480> be<00:02:54.660> diluted<00:02:54.900> because<00:02:55.710> now<00:02:55.890> you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
this is gonna be diluted because now you

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.250 
this is gonna be diluted because now you
have<00:02:56.040> some<00:02:56.490> electrolytes<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.360> replace<00:02:57.930> some

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
have some electrolytes to replace some

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.870 
have some electrolytes to replace some
of<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.470> salts<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.160> sodium<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.760> potassium

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
of the salts the sodium and potassium

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.480 
of the salts the sodium and potassium
and<00:03:00.690> also<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.500> chloride<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.220> lose

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
and also the chloride that you lose

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.850 
and also the chloride that you lose
mostly<00:03:03.209> sodium<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.780> chloride<00:03:04.020> from<00:03:04.650> your

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
mostly sodium and chloride from your

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.830 
mostly sodium and chloride from your
skin<00:03:05.220> when<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.670> sweat<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.570> it's<00:03:06.660> very

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
skin when you sweat so it's very

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.570 
skin when you sweat so it's very
important<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.500> drink<00:03:07.920> some<00:03:08.130> fluids<00:03:08.340> and

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
important you drink some fluids and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.030 
important you drink some fluids and
electrolytes<00:03:08.730> as<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.959> are<00:03:10.080> working<00:03:10.560> out<00:03:10.739> at
