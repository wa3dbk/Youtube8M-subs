okay<00:00:02.040> so<00:00:02.100> let's<00:00:02.429> start<00:00:02.669> by<00:00:02.820> taking<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.210> little

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
okay so let's start by taking a little

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.670 
okay so let's start by taking a little
bit<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.810> sample<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.350> I'm<00:00:04.440> gonna<00:00:04.560> be

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
bit of the sample that I'm gonna be

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.130 
bit of the sample that I'm gonna be
testing<00:00:05.100> here<00:00:05.339> it's<00:00:05.460> methanol<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.750> adding

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
testing here it's methanol and adding

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.259 
testing here it's methanol and adding
about<00:00:07.410> one<00:00:08.340> centimeter

example to the boiling
see<00:00:14.410> here<00:00:14.650> I'm<00:00:14.830> gonna<00:00:14.980> check<00:00:15.280> in<00:00:15.429> and<00:00:15.730> make

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:15.759 
see here I'm gonna check in and make

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.580 
see here I'm gonna check in and make
sure<00:00:15.910> that<00:00:16.059> it's<00:00:16.359> like<00:00:16.689> the<00:00:16.810> sample<00:00:17.080> is<00:00:17.289> about

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
sure that it's like the sample is about

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:32.530 
sure that it's like the sample is about
one<00:00:17.830> centimeter

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.260 

okay<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> next<00:00:33.900> step<00:00:34.080> is<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.440> take<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:35.270> small

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
okay the next step is to take a small

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.930 
okay the next step is to take a small
section<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.930> capillary<00:00:37.770> tube<00:00:38.130> that<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:38.700> been

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
this is not a lab where we want to heat

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.569 
this is not a lab where we want to heat
vigorous<00:02:51.049> that<00:02:51.230> we<00:02:51.379> want<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.799> just<00:02:52.340> heat

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
vigorous that we want to just heat

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.220 
vigorous that we want to just heat
gently<00:02:52.939> and<00:02:53.150> let<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.480> temperature<00:02:53.659> come<00:02:54.079> up

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
gently and let the temperature come up

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:19.370 
gently and let the temperature come up
slowly<00:02:54.620> inside<00:02:55.129> the<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.810> large<00:02:57.079> test<00:02:57.379> tube

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.670 

just<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.190> few<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.820> slow<00:03:21.600> bubbling<00:03:22.230> air<00:03:22.470> coming

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
just a few a slow bubbling air coming

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.470 
just a few a slow bubbling air coming
out<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.160> inner<00:03:23.400> tube<00:03:23.520> if<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.270> see

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
out of that inner tube if you can see

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.970 
out of that inner tube if you can see
the<00:03:24.630> little<00:03:24.960> bubbles<00:03:25.140> moving<00:03:25.620> there<00:03:25.770> just

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
the little bubbles moving there just

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.400 
the little bubbles moving there just
look<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.910> left<00:03:27.210> of<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.690> red<00:03:27.840> bulb<00:03:28.200> of

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
look just to the left of the red bulb of

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.900 
look just to the left of the red bulb of
the<00:03:28.440> thermometer<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.070> you'll<00:03:29.220> see<00:03:29.460> small

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
the thermometer and you'll see small

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.480 
the thermometer and you'll see small
bubbles<00:03:30.260> those<00:03:31.260> are<00:03:31.410> forming<00:03:31.860> out<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
bubbles those are forming out of the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.610 
bubbles those are forming out of the
bottom<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.210> inverted<00:03:33.840> capillary<00:03:34.380> tube

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
bottom of the inverted capillary tube

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.500 
bottom of the inverted capillary tube
inside<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.610> boiling<00:03:36.000> tube

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.820 

and<00:03:38.629> the<00:03:38.959> rate<00:03:39.170> of<00:03:39.379> bubble<00:03:39.799> formation

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
and the rate of bubble formation

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.670 
and the rate of bubble formation
speeding<00:03:40.730> up

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.949 

okay<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.549> there's<00:03:44.879> a<00:03:44.939> fairly<00:03:45.239> rapid<00:03:45.689> stream

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
okay and there's a fairly rapid stream

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.869 
okay and there's a fairly rapid stream
there<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.379> I'm<00:03:46.500> gonna<00:03:46.650> stop<00:03:47.069> heating<00:03:47.579> at<00:03:47.700> this

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
there so I'm gonna stop heating at this

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.630 
there so I'm gonna stop heating at this
point<00:03:48.260> see<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.439> stream<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:50.040> bubbles<00:03:50.189> coming

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
point see that stream of bubbles coming

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.429 
point see that stream of bubbles coming
out<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:50.970> small<00:03:51.420> capillary<00:03:51.930> tube

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
out of the small capillary tube

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.380 
out of the small capillary tube
go<00:03:53.010> ahead<00:03:53.129> shut<00:03:53.370> my<00:03:53.519> gas<00:03:53.730> off<00:03:55.430> now<00:03:56.430> my<00:03:56.939> job<00:03:57.209> is

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
go ahead shut my gas off now my job is

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.740 
go ahead shut my gas off now my job is
just<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.659> wait<00:03:57.930> until<00:03:58.439> those<00:03:58.560> bubbles<00:03:59.750> slow

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
just to wait until those bubbles slow

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.530 
just to wait until those bubbles slow
down<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:02.340> have<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.579> be<00:04:02.700> patient<00:04:02.939> here<00:04:03.299> just

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
down you have to be patient here just

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.369 
down you have to be patient here just
wait<00:04:03.750> as<00:04:04.019> though<00:04:04.230> as<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.629> cools<00:04:06.930> off<00:04:07.109> what

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
wait as though as the it cools off what

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.770 
wait as though as the it cools off what
happens<00:04:07.739> here<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.010> we<00:04:08.280> go<00:04:08.640> beyond<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.329> boiling

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
happens here is we go beyond the boiling

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.289 
happens here is we go beyond the boiling
point<00:04:10.079> we<00:04:10.739> go<00:04:10.859> past<00:04:11.159> the<00:04:11.430> boiling<00:04:11.609> point<00:04:12.090> and

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
point we go past the boiling point and

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:18.830 
point we go past the boiling point and
we<00:04:13.290> wait<00:04:13.579> until<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:16.560> returns<00:04:17.299> until<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:18.660> the

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
we wait until it returns until the the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.360 
we wait until it returns until the the
temperature<00:04:19.109> drops<00:04:19.440> back<00:04:19.650> down<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
temperature drops back down to the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.830 
temperature drops back down to the
boiling<00:04:20.669> point<00:04:20.880> so<00:04:20.910> we<00:04:21.090> heat<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.299> above<00:04:21.690> the

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
boiling point so we heat it above the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.930 
boiling point so we heat it above the
boiling<00:04:22.169> point<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:22.860> let<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.220> cool<00:04:23.370> off<00:04:23.430> back

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
boiling point and let it cool off back

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.490 
boiling point and let it cool off back
down<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.539> boiling<00:04:24.870> point<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.169> we'll<00:04:25.350> talk

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
down to the boiling point and we'll talk

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.210 
down to the boiling point and we'll talk
about<00:04:25.650> why<00:04:25.949> we<00:04:26.160> do<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.520> in<00:04:27.180> class

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.520 

so<00:04:32.820> I'm<00:04:33.030> just<00:04:33.210> waiting<00:04:33.420> patiently<00:04:34.080> for<00:04:34.200> the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
so I'm just waiting patiently for the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.560 
so I'm just waiting patiently for the
bubbles<00:04:34.890> to<00:04:35.040> slow<00:04:35.340> down<00:04:35.550> you<00:04:35.820> can<00:04:36.000> see<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.360> the

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
bubbles to slow down you can see the the

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.030 
bubbles to slow down you can see the the
rate<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.930> bubble<00:04:37.230> formation<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.830> slowed<00:04:38.010> down

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
rate of bubble formation is slowed down

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.920 
rate of bubble formation is slowed down
a<00:04:38.280> little<00:04:38.460> bit<00:04:38.700> just<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.270> left<00:04:39.420> of<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.750> red

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
a little bit just to the left of the red

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.510 
a little bit just to the left of the red
thermometer<00:04:40.920> bulb<00:04:41.480> and<00:04:43.070> when<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.190> last

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
thermometer bulb and when the last

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.160 
thermometer bulb and when the last
bubble<00:04:45.120> comes<00:04:45.390> out<00:04:45.570> at<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.720> end<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:46.050> that

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
bubble comes out at the end of that

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.460 
bubble comes out at the end of that
capillary<00:04:46.590> tube<00:04:47.120> that's<00:04:48.120> when<00:04:48.810> I<00:04:48.840> record<00:04:49.320> the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
capillary tube that's when I record the

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.060 
capillary tube that's when I record the
temperature<00:04:49.920> that's<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.520> one<00:04:51.230> it<00:04:52.230> looks<00:04:52.710> like

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
temperature that's the one it looks like

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.550 
temperature that's the one it looks like
that<00:04:54.030> has<00:04:54.330> occurred<00:04:54.660> so<00:04:54.990> we're<00:04:55.170> going<00:04:55.290> to<00:04:55.410> just

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
that has occurred so we're going to just

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.100 
that has occurred so we're going to just
and<00:04:55.920> you'll<00:04:56.850> notice<00:04:57.150> also<00:04:57.330> that<00:04:57.450> at<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.900> same

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
and you'll notice also that at the same

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.050 
and you'll notice also that at the same
time<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.500> last<00:04:58.740> bubble<00:04:59.130> comes<00:04:59.370> out<00:04:59.610> of<00:04:59.820> the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
time the last bubble comes out of the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.750 
time the last bubble comes out of the
small<00:05:00.360> capillary<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.560> sample<00:05:02.040> liquid<00:05:02.400> gets

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
small capillary the sample liquid gets

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.620 
small capillary the sample liquid gets
drawn<00:05:03.180> up<00:05:03.480> into<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.170> capillary
