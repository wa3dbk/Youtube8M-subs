00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.340
Holding a white flower within my hands

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.960
I see how youth can arrive to a righteous peace

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.640
If we are near them they can arrive to it

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.320
Otherwise what's our use in this Earth

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.020
Do you see to what we came to in these days?

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.680
What are people thinking about? only money and gold

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.320
Now I am fed of it

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.820
Of being afraid and of a frightening weapon

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.680
From morning to evening see how further

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.280
We could get, if only could we help a bit more

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.960
Our friends and also all the people around us

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.700
Seeing the goodness inside all humankind

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.320
Hand in hand and in harmony in a garden

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.900
A goal which is far above the dust

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.660
Since little until that walking is possible

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.280
Since youth until the day service can be done

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.960
An aim which is far above the dust

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.660
truthful mouths  without a tape (scotch)

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.080
An aim which could be like peace

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.980
you can not give love if you're not happy alone

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.640
An aim which is far above the dust

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.340
truthful mouths  without a tape (scotch)

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.760
An aim which could be like peace

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.560
you can not give love if you're not happy alone

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.340
I tell you, if I had a son I would teach to him

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.960
the love that I always had to tell the truth

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.600
a protruding nail will be beaten

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.280
even if the wood is hard you don't bend yourself

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.760
become yourself don't go the wrong way

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.660
escape from the comfort that they give you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.280
put the love and light in your doubt

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.920
there are no answers, but questions like an ignorant

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.600
when you grow up you will do something great

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.280
forced to grow up and walk, don't look back

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.960
become an example of personal improvement

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.640
the engine of life isn't the fear

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.180
I don't think you like the old age

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.000
in silence I will give you the happiness that speaks

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.340
I will not tell you where the bread is

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.360
if you have clear ideas you'll find it even in times of hunger

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.960
An aim which is far above the dust

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.660
truthful mouths  without a tape (scotch)

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.080
An aim which could be like peace

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.980
you can not give love if you're not happy alone

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.600
An aim which is far above the dust

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.300
truthful mouths  without a tape (scotch)

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.720
An aim which could be like peace

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.420
you can not give love if you're not happy alone
