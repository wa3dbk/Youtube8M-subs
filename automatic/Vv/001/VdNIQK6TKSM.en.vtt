00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Hi everyone and welcome to iphon.fr 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.790
 French today small 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.440
 presentation of it prevents caperlan 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.880
 h and so to Saint Nazaire decathlon 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.940
 currently its price is 124 euros 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.060
 90 I'm more sure of myself but I believe 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.800
 that's it me I ask him slightly 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.150
 cheaper since I had a discount 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.670
 so so so do not 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.150
 make no mistake I added some 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.850
 extensions of accessories in addition so 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.190
 so for 104 90 we would not have 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.690
 the entirety of what you 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.370
 can see on the video 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.160
 so I'll give you a little detail 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 of what was originally and not 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.040
 rather than I did rather a detail of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.090
 what I added like that you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 can deduce for themselves what they 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.920
 had originally so let's start a 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.379
 name that I added to this little 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.879
 temple this fishing station the bar 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.110
 power plant 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.270
 it's around kilos cost a little 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.590
 more than 35 euros so this station 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.280
 central and serves what purpose it serves to 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.530
 ask the can 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.729
 so thanks to the year that I can see just 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.680
 so here it is in break can at the level 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.500
 central which finally allows account 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.090
 to have centered on the stroke calm 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.509
 fishing 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.920
 and then 2 which allows you to have 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.470
 hands free to start 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.390
 front of the sails to do what you 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.240
 have to do to optimize skin from 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.920
 fishing then I added a locker 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.030
 to have an extra locker 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.000
 up to the base it comes with a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.430
 quasi that has a drawer so I 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.479
 added a locker to drink m 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.880
 resigned from odds and ends 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.350
 extra here you know the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.600
 bobbins of thread etc etc 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.500
 hooks for power between 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.659
 quotes so add the little brothel 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.220
 additional fisherman and otherwise 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.229
 otherwise there was this plate there that 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.890
 I have bought so apart 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.770
 which finally allows account have asked 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.490
 so it's maggots it's usually his 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:04.650
 little material of the gorges joy 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.270
 markers 6 to the claws and so that's 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.100
 there was too much stuff in 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.320
 more 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.170
 so that's so we had to add up 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.620
 a little bit near the total of this 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.660
 together 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.580
 right now it would cost a little 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.960
 less than 200 euros so an urban cup 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.760
 fishing 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.800
 here is yves evening of another brand 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.810
 it costs more than 100 euros 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.670
 they are provided with the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.830
 casters or not the casters when I 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.270
 talking about sealed roulette it's the little 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.530
 transport cart because the ena 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.160
 some that are planned with his 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.720
 transport trolley 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.150
 this model does not have the bones and so the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.330
 wheels for transportation by it against 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.680
 exists the top model with them so 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.120
 all every little one every 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.290
 more accessories so the casters that 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.390
 at 299 euros 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.980
 I do not want to put 2 519 and 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.380
 red at eight meters less than 200 euros 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.000
 so I found this alternative there in 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.950
 more after you have to know that my 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.040
 vehicle can not accept so the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.440
 capellen crate with casters that 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.730
 is too bulky for my taste so the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.800
 blow there was that too that came back in 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.630
 account in my purchase so the place that 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.000
 could take this case a 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.000
 times so tidy e so 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.780
 optimized and so they could so 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.140
 the place she could take in my 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.700
 car 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.170
 so here are the small points so that 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.250
 I enjoyed on this piece 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.120
 whose plecanatide is enough 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.920
 comfortable ac mixed between resident 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.140
 and flexible so a happy medium I would say 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.459
 you to us for our little fez here 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.650
 otherwise what did I really appreciate 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.730
 and so that is provided by default then 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.250
 I guess you'll see him I've 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.220
 tried to shift a kiss but a 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.959
 little bit this little increases the risk is 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.270
 there by default it's still small 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.709
 nice option could add their 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.010
 supplement they did not do it and it plays 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.280
 it's nice of them 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.560
 that's so many and so I told you 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.510
 a locker with a drawer yesterday the strap 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.980
 the strap and therefore provides by default this 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.280
 which is not bad but the little detail that 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.800
 I enjoyed it for 700 cases this is the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.180
 small the small the small recess 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.300
 that's what can block the ash there 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.580
 to avoid you being dragged by 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.520
 earth and so you rather not rather 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.239
 bad it's a small detail well thought out 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.370
 then a little detail that was supposed to 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.950
 have on all fishing stations 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.810
 it's the small level indicator for 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.220
 optimize its seating and therefore have a 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.380
 optimal comfort to be able to fish more 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.760
 for several hours 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.120
 and if not otherwise excuse me for the 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.550
 cash 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.740
 the camera there he signs a little 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.050
 small place where we can include 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.090
 so there is inserted in quotation marks so 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.750
 an umbrella that we could see so 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.660
 it's pretty good 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.400
 so everything is thought to be able to have 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.960
 all the elements available and I 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.460
 find it rather not bad there was a 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.610
 additional accessory so in in 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.070
 in the crate it was this little 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.860
 accessory this little this little time 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.200
 of time in quotation marks and I have not 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.720
 too much knew what he was serving but I 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.979
 have deduced a thing as you can 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.510
 see in the first in the east in 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.640
 the photos when the crate was going to fold 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.570
 to take the least space possible 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.080
 there is the pontoon so which is so hours 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.320
 parallel to the cash is 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.400
 perpendicular to the ground here is the so the 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.880
 along the crate the pontoon that is 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.169
 really along the crate is so 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.430
 this one in the end when he is 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.169
 in this position there is a small 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.370
 little game he tends to fairs 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.100
 come a little bit towards the 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.140
 ground so so its opening angle and 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.880
 more and wider and so to avoid 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.919
 just that it will it balks 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.590
 bullet I think they planned in the 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.410
 crate this little trick there he has to 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.800
 so hang on the sides on 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.960
 clings and bloody on the little ones the 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.190
 little game can come this little ones 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.460
 the small metal tip where 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.010
 cling straps and so that 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.230
 blow it hangs there we do a little 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.000
 pass on both sides of the 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.550
 of the pontoon and then we hang up the 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.520
 second the street it's still the pontoon 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.900
 fixed languages ​​from the stroke of that 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:21.990
 it's a real blow to the shoulder during the 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:24.180
 transport and that makes it so that I 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.060
 know it's something more than 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.710
 more pro and more here is more 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.930
 Securing for for transportation because 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.280
 that despite everything though it is one of 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.040
 the cheapest fishing stations 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.750
 market 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.660
 it's still an investment and 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.870
 it should not be damaged so we 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.720
 promise elbow of the first part of 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.780
 fishing what's so a presentation 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.170
 I hope I have been explicit to have been 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.480
 clear to have a good education 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.930
 because this is my first video is 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.150
 so 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:00.500
 so that's all I hope you do 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:02.840
 more in the future and and you present a 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.130
 little bit like stake I'm considering but 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.190
 so my fishing parties on the edge of 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:10.700
 water whether in river being in 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.530
 lacquer and here they are but how 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.020
 still how am I going to strategy myself 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.660
 fishing in quotation marks and what will 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.220
 my fishing strategies and and that's it 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.930
 knowing that moment there I made the 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.200
 competition in the past as you have 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:28.430
 could see in the page about 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:31.130
 so my site but my good games that 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.080
 it's been a long time since I left that 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.010
 does I sin more really very 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.350
 I'm fishing 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.250
 go a big average between 15 and 20 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.440
 times in the year 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:44.240
 in any case that's what happened on 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:46.640
 the year 2014 and so suddenly by the 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.920
 automatisms are no longer the study that 

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.830
 so I judged had maybe at the edge of 

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.110
 the water game I lost a big one 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:57.440
 part even though I have some few 

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.150
 bases still so suddenly that's for 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.170
 time to be tolerant and then to 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.960
 you also better share your 

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.950
 experiences so that all together we 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.500
 advance what then
