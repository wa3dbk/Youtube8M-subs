 how to play blackjack like a professional 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.160
 we all know that the goal of the game is to get a 21 or more score 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.909
 next without going over 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.529
 unlike the tickets where there are many strategies to win in 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.630
 the black yak there is only one 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.470
 is the probability strategy that must be applied in any circumstance 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.009
 with the basic strategy will reduce the casino advantage to less than 1% 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.140
 this is a basic strategy table 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.110
 here are all the combinations that could come out in one hand 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.510
 at the top you will find the dealer's exposed letter 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.140
 and on the left side the possible cards of the player 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.610
 with the basic strategy will reduce the casino's advantage to a laughable 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.670
 zero point 44% 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.210
 remember that in blackjack after the first two cards are dealt 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.310
 the player may take one of the following decisions 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.100
 to stand in that case will keep the cards he has 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.550
 ask for more letters to try to get twenty-one points 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.960
 double the value of the initial bet can be doubled 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.570
 divide if the first two cards of the player are equal this one will be able to divide 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 his game in two independent games 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.330
 If you want to be successful you must follow the move indicated by the table for each 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.000
 hand 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.850
 it is a mathematical question that is why to play with the basic strategy 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.640
 will increase your chances of winning 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.140
 let's see how it works 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.220
 the letter of the carvers a 4 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.220
 and the player's cards total 19 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.110
 the table tells us that for this hand we must plant ourselves 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.590
 the letter of the carvers an 8 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.730
 the player's two cards total 5 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.080
 this time we are told that we should ask for more letters 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.830
 in this example the carver has three 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.259
 the player has 20 points 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259
 in this hand we must stand 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.339
 on the larcher card means asking for a letter 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.149
 the s means that to stand 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.179
 the d tells us to bend 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.749
 the sp tells us we should split the hand 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.430
 as you can see this simple strategy maximizes our chances of winning in 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.549
 blackjack
