this<00:00:17.550> video<00:00:17.880> we're<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.660> look<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
this video we're going to look at a

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.170 
this video we're going to look at a
backup<00:00:19.680> camera<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.340> sensors<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.060> are

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
backup camera with sensors that are

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.019 
backup camera with sensors that are
going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.510> replace<00:00:21.779> hopefully<00:00:22.500> without<00:00:23.279> very

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
going to replace hopefully without very

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.339 
going to replace hopefully without very
much<00:00:24.269> modification<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.590> my<00:00:25.740> 2006<00:00:26.369> f150<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:28.199> my

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
much modification in my 2006 f150 in my

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.900 
much modification in my 2006 f150 in my
infinite<00:00:28.740> ruck<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.400> got<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> backup

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
infinite ruck it's got the backup

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.700 
infinite ruck it's got the backup
sensors<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> Park<00:00:30.960> Assist<00:00:31.260> whatever<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
sensors of the Park Assist whatever you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.229 
sensors of the Park Assist whatever you
want<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.009> call<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> rear<00:00:32.850> bumpers

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
want to call it in the rear bumpers

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.850 
want to call it in the rear bumpers
right<00:00:33.450> now<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.899> what<00:00:34.050> happened<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
right now so what happened is that the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.040 
right now so what happened is that the
two<00:00:35.040> sensors<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> passenger<00:00:36.450> side<00:00:36.690> are

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
two sensors on the passenger side are

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.979 
two sensors on the passenger side are
shorted<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.430> whatever<00:00:38.879> else<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
shorted out or whatever else so the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.799 
shorted out or whatever else so the
backup<00:00:40.469> sensors<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:41.640> work<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.329> cost<00:00:42.600> of

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
backup sensors do not work the cost of

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
backup sensors do not work the cost of
replacing<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.469> two<00:00:43.649> backup<00:00:44.040> sensors<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
replacing the two backup sensors is

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.660 
replacing the two backup sensors is
roughly<00:00:44.969> about<00:00:45.030> 175<00:00:46.020> dollars<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
roughly about 175 dollars so for the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.240 
roughly about 175 dollars so for the
same<00:00:47.910> price<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:49.050> able<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.920> backup

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
same price I was able to get a backup

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.270 
same price I was able to get a backup
camera<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:51.239> new<00:00:51.420> sensors<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.559> replacement

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
camera for new sensors and a replacement

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.819 
camera for new sensors and a replacement
mirror<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.760> has<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.940> built-in<00:00:54.390> TV<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.140> way

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
mirror that has a built-in TV is way

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
mirror that has a built-in TV is way
better<00:00:56.039> system<00:00:56.640> than<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> Ford<00:00:57.449> has<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
better system than what the Ford has so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.979 
better system than what the Ford has so
let's<00:00:58.590> go<00:00:58.770> over<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.190> now<00:00:59.399> I'm<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> do

powers to go to the backup light plus a
ground

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.180 

let's<00:02:28.090> see<00:02:28.330> your<00:02:28.420> backup<00:02:28.960> speak<00:02:29.590> or<00:02:29.800> beeper

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
let's see your backup speak or beeper

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.190 
let's see your backup speak or beeper
I'm<00:02:30.430> not<00:02:30.610> sure<00:02:30.850> I'd<00:02:30.970> want<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.300> install<00:02:31.690> that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.580 

here's<00:02:35.200> one<00:02:35.440> sensor<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.100> I'm<00:02:36.160> hoping<00:02:36.550> that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
here's one sensor and I'm hoping that

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.470 
here's one sensor and I'm hoping that
these<00:02:38.590> should<00:02:38.860> be<00:02:38.920> pretty<00:02:39.370> easy<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.970> fit<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.330> or

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
these should be pretty easy to fit in or

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.860 
these should be pretty easy to fit in or
the<00:02:40.660> existing<00:02:41.080> forward<00:02:41.470> ones<00:02:41.620> were<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:46.120> then

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
the existing forward ones were and then

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.780 
the existing forward ones were and then
three<00:02:47.290> more<00:02:47.560> sensor<00:02:48.100> so<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.370> get<00:02:48.520> four

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
three more sensor so you get four

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.780 
three more sensor so you get four
sensors<00:02:49.240> in<00:02:49.420> total<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:54.130> is<00:02:54.310> your<00:02:54.490> backup

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
sensors in total this is your backup

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.970 
sensors in total this is your backup
camera<00:02:55.030> right<00:02:55.720> here<00:02:56.110> goes<00:02:56.410> on<00:02:56.590> top<00:02:56.740> of<00:02:56.800> your

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
camera right here goes on top of your

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.160 
camera right here goes on top of your
license<00:02:57.370> plate<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.880> had<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.630> choice<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.960> choose

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
license plate you had a choice to choose

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.960 
license plate you had a choice to choose
from<00:02:59.620> four<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.250> one<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.400> wanted<00:03:00.850> because

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
from four is the one I wanted because

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.720 
from four is the one I wanted because
you<00:03:01.270> can<00:03:01.510> slightly<00:03:01.810> adjust<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.650> it's<00:03:03.550> got

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
you can slightly adjust it it's got

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.440 
you can slightly adjust it it's got
infrared<00:03:04.030> for<00:03:04.420> nighttime<00:03:06.150> we'll<00:03:07.150> see<00:03:07.300> how

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
infrared for nighttime we'll see how

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.850 
infrared for nighttime we'll see how
well<00:03:07.600> work<00:03:07.840> someplace<00:03:08.080> that<00:03:08.350> forever<00:03:08.560> breaks

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
well work someplace that forever breaks

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.040 
well work someplace that forever breaks
down<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.430> could<00:03:10.240> always<00:03:10.390> replace<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.930> with

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
down I could always replace it with

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.199 
down I could always replace it with
another<00:03:11.080> one<00:03:13.920> this<00:03:14.920> I'm<00:03:15.310> going<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.730> assume

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
another one this I'm going to assume

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.410 
another one this I'm going to assume
would<00:03:16.630> be<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.989> power<00:03:17.230> cable<00:03:17.920> for<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.940> backup

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
would be the power cable for the backup

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.820 
would be the power cable for the backup
camera<00:03:21.270> this<00:03:22.270> is<00:03:22.570> your<00:03:22.810> main<00:03:23.020> control<00:03:23.470> box

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
camera this is your main control box

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.510 
camera this is your main control box
right<00:03:24.190> here<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.330> rear<00:03:26.220> looks<00:03:27.220> like<00:03:27.430> you

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
right here for the rear looks like you

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.840 
right here for the rear looks like you
got<00:03:27.610> your<00:03:27.820> power<00:03:28.030> wire<00:03:28.300> going<00:03:28.739> for<00:03:29.739> sensors<00:03:30.550> an

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
got your power wire going for sensors an

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.000 
got your power wire going for sensors an
AV<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.600> out<00:03:33.930> obviously<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.110> must<00:03:35.380> be<00:03:35.470> for

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
AV in and out obviously that must be for

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.750 
AV in and out obviously that must be for
the<00:03:36.130> main<00:03:36.280> power

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.089 

this<00:03:43.330> one<00:03:43.569> here<00:03:43.780> goes<00:03:43.810> out<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.409> your<00:03:44.500> audio<00:03:44.950> and

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
this one here goes out to your audio and

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:51.030 
this one here goes out to your audio and
video<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.670> even<00:03:49.180> comes<00:03:49.569> with<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.200> hole<00:03:50.680> saw

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
video and it even comes with a hole saw

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.490 
video and it even comes with a hole saw
to<00:03:51.069> drill<00:03:51.340> holes<00:03:53.189> look<00:03:54.189> at<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:55.230> if<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.349> don't

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
to drill holes look at that if you don't

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.940 
to drill holes look at that if you don't
want<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.739> screw<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.069> up<00:04:00.510> that's<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.750> that's

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
want to screw it up that's it that's

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.830 
want to screw it up that's it that's
that's<00:04:02.950> all<00:04:03.099> that's<00:04:03.190> in<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.459> box<00:04:03.700> well<00:04:04.659> there

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
that's all that's in the box well there

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.300 
that's all that's in the box well there
you<00:04:04.900> have<00:04:04.959> it's<00:04:05.230> pretty<00:04:05.470> simple<00:04:05.739> video<00:04:06.069> and

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
you have it's pretty simple video and

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.890 
you have it's pretty simple video and
when<00:04:06.489> we<00:04:06.640> install<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.209> I'll<00:04:07.450> go<00:04:07.599> more<00:04:07.840> into

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
when we install it I'll go more into

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.569 
when we install it I'll go more into
depth<00:04:08.379> and<00:04:08.590> what's<00:04:08.709> all<00:04:08.859> involved<00:04:09.129> so<00:04:09.430> if<00:04:09.489> you

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
depth and what's all involved so if you

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:10.500 
depth and what's all involved so if you
have<00:04:09.670> any<00:04:09.790> questions<00:04:10.120> comments<00:04:10.420> or<00:04:10.450> concerns
