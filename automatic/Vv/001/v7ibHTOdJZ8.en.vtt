00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
of fun on stream i believe and getting

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.580 
of fun on stream i believe and getting
quite<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> bit<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.479> viewers<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:30.840> well<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.200> it's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
quite a bit of viewers as well so it's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.810 
quite a bit of viewers as well so it's
really<00:01:31.770> nice<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.189> everyone's<00:01:32.460> support<00:01:32.729> on

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
really nice to see everyone's support on

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.940 
really nice to see everyone's support on
there<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.380> made<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.890> much

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
there and it's just made it so much

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740 
there and it's just made it so much
easier<00:01:35.250> doing<00:01:35.640> bosses<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.210> God<00:01:36.390> words<00:01:36.600> which

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
easier doing bosses like God words which

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
easier doing bosses like God words which
are<00:01:36.840> normally<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.680> boring<00:01:37.920> but

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
are normally really really boring but

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.710 
are normally really really boring but
then<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.759> you're<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:38.970> stream<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.570> makes

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
then if you're on stream it just makes

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.210 
then if you're on stream it just makes
it<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.930> much<00:01:40.350> easier<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> lot

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
it that much easier and it's a lot

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.499 
it that much easier and it's a lot
easier<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:42.000> stay<00:01:42.210> there<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.479> long

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
easier to you know stay there for long

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.109 
easier to you know stay there for long
periods<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:43.020> time<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.380> grind<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.579> here's<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
periods of time and grind but here's the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.510 
periods of time and grind but here's the
td's<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> first<00:01:47.280> drop<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
td's and we get this is the first drop a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.740 
td's and we get this is the first drop a
gun<00:01:47.759> from<00:01:47.850> dd's<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.720> most

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
gun from dd's and it was the most

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.050 
gun from dd's and it was the most
expensive<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.740> dragon<00:01:50.130> limbs<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
expensive one the dragon limbs so it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880 
expensive one the dragon limbs so it
only<00:01:51.149> took<00:01:51.329> me<00:01:51.390> about<00:01:51.479> an<00:01:52.170> hour<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> half<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
only took me about an hour and a half to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.160 
only took me about an hour and a half to
get<00:01:53.009> those<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.180> got<00:01:54.479> fairly<00:01:54.780> lucky<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
get those so I got fairly lucky on the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.160 
get those so I got fairly lucky on the
td's<00:01:55.439> ones<00:01:55.710> i<00:01:55.920> would<00:01:56.040> say<00:01:56.189> although<00:01:56.430> i<00:01:57.170> had

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
td's ones i would say although i had

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.170 
td's ones i would say although i had
done<00:01:58.590> several<00:01:59.100> trips<00:01:59.460> before<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> past

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
done several trips before in the past

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.630 
done several trips before in the past
but<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.780> my<00:02:00.930> first<00:02:01.110> trip<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.649> stream<00:02:02.100> so

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
but this was my first trip on stream so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.700 
but this was my first trip on stream so
i<00:02:02.670> believe<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.570> some<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.560> like

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
i believe that some of it is just like

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.069 
i believe that some of it is just like
the<00:02:04.890> stream<00:02:05.159> luck<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.610> really<00:02:05.969> helping<00:02:06.299> it's

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the stream luck is really helping it's

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.809 
the stream luck is really helping it's
made<00:02:07.380> by<00:02:07.409> drop<00:02:07.770> rates<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.069> lot<00:02:08.280> better<00:02:08.520> ever

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
made by drop rates a lot better ever

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.460 
made by drop rates a lot better ever
since<00:02:08.910> i<00:02:09.209> started<00:02:09.270> streaming<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.020> i<00:02:10.050> really<00:02:10.289> do

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
since i started streaming so i really do

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.199 
since i started streaming so i really do
appreciate<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.979> but<00:02:11.610> anyway<00:02:11.730> those<00:02:12.060> are<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
appreciate that but anyway those are the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.730

some drops for those but they are not

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.530 
some drops for those but they are not
expensive<00:03:28.770> enough<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.610> qualify<00:03:29.880> those<00:03:30.330> bosses

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
expensive enough to qualify those bosses

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.290 
expensive enough to qualify those bosses
as<00:03:30.900> done<00:03:31.260> but<00:03:31.980> anyway<00:03:32.280> all<00:03:32.460> I<00:03:32.490> can<00:03:32.730> say<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:32.940> this
