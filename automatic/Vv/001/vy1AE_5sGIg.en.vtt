00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.389
 here came to the tire said by 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.280
 40 minutes will do this 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.960
 procedure 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:18.510
 that is, remove the four wheel tires and 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.859
 stick them that is more accurately remove the tire 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.949
 old stick on new tires 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.990
 This is how a wheel looks without without 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.119
 number of wheels is dirty 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.710
 I was confused of course that's part of this 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.010
 bent otep some he too 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.700
 uneven here but I was told it should 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.700
 be zermatt 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.630
 very long here it is 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.420
 pneumatic tool with her course 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.519
 fast wheels are removed 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.420
 these screws fall asleep the bolts are removed and 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.420
 dress very well 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.350
 start but had such here everyday 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.150
 came another that the installation turned out that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.760
 in tone you too they cannot work with 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.860
 rubber ranflet once from this type 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.690
 such on which even if it pierces 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.490
 and there about what you can tknotsya eight 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.130
 kilometers traveled then there is such 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.900
 oak tires which you are not 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.940
 we can also dismantle each tire 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.400
 they could not remove the disk 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.850
 the disk was such a rubber on 2 disks as 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.770
 would be the usual here actually attempt number 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:38.340
 2 take number two here I am assured that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.340
 they work with such rubber on the truth of them 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.930
 there is no longer this pneumatic tool 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.580
 which unscrew and twist already 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.330
 made and here 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.860
 gone yet 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.270
 is it that work here will already cost 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.390
 2,000 rubles and there 2,200 spoke like this 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.390
 here 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.840
 and this front shot well 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.890
 and whether to eliminate 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.959
 grusha did not do how to say here 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.890
 but if you go there right here straight right 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.890
 and there was I, Robot
