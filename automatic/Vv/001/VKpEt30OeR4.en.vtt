 a week after winning the johan 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.029
 cruff scale through that dazzling 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.849
 victory in the Amsterdam arena 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.920
 ajax will really start for psv 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.309

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.560
 Saturday night against RKC in Waalwijk 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.600
 and it was at the final training 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.609
 exorbitant pressure on the re-run 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.859
 about fifteen hundred supporters saw the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.680
 players in their final training 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.269
 position play play he orlando engelaar 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.710
 working on his recovery on his own 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.269
 still slightly injured but will 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.109
 no doubt quickly reconnect with the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.009
 group 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.620
 and for the rest it begins 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.100
 Saturday night all finally yes again 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.360

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.489
 for is 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.660
 and now we have to go see what 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.829
 we can do that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.960
 have of course best last Sunday 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.550
 issued a nice business card 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.020
 yes but this is another game there 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.370
 another opponent often difficult 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.800
 opponents but tomorrow we have to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.149
 show that we are on the right track 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.590
 that in the form for bring none either 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.690
 have a wetzer floor and that should be too 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.520
 trust but the preparation is the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.559
 psv would be so happy to prepare one 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.550
 made a flaming start in the Dutch 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.750
 League 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.129
 first with that away match in waalwijk 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.770
 then next week 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.780
 the home game against roda jc 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.909
 PSV lost another one last season 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.549
 very important competition in waalwijk 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.490
 then became 2nd in favor of the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.680
 home team but now everyone realizes 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.439

 simply must be won yes always 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.520
 but the whole group i have is that we 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.259
 just have to watch it and bullying 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.759
 against teams like a museum 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.329
 with all due respect then you just have to 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.799
 winds because all sustainably reversed 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.380
