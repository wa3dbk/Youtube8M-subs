00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.369
 the initiative soonwald has invited 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.369
 the ministry especially the 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.270
 Minister for a forest visit in the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.120
 soonwald and here we like the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.129
 beauties peculiarities of the forest 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.860
 once show the initiative soonwald 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.140
 has been asking for a very long time 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.589
 nature of a national park busy 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.870
 you just have to think about the three 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:50.750
 great conferences these and conferences 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.000
 we did and some 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.309
 other events for example 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.510
 such events with leaders of 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:03.140
 national park as forestry director here in the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.390
 board duckfoot I was relative 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.880
 long namely 30 years and I know that 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.020
 soonwald actually very good 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.460
 besides , I was in America and I have 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.350
 there are also ten national parks 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.830
 met and in Canada also 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.899
 Which 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.570
 that means I already know quite well 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.600
 and therefore have a scale 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.569
 and can say that the soonwald 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.959
 really well here in the 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:28.910
 series of the national park fits and that 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:31.459
 that's a good decision 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.720
 her intentions forest as a national park 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.720
 would choose 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:45.050
 i love this soonwald is for me 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.500
 as paradise the trees of 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.850
 black stork wise faith lives and 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.470
 There are many species of animals worthy of protection 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.270
 here 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.700
 the son was the most beautiful for me 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.869
 woodland germany 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.830
 i visited the bavarian forest in 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.830
 holiday who can who can then type 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.630
 that so much higher quality we need 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.250
 we play for human and animal and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.250
 that's why national parks once 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.610
 i want that diversity 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:26.560
 of our plants and animals 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:28.960
 we need big woodlands the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.630
 but also need to be maintained 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.380
 need our native orchids 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.450
 your special locations the regulations 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.610
 from a national park are therefore 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.130
 required 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.880
 we need our national park 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.950
 soonwald-nah if we like the landscape like that 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.740
 we actually see today 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.950
 a natural landscape but in 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.720
 Reality is what the earth is through 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.160
 which has produced evolution and we 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.630
 we have to be clear that we have the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.970
 character of this landscape is not 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.130
 may change the landscape belongs 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.630
 all of us 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.730
 the rhine hunsrÃ¼ck circle already has today 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.470
 100 percent of the energy he needs 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.120
 through renewable systems we produce 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.250
 now have a situation that completely 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.810
 Reckless pursuit of profit 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.950
 an excess of wind turbines 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.660
 I would say that has to be done 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.490
 led to the worst devastation 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.280
 since the Thirty Years War 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.620
 our landscape is just because of that 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.780
 it is especially important that nature is 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.130
 also the human and the animals and the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.959
 need plants retreat 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:45.850
 Only recently has a group of citizens 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.550
 5000 signatures against this 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.370
 Saving the son forest and against 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.440
 the aggressive spread of 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.959
 wind turbines in the state government 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.810
 located in mainz 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.040
 our position is indeed renewable 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.530
 energies 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.090
 but no to your conservation 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.170
 enemy spread 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.170
 I stand for that 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.250
 I would like to have one 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:17.500
 Economics in nature conservation 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:21.949
 forest would make redundant 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.770
 but at the moment the son is over 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.720
 not only about the soonwald before 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.510
 over the whole hunsrÃ¼ck one 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.030
 Landscape and forest destruction associated 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.260
 as they like it for a long time 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.169
 had not been there yet 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.210
 in my opinion, the forest people more 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.340
 in front of their forest 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.340
 I am very disappointed about that 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.120
 a very good feeling here too 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.000
 stand and have a strong tree in the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.289
 to feel an old oak on the back 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.740
 maybe it already seemed to be his 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.090
 horse has tethered and it does me 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.849
 at the same time it almost hurts me 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.370
 physically hurt to know that this 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.110
 maybe last one of the last 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.979
 small or intactness in 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.830
 Germany the Soonwald without special 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:22.770
 protection status is there and no strong 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:26.409
 lobby has that is incredible for me 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.840
 I have great hopes for the new one 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:32.530
 red green state government set and 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.680
 your competence and hoped that it would be more 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.560
 protection for our protection exists so far 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.360
 unfortunately not yet happened as well 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.090
 national park we are now in the 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.969
 second row 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:49.110
 although we have all the prerequisites for it 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:52.349
 have a successful one here 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.870
 new national park for rhineland-palatinate 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:59.770
 to be able to found 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:01.569
 Once upon a time there is biodiversity 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.419
 Worth here is to be protected 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.779
 animals have the sensitive ones here 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.310
 Bioindicators are for the 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:12.310
 closed nature of the woodland like the 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:16.889
 Lynx again black stork the wildcat 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:19.210
 and we have tourist features here 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.250
 the for a national park 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.130
 that is unique in Germany 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:28.090
 close to the viticultural areas and there are three 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.370
 kurbÃ¤der and we are very close to it 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.020
 the conurbations the infrastructure 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.300
 that means you could get one here 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.719
 National Park customers the one-time 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.340
 profile would have Europe-wide and safe 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:41.259
 successful and who to success it is 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.870
 We are passionate 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:46.240
 Discussed for years here and always 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.539
 want more people in the summer dream 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.390
 a national park and I think 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:54.870
 we have the level 2 now 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.870
 earned
