00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.480
 hello everyone welcome to this new 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.460
 video and today I bring you a 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.960
 very interesting game to pass those 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.059
 moments of boredom when we are 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.860
 waiting when we go on the transport 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.860
 or something is a pretty game 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.230
 interesting that besides entertaining us 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.849
 we will be speeding up the mind is a 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.429
 game like a puzzle is very interesting 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.609
 and it's a pretty pretty good game 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:27.699
 for these moments since it is not 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.939
 very long and it is by levels and so what 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.240
 we are going through each one as we 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.180
 let's go do something good here we have 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.500
 the game has quite a few levels it has 7 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.320
 as we can see 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.360
 and as you can see it is very minimalist and 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.150
 Besides this, it has some 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.760
 animations pretty well achieved and 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.309
 because the design and the music are very 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.559
 good, let's go to the first 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.360
 levels the game as it goes 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.440
 advancing is usually complicated and then I 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.960
 is right now in the first 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.970
 levels so let's go with this 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.680
 it's very interesting to come back with some 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.030
 level that has already happened so that I do not 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.340
 make it look bad and here we have 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.500
 good as you can see the logic of this 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:24.370
 game is to pass these rows 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.400
 above the color and let's say have 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.590
 all the colors together is to say 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.470
 let's say for example in this case could 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.270
 press this as you can see the color has 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.260
 passed over both of the two 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:42.119
 pictures and they are purple so that the 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.680
 box is highlighted one of two or you have to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.500
 two lines of the same color go through 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.660
 above that picture or that some other 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.060
 line of color that has gone through that 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.000
 box and the color line of the box 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.310
 pass over is a logic a small 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.630
 a bit complicated but that's how you play and 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.030
 it's pretty entertaining after 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.729
 one catches the logic of the game in 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.610
 this case I have uploaded the line and here as 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.770
 we can see for the corner box 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.230
 Well, I have to put that same color 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.390
 because I can not place another one and here already 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.790
 I have marked that box has already been 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.459
 marked and now what I have to do 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.070
 is looking for a way to follow 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.040
 fitting the other boxes in my case 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.769
 well 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.760
 here as we can see I'm going to select 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.129
 this 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.110
 for the case of the color red goes to 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.710
 select here the red 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.420
 and how can you see so that the color 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.590
 work 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.880
 what we have to do is pass this 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.330
 above but it has gone badly so 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.370
 this afternoon 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.580
 I'm going to cross in red as you can see 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.710
 has worked and now what I'm going to 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.440
 to do is to pass the purple over 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.480
 these two as you can see I have crossed the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.180
 two bruises and the bony picture 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.769
 darkened and in this case there was the 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.239
 red color below and I've gone on 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.940
 purple above that's why it worked 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.680
 in the case of red as you can see the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.569
 Purple line is below and red 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.470
 above that's why it's been highlighted 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.810
 Now in the case of blue light 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.000
 I'm going to go over and go to 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.940
 highlight and finally I have color 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.400
 red well this way we have passed 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.620
 this level and how can you see the game 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.040
 Well, as I explained, what happened 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.519
 easy enough this level 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.650
 it was a bit simple but to 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.750
 As we move forward and as we 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.549
 discovering the logic of the game as it 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.079
 is complicating a bit in the first 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.359
 levels may be a bit difficult 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.980
 while we take the logic and then to 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.420
 As we progress, it looks 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.519
 much more complicated as you can see 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.739
 there are much more levels and 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.269
 complicated more and more the thing is very 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.220
 very entertaining then let's go 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.970
 backwards and as you can see this is the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.159
 level 1 of 7 and then we have many more 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.319
 levels and many more difficulties up 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.810
 that we reach level 7 because it's going to be 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.689
 much more more complicated as you can see 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.819
 the game is quite complete and for 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.159
 be perfect for those moments of 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.530
 boredom the game is free and there 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.060
 a paid version but I'll take the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.919
 free version since it offers almost what 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.410
 same and then you have a bit of 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.910
 advertising but it's worth it has a 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.970
 little advertising for an excellent 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.660
 good game this has been the game that 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.670
 I want to recommend you in this video 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.710
 and before saying goodbye I want to ask you 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.680
 I want to comment on that and finished 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.780
 schedule to develop design and do 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.190
 everything in my English application which 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.860
 I was programming during all these 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.110
 months and it was already determined so that 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.940
 I leave the description in the link in the 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.040
 description of the video I hope the 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.230
 download and that you like that is the 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.800
 main objective that they like to 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.060
 you and help them if you like you can 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.520

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.470
 and if they do not like it, they also comment 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.870
 positively on the place thor and leave 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.240
