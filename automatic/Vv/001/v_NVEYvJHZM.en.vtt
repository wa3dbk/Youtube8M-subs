00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.300
 hello I am critical camille and crime 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.210
 light a program dedicated to the art of 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.310
 photography is today I'm going to speak is one of 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.180
 a concept an idea that died already 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.880
 right time and it is related to the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.939
 breach of composition rules 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.520
 if we think about it, it happens frequently 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.040
 and why is the discography so 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.510
 strong and often do not have elements 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.399
 of composition or a jotÃ£o organization 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.130
 visible so understandable 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.840
 this is because photography as 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.210
 art is often strong because 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.500
 captures the very important moment 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.230
 can be a very important moment to 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.600
 You are important to the family that 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.280
 is photographing important moment 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.820
 for a specific person photography 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.890
 have this property of connecting with 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.770
 the story of someone who might not 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.939
 be your story 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.380
 we often have photographs that are 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.979
 very strong in composition but not in the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.780
 visual organization element 18 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.610
 exactly it is by the human element there 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.960
 by the strong connection it generates 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:27.710
 story behind the photo and it happens that 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.909
 go to the rules of composition that one has 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.979
 that having a time only you can 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.729
 check a channel that is very dense almost 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.650
 an hour in which various tips of is and does 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.390
 an in- depth analysis of techniques for 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.640
 apply design to photography 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.740
 all this is very useful when you are 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.350
 your impression when you need to be 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.310
 creative in photography in a way 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.159
 that what is photographing does not give you 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.640
 a lot of expression give us lots of 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.700
 visual connection for example is one we 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.080
 Classic is not working with fifa 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.420
 wedding he has to shoot 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.640
 dumplings is the sweet leave you have to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.680
 work composition of the future make a 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.500
 rehearsal with the couple whether marriage is 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.870
 And the couple is getting a lot out of 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.400
 expression is not taking too many scenes 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.720
 different you have to work with 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.310
 position but often occurs in 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.459
 in front of the camera happens things 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.910
 fantastic people they give a few 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.850
 scenes are expressions 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.550
 but I can not say something singular about 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.620
 another unique moment and a beautiful idea 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.480
 and cartier bresson cited much in his 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.520
 your photographs is that idea. 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.950
 of a turning point when you 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.140
 photograph something at the right time 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.400
 You got something for something. 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.320
 expressive 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.140
 something that was not is not seen in a way 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.930
 very ordinary in the ordinary you finish 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.560
 capturing there and you can find 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.040
 elements of composition as contrast 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.880
 Positive Negative Plane Ratio 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.890
 you can find the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.650
 rule of the text all 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.960
 photography but more importantly 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.450
 to be actually the fact that you 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.080
 recorded the moment you captured the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.510
 human history in that photograph is 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.250
 some students ask me, ah, okay? 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.130
 I'll have to keep thinking about composition. 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.840
 when shooting an event without 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.090
 to be thinking text rule have to 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.180
 think of plans you have not 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.550
 all depends on what we are giving to 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.170
 you in front of your camera 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.060
 people all expressions they 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.420
 They are giving moments I would say 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.480
 composition rationally it is a 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.550
 tool that photographers can use 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.250
 when there is in fact the demand for 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.050
 be creative when you are not giving anything 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.090
 of interesting in front of the camera 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.580
 if you are seeing things happen 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.040
 exciting is seeing things happen 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.650
 is that it never occurred before nature 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.750
 is taking something unheard of 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.550
 So you think so much about composition 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.980
 such rational chance 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.160
 You can leave me some way. 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.100
 your spirit more connected with the scene 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.230
 and that's when the idea is already there. 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.840
 videos and how important are you behind 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.610
 the camera a many relaxed camera 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.170
 times behind the camera brings the viewfinder 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.750
 is much more important because it increases 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.690
 the chances of you capturing that 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.940
 moment in time to raise cameras 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.440
 already lost that idea that 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.620
 you may have missed this 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.750
 decisive moment of the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.180
 only occurred many among the 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.110
 clicks I have already 78 episodes is 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.260
 photographing 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.210
 if you saw the scene you did not photograph 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.370
 s10 and saw there in your saying you do not 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.270
 lost the photo 3 that is taking photos 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.139
 I also think that in the 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.599
 photography 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:55.099
 does not exist after saying a certain rule of 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:57.770
 conduct but you feel free insurance 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:01.009
 feels delivered the scene is going to help you 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.840
 others to capture special moments 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.630
 important moments 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.770
 visually beautiful you can compose scene 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:13.849
 It can perfectly 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.190
 visually the scene but often the 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.349
 that will give the human to a story 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.020
 the strong connection is someone there. 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.340
 someone trying something unique 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.910
 can be nature can also be a 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.169
 animal can be can be yourself in the 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.710
 front of the photo 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.979
 so think about it is the composition she is 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.110
 often broken because of this 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.960
 history of human connection has to do with 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.099
 the story in front of the photo 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.750
 Many thanks to everyone for channel 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.470
 in the next big video mistakes 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.470
 hug to everyone
