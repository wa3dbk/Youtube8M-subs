00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
is awesome but uh then 14 is definitely

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.430 
is awesome but uh then 14 is definitely
not<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.120> good<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.360> they<00:00:51.510> fail<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.110> still<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
not as good as they fail it's still a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
not as good as they fail it's still a
two-shot<00:00:52.860> kill<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.510> this

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
two-shot kill just like it but this

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360 
two-shot kill just like it but this
thing<00:00:54.780> has<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> lot<00:00:55.020> more<00:00:55.289> kick<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.280> lot

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
thing has a lot more kick to it and lot

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.889 
thing has a lot more kick to it and lot
more<00:00:56.399> recoil<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:58.739> still<00:00:58.980> fun<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.190> use<00:00:59.430> but

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
more recoil it's still fun to use but

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
more recoil it's still fun to use but
it's<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.020> little<00:01:01.260> bit<00:01:01.379> harder<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.010> know<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.399> you

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it's a little bit harder you know if you

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.070 
it's a little bit harder you know if you
want<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.000> challenge<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.719> go<00:01:03.960> ahead

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
want that challenge then you go ahead

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080 
want that challenge then you go ahead
and<00:01:04.290> use<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> FAL<00:01:05.880> more

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
and use this but I like the FAL more

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.670 
and use this but I like the FAL more
because<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.689> spray<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.320> actually<00:01:07.560> hit

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
because I like to spray and actually hit

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440 
because I like to spray and actually hit
my<00:01:07.799> target<00:01:07.860> instead<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.549> spraying<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
my target instead of spraying and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.500 
my target instead of spraying and
shooting<00:01:09.869> above<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:11.090> even<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> grip

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
shooting above them even with the grip

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.950 
shooting above them even with the grip
it's<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.500> crazy<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.960> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it's a little a little crazy but you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.050 
it's a little a little crazy but you
know<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.220> even<00:01:17.520> counteract

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
know if you if you can even counteract

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.580 
know if you if you can even counteract
that<00:01:18.150> by<00:01:18.270> pulling<00:01:18.750> down<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> thumbstick<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that by pulling down on the thumbstick a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.109 
that by pulling down on the thumbstick a
lot<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.340> sometimes<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.909> kind<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
lot it's just sometimes it kind of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.100 
lot it's just sometimes it kind of
catches<00:01:21.299> me<00:01:21.570> off<00:01:21.600> guard

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
catches me off guard

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.539 
catches me off guard
we<00:01:22.650> still<00:01:22.830> did<00:01:22.950> pretty<00:01:23.130> good<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.460> game

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
we still did pretty good in this game

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.560 
we still did pretty good in this game
when<00:01:23.880> 22<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.450> 7<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.670> 3.14<00:01:26.670> killed<00:01:27.299> death

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
when 22 and 7 it is a 3.14 killed death

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.830 
when 22 and 7 it is a 3.14 killed death
ratio<00:01:27.780> which<00:01:28.590> anything<00:01:29.130> ever<00:01:29.310> probably<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> 2.0

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
ratio which anything ever probably a 2.0

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.990 
ratio which anything ever probably a 2.0
I<00:01:30.900> would<00:01:31.229> say<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.770> good<00:01:31.920> player<00:01:32.159> you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
I would say that's a good player you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.340 
I would say that's a good player you
know<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> may<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:33.810> different<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> may

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
know you may think different you may

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.499 
know you may think different you may
have<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> 3.0<00:01:35.220> or<00:01:35.400> whatever<00:01:35.640> maybe<00:01:36.060> even<00:01:36.329> higher

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
have a 3.0 or whatever maybe even higher

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.160 
have a 3.0 or whatever maybe even higher
and<00:01:36.750> uh<00:01:37.670> honestly<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.780> try<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.079> all

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and uh honestly if I really try it all

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.969 
and uh honestly if I really try it all
the<00:01:40.259> time<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:40.890> easily<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> 3.0<00:01:42.979> when

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the time I could easily have a 3.0 when

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.200 
the time I could easily have a 3.0 when
I'm<00:01:44.100> actually<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.149> I'm

usually get them and I don't know it's

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.770 
usually get them and I don't know it's
just<00:03:19.799> fun<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.940> get<00:03:21.090> them<00:03:21.239> back<00:03:21.419> for<00:03:21.599> what<00:03:21.750> they

running around with Olympia on like a

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.069 
running around with Olympia on like a
good<00:04:03.689> sniping<00:04:04.199> map<00:04:04.379> or<00:04:04.560> something<00:04:04.739> then<00:04:05.900> if<00:04:06.900> I

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
good sniping map or something then if I

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.199 
good sniping map or something then if I

you know good positive a little bit at

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.110 
you know good positive a little bit at
least<00:04:13.379> not<00:04:13.560> go<00:04:13.709> negative<00:04:13.949> because<00:04:14.759> I<00:04:14.790> don't

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
least not go negative because I don't

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.800 
least not go negative because I don't
want<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.359> be<00:04:15.419> the<00:04:15.540> cause<00:04:15.689> of<00:04:15.720> us<00:04:16.049> losing<00:04:17.810> but

want to be the cause of us losing but

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.029 
want to be the cause of us losing but
you<00:04:18.870> know<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.109> course<00:04:19.289> I<00:04:19.470> could<00:04:19.650> be<00:04:19.680> turning

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
you know of course I could be turning

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.680 
you know of course I could be turning
the<00:04:20.099> whole<00:04:20.220> time<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.729> actually<00:04:21.000> make<00:04:21.180> up<00:04:21.329> for

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
the whole time and actually make up for

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.740 
the whole time and actually make up for
some<00:04:21.900> some<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.590> my<00:04:22.680> teammates<00:04:23.010> downfalls<00:04:23.750> but

some some of my teammates downfalls but

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.089 
some some of my teammates downfalls but
you<00:04:24.840> know<00:04:24.960> I<00:04:24.990> don't<00:04:25.169> want<00:04:25.409> to<00:04:25.500> go<00:04:25.560> try<00:04:25.770> hard<00:04:25.979> all

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
you know I don't want to go try hard all

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.920 
you know I don't want to go try hard all
the<00:04:26.190> time

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
the time

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.600 
the time
like<00:04:27.080> playing<00:04:27.350> like<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.949> mean<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.520> course

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
like playing like that I mean of course

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.800 
like playing like that I mean of course
that's<00:04:28.820> why<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.030> have<00:04:29.150> them<00:04:29.240> out<00:04:29.389> of<00:04:29.509> controller

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
that's why I have them out of controller

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.650 
that's why I have them out of controller
is<00:04:29.990> more<00:04:30.410> fun<00:04:30.880> but<00:04:31.880> anyway<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.210> see<00:04:32.419> me<00:04:32.509> call

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
is more fun but anyway you see me call

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.010 
is more fun but anyway you see me call
any<00:04:32.810> care<00:04:32.990> package<00:04:33.880> packages<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.300> don't<00:04:35.900> know

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
any care package packages I don't know

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.300 
any care package packages I don't know
what<00:04:36.259> I<00:04:36.289> was<00:04:36.470> trying<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.770> say<00:04:36.949> aren't<00:04:37.160> there

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
what I was trying to say aren't there

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.999 
what I was trying to say aren't there
call<00:04:38.030> calling<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.229> care<00:04:39.380> packages<00:04:39.800> and

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
call calling and care packages and

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.129 
call calling and care packages and
usually<00:04:41.000> I'm<00:04:41.090> actually<00:04:41.419> pretty<00:04:41.690> generous

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
usually I'm actually pretty generous

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.719 
usually I'm actually pretty generous
with<00:04:42.320> these<00:04:42.470> but<00:04:42.680> in<00:04:42.770> this<00:04:42.860> game<00:04:43.070> I<00:04:43.340> don't<00:04:43.400> know

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
with these but in this game I don't know

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.249 
with these but in this game I don't know
why<00:04:43.970> would<00:04:44.330> I<00:04:44.360> decided<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.870> take<00:04:44.990> them<00:04:45.110> for

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
why would I decided to take them for

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:45.730 
why would I decided to take them for
myself

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
myself

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.520 
myself
probably<00:04:46.669> about<00:04:46.729> 95%<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.750> time<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:48.139> give<00:04:48.380> them

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
probably about 95% of time I give them

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.409 
probably about 95% of time I give them
away<00:04:48.650> to<00:04:48.800> my<00:04:49.160> teammates<00:04:49.580> just<00:04:50.150> because<00:04:50.330> I

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
away to my teammates just because I

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.570 
away to my teammates just because I
figure<00:04:50.690> if<00:04:50.810> I'm<00:04:50.960> getting<00:04:51.259> care<00:04:51.500> packages<00:04:51.919> then

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
figure if I'm getting care packages then

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.939 
figure if I'm getting care packages then
most<00:04:52.820> likely<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:53.210> don't<00:04:53.539> need<00:04:53.720> extra<00:04:53.900> kills<00:04:54.350> and

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
most likely I don't need extra kills and

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.760 
most likely I don't need extra kills and
sure<00:04:55.160> they<00:04:55.340> are<00:04:55.490> low<00:04:55.729> killstreaks<00:04:56.270> but<00:04:56.770> you

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
sure they are low killstreaks but you

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.540 
sure they are low killstreaks but you
know<00:04:57.949> I<00:04:57.979> I<00:04:58.520> don't<00:04:59.000> care<00:04:59.259> how<00:05:00.259> many<00:05:00.440> kills<00:05:00.680> yeah

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
know I I don't care how many kills yeah

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.700 
know I I don't care how many kills yeah
if<00:05:01.820> if<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.780> was<00:05:02.990> going<00:05:03.229> for<00:05:03.349> higher<00:05:03.500> kill

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
if if I was going for higher kill

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.499 
if if I was going for higher kill
streaks<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.160> just<00:05:04.370> kept<00:05:04.550> going<00:05:04.669> instead<00:05:05.389> of

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
streaks and I just kept going instead of

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:06.700 
streaks and I just kept going instead of
running<00:05:05.720> out<00:05:05.870> in<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.020> open<00:05:06.259> to<00:05:06.349> set<00:05:06.530> out<00:05:06.680> a

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
running out in the open to set out a

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.040 
running out in the open to set out a
sentry<00:05:07.220> gun<00:05:07.400> then<00:05:08.060> yeah<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.300> probably<00:05:08.840> could

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050
