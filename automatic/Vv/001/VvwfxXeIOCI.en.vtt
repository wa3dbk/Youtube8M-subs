00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
you work around so you've got the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.220 
you work around so you've got the
different<00:00:17.460> stages<00:00:17.790> so<00:00:18.210> I've<00:00:18.450> so<00:00:18.720> far<00:00:18.750> either

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
different stages so I've so far either

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.530 
different stages so I've so far either
not<00:00:19.530> at<00:00:19.620> stage<00:00:19.860> 1<00:00:20.100> 2<00:00:20.280> &amp;<00:00:20.430> 3<00:00:20.460> obviously<00:00:21.030> you'll

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
not at stage 1 2 &amp; 3 obviously you'll

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.150 
not at stage 1 2 &amp; 3 obviously you'll
start<00:00:21.780> on<00:00:21.870> 1<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.230> everything<00:00:22.440> will<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.890> locked

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
start on 1 and everything will be locked

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.370 
start on 1 and everything will be locked
but<00:00:23.970> as<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.480> progress<00:00:24.630> through<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.050> levels

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
but as you progress through the levels

but as you progress through the levels
you<00:00:25.410> are<00:00:25.470> not<00:00:25.770> new<00:00:25.950> stages<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.670> eventually<00:00:27.000> you

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
you are not new stages so eventually you

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.060 
you are not new stages so eventually you
can<00:00:27.300> see<00:00:27.480> here<00:00:27.720> there's<00:00:28.020> 3<00:00:28.230> more<00:00:28.410> there<00:00:28.650> 3<00:00:28.920> more

has<00:01:30.149> now<00:01:30.539> pretty<00:01:30.780> much<00:01:30.960> gone<00:01:31.140> at<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> top<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
has now pretty much gone at the top and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.219 
has now pretty much gone at the top and
if<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.640> maybe<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.149> more<00:01:33.360> yep

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
if I do maybe one more yep

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
if I do maybe one more yep
that<00:01:34.410> now<00:01:34.649> it's<00:01:34.800> filled<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.190> green<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
that now it's filled up green and that

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
that now it's filled up green and that
only<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.200> balls<00:01:37.410> will<00:01:37.619> now<00:01:37.770> start<00:01:38.130> reversing

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
only the balls will now start reversing

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
only the balls will now start reversing
a<00:01:38.729> little<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.810> continue<00:01:40.350> coming<00:01:40.530> back

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
a little bit then continue coming back

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.020 
a little bit then continue coming back
to<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:40.920> middle<00:01:41.190> but<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.399> means<00:01:41.580> they'll<00:01:41.789> stop

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
to the middle but it means they'll stop

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.719 
to the middle but it means they'll stop
generating<00:01:42.660> so<00:01:42.930> before<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.950> meteor<00:01:44.700> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
generating so before that meteor is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.200 
generating so before that meteor is
filled

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
filled

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.990 
filled
they'll<00:01:45.390> continuously<00:01:46.080> coming<00:01:46.470> around<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.490> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
they'll continuously coming around so I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.820 
they'll continuously coming around so I
mean<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.900> want<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> only<00:01:49.260> got<00:01:49.590> lots<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
mean you want you only got lots of

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.490 
mean you want you only got lots of
combos<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.549> try<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.150> miss<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:52.170> any<00:01:52.350> of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
combos and try not to miss with any of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.710 
combos and try not to miss with any of
them<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.010> that<00:01:53.189> gets<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:54.000> know<00:01:54.030> full<00:01:54.570> as

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
them so that gets to you know full as

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.289 
them so that gets to you know full as
quickly<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.200> possible<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.830> then<00:01:56.670> once<00:01:57.119> you've

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
quickly as possible and then once you've

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.149 
quickly as possible and then once you've
hit<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.619> want<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.830> get<00:01:58.950> rid<00:01:59.070> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
hit that you just want to get rid of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.890 
hit that you just want to get rid of
them<00:01:59.310> before<00:01:59.790> they<00:02:00.119> hit<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.270> middle<00:02:00.509> then

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
them before they hit the middle then

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.710 
them before they hit the middle then
next<00:02:01.350> level<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.150> see<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.509> I've

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
next level so as you can see here I've

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.510 
next level so as you can see here I've
got<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.990> current<00:02:04.200> got<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> green<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.250> I've

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
got a current got a green one but I've

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.060 
got a current got a green one but I've
also<00:02:05.700> got<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.939> blue<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.600> reserve<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> hit

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
also got a blue one in reserve so I hit

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.800 
also got a blue one in reserve so I hit
that<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.329> hit<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.509> Frog<00:02:09.690> in

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
that if you just just hit the Frog in

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.060 
that if you just just hit the Frog in
the<00:02:09.869> middle<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.140> will<00:02:10.350> change<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.769> color<00:02:10.920> of

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
the middle that will change the color of

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.280 
the middle that will change the color of
the<00:02:11.190> ball<00:02:11.370> there<00:02:11.579> so<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:12.299> instead<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.959> wanted

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the ball there so if instead I wanted

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.410 
the ball there so if instead I wanted
blue<00:02:13.530> one<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.950> can<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.340> hit<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.489> then<00:02:15.030> shoot

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
blue one I can just hit that then shoot

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.180 
blue one I can just hit that then shoot
as<00:02:15.540> normal<00:02:15.959> they<00:02:16.530> see<00:02:16.590> here<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.070> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
as normal they see here that the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.430 
as normal they see here that the
wrongest<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.670> middle<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.570> just<00:02:18.959> try<00:02:19.380> and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
wrongest in the middle so I just try and

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.380 
wrongest in the middle so I just try and
fill<00:02:19.799> this<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.070> quickly<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.760> don't<00:02:20.970> hit<00:02:21.120> game

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
fill this in quickly so don't hit game

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.720 
fill this in quickly so don't hit game
over<00:02:21.720> now<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.590> notice<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.220> game<00:02:23.400> is

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
over now you notice that the game is

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.000 
over now you notice that the game is
maybe<00:02:24.209> running<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.600> bit<00:02:24.750> slow<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:25.380> device<00:02:25.709> but

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
maybe running a bit slow my device but

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.130 
maybe running a bit slow my device but
I'll<00:02:26.340> explain<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.360> second

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
I'll explain that in a second

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.930 
I'll explain that in a second
there's<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.680> few<00:02:28.890> power-ups<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:29.549> so<00:02:29.790> that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
there's a few power-ups there so that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.970 
there's a few power-ups there so that
for<00:02:30.120> example<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.810> destroyed<00:02:31.230> ones<00:02:31.500> near<00:02:31.799> it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
for example just destroyed ones near it

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.970 
for example just destroyed ones near it
this<00:02:32.549> one<00:02:32.820> will<00:02:33.269> do<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.420> same<00:02:33.720> there<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.200> this

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
this one will do the same there and this

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.920 
this one will do the same there and this
if<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.549> can<00:02:35.700> get<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.850> purple<00:02:36.329> one<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:36.750> see

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
if I can get a purple one you can see

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.360 
if I can get a purple one you can see
there's<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.260> reverse<00:02:37.650> one<00:02:37.890> there<00:02:38.070> so<00:02:38.100> hit

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
there's the reverse one there so hit

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.150 
there's the reverse one there so hit
that<00:02:38.400> all<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.450> more<00:02:39.660> reverse<00:02:40.019> now<00:02:40.829> you<00:02:40.890> might

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
that all the more reverse now you might

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.100 
that all the more reverse now you might
have<00:02:41.220> noticed<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.299> get<00:02:42.360> rid<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.840> set

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
have noticed that if I get rid of a set

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.160 
have noticed that if I get rid of a set
in<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.590> middle<00:02:44.100> it'll<00:02:44.880> stop<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.420> ones<00:02:45.630> ahead

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
in the middle it'll stop the ones ahead

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.900 
in the middle it'll stop the ones ahead
from<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.530> moving<00:02:47.069> until<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.610> one<00:02:47.760> behind

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
from you moving until the one behind

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.000 
from you moving until the one behind
catches<00:02:48.420> up<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.660> here<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.379> see<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.620> front<00:02:49.800> one

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
catches up to here you see the front one

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.800 
catches up to here you see the front one
stopped<00:02:50.280> moving<00:02:50.430> until<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.150> rest<00:02:51.330> catch<00:02:51.569> up

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
stopped moving until the rest catch up

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.490 
stopped moving until the rest catch up
and<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.260> kind

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and it kind

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.770 
and it kind
pushes<00:02:52.950> them<00:02:53.070> up<00:02:53.190> from<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> back<00:02:53.460> so<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.600> can

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
pushes them up from the back so that can

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.130 
pushes them up from the back so that can
make<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.200> bit<00:02:55.380> easier<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:57.720> notice<00:02:58.020> it

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
make it a bit easier and you notice it

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.010 
make it a bit easier and you notice it
the<00:02:58.200> JEM<00:02:58.380> door<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.650> rollback<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.660> if<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.750> just<00:03:00.930> go

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
the JEM door to rollback so if I just go

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.300 
the JEM door to rollback so if I just go
to<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.170> next<00:03:01.350> level<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.680> should<00:03:01.830> bury<00:03:02.190> that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
to the next level I should bury that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.710 
to the next level I should bury that
nice<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.760> easily<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.270> complete<00:03:03.600> the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
nice and easily so you complete the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.510 
nice and easily so you complete the
level<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.350> get<00:03:04.500> bonus<00:03:04.650> score<00:03:05.010> depending<00:03:05.430> on

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
level you get bonus score depending on

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.520 
level you get bonus score depending on
how<00:03:05.700> far<00:03:06.030> they<00:03:06.240> work<00:03:06.450> from<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.780> middle<00:03:07.050> unless

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
how far they work from the middle unless

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.460 
how far they work from the middle unless
you<00:03:07.800> combos<00:03:08.250> coins<00:03:09.150> gap<00:03:09.570> which<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:09.930> if<00:03:10.350> you

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
you combos coins gap which is if you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.320 
you combos coins gap which is if you
shoot<00:03:10.680> through<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.040> gap<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.670> create<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.970> combo

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
shoot through a gap to create a combo

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.840 
shoot through a gap to create a combo
max<00:03:12.720> chain<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.200> Max<00:03:13.350> cumber<00:03:13.680> there<00:03:13.860> next

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
max chain and Max cumber there next

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.220 
max chain and Max cumber there next
we'll<00:03:15.000> show<00:03:15.030> your<00:03:15.360> time<00:03:15.600> as<00:03:15.780> well<00:03:15.870> as<00:03:15.990> an<00:03:16.080> ace

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
we'll show your time as well as an ace

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.500 
we'll show your time as well as an ace
time<00:03:16.530> if<00:03:16.740> you<00:03:16.830> want<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.100> try<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.400> beat<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:17.550> so

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
time if you want to try and beat that so

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.100 
time if you want to try and beat that so
okay

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
okay

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.660 
okay
takes<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.560> next<00:03:19.830> level<00:03:20.160> which<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.550> this

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
takes to the next level which in this

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.370 
takes to the next level which in this
case<00:03:20.940> for<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.240> team<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.690> level<00:03:21.990> one<00:03:22.650> two<00:03:24.380> so

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
case for the team is a level one two so

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.370 
case for the team is a level one two so
each<00:03:25.770> level<00:03:26.040> has<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.670> different<00:03:27.150> map<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.690> you

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
each level has a different map and you

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.660 
each level has a different map and you
get<00:03:28.530> some<00:03:28.650> pretty<00:03:28.680> complicated<00:03:29.130> ones<00:03:29.459> later

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
get some pretty complicated ones later

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.800 
get some pretty complicated ones later
others<00:03:29.970> will<00:03:30.120> just<00:03:30.209> actually<00:03:30.480> start<00:03:30.690> going

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
others will just actually start going

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.470 
others will just actually start going
underneath<00:03:31.410> each<00:03:31.800> other<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.970> can<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.300> hard

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
underneath each other so it can be hard

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.180 
underneath each other so it can be hard
to<00:03:33.540> keep<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.750> track<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:33.989> hits<00:03:34.260> right<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.010> there's

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
to keep a track of hits right so there's

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.010 
to keep a track of hits right so there's
corn<00:03:35.400> over<00:03:35.640> there<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.090> want<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.420> hit<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
corn over there so you want to hit the

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.199 
corn over there so you want to hit the
coin<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.739> gives<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> few<00:03:38.459> bonus<00:03:38.730> points

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
coin that gives you a few bonus points

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.990 
coin that gives you a few bonus points
there<00:03:40.100> there's<00:03:41.100> another<00:03:41.310> pair<00:03:41.580> up<00:03:41.700> there

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
there there's another pair up there

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.300 
there there's another pair up there
which<00:03:42.360> means<00:03:42.959> it's<00:03:43.320> easier<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.800> aim<00:03:43.830> because

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
which means it's easier to aim because

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.600 
which means it's easier to aim because
it<00:03:44.430> gives<00:03:44.580> you<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:44.760> little<00:03:45.030> line<00:03:45.330> here<00:03:46.580> so<00:03:47.580> a

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
it gives you this little line here so a

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.810 
it gives you this little line here so a
good<00:03:48.120> example<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.989> rolling<00:03:49.860> back<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.340> if<00:03:50.670> I

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
good example of the rolling back is if I

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.370 
good example of the rolling back is if I
shoot<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.330> screen<00:03:51.660> one<00:03:51.840> into<00:03:52.050> this<00:03:52.140> screen

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
shoot the screen one into this screen

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.660 
shoot the screen one into this screen
but<00:03:52.590> you'll<00:03:52.800> see<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.160> blue<00:03:53.430> ones

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
but you'll see that this blue ones

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.580 
but you'll see that this blue ones
either<00:03:53.880> side<00:03:54.180> they'll<00:03:54.959> roll<00:03:55.230> together<00:03:55.350> and

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
either side they'll roll together and

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.800 
either side they'll roll together and
hit<00:03:55.680> another<00:03:55.860> converse<00:03:56.310> that's<00:03:56.549> one<00:03:56.820> two<00:03:57.180> so

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
hit another converse that's one two so

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.650 
hit another converse that's one two so
you<00:03:57.870> get<00:03:58.080> even<00:03:58.260> more<00:03:58.440> points<00:03:58.650> for<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:59.010> there

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
you get even more points for that there

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.509 
you get even more points for that there
so<00:04:00.660> as<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.840> mentioned<00:04:01.170> before<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:02.070> game<00:04:02.250> my

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
so as I mentioned before the game my

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.830 
so as I mentioned before the game my
peers<00:04:02.820> we<00:04:02.940> were<00:04:03.000> running<00:04:03.180> quite<00:04:03.450> slow<00:04:03.720> and

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
peers we were running quite slow and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.970 
peers we were running quite slow and
that's<00:04:03.900> because<00:04:04.170> I've<00:04:04.260> got<00:04:04.410> all<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.590> settings

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
that's because I've got all the settings

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.789 
that's because I've got all the settings
turned<00:04:05.310> up<00:04:05.489> so<00:04:06.239> if<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:07.230> go<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.560> menu

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
turned up so if I just go to the menu

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.940 
turned up so if I just go to the menu
here<00:04:07.830> you've<00:04:08.310> got<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.489> couple<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.820> options<00:04:09.920> so<00:04:10.920> I

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
here you've got a couple of options so I

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.800 
here you've got a couple of options so I
just<00:04:11.250> under<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:11.940> options<00:04:12.239> here<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.480> got<00:04:12.630> game

settings and sound settings and the game

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.940 
settings and sound settings and the game
you<00:04:15.090> can<00:04:15.269> see<00:04:15.840> for<00:04:16.049> example<00:04:16.109> here<00:04:16.500> I've<00:04:16.709> got

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
you can see for example here I've got

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.710 
you can see for example here I've got
the<00:04:17.100> advanced<00:04:17.489> mobile<00:04:17.790> effects<00:04:18.120> which<00:04:18.390> if<00:04:18.600> you

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
the advanced mobile effects which if you

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.050 
the advanced mobile effects which if you
notice<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.200> balls<00:04:19.440> are<00:04:19.590> rolling<00:04:19.880> that's<00:04:20.880> if

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
notice the balls are rolling that's if

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.190 
notice the balls are rolling that's if
you<00:04:21.120> got<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.359> ticked<00:04:21.630> if<00:04:21.720> you<00:04:21.810> untick<00:04:22.169> that

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
you got that ticked if you untick that

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.770 
you got that ticked if you untick that
they'll<00:04:22.560> just<00:04:22.740> see<00:04:22.830> me<00:04:22.950> moving<00:04:23.340> along<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.570> if

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
they'll just see me moving along so if

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.150 
they'll just see me moving along so if
you've<00:04:24.870> got<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:24.990> slow<00:04:25.229> device<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.770> might<00:04:26.010> be

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
you've got a slow device it might be

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.440 
you've got a slow device it might be
good<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.310> keep<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:26.580> on<00:04:26.729> take<00:04:27.120> you've<00:04:27.330> also

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
good to keep that on take you've also

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.290 
good to keep that on take you've also
got<00:04:27.720> shadows<00:04:28.590> Showtime<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:29.580> repeated<00:04:30.120> fire

got shadows Showtime and repeated fire

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.380 
got shadows Showtime and repeated fire

so miles for the Showtime on there just

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.659 
so miles for the Showtime on there just
put<00:04:33.540> it<00:04:33.630> back<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:33.990> middle<00:04:34.400> so<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.430> hear

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
put it back to the middle so you hear

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.190 
put it back to the middle so you hear
like<00:04:35.910> you'll<00:04:36.180> notice<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.780> balls<00:04:36.960> aren't

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
like you'll notice that the balls aren't

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.440 
like you'll notice that the balls aren't
rolling<00:04:37.710> really<00:04:37.890> any<00:04:38.160> more<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.360> is

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
rolling really any more but that is

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.969 
rolling really any more but that is
quite<00:04:39.660> useful<00:04:39.780> because<00:04:40.140> it<00:04:40.320> means<00:04:40.350> as<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:40.830> can

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
quite useful because it means as you can

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.409 
quite useful because it means as you can
see<00:04:41.160> here<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.460> game<00:04:41.640> is<00:04:41.820> running<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.300> bit

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
see here the game is running a bit

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.750 
see here the game is running a bit
faster<00:04:42.960> which<00:04:43.590> is<00:04:43.800> probably<00:04:44.340> a<00:04:44.430> bit<00:04:44.580> better

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
faster which is probably a bit better

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.310 
faster which is probably a bit better
fit<00:04:45.000> in<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.180> later<00:04:45.330> levels<00:04:45.570> you<00:04:45.870> can<00:04:46.140> get

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
fit in the later levels you can get

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.650 
fit in the later levels you can get
pretty<00:04:46.500> overwhelmed<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:48.000> sound<00:04:48.240> sends<00:04:48.570> as

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
pretty overwhelmed the sound sends as

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.260 
pretty overwhelmed the sound sends as
well<00:04:48.840> in<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.229> options<00:04:49.560> menu<00:04:49.770> it's<00:04:50.760> just<00:04:51.000> again

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
well in the options menu it's just again

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.920 
well in the options menu it's just again
