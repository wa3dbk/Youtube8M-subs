00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 Hello everyone, Pavel Bagryantsev and you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.109
 this video we will talk about how 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.780
 manipulate other people yes yes you 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.590
 did not misinterpret exactly how to manipulate 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.590
 by other people 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.199
 Well, let's start with the fact that surely in your 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.350
 life ever wanted to take hold 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.769
 something brain and manage to infuse those 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.480
 thoughts that you want to man 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.800
 digested before from them could not get rid 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.830
 you wanted to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.140
 by some of your pattern or by 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.989
 somehow your desire went development 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.260
 events and it is possible that this person 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.059
 thought only of you and did as you 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.940
 I want what I tell you how it is 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.510
 it's done only I'm not sure that you are mine 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.030
 answer 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.090
 like it let's break it down first 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.309
 such a concept is manipulated by others 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.430
 people for what we need it when we 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.140
 we want to somehow feel dry even somehow 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.109
 manipulate when we want to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.629
 the man did as we need him 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.280
 perceive a bit like a man on 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.920
 the other side as if on the other side 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.140
 barricades that he is not obediently some 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.340
 some kind of incomprehensible 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.150
 he doesn't want to talk to me 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.259
 so I will take and begin to quiet 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.420
 im just manipulate why are you 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.610
 treat if you want to do it 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.740
 or if you have such 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.020
 need or desire then why are you 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.340
 initially think that man is your enemy 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.640
 I now want to ask you this question 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.610
 why do you think that he does not want 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.990
 it is possible to do what you are talking about 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.950
 ask for thinking about it i realized that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.680
 we ourselves 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.079
 we look for enemies we form the picture ourselves 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.939
 that this man he does not want 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.340
 do as I need so I will 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.950
 manipulate them and I suggest you 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.259
 a small alternative at least live 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.439
 so maybe a week I'm sure the world 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.450
 around you will change how I call it 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.060
 so how can you influence others 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.659
 people is the most important rule 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.000
 regulations 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.350
 vinwin that is, won-won when 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.899
 both sides win 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.479
 initially every person he is to you 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.470
 neutral if this person is familiar with you 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.900
 then he at least 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.030
 already friendly because u 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.370
 he has a certain coefficient 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.590
 trust you therefore do not need to try 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.310
 they just like hard manipulated 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.400
 just try to do so 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.349
 some process or some kind of deal 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.540
 so that it would be beneficial to both of you 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.390
 try to think of such a situation 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.340
 so that he too won something believe 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.110
 when you open men when you 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.810
 open your heart to him when you tell him 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.569
 offer some profitable 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.880
 cooperation and show him 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.530
 benefits in this he gladly himself 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.769
 will do what you need 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.569
 he will do as you need but he happens 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.450
 nuance he can ask for something in return 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.459
 so you do it for me 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.799
 make it bad for me 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.780
 poorly developed if you need that 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.970
 do something to achieve in the end 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.400
 My goal seems to be the rule 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.130
 she won-she won the most understandable and 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.319
 true for our modernity but 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.329
 agree that you would be unpleasant 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.430
 if you have learned let's say 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.590
 manipulate people and the other person 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.549
 learned better than you that is he 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.010
 do no more unnoticed than you 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.650
 think you are manipulating them though 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.319
 In fact, you do not even suspect that 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.870
 manipulates you and most likely it is 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.700
 and happening dear friends therefore 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.709
 think about when you want 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.540
 something to do with someone with 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.959
 manipulate where did you get such thoughts 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.209
 what do you want to come to and what are yours 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.010
 this goal can someone manipulated 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.239
 you now what do you want some 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.329
 in strange ways 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.430
 achieve something but if you 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.240
 really need something try 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.610
 share 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.310
 with a man give him a piece of his 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.040
 kindness, caring souls take care of one 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.530
 ask what i would really like you for 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.200
 I did it 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.790
 can you please help me and can 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.100
 can i do something for you 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.800
 let's figure out how this could be us 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.260
 two friends are beneficial when you start 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.260
 think in another way through a prism 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.450
 won-won immediately the world is changing people 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.430
 want to cooperate with you they want 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.040
 give you more because they 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.950
 understand that they no longer receive unless 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.890
 this is bad in my opinion even an excellent model 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.930
 of this world when everyone gives each other 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.670
 a little more then it seems to me and 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.830
 life on our planet will be better 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.900
 please think about it and write 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.490
 in your comments do you agree with 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.130
 me about it and what are you talking about it 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.440
 think if you liked this advice 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.810
 like to sign up 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.790

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.000
