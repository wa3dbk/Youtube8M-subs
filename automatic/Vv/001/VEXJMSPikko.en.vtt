00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
hello and welcome to a video on the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.680 
hello and welcome to a video on the
basics<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.160> fiber<00:00:14.370> mesh<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.389> video<00:00:15.660> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
basics of fiber mesh in this video I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.330 
basics of fiber mesh in this video I
just<00:00:15.929> want<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> cover<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.560> basics<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.130> using

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
just want to cover the basics of using

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.150 
just want to cover the basics of using
fiber<00:00:17.789> mesh<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.420> also<00:00:18.960> what<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.320> can<00:00:19.529> do<00:00:19.770> with

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
fiber mesh and also what you can do with

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.390 
fiber mesh and also what you can do with
the<00:00:20.310> fibers<00:00:20.699> wants<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.090> become<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.630> sub<00:00:21.960> tool<00:00:22.400> so

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the fibers wants to become a sub tool so

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.920 
the fibers wants to become a sub tool so
let's<00:00:23.580> begin<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.000> taking<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> look<00:00:24.449> at<00:00:24.570> our<00:00:24.689> dog

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
let's begin and taking a look at our dog

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.589 
let's begin and taking a look at our dog
you<00:00:25.380> may<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.710> noticed<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> project<00:00:26.789> menu

you may have noticed in the project menu
of<00:00:27.750> our<00:00:27.840> light<00:00:28.019> box<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.439> already<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.769> two

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
of our light box we already have two

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.370 
of our light box we already have two
dogs<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.730> fibers<00:00:30.179> created<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.689> them<00:00:30.840> let's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
dogs with fibers created on them let's

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.440 
dogs with fibers created on them let's
go<00:00:31.500> ahead<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.830> redo<00:00:32.160> construct<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:33.000> with

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
go ahead and redo construct this with

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.510 
go ahead and redo construct this with
our<00:00:33.630> own<00:00:33.750> little<00:00:33.930> twist<00:00:34.280> I'm<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> open

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
our own little twist I'm going to open

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.190 
our own little twist I'm going to open
up<00:00:35.640> my<00:00:35.790> fiber<00:00:36.030> mesh<00:00:36.239> self<00:00:36.510> palette<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:36.960> click

up my fiber mesh self palette and click

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.319 
up my fiber mesh self palette and click
on<00:00:37.320> our<00:00:37.410> preview<00:00:37.800> button<00:00:38.399> you'll<00:00:38.969> notice<00:00:39.059> that

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
on our preview button you'll notice that

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.510 
on our preview button you'll notice that
ZBrush<00:00:39.629> instantly<00:00:40.079> creates<00:00:40.440> fibers<00:00:40.920> around

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
ZBrush instantly creates fibers around

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.459 
ZBrush instantly creates fibers around
the<00:00:41.640> whole<00:00:41.790> dog<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.329> actually<00:00:42.809> want<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.079> control

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the whole dog I actually want to control

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.080 
the whole dog I actually want to control
where<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> want<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.160> put<00:00:44.309> fibers<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:44.940> going

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
where I want to put fibers so I'm going

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
where I want to put fibers so I'm going
to<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.360> by<00:00:45.539> masking<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.469> I'm<00:00:46.530> going<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to do this by masking so I'm going to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.069 
to do this by masking so I'm going to
quickly<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.180> unmask<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.539> areas<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.989> our

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
quickly just unmask some areas of our

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.950 
quickly just unmask some areas of our
dog<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.820> control<00:00:51.149> where<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> want

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
dog so that I can control where I want

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.860 
dog so that I can control where I want
the<00:00:52.050> fibers<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> once<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the fibers to be and not to be so once I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.090 
the fibers to be and not to be so once I
have<00:00:55.020> something<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.410> I'm<00:00:55.500> looking<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:55.860> I'm

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
have something that I'm looking for I'm

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.869 
have something that I'm looking for I'm
gonna<00:00:56.219> go<00:00:56.309> ahead<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.550> hit<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> preview

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
gonna go ahead and hit the preview

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.910 
gonna go ahead and hit the preview
button<00:00:57.090> again<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> dog's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
button again you can see that the dog's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.010 
button again you can see that the dog's
fibers<00:00:59.640> now<00:00:59.820> are<00:01:00.059> only<00:01:00.149> being<00:01:00.480> created<00:01:00.899> where

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
fibers now are only being created where

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.930 
fibers now are only being created where
there's<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> mask<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> being<00:01:02.550> controlled

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
there's a mask this is being controlled

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.100 
there's a mask this is being controlled
by<00:01:03.030> our<00:01:03.149> by<00:01:03.629> mask

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
by our by mask

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.039 
by our by mask
slider<00:01:04.670> also<00:01:05.670> take<00:01:05.909> note<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> by<00:01:06.659> area

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
slider also take note of the by area

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.660 
slider also take note of the by area
slider<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> turn<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.369> you'll<00:01:08.580> see

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
slider when I turn this up you'll see

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.719 
slider when I turn this up you'll see
what<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.710> by<00:01:10.710> area<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> taking<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
what this will do by area is taking the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.280 
what this will do by area is taking the
underlining<00:01:12.119> geometry<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.869> taking<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.200> look

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
underlining geometry and taking a look

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
underlining geometry and taking a look
at<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> polygon<00:01:14.040> sizes<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.700> constructing

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
at the polygon sizes and constructing

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
at the polygon sizes and constructing
hair<00:01:15.810> based<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> side<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> our<00:01:17.130> polygons

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
hair based on the side of our polygons

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.550 
hair based on the side of our polygons
so<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.330> general<00:01:18.659> region<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.110> polygons

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so in this general region the polygons

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.710 
so in this general region the polygons
are<00:01:19.680> larger<00:01:20.130> which<00:01:20.549> then<00:01:20.759> creates<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.210> longer

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
are larger which then creates a longer

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.780 
are larger which then creates a longer
and<00:01:21.930> larger<00:01:22.380> fiber<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.400> region<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and larger fiber and in this region the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.940 
and larger fiber and in this region the
polygons<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.360> smaller<00:01:24.659> which<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.409> create<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
polygons are smaller which then create a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.340 
polygons are smaller which then create a
shorter<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.580> skinnier<00:01:27.000> fiber<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.990> let's<00:01:28.170> just

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
shorter and skinnier fiber so let's just

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.590 
shorter and skinnier fiber so let's just
knock<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.979> slider<00:01:29.340> down<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.000> bit<00:01:30.030> so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
knock that slider down just a bit so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.200 
knock that slider down just a bit so
that<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:31.020> less<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> bite<00:01:31.680> area<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:33.030> next

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that we have less of bite area the next

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.789 
that we have less of bite area the next
thing<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.479> might<00:01:33.600> want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> adjust<00:01:34.350> my

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
thing I might want to do is adjust my

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.679 
thing I might want to do is adjust my
length<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.270> some<00:01:36.450> quick

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
length so I'm going to do some quick

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.020 
length so I'm going to do some quick
length<00:01:37.200> adjustments<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.369> next<00:01:38.610> thing<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.850> want

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
length adjustments the next thing I want

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.450 
length adjustments the next thing I want
to<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.479> our<00:01:39.840> coverage<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:41.009> coverage<00:01:41.310> is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
to just is our coverage what coverage is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.690 
to just is our coverage what coverage is
doing<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.939> widening<00:01:42.750> our<00:01:43.020> fibers<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> don't

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
doing is widening our fibers so I don't

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.069 
doing is widening our fibers so I don't
want<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.030> them<00:01:45.119> miss<00:01:45.299> wide<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.899> we're

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
want to have them miss wide so we're

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.069 
want to have them miss wide so we're
going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> drop<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.220> bit<00:01:48.079> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
going to drop that down a little bit the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.420 
going to drop that down a little bit the
next<00:01:49.229> thing<00:01:49.409> I'll<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.770> adjust<00:01:49.890> some<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> my

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
next thing I'll do is adjust some of my

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.580 
next thing I'll do is adjust some of my
colors<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.659> I'm<00:01:51.720> going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> click<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.320> tip

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
colors so I'm going to click on my tip

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.889 
colors so I'm going to click on my tip
color<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.159> give<00:01:53.909> our<00:01:54.060> dog<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.659> bit<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
color and give our dog a little bit of a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.770 
color and give our dog a little bit of a
brown<00:01:55.170> tone<00:01:55.950> color<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.640> don't<00:01:57.360> forget<00:01:57.659> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
brown tone color to it don't forget you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.139 
brown tone color to it don't forget you
can<00:01:57.810> also<00:01:58.049> change<00:01:58.439> your<00:01:58.590> base<00:01:58.890> color<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.030> any

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
can also change your base color to any

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.660 
can also change your base color to any
color<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> wish<00:02:00.979> apply<00:02:01.979> more<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.549> your

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
color that you wish apply more of your

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.810 
color that you wish apply more of your
base<00:02:02.880> color<00:02:03.180> or<00:02:03.780> less<00:02:04.140> your<00:02:04.350> base<00:02:04.590> color

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
base color or less your base color

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.580 
base color or less your base color
the<00:02:06.330> next<00:02:06.540> thing<00:02:06.660> I<00:02:06.750> want<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.410> my

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the next thing I want to just is my

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.070 
the next thing I want to just is my
gravity<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:09.030> by<00:02:09.150> clicking<00:02:09.210> our<00:02:09.660> slide<00:02:09.900> on<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
gravity so by clicking our slide on the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.540 
gravity so by clicking our slide on the
higher<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.410> go<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.740> course<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.130> fiber<00:02:11.370> is

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
higher we go of course the fiber is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.730 
higher we go of course the fiber is
going<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.730> fall<00:02:11.940> further<00:02:12.240> down<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:13.230> direction

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
going to fall further down the direction

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.460 
going to fall further down the direction
now<00:02:14.190> gravity<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.700> controlled<00:02:15.150> by<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.960> camera

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
now gravity is controlled by the camera

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.400 
now gravity is controlled by the camera
angled<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.640> object<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.600> for<00:02:18.810> example<00:02:19.170> I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
angled to the object so for example I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.490 
angled to the object so for example I
was<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.950> switch<00:02:20.160> my<00:02:20.370> dog<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.840> be<00:02:21.990> facing<00:02:22.230> this

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
was to switch my dog to be facing this

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500 
was to switch my dog to be facing this
way<00:02:22.740> towards<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.610> downward<00:02:24.000> slope<00:02:24.210> of<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
way towards the downward slope of the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.710 
way towards the downward slope of the
camera<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.110> upgrade<00:02:26.010> my<00:02:26.760> gravity<00:02:27.240> you'll

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
camera and upgrade my gravity you'll

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.660 
camera and upgrade my gravity you'll
notice<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.200> when<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.380> turn<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.800> side<00:02:29.040> all

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
notice that when I turn to the side all

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.490 
notice that when I turn to the side all
the<00:02:30.000> fibers<00:02:30.390> are<00:02:30.600> facing<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.350> direction

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the fibers are facing that direction

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.070 
the fibers are facing that direction
which<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.520> front<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> dog<00:02:33.360> so

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
which is the front of the dog so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.600 
which is the front of the dog so
obviously<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.500> would<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.040> my<00:02:35.190> fibers

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
obviously I would like to have my fibers

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.200 
obviously I would like to have my fibers
facing<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.840> direction<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.700> next<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.150> to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
facing this direction the next I want to

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.630 
facing this direction the next I want to
take<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> look<00:02:39.630> at<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.020> do<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.680> want<00:02:40.770> any<00:02:41.160> profiles

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
take a look at is do I want any profiles

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.840 
take a look at is do I want any profiles
so<00:02:42.630> we<00:02:42.780> turn<00:02:42.960> this<00:02:43.140> slider<00:02:43.440> up<00:02:43.730> ZBrush<00:02:44.730> is

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
so we turn this slider up ZBrush is

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.950 
so we turn this slider up ZBrush is
automatically<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.630> give<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.900> a

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
automatically going to give you a

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.950 
automatically going to give you a
warning<00:02:46.790> what's<00:02:47.790> happening<00:02:48.240> is<00:02:48.390> our<00:02:48.510> fibers

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
warning what's happening is our fibers

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.220 
warning what's happening is our fibers
now<00:02:49.140> instead<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.070> being<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.550> one<00:02:51.210> face<00:02:51.570> they

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
now instead of being just one face they

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.720 
now instead of being just one face they
actually<00:02:52.410> have<00:02:52.680> four<00:02:53.070> because<00:02:53.310> I've<00:02:53.430> set<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
actually have four because I've set the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.120 
actually have four because I've set the
slider<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.150> four<00:02:54.390> take<00:02:55.260> note<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.740> once<00:02:55.980> you

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
slider to four take note that once you

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.250 
slider to four take note that once you
turn<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.610> higher<00:02:56.910> than<00:02:57.150> one<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.900> can<00:02:58.080> no

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
turn this to higher than one you can no

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.380 
turn this to higher than one you can no
longer<00:02:58.530> use<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.040> sides<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.580> radius<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
longer use the sides and radius in the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.530 
longer use the sides and radius in the
render<00:03:00.750> part<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.200> fibers<00:03:01.800> so<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.850> like<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.390> keep

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
render part of fibers so I like to keep

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.720 
render part of fibers so I like to keep
this<00:03:03.750> at<00:03:03.959> one<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.280> option<00:03:05.670> to

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
this at one so that I have the option to

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.060 
this at one so that I have the option to
use<00:03:05.940> my<00:03:06.120> sides<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.750> radius<00:03:07.110> when<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:07.830> go<00:03:08.010> to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
use my sides and radius when I go to

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.010 
use my sides and radius when I go to
render<00:03:08.340> my<00:03:08.520> fibers<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.510> next<00:03:09.750> thing<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.930> might

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
render my fibers the next thing I might

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.140 
render my fibers the next thing I might
want<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.230> take<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.440> look<00:03:10.650> at<00:03:10.830> are<00:03:11.040> my<00:03:11.580> segments

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
want to take a look at are my segments

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.360 
want to take a look at are my segments
so<00:03:12.870> when<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.050> turn<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.620> something<00:03:13.920> like<00:03:14.040> 6

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
so when I turn this to something like 6

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.760 
so when I turn this to something like 6
we're<00:03:15.120> adding<00:03:15.540> more<00:03:15.570> segments<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.440> our<00:03:16.560> dog

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
we're adding more segments to our dog

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.410 
we're adding more segments to our dog
which<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.190> also<00:03:17.400> going<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.640> help<00:03:17.790> us<00:03:18.030> create<00:03:18.300> a

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
which is also going to help us create a

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.960 
which is also going to help us create a
little<00:03:18.540> bit<00:03:18.690> different<00:03:19.110> length<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.890> flow<00:03:20.610> to

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
little bit different length and flow to

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.420 
little bit different length and flow to
our<00:03:21.000> fibers<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.320> like<00:03:22.560> what<00:03:22.709> we<00:03:22.830> have<00:03:22.980> here

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
our fibers so I like what we have here
