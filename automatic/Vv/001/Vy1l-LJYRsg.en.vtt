straight line and it knows how to do

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979 
straight line and it knows how to do
that<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.239> Milky<00:00:57.660> Way<00:00:57.809> at

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
crap away from other dung beetles so

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
crap away from other dung beetles so
they're<00:01:07.710> not<00:01:07.799> competing<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.520> also<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> get

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
they're not competing and also to get

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.719 
they're not competing and also to get
down<00:01:09.390> underground<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.409> they<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.770> consume<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
down underground so they can consume it

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.310 
down underground so they can consume it
I<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.090> you're<00:01:12.299> thinking<00:01:12.510> trace<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.140> about

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
I know you're thinking trace what about

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200 
I know you're thinking trace what about
during<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> day<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> how<00:01:14.939> would<00:01:15.000> they

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
during the day what it how would they

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.880 
during the day what it how would they
see<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.509> Milky<00:01:15.780> Way<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.080> daytime<00:01:16.530> dung

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
see the Milky Way it's daytime dung

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.039 
see the Milky Way it's daytime dung
beetles<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.310> also<00:01:17.549> use<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> Sun<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.810> Moon

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
beetles can also use the Sun the Moon

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
trying to figure out how a dung beetle

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520 
trying to figure out how a dung beetle
knows<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> travel<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.780> straight<00:01:27.840> line<00:01:28.259> when

knows to travel in a straight line when
there's<00:01:28.710> no<00:01:28.920> moon<00:01:29.220> at<00:01:29.579> night<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.360> find<00:01:30.780> out

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
there's no moon at night so to find out

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
there's no moon at night so to find out
they<00:01:31.259> took<00:01:31.590> dung<00:01:31.920> beetles<00:01:32.340> into<00:01:32.759> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
they took dung beetles into a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.789 
they took dung beetles into a
planetarium<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.110> could<00:01:34.259> control<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
planetarium so they could control the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.560 
planetarium so they could control the
star<00:01:35.100> field<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> mean<00:01:36.119> where<00:01:36.270> else<00:01:36.299> would

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
star field but I mean where else would

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.390 
star field but I mean where else would
you<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.810> by<00:01:37.200> moving<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.680> Stars<00:01:37.920> around<00:01:38.250> in

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you go by moving the Stars around in

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.039 
you go by moving the Stars around in
this<00:01:38.490> planetarium<00:01:39.210> scientists<00:01:39.689> were<00:01:39.750> able<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
this planetarium scientists were able to

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
this planetarium scientists were able to
determine<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.189> dung<00:01:41.430> beetles<00:01:41.820> were

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
determine that the dung beetles were

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.450 
determine that the dung beetles were
using<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> band<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.020> our<00:01:43.170> galaxy<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.950> roll

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
using the band of our galaxy to roll

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.969 
using the band of our galaxy to roll
balls<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.060> poop<00:01:45.299> around<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.810> desert<00:01:46.020> that's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
balls of poop around the desert that's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.160 
balls of poop around the desert that's
cool<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.240> use<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.659> Milky<00:01:49.020> Way

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
cool they think they use the Milky Way

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
cool they think they use the Milky Way
because<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.799> compound<00:01:50.340> eyes<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
because they have compound eyes and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.609 
because they have compound eyes and
compound<00:01:51.450> eyes<00:01:51.570> make<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.960> little<00:01:52.110> difficult

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
compound eyes make it a little difficult

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.230 
compound eyes make it a little difficult
to<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.070> pinpricks<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.700> light<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.060> make

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
to see the pinpricks of light that make

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.469 
to see the pinpricks of light that make
up<00:01:54.360> stars<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> big<00:01:55.649> band<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.159> galaxies<00:01:56.759> no

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
up stars but a big band of galaxies no

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.039 
up stars but a big band of galaxies no
problem<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.409> we<00:01:58.469> learn<00:01:58.590> from<00:01:58.829> this

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
problem so what can we learn from this

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.870 
problem so what can we learn from this
we're<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.170> sure<00:02:01.439> though<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.219> do<00:02:02.340> often<00:02:02.549> think

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
we're not sure though we do often think

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.940 
we're not sure though we do often think
of<00:02:02.939> ourselves<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.570> smartest<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.380> bestest

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
of ourselves as the smartest the bestest

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.889 
of ourselves as the smartest the bestest

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.900 
in the most evolved dist of all of the
creatures<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.009> navigate<00:02:08.160> by<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.580> Milky

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
creatures can you navigate by the Milky

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.570 
creatures can you navigate by the Milky
Way<00:02:09.110> hmm<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.649> matter<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.099> balance

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
Way hmm for that matter can you balance

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.660 
Way hmm for that matter can you balance
on<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.730> giant<00:02:11.970> ball

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
on a giant ball

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.730 
on a giant ball
no<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.940> would<00:02:15.240> hurt<00:02:15.360> myself<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:16.290> wrap<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.590> all<00:02:16.680> up

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
no I would hurt myself to wrap it all up

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.380 
no I would hurt myself to wrap it all up
these<00:02:17.010> little<00:02:17.160> guys<00:02:17.400> are<00:02:17.640> pretty<00:02:17.819> smart<00:02:18.120> not

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
these little guys are pretty smart not

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.480 
these little guys are pretty smart not
only<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.840> they<00:02:18.959> balance<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.709> ball<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:20.190> poop

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
only can they balance on a ball of poop

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.580 
only can they balance on a ball of poop
which<00:02:21.030> they<00:02:21.240> use<00:02:21.480> by<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.750> way<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.959> keep<00:02:22.260> cool

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
which they use by the way to keep cool

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.550 
which they use by the way to keep cool
off<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.190> desert<00:02:23.520> sand<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.270> eat<00:02:24.630> they<00:02:25.410> can

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
off the desert sand and eat they can
