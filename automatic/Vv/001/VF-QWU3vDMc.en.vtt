00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
the Nintendo 3ds so to start with this

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.280 
the Nintendo 3ds so to start with this
game<00:00:35.260> because<00:00:35.470> I<00:00:35.530> thought<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:36.070> lot<00:00:36.640> of<00:00:36.700> people

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
game because I thought a lot of people

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.560 
game because I thought a lot of people
may<00:00:38.290> be<00:00:38.320> curious<00:00:38.860> about<00:00:39.130> it<00:00:39.340> but<00:00:39.550> probably<00:00:40.360> not

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
may be curious about it but probably not

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.510 
may be curious about it but probably not
that<00:00:40.720> many<00:00:40.930> people<00:00:41.110> are<00:00:41.320> going<00:00:41.410> to<00:00:41.470> buy<00:00:41.680> it<00:00:41.739> so

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
that many people are going to buy it so

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.700 
that many people are going to buy it so
I<00:00:42.550> thought<00:00:42.790> it'd<00:00:42.910> be<00:00:42.940> good<00:00:43.149> to<00:00:43.360> just<00:00:43.870> do<00:00:44.620> an

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
I thought it'd be good to just do an

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.580 
I thought it'd be good to just do an
unboxing<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.810> show<00:00:46.810> you<00:00:46.870> some<00:00:47.110> gameplay<00:00:47.290> in

kind of have a bit of a read up on that

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.760 
kind of have a bit of a read up on that
thing<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.720> then<00:02:50.930> you've<00:02:51.050> got<00:02:51.200> some<00:02:51.230> Amiga

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
thing and then you've got some Amiga

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.850

builds<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.810> much<00:02:53.810> more<00:02:54.050> stronger<00:02:54.380> than

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
builds a much more stronger than

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.020 
builds a much more stronger than
powerful<00:02:55.540> than<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.750> basic<00:02:57.170> builds<00:02:58.030> however

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
powerful than the basic builds however

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.120 
powerful than the basic builds however
they<00:02:59.150> drain<00:02:59.450> more<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.840> energy<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:01.209> so<00:03:02.209> on<00:03:02.450> so

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130
