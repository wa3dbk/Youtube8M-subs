couldn't<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.320> my<00:02:04.350> bunny<00:02:05.159> here<00:02:05.520> at<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> top<00:02:05.970> to

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
couldn't get my bunny here at the top to

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.900 
couldn't get my bunny here at the top to
come<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.080> higher<00:02:07.440> because<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.459> supposed<00:02:08.789> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
come up higher because I was supposed to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.420 
come up higher because I was supposed to
take<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.420> part<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.410> kind<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.039> attach

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
take this part here and kind of attach

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.760 
take this part here and kind of attach
it<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.850> bun<00:02:12.300> up<00:02:12.480> there<00:02:12.720> hers<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.470> sitting

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it to that bun up there hers is sitting

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470 
it to that bun up there hers is sitting
a<00:02:13.860> little<00:02:14.010> higher<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.819> still<00:02:15.180> have<00:02:15.239> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
a little higher so I still have to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.290 
a little higher so I still have to
practice<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:16.340> getting<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.790> come<00:02:18.030> all<00:02:18.239> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
practice on getting it to come all the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.960 
practice on getting it to come all the
way<00:02:18.630> up<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.709> didn't<00:02:20.069> have<00:02:20.160> enough<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.670> hair

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
way up and I didn't have enough on hair

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.040 
way up and I didn't have enough on hair
pins<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:22.590> was<00:02:22.800> my<00:02:23.069> attempt<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:24.050> without

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
pins so this was my attempt I without

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.910 
pins so this was my attempt I without
having<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.800> necessary<00:02:27.470> number<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.709> hair

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
having the necessary number of hair

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.009 
having the necessary number of hair
clips<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.880> could<00:02:30.030> feel<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.360> some<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.900> them

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
clips and I could feel the some of them

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.830 
clips and I could feel the some of them
are<00:02:31.140> coming<00:02:31.440> out<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> back<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.670> did<00:02:33.600> my

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.630 
are coming out in the back so I did my
best<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.709> definitely<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.190> think<00:02:35.220> looks

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.890 
best and it definitely I think looks
