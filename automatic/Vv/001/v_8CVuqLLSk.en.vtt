if you look at the world's most exciting
performance<00:00:01.890> cars<00:00:02.100> you'll<00:00:02.310> find<00:00:02.550> that<00:00:02.639> the

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
performance cars you'll find that the

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.999 
performance cars you'll find that the
majority<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:03.300> them<00:00:03.449> offer<00:00:03.720> two<00:00:04.080> doors<00:00:04.380> in<00:00:04.680> two

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
feet most of the time that's just fine

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.780 
feet most of the time that's just fine
but<00:00:07.830> every<00:00:08.010> now<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.280> again<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.610> might<00:00:08.730> want

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
but every now and again you might want

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.220 
but every now and again you might want
to<00:00:08.970> take<00:00:09.120> some<00:00:09.360> friends<00:00:09.660> along<00:00:09.750> for<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.080> ride

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
that case is certainly far more

Lamborghini of course but it gives it
more<00:01:14.460> clearance<00:01:14.939> over<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> curb<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.720> also

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
enemies and then there's the rear hats

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.740 
enemies and then there's the rear hats
which<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.729> bit<00:01:20.850> difficult<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.420> open

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
which is a little bit difficult to open

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.210

here but when you get it open you get a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.060 
here but when you get it open you get a
fairly<00:01:23.960> sizable<00:01:24.960> interior<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.770> fold<00:01:26.009> down

fairly sizable interior and fold down
the<00:01:26.189> rear<00:01:26.340> seats<00:01:26.490> which<00:01:26.939> gives<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> even<00:01:27.390> more

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the rear seats which gives you even more

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
the rear seats which gives you even more
storage<00:01:27.930> space<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> nice<00:01:28.470> flat<00:01:28.770> area<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.670> quite

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
storage space a nice flat area not quite

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.520 
storage space a nice flat area not quite
big<00:01:30.210> enough<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.689> sheet<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.960> drywall<00:01:31.140> maybe

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
big enough for a sheet of drywall maybe

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.630 
big enough for a sheet of drywall maybe
but<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> couple<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.130> sets<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.400> golf<00:01:32.520> clubs

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
but a couple of sets of golf clubs

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640 
but a couple of sets of golf clubs
should<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.060> no<00:01:33.180> problem<00:01:33.570> at<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.560> of

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
should be no problem at all but of

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.899 
should be no problem at all but of
course<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.100> rear<00:01:35.310> doors<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.729> really

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
course it's the rear doors that really

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.789 
course it's the rear doors that really
set<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.210> car<00:01:36.479> apart<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.380> rear<00:01:37.530> seats

here<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:07.880> turn<00:03:08.150> on<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.450> navigation

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
here you can turn on the navigation

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.680 
here you can turn on the navigation

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
system by hitting the nav button you

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.820 
system by hitting the nav button you
might<00:03:11.810> think<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.110> you<00:03:12.260> control<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.680> nav

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
might think that you control the nav

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.410 
might think that you control the nav
system<00:03:13.130> by<00:03:13.250> using<00:03:13.490> this<00:03:13.580> nice<00:03:13.820> big<00:03:14.000> dial<00:03:14.270> that

falls right to hand between the seats

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.620 
falls right to hand between the seats
but<00:03:16.430> no<00:03:16.550> actually<00:03:16.880> that's<00:03:16.970> just<00:03:17.240> for<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.420> seat

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
but no actually that's just for the seat

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.479 
but no actually that's just for the seat
here<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:18.050> control<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.620> navigation<00:03:18.830> yet<00:03:19.400> to

reach up to this smaller dial on the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.470 
reach up to this smaller dial on the

the<00:03:25.730> street<00:03:26.060> name<00:03:26.270> and<00:03:26.570> I'll<00:03:26.840> do<00:03:27.020> a<00:03:27.050> character

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
the street name and I'll do a character

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.199 
the street name and I'll do a character
by<00:03:27.739> character<00:03:27.790> letter-by-letter

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
by character letter-by-letter

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.630 
by character letter-by-letter
there's<00:03:29.690> no<00:03:29.870> voice<00:03:30.050> recognition<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:31.100> takes<00:03:31.370> an

there's no voice recognition it takes an

absolute age to enter in anything here

so<00:03:33.980> hopefully<00:03:34.130> you're<00:03:34.850> only<00:03:35.000> going<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.360> a<00:03:35.450> few

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
so hopefully you're only going to a few

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.479 
so hopefully you're only going to a few
places<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.230> can<00:03:36.380> add<00:03:36.560> as<00:03:36.800> favorites<00:03:37.310> and

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
places that you can add as favorites and

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.160 
places that you can add as favorites and
then<00:03:37.880> in<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.180> gauge<00:03:38.360> cluster<00:03:38.780> there<00:03:38.930> are<00:03:39.020> two

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
then in the gauge cluster there are two

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.720 
then in the gauge cluster there are two
more<00:03:39.380> small<00:03:39.530> displays<00:03:40.100> on<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.370> Left<00:03:40.550> you've

so<00:04:02.570> what<00:04:02.720> does<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.050> repeat<00:04:03.380> s<00:04:03.650> offer<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.340> the

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
so what does the repeat s offer that the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.800 
so what does the repeat s offer that the
original<00:04:04.820> repeat<00:04:05.090> from<00:04:05.240> a<00:04:05.360> couple<00:04:05.540> of<00:04:05.660> years

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
original repeat from a couple of years

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.690 
original repeat from a couple of years
ago<00:04:05.960> did<00:04:06.230> not<00:04:06.260> what<00:04:06.860> we've<00:04:06.980> stepped<00:04:07.220> up<00:04:07.400> about

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
ago did not what we've stepped up about

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.760

80<00:04:07.940> horsepower<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.780> time<00:04:09.050> we're<00:04:09.230> up<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.560> five

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.100 
got more of a top-end

sounds<00:04:36.860> pretty<00:04:36.980> nice<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:37.520> we're<00:04:37.820> not<00:04:37.880> going<00:04:38.030> to

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
sounds pretty nice so we're not going to

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.880 
sounds pretty nice so we're not going to
complain<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.810> other<00:04:38.930> nice<00:04:39.140> improvement<00:04:39.680> is<00:04:39.860> a
