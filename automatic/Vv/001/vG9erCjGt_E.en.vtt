00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.340
Oh my God, what a beauty have come here... hello

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.340
Hello

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.880
So... who have come here? What's your name?

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.000
Diana, I'm 6 years old

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.360
Diana, you have such a beautiful dress and such a beautiful name, where have you come from?

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.540
From Dnepropetrovsk

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.090
Wonderfull

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.330
Please, tell something about you. What do you want to be when you grow up?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.240
An archaelogist

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.360
Whom?

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.790
I like to learn about dinosaurus very much, espesially their sceletons

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.860
Cool

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.660
Please tell me... I have written here, that you like pink colour, boys and money. It's true?

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.880
It's clear with pink, okay, what about boys? Do you have a beloved boy?

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.280
A lot of them

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.640
In garden and in yard!

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.180
Both in garden and in yard? wow...

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.540
And it's some boy from another group (in kindergarten, i think)

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.790
From another group? Tell me between us, girls, you are looking after him or he is looking after you?

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.490
Both of us

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.050
Both of you...

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.090
He has a friend who prevents me to be with him everytime

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.680
Why are you so awry looking at Vlad? You want to include him to their 'heap'?

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.650
I see you want to insert him to this 'heap'

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.540
Which boys do you like?

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.030
All

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.070
That's it, Vlad...

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.410
What about boys like Ihor and Vlad?

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.610
What can i do with them? (sarcastic)

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.530
Really

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.410
We are too big for this 'heap'

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.880
No, no, no... it is not a big heap, just... i love them all together

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.070
The last thing to find out is... what a poem do you want to read for us?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.400
It's named "Our grandma goes"

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.640
Come on

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.300
Our grandma goes and her stick knocks

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.270
I'm telling to my gradma "Call a doctor!

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.150
You will take a medicine and become healthy

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.700
If it will be some bitter... it doesn't matter

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.200
You will endure a bit and when the doctor come out

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.220
We will go outside and play a ball

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.080
We will run my grandma, and jump very high

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.830
What's a problem with it? It's very easy!"

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.650
It's not over! not over, not over!

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.670
Continue, continue

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.120
I have to concentrate a bit

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.250
Grandma answers me "what about doctors?

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.970
I didn't fall ill, i'm just old

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.590
I'm just very old and my hair is gray

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.110
Somewhere i have lost my golden young years...

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.020
Somewhere behind far dark forest,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.910
behind high mountain, behind deep water...

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.890
How to get there? It's unknown for people..."

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.460
I tell to my grandma "recall this place!

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.620
I will go there, i will swim and walk

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.970
I will find your young years!"

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.680
What a wonderfull girl is on stage now... Unbelievable, i have not words...

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.210
You are not just talanted girl, you are unique girl, and it's a pleasure for me, that you came here and read this poem so nice

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.850
I was teached to such learning, because it's a poem...

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.730
Super, bravo, i have not words... Vlad, what will you say?

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.090
Diana, i think that you have not a talent

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.690
You have a GREAT talent

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.110

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.500

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.010

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.540
