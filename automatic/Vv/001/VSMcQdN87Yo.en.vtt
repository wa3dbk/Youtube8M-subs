it<00:02:21.049> looks<00:02:21.290> like<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.829> DVI<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.940> HDMI<00:02:23.680> adapter<00:02:25.450> you

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
it looks like a DVI to HDMI adapter you

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.580 
it looks like a DVI to HDMI adapter you
have<00:02:26.480> your<00:02:27.320> crossfire<00:02:29.200> right<00:02:30.200> there<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:33.320> have

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
have your crossfire right there you have

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.780 
have your crossfire right there you have
a<00:02:33.890> power<00:02:34.370> cable<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.420> an<00:02:35.660> 8<00:02:35.900> pin<00:02:36.170> 2<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.340> 2

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
a power cable so this is an 8 pin 2 to 2

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
a power cable so this is an 8 pin 2 to 2
dual<00:02:38.060> 6<00:02:38.390> pin<00:02:38.660> PCI<00:02:38.690> Express<00:02:39.530> power<00:02:39.829> connector

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
dual 6 pin PCI Express power connector

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.650 
dual 6 pin PCI Express power connector
and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.550 
and
it<00:02:44.019> looks<00:02:44.379> like<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:45.840> another<00:02:46.840> heat<00:02:47.110> sink<00:02:47.379> here

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
it looks like a another heat sink here

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.339 
it looks like a another heat sink here
designed<00:02:47.920> for<00:02:48.129> most<00:02:48.459> cooling<00:02:48.940> door<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.750> L<00:02:49.989> and

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
designed for most cooling door and L and

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.470 
designed for most cooling door and L and
two<00:02:50.830> overclocking<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.120> heat<00:02:52.269> sink

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
two overclocking so this is a heat sink

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.839 
two overclocking so this is a heat sink
that<00:02:52.569> you<00:02:52.629> can<00:02:53.019> use<00:02:53.260> for<00:02:53.950> overclocking<00:02:54.400> um

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
that you can use for overclocking um

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.160 
that you can use for overclocking um
again<00:02:55.209> we're<00:02:55.360> going<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.540> get<00:02:55.599> into<00:02:55.780> all<00:02:56.140> that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
again we're going to get into all that

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.740 
again we're going to get into all that
in<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.739> actual<00:02:57.310> review<00:02:58.500> now<00:02:59.500> Asus<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.489> HD<00:03:01.030> 7970

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
in the actual review now Asus is HD 7970

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.610 
in the actual review now Asus is HD 7970
direct<00:03:02.739> see<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.400> carve<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:04.030> big<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:05.500> guys

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.650 
can see here it is a very very big card
isn't<00:03:08.769> actually<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.489> three<00:03:09.910> slot<00:03:10.209> card<00:03:10.510> we're

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
isn't actually a three slot card we're

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.470 
isn't actually a three slot card we're
going<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.900> get<00:03:11.019> into<00:03:11.319> but<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.580> course<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:13.360> know

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
going to get into but of course you know

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.110 
going to get into but of course you know
issues<00:03:13.989> whether<00:03:14.500> they<00:03:14.739> have<00:03:15.040> an<00:03:15.280> nvidia<00:03:15.849> card

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
issues whether they have an nvidia card

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.319 
issues whether they have an nvidia card
or<00:03:16.390> an<00:03:16.900> AMD<00:03:17.829> card<00:03:18.250> they<00:03:18.549> use<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.880> same<00:03:19.030> color

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
or an AMD card they use the same color

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.000 
or an AMD card they use the same color

cooling<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:21.940> you're<00:03:22.540> gonna<00:03:22.630> have<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:22.930> black

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
cooling so you're gonna have a black

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.979 
cooling so you're gonna have a black
shroud<00:03:23.650> with<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.610> red<00:03:24.880> accents<00:03:25.540> right<00:03:25.750> there

on<00:03:26.200> again<00:03:27.040> andy<00:03:27.579> or<00:03:27.819> nvidia<00:03:28.440> there<00:03:29.440> are<00:03:29.560> two

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
on again andy or nvidia there are two

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.650 
on again andy or nvidia there are two
very<00:03:30.129> large<00:03:30.310> cooling<00:03:30.730> fans<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.180> then<00:03:31.540> you

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
very large cooling fans and then you

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.970 
very large cooling fans and then you
actually<00:03:31.900> have<00:03:32.140> i'm<00:03:32.410> not<00:03:32.560> sure<00:03:32.680> if<00:03:32.739> you<00:03:32.829> can

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
actually have i'm not sure if you can

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.259 
actually have i'm not sure if you can
see<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.280> cuz<00:03:33.400> i<00:03:33.459> don't<00:03:33.610> even<00:03:33.670> look<00:03:33.849> at<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.060> card

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
see it cuz i don't even look at the card

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.559 
see it cuz i don't even look at the card
yet<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:35.170> can't<00:03:35.440> really<00:03:35.680> see<00:03:36.040> but<00:03:36.280> um<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:37.450> know

if I can get in there so you guys can

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.100 
if I can get in there so you guys can
kind<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:38.980> see<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.340> inside<00:03:40.090> there<00:03:40.390> are<00:03:40.450> very

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
kind of see that inside there are very

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.140 
kind of see that inside there are very
very<00:03:41.410> large<00:03:41.620> heat<00:03:41.890> pipes<00:03:42.129> that<00:03:42.579> actually<00:03:43.000> make

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
very large heat pipes that actually make

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.869 
very large heat pipes that actually make
direct<00:03:43.540> contact<00:03:43.750> with<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.739> GPU<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.519> of

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
direct contact with the GPU and of

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.240 
direct contact with the GPU and of
course<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.690> very<00:03:47.049> large<00:03:47.319> heat<00:03:47.560> sinks<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.100> help

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
course to very large heat sinks to help

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.240 
course to very large heat sinks to help
dissipate<00:03:48.579> all<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.359> heat<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:50.739> guys<00:03:51.040> can

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
dissipate all of that heat you guys can

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.740 
dissipate all of that heat you guys can
kinda<00:03:51.549> see<00:03:51.730> it's<00:03:52.150> kind<00:03:52.329> of<00:03:52.359> hard<00:03:52.420> cuz<00:03:52.660> they

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
kinda see it's kind of hard cuz they

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.479 
kinda see it's kind of hard cuz they
have<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:53.019> very<00:03:53.139> large<00:03:53.500> trout<00:03:53.859> on<00:03:54.100> here<00:03:54.280> so

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
have this very large trout on here so

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.370 
have this very large trout on here so
you<00:03:54.519> can't<00:03:54.850> really<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.959> know<00:03:56.079> get<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.319> good

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
you can't really you know get a good

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.740 
you can't really you know get a good
look<00:03:56.829> at<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.069> coin<00:03:57.310> but<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.450> direct

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
look at the coin but that is the direct

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.680 
look at the coin but that is the direct
see<00:03:59.170> you<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.560> cooling<00:04:00.069> now<00:04:00.459> on<00:04:00.880> this<00:04:01.299> side<00:04:01.480> you

can see that they have covered the
entire<00:04:03.989> card<00:04:04.989> in<00:04:05.349> this<00:04:06.099> kind<00:04:06.940> of<00:04:06.970> shroud<00:04:07.299> it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
entire card in this kind of shroud it

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.970 
entire card in this kind of shroud it
kind<00:04:07.599> of<00:04:07.660> covers<00:04:07.810> everything<00:04:08.440> up<00:04:08.560> makes<00:04:08.920> it

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
look very very cool as well flip it over

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.430 
look very very cool as well flip it over
here<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.190> opposite<00:04:12.790> side<00:04:13.019> same<00:04:14.019> thing<00:04:14.079> and

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
here to the opposite side same thing and

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.680
