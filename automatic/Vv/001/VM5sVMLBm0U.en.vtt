00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.380
 and we also saw the participation of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.960
 women and talked a while of 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.410
 this increase that has had substantial 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.599
 generally if part approximately 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.400
 2 000 600 women have already 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.810
 participating in various fields they are going 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.579
 to be seen on the continent of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.409
 special forces paratroopers 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.509
 troops of the administrations of the field 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:29.189
 doctor but also highlights the fact 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.319
 that are currently already in the arms of 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.420
 artillery sappers at school 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:35.370
 military and in addition to intervention and we 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.890
 it speaks that the navy has also been 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.020
 this increase in the participation of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 women's presence in the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.310
 marine effectively in recent years 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.740
 has greatly increased the 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.260
 participation of women reaching 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.810
 such degree that we currently have 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.770
 women embarked something that 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.480
 previously at least in our country 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.230
 it looked more like this we've seen it 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.230
 was accentuated and the increase of the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.910
 woman on board the units also the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.700
 air force we have even the increase 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.979
 of the participation of women from 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.200
 such way that in 2007 the 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.119
 entry of female staff into the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.920
 aviation military school in the year 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.990
 2010 the first woman graduated 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.180
 pilot military aviator of our 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.580
 Armed Forces excellent news 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.590
 being so it is so continued to put 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.800
 precisely because the brands are 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.930
 for landing or getting there the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.500
 paratroopers who got laid 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.880
 fanned a few minutes ago if this 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.100
 action they just finished they just watched 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.300
 what's going on in the socket of the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.310
 Mexico City is the action that 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.530
 takes place at the start or before the jump 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.710
 so that the paratroopers have a 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.340
 reference and they can reach their point 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.170
 objective with all the opportunity and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.420
 effectiveness that characterize them 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.630
 it will be necessary to mention that in the century 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.240
 19 there were also some acts 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.220
 there was no air planes could not be 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.170
 throw in a parachute but in several 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.590
 ceremonies rose balloons 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.720
 aerostatic with illumination that in the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.709
 night they stretched in the sky we can 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.800
 speak that the first time was in 1832 and 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.230
 this continued until 1872 we still have 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.410
 references what is a fact is that it has 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.450
 there has been a notable advance in what is the 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.150
 self development of our forces 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.340
 armed 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.599
 That's the way it is for you, however, 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.030
 weather conditions that are 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.500
 giving priority at this time training 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.090
 and the training of this staff of 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.860
 Parachutists sometimes allows them 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.530
 also reach the most areas 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.439
 inaccessible even from the plan of plan 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.760
 n 3 we are effectively seeing the high 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.370
 degree of training that they have 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.609
 developed these jumping equipment of 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.439
 precision that from 16,000 feet fall and 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.569
 the smoke that we are seeing is the one that 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.180
 indicates on the ground the direction of the wind 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.150
 for those during the fall they can 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.920
 orient your parachute by maneuvering it 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.349
 to be able to fall at the exact point where 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.200
 they want to do it without a doubt 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.440
 great training great training that 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.409
 means for the different units of 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.450
 the armed forces of the navy also 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.540
 this is gustavo I would like precisely 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.189
 mention emphasize what they are 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.019
 some of the missions that can be 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.790
 perform precisely through these 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.650
 means and we can talk about the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.959
 terrestrial interception of aircraft 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.489
 illicit rescue operations in 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.590
 areas of difficult access via 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.540
 terrestrial providing security 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.819
 by some 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.069
 intervention force ensure one or 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.019
 several critical points operations 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.540
 campaign participate search and rescue in 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.760
 end is very varied the activities that 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.010
 can be specified through this 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.439
 very colorful type of operation this 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.650
 military show of the body of 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:55.200
 parachute without a doubt if we talked 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.930
 at the beginning of the huge commitment that 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.569
 they have the armed forces for the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.030
 security mainly from the town of 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.099
 Mexico with all these activities that 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.290
 perform good we do not see more than 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.989
 demonstrated the Mexican army is a 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.139
 popular army that comes from the town and 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.410
 that is due to the people without doubt if 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.849
 course the Mexican armed forces 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.340
 We anchored the people and the people will 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.830
 we serve and I would like at this time 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.349
 also tell you that within the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.240
 units of riflemen parachutists of 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:29.910
 the army of mexico we have 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.220
 female staff who also receive the 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.990
 same training as a man and he 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.229
 they develop in their activities 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.880
 operational as efficiently or more as 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.860
 they like that 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.290
 we like to hear that there is that 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.810
 participation of women within 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.970
 the navy and the army and that also 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.850
 they have important roles that 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.900
 play gender equity in all 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.900

 administrative and logistical operative 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.310
 as we can observe or we will be able to 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.260
 observe later on there are indeed 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.420
 women already doing important courses 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.340
 of special forces of bodies

 specials like the paratroopers and 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.230
 special forces we will be able to 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.400
 Enjoy in a parade in a few moments 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.870
 talking about equal opportunity 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.820
 for women currently in the

 paratroopers who arrived precisely 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.200
 where the brands were
