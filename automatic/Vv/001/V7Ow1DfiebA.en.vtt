here<00:00:45.719> at<00:00:45.809> Ford<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.829> advantage<00:00:47.249> of<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.519> is

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
here at Ford the advantage of it is

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.430 
here at Ford the advantage of it is
because<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.359> vehicle<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:49.079> actually

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
because the vehicle is not actually

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.739 
because the vehicle is not actually
captured<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.249> a<00:00:50.280> conveyor<00:00:50.729> like<00:00:50.999> you<00:00:51.149> would<00:00:51.359> in

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
captured on a conveyor like you would in

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:53.419 
captured on a conveyor like you would in

pivot on those pins thereby taking a

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.829

much steeper angle down into the tanks

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.739 
much steeper angle down into the tanks
because<00:01:01.589> of<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> angle<00:01:02.519> it<00:01:02.879> allows<00:01:03.329> us<00:01:03.359> to

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
because of this angle it allows us to

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.440 
because of this angle it allows us to

the way that we're able to accomplish

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.950 
the way that we're able to accomplish
that<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.770> through<00:01:20.250> modular<00:01:20.880> painting<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that is through modular painting in a

able to just pull the vehicle in and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.300 
able to just pull the vehicle in and
stop<00:01:25.360> it<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.780> robots<00:01:26.140> take<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.590> vehicle<00:01:26.979> and

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
stop it the robots take the vehicle and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.640 
stop it the robots take the vehicle and
then<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.549> unit<00:01:27.850> exits<00:01:28.390> therefore<00:01:29.140> your<00:01:29.350> spray

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
then the unit exits therefore your spray

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.950 
then the unit exits therefore your spray
booth<00:01:29.890> is<00:01:30.070> much<00:01:30.280> shorter<00:01:30.549> much<00:01:30.880> smaller<00:01:31.270> and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
booth is much shorter much smaller and

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.200 
booth is much shorter much smaller and
now<00:01:32.259> with<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.560> transit<00:01:32.979> program<00:01:33.490> we're<00:01:34.090> able

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
now with the transit program we're able

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.780 
now with the transit program we're able
to<00:01:34.450> incorporate<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.350> new<00:01:35.740> technology<00:01:36.400> that<00:01:36.670> we

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
to incorporate a new technology that we

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.359 
to incorporate a new technology that we
call<00:01:36.940> Monaco<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:38.080> advantage<00:01:38.470> of<00:01:38.590> Monaco<00:01:39.040> is

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
call Monaco the advantage of Monaco is

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.359 
call Monaco the advantage of Monaco is
it<00:01:39.670> allows<00:01:39.940> us<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.479> apply<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.680> coating<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.280> a

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
it allows us to apply the coating and a

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.180 
it allows us to apply the coating and a
two-step<00:01:42.820> process<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:44.080> put<00:01:44.290> on<00:01:44.409> a<00:01:44.440> prime<00:01:44.800> and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
two-step process we put on a prime and

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.760 
two-step process we put on a prime and
then<00:01:45.550> we<00:01:45.729> have<00:01:45.940> incorporated<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.170> color<00:01:47.440> and

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
then we have incorporated the color and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.760 
then we have incorporated the color and
the<00:01:48.159> gloss<00:01:48.430> all<00:01:48.850> in<00:01:49.149> one<00:01:49.330> layer<00:01:49.590> one<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.680> the

new<00:01:55.479> technology<00:01:55.869> where<00:01:56.830> we<00:01:56.860> incorporate<00:01:57.460> the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
new technology where we incorporate the

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.480 
new technology where we incorporate the
color<00:01:57.850> aspect<00:01:58.390> into<00:01:58.929> a<00:01:58.960> clear<00:01:59.350> coat<00:01:59.590> really

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490

protects<00:02:01.000> our<00:02:01.119> customers<00:02:01.630> against<00:02:02.020> that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
protects our customers against that

degradation<00:02:03.090> we're<00:02:04.090> putting<00:02:04.420> less<00:02:04.659> coating

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
degradation we're putting less coating

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.779 
degradation we're putting less coating
on<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.350> vehicle<00:02:05.740> so<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.039> do<00:02:06.190> see<00:02:06.399> some<00:02:06.550> weight

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
on the vehicle so we do see some weight

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.820 
on the vehicle so we do see some weight
savings<00:02:07.300> from<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.539> about<00:02:08.140> full<00:02:08.380> pounds<00:02:08.679> per

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
savings from that about full pounds per

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.520 
savings from that about full pounds per
vehicle<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.819> also<00:02:09.970> reduce<00:02:10.539> TOC<00:02:11.080> emissions

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
vehicle and also reduce TOC emissions

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.160 
vehicle and also reduce TOC emissions
right<00:02:12.190> now<00:02:12.370> we're<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.180> target<00:02:13.660> this<00:02:13.959> for

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
right now we're going to target this for

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.720 
right now we're going to target this for
commercial<00:02:14.680> vehicles<00:02:14.769> so<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.430> going<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.640> be

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
commercial vehicles so it's going to be

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.270 
commercial vehicles so it's going to be
on<00:02:15.880> transit<00:02:16.540> here<00:02:16.750> it's<00:02:17.319> also<00:02:17.560> being<00:02:17.920> applied

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
on transit here it's also being applied

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.270 
on transit here it's also being applied
to<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.670> transit<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.330> China<00:02:19.630> after<00:02:20.440> paint<00:02:20.920> the
