 how cool she is in general already on my 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.280
 The channel has a car for pumping from gta 5 to 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.700
 overall, you can also look further tomb 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.550
 raider 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.940
 I almost passed this visa tomb yesterday 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.790
 raider 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.780
 when I go through his night record 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.370
 on our channel 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.870
 but this is not the most not the most but one of 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.620
 the most epic games I've ever 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.060
 played there this is what's going on here I 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.300
 I'll start recording, you'll see for yourself 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.820
 the game is just bombarding it goes on 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.330
 assassin's creed unity everyone knows it 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.480
 defocus 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.880
 everyone knows her game is awesome 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.830
 of course she was funny at the very beginning 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.959
 but in the end I really like her 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.800
 i am a fan of assassin's creed series 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.720
 almost everything is accurate almost all parts well and 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.540
 almost all of this 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.070
 assassin's creed unity in general 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.800
 awesome 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.440
 then we all go beloved witcher 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.900
 3 witcher 3 wild hunt I bought myself 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.650
 dns and this is how you see only online 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.670
 dns I have this volchik in here 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.410
 in general, now I will unpack your game 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.940
 just awesome almost everything went 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.660
 percent to eighty nine 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.280
 This game just took me completely 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.770
 let's start this more or less 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.390
 interesting here we shoot not for 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.500
 what game i don't have such top 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:06.190
 things here we are shooting and we are 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.710
 Witcher 3 discover the most interesting 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.880
 here it is just what they tell us 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.450
 sit projekt red 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:19.270
 can pause and read 321 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.890
 so we go further leadership 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.070
 user basically nothing 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:29.320
 interesting 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:33.820
 further this map is really interesting from 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.640
 the whole witcher is generally understandable then 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.850
 that the card itself is like a piece of paper for 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.570
 gta 5 more but the map is just 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.390
 Witcher 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:46.750
 real times five or eight more than 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.460
 gta 5 you can if you have played already 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.040
 quite 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:54.010
 beat until my God witch 3 then you 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:59.290
 just yourself know about the scale of this map 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:02.530
 just chic we go on 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:07.930
 us another great drive is 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:12.750
 soundtracks to the soundtrack of the game checking 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.750
 witcher 3 wild hunt then goes with us 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.070
 wonderful so this is us a 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.660
 the witch's universe here is told in 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.560
 common to those people who have not played a sign 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.260
 2 and 1 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.690
 what is it all about but i want to say 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.310
 what if you play witch 3 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.560
 you will not be the feeling that you are something 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.760
 missed but only in one mission in 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.760
 The beginning of the sticker with the roll of one is on 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.180
 playstation overall it was very 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.120
 interesting we go further 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:46.270
 Of course the most interesting with us is this 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:51.580
 this one is a wolf icon and an amulet icon 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.580

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:03.229
