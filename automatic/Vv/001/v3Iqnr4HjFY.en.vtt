00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.670
 to the music of sen sans 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.670
 Japanese skater will ride 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.279
 once the bronze medalist of the championship 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.189
 countries of the rising sun 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.390
 then this place 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.390
 on the pedestal lost 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.720
 he left 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.019
 restaurant and 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.029
 from Japan 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.989
 I'm surprised that 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.249
 with such a leisurely as they 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.309
 melikyan language rnn and 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:43.669
 the name of saint john is quite a bit 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.909
 late for the final chord 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.849
 injured 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.799
 do we need 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.609
 I think yes 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.139
 will do 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.139
 need to say 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.159
 we are still in the performance of the goal 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.379
 in twitter networks crash site cried out 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.299
 so he during 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.079
 opened up 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.249
 because the growth of attribution 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:16.859
 with interest look at the site in this 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.469
 case 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.739
 if in the famous information 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.300
 spaces 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.300
 exclusively Yushchenko 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.159
 woods is then present too 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.909
 but honest word to all such thoughts 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:36.870
 don't even know 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.690
 what it will be slowly now 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.690
 slow motion 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.389
 clearly 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.979
 a little bit different 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.979
 Chirkunov will be seen 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.819
 I think not conducted 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.389
 in Belarus 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.620
 it's not the only one 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.650
 water marks 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.939
 chelsea mu 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:20.939
 good such position was doubled 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.249
 vrubel d 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:24.949
 and everything seems to be right 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.629
 16 heat 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.629
 This is enough 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.539
 film 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.780
 in the women's single skating myself too 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.909
 It was 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.529
 a couple can see figure skaters Anatolia 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:54.509
 Makarenko 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.259
 it did not stop to score very much 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.119
 decent places 

00:05:58.119 --> 00:06:01.119
 after the concert uah 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.879
 from mid July 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.369
 if the parties do not show 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:08.599
 investment activity 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:10.360
 if clean 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.659
 neat skating 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.659
 it turns out not bad grades 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.800
 ahead of the performance by christopher 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.720
