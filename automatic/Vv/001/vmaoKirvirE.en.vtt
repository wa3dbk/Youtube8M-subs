00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.000
 I was born in Brazil and started playing soccer 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.639
 When I was 8 years old I love football 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.490
 I had a lot of fun training and going 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.260
 a good time that was the purpose of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.289
 football in my life when I was just a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.289
 boy 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.860
 currently in my life and my career live 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.340
 by goals and objectives and therefore everything 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.750
 what I do has an address and purpose 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.579
 I think this is what gives me the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.579
 motivation to strive for my dreams 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.590
 we go out in the lord 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.080
 in 2000 I played for the team 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.790
 juvenile of Sao Paulo and in the middle of 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.400
 championship received a yellow card 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.990
 I was suspended for a game so 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.350
 take advantage of the free weekend that 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.299
 I had to visit my grandparents 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.490
 my brother and I went to a park 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.860
 aquatic amusement and gliding 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.259
 on a slide I hit my head with the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.659
 bottom of the pool and my neck is 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.690
 it broke I had fractured the sixth 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.820
 vertebra 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.040
 I returned to the trainings to Sao 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.070
 paulo but I could not stand more the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.530
 pain all including the doctors I 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.480
 they said that I was very lucky that I could 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.510
 be paralyzed and lose my ability 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.280
 to walk and play soccer but I do not think 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.060
 that was lucky I think god 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.939
 I was protecting 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.740
 I started playing again in 2001 and 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.630
 almost after two weeks they called me 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.060
 to play in the professional team of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.909
 sao paulo I think god had a 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.250
 purpose in that accident and I think not 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.350
 it was coincidence was something that happened 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.049
 just before starting the blessing of 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.729
 my career as a professional player was 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.729
 a great experience in my life 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.039
 Kaka is a very special person since 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.860
 the eliminations of the world cup 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.490
 in 2001 we played together in the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.520
 Brazil's biggest selection we are friends 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.160
 his character is faultless and all the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.010
 time I have not known your walk with 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.010
 God is an example for all of us 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.830
 lose is part of the game we play two or 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.230
 three games a week and we won about 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.900
 and we lose others but the defeats 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.500
 they can teach us and it can be a time 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.600
 for reflection it is difficult 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.180
 I have defeats that have marked my life 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.750
 how to lose the cup final 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.600
 World of 2006 against France 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.100
 I have also had many victories but 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.100
 the defeats have taught me 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.930
 in 2002 I played with the selection of 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.819
 Brazil for the first time was 20 years old is 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.650
 a feeling that goes beyond the 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.360
 words 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.819
 the first time I heard the anthem 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.299
 national standing singing it with the 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.280
 national team and with the entire stadium 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.970
 it gave me great emotion was a great 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.970
 God's blessing 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.069
 in the world cup of 2002 I played only 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:33.530
 25 minutes in a match against the coast 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.469
 rich but I felt like a champion of 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.569
 world when the final whistle sounded in the 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.579
 last game I ran to the court and what 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.250
 The only thing I could do was glorify and 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.349
 thank god I knew that everyone 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.030
 I was watching the game millions and 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.879
 millions of people stuck to 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.120
 TV the great emotion of being a champion 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:56.239
 it was almost too much so with the nilson 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.250
 illusion we pray together for me really 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.689
 it was special to be in that group and be 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.689
 world champion in 2000 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.700
 the fact of playing for a great team 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.799
 play in the national team the fact 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.230
 of having a wife and family that I 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.130
 they support just show me that I need 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.049
 goodbye even more for all these demands 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.870
 I think it's at this time that 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.210
 we need more goodbye always tell 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.210
 the people including my wife and children 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.150
 they need to find goodbye first and he 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.930
 will take care of what remains 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.870
 regardless of what you have 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.180
 who are you where do you play what you do to 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:41.220
 part of your job or your profession 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.760
 Jesus loves you in the same way 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:48.249
 for me I see this when I win when 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.829
 I lose or even when I fail 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.319
 in the eyes of God, I am the same 

00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:56.019
 person and he will continue to love me from the 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:59.729
 same way I think this is what we 

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:59.729
 approach him every day 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.660
 we have a father who loves us and has a 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.790
 plan for us I'm not talking about 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.380
 a fairy tale god I'm 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.930
 talking about a god that I have experienced 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.850
 and that has changed my life and that 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.870
 changes and transforms every day into a 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.870
 very real way 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.430
 I want to share a secret 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.460
 spiritual when we got married my wife 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.200
 and I was virgin, I'm not going to tell you 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.900
 that was easy because there were many 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.690
 temptations we spent a lot of time praying 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.730
 and walking near Jesus was a great 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.050
 challenge but it was worth having 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.990
 expected 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.940
 I am living many of my dreams the 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.340
 bible tells us that god is capable of 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.919
 do immensely more than we ask 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.889
 or imagine and I think this is what 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.229
 has happened in my life I play soccer 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.030
 because I have a talent given by God and 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.789
 he has perfected that talent in me 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.550
 life jesus said separated from me not 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:06.220
 they can do nothing and I believe it 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.740
 he said I am the way the truth and the 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.470
 life nobody comes to the father if it is not for 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.900
 my god gave me a second chance and 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.070
 he accepted me as his son made a 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.620
 sacrifice on the cross for me 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.770
 if only he had the soccer fame or title 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.350
 if I did not have goodbye I would not be happy without 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.600
 Any doubt today I can say that God has 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.870
 done things in my life that I could never 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.870
 have imagined 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.969
 in the end 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:39.849
 with game or without him god is enough 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:42.389
 and he is the first 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:42.389
 the disc
