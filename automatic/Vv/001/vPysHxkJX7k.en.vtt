00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
probably due to a hot barrel and it

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.529 
probably due to a hot barrel and it
doesn't<00:02:05.460> help<00:02:05.579> anything<00:02:05.790> with

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.330 
bullets and see what she does it about
300<00:05:39.419> yards<00:05:39.570> we'll<00:05:40.380> just<00:05:40.560> go<00:05:41.010> set<00:05:41.220> our

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
300 yards we'll just go set our

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.600 
300 yards we'll just go set our
self-healing<00:05:42.090> target<00:05:42.479> up
