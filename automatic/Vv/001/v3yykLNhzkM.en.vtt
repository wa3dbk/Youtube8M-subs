hi<00:00:01.540> Brian<00:00:01.900> here<00:00:02.080> with<00:00:02.230> another<00:00:02.500> update<00:00:02.710> on<00:00:03.040> my

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:03.159 
hi Brian here with another update on my

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.789 
hi Brian here with another update on my
aquaponic<00:00:03.760> systems<00:00:04.180> in<00:00:05.080> this<00:00:05.230> video<00:00:05.500> I'm<00:00:05.650> just

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:05.799 
aquaponic systems in this video I'm just

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.580 
aquaponic systems in this video I'm just
going<00:00:05.980> to<00:00:06.009> show<00:00:06.250> the<00:00:06.970> replacement<00:00:07.839> of<00:00:08.049> the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
going to show the replacement of the

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.430 
going to show the replacement of the
pump<00:00:08.860> to<00:00:09.250> my<00:00:09.400> outdoor<00:00:09.730> aquaponic<00:00:10.330> system<00:00:10.690> so

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
pump to my outdoor aquaponic system so

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.410 
pump to my outdoor aquaponic system so
as<00:00:11.500> you<00:00:11.619> can<00:00:11.770> see<00:00:11.830> here<00:00:12.219> the<00:00:12.369> flow<00:00:12.670> had<00:00:13.209> gotten

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
as you can see here the flow had gotten

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.770 
as you can see here the flow had gotten
to<00:00:13.629> be<00:00:13.779> really<00:00:14.139> slow<00:00:14.680> and<00:00:15.540> basically<00:00:16.540> the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
to be really slow and basically the

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.100 
to be really slow and basically the
siphons<00:00:17.230> were<00:00:17.680> not<00:00:17.860> cycling<00:00:18.220> properly<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.930> so

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
siphons were not cycling properly and so

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.570 
siphons were not cycling properly and so
some<00:00:20.350> tanks<00:00:20.650> were<00:00:20.740> just<00:00:20.950> kind<00:00:21.130> of<00:00:21.190> staying<00:00:21.430> at

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
some tanks were just kind of staying at

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.210 
some tanks were just kind of staying at
a<00:00:21.610> steady<00:00:21.940> level<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:23.080> I<00:00:23.110> decided<00:00:23.620> to<00:00:23.860> go<00:00:24.130> ahead

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
a steady level so I decided to go ahead

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.970 
a steady level so I decided to go ahead
and<00:00:24.430> replace<00:00:24.670> the<00:00:24.940> pump<00:00:25.530> seems<00:00:26.530> like<00:00:26.740> all<00:00:26.950> the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
and replace the pump seems like all the

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.460 
and replace the pump seems like all the
algae<00:00:27.400> and<00:00:27.670> gunk<00:00:28.090> that<00:00:28.180> build<00:00:28.600> built<00:00:29.020> up<00:00:29.230> over

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
algae and gunk that build built up over

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.980 
algae and gunk that build built up over
time<00:00:29.619> cause<00:00:30.400> my<00:00:30.580> old<00:00:30.610> one<00:00:30.910> to<00:00:31.000> slow<00:00:31.180> down<00:00:31.390> so<00:00:31.750> I

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
time cause my old one to slow down so I

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.520 
time cause my old one to slow down so I
bought<00:00:32.500> this<00:00:32.650> one<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:34.020> 400<00:00:35.020> gallon<00:00:35.290> per<00:00:35.470> hour

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
bought this one it's 400 gallon per hour

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.550 
bought this one it's 400 gallon per hour
pump<00:00:36.239> again<00:00:37.239> got<00:00:37.540> it<00:00:37.570> off<00:00:37.750> of<00:00:37.870> Amazon

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
pump again got it off of Amazon

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.620 
pump again got it off of Amazon
should<00:00:39.100> be<00:00:39.220> about<00:00:39.460> twice<00:00:39.730> as<00:00:39.910> powerful<00:00:40.390> as<00:00:40.480> my

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
should be about twice as powerful as my

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.740 
should be about twice as powerful as my
old<00:00:40.840> one<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:42.070> this<00:00:42.190> one<00:00:42.399> also<00:00:42.550> has<00:00:42.700> a<00:00:43.270> built<00:00:43.600> in

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
old one and this one also has a built in

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.210 
old one and this one also has a built in
filtration<00:00:45.390> area<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.680> hopefully<00:00:48.010> that'll

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
filtration area so hopefully that'll

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.000 
filtration area so hopefully that'll
slow<00:00:49.059> down<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.690> build-up<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.470> algae<00:00:50.860> and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
slow down the build-up of algae and

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.630 
slow down the build-up of algae and
stuff<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:52.239> protect<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.899> impeller<00:00:53.230> better<00:00:53.640> it

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
stuff and protect the impeller better it

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.100 
stuff and protect the impeller better it
came<00:00:54.820> with<00:00:54.969> a<00:00:55.000> bunch<00:00:55.239> of<00:00:55.329> attachments<00:00:55.989> or

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
came with a bunch of attachments or

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.290 
came with a bunch of attachments or
fittings<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.820> they<00:00:58.420> thread<00:00:58.780> in<00:00:58.960> rather<00:00:59.710> than

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
fittings and they thread in rather than

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.030 
fittings and they thread in rather than
fit<00:01:01.300> in<00:01:01.450> snugly<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.260> they<00:01:02.379> should<00:01:02.559> be<00:01:02.680> nice<00:01:02.829> and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
fit in snugly so they should be nice and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.429 
fit in snugly so they should be nice and
secure<00:01:03.539> there's<00:01:04.539> a<00:01:04.600> number<00:01:05.049> of<00:01:05.139> different

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
secure there's a number of different

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.010 
secure there's a number of different
diameters<00:01:06.420> unfortunately<00:01:07.420> they<00:01:07.600> don't<00:01:07.719> line

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
diameters unfortunately they don't line

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.289 
diameters unfortunately they don't line
up<00:01:08.049> with<00:01:08.229> your<00:01:08.709> typical<00:01:08.889> PVC<00:01:09.700> diameters

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
up with your typical PVC diameters

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.039 
up with your typical PVC diameters
they're<00:01:10.959> more<00:01:11.170> for<00:01:11.439> I<00:01:11.469> guess<00:01:11.829> flexible<00:01:12.369> tubing

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
they're more for I guess flexible tubing

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.590 
they're more for I guess flexible tubing
so<00:01:14.049> you<00:01:14.109> may<00:01:14.289> have<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.590> kind<00:01:14.799> of<00:01:15.299> figure<00:01:16.299> out<00:01:16.420> a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
so you may have to kind of figure out a

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.190 
so you may have to kind of figure out a
way<00:01:16.869> to<00:01:16.929> make<00:01:17.289> it<00:01:17.409> fit<00:01:17.679> normal<00:01:18.310> PVC<00:01:18.880> I<00:01:19.119> had<00:01:20.049> to

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
way to make it fit normal PVC I had to

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.239 
way to make it fit normal PVC I had to
do<00:01:20.319> that<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.909> can<00:01:22.029> see<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.200> old<00:01:23.799> pump<00:01:24.100> I

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:24.249 
do that as you can see the old pump I

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:27.959 
do that as you can see the old pump I
had<00:01:24.459> I<00:01:24.759> was<00:01:24.999> able<00:01:25.149> to<00:01:25.299> get<00:01:25.509> to<00:01:25.840> fit<00:01:26.789> some<00:01:27.789> pretty

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
had I was able to get to fit some pretty

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.300 
had I was able to get to fit some pretty
standard<00:01:28.539> sizes<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.170> had<00:01:29.409> to<00:01:29.560> come<00:01:30.099> up<00:01:30.219> with

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
standard sizes I had to come up with

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.969 
standard sizes I had to come up with
some<00:01:30.630> ways<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.810> stepping<00:01:32.170> down<00:01:32.349> to<00:01:32.679> make<00:01:32.829> them

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
some ways of stepping down to make them

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.919 
some ways of stepping down to make them
fit<00:01:33.159> but<00:01:33.549> I<00:01:33.759> was<00:01:33.999> able<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.299> get<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.659> just

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
fit but I was able to get it to just

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.249 
fit but I was able to get it to just
snug<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.319> there<00:01:35.639> on<00:01:36.639> this<00:01:36.849> system<00:01:37.240> though<00:01:37.420> it

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
snug in there on this system though it

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.169 
snug in there on this system though it
didn't<00:01:38.619> fit<00:01:38.740> any<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:39.039> those<00:01:39.219> diameters<00:01:39.849> quite

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
didn't fit any of those diameters quite

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.719 
didn't fit any of those diameters quite
right<00:01:40.420> but<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:41.560> did<00:01:41.679> come<00:01:41.859> close<00:01:42.189> one<00:01:42.549> of<00:01:42.579> the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
right but it did come close one of the

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.209 
right but it did come close one of the
sizes<00:01:43.119> did<00:01:43.299> come<00:01:43.479> close<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.869> fitting<00:01:44.049> in<00:01:44.319> to<00:01:45.009> my

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
sizes did come close to fitting in to my

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.319 
sizes did come close to fitting in to my
main<00:01:45.429> main<00:01:45.969> main<00:01:46.619> PVC<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.759> with<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.029> heat<00:01:49.179> gun

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
main main main PVC so with the heat gun

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.710 
main main main PVC so with the heat gun
I<00:01:49.630> was<00:01:50.139> able<00:01:50.319> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I was able to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.020 
I was able to
why<00:01:52.110> didn't<00:01:52.410> I<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.890> diameter<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.580> pipe

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
why didn't I the diameter of that pipe

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.250 
why didn't I the diameter of that pipe
just<00:01:54.360> enough<00:01:54.690> to<00:01:55.380> Snug<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:57.330> so<00:01:58.080> that

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
just enough to Snug it in and so that

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.330 
just enough to Snug it in and so that
worked<00:01:58.440> pretty<00:01:58.650> well<00:01:59.510> so<00:02:00.510> after<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.560> was

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
worked pretty well so after that I was

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.670 
worked pretty well so after that I was
able<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.820> screw<00:02:03.510> on<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.960> attach<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.470> pipe

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
able to screw on and attach to the pipe

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.320 
able to screw on and attach to the pipe
and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.670> worked<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.090> down<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.480> the<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> tank

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
and I worked it down in the in the tank

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.270 
and I worked it down in the in the tank
but<00:02:09.330> sure<00:02:10.110> enough<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.649> soon<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.950> turned<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
but sure enough as soon as I turned it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.580 
but sure enough as soon as I turned it
on<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.670> didn't<00:02:11.910> see<00:02:12.030> any<00:02:12.180> water<00:02:12.390> flow<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.930> I

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
on I didn't see any water flow so I

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.130 
on I didn't see any water flow so I
pulled<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.890> back<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.750> looked<00:02:15.750> into<00:02:15.960> what

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
pulled it back out and looked into what

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.480 
pulled it back out and looked into what
the<00:02:16.230> issue<00:02:16.380> was<00:02:17.360> first<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.510> all<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
the issue was first of all it the the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.240 
the issue was first of all it the the
PVC<00:02:20.850> pipe<00:02:21.030> didn't<00:02:21.450> fit<00:02:21.630> snugly<00:02:22.230> enough<00:02:22.560> onto

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
PVC pipe didn't fit snugly enough onto

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.540 
PVC pipe didn't fit snugly enough onto
the<00:02:23.459> pump<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.930> stay<00:02:25.380> on<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.920> think<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.340> fell

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the pump to stay on so I think it fell

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.610 
the pump to stay on so I think it fell
off<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.840> was<00:02:27.959> one<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> reasons<00:02:28.530> I

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
off and so that was one of the reasons I

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.080 
off and so that was one of the reasons I
didn't<00:02:28.830> see<00:02:28.950> any<00:02:29.070> water<00:02:29.310> flow<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:29.970> it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
didn't see any water flow is that it

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.320 
didn't see any water flow is that it
wasn't<00:02:30.630> attached<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.110> my<00:02:31.200> pipe<00:02:31.910> but<00:02:32.910> before<00:02:33.300> I

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
wasn't attached to my pipe but before I

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.760 
wasn't attached to my pipe but before I
put<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.600> back<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.020> did<00:02:34.170> want<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.380> test<00:02:34.620> out

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
put it back in I did want to test out

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.080 
put it back in I did want to test out
the<00:02:34.950> pump<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.459> make<00:02:35.520> sure<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.910> was

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
the pump and make sure that I was

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.510 
the pump and make sure that I was
working<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.900> when<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.680> did<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.070> just<00:02:38.220> put

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
working and when I did that I just put

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.510 
working and when I did that I just put
it<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.760> bucket<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.300> had<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.870> cycle<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.520> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
it in a bucket and had it cycle and the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.160 
it in a bucket and had it cycle and the
pressure<00:02:41.790> did<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.239> seem<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.600> be<00:02:42.840> nearly

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
pressure did not seem to be nearly

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.590 
pressure did not seem to be nearly
strong<00:02:43.560> enough<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.850> do<00:02:44.970> what<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.150> wanted<00:02:45.420> it

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
strong enough to to do what I wanted it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.130 
strong enough to to do what I wanted it
to<00:02:45.630> do<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:48.270> initially<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.810> was<00:02:48.930> kind<00:02:49.110> of

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
to do and so initially I was kind of

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.170 
to do and so initially I was kind of
concerned<00:02:49.590> but<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.190> let<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.430> run<00:02:50.550> for<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.820> while<00:02:50.940> I

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
concerned but I let it run for a while I

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.340 
concerned but I let it run for a while I
knew<00:02:51.330> these<00:02:51.510> things<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.959> kind<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.230> a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
knew these things have kind of a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.830 
knew these things have kind of a
break-in<00:02:52.590> period<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.310> sure<00:02:54.239> enough<00:02:54.510> after

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
break-in period and sure enough after

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.280 
break-in period and sure enough after
several<00:02:55.620> minutes<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:56.190> kind<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.610> immediately

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
several minutes it kind of immediately

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.030 
several minutes it kind of immediately
just<00:02:58.290> started<00:02:58.760> flowing<00:02:59.760> really<00:03:00.030> strong<00:03:00.420> so

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
just started flowing really strong so

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.229 
just started flowing really strong so
just<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.100> word<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.340> caution<00:03:02.519> if<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:02.880> get<00:03:03.090> one<00:03:03.180> of

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
just a word of caution if you get one of

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.990 
just a word of caution if you get one of
these<00:03:03.330> pumps<00:03:03.690> let<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.709> run<00:03:04.860> for<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.160> few<00:03:05.700> minutes

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
these pumps let it run for a few minutes

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.840 
these pumps let it run for a few minutes
before<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.450> judge<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:08.010> pumps<00:03:08.370> output

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
before you judge the the pumps output

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.150 
before you judge the the pumps output
it'll<00:03:09.690> probably<00:03:09.900> get<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.230> lot<00:03:10.440> stronger<00:03:10.709> if<00:03:11.010> you

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
it'll probably get a lot stronger if you

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.570 
it'll probably get a lot stronger if you
wait

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
wait

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.280 
wait
so<00:03:12.450> with<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.140> figured<00:03:13.500> out<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:15.290> basically

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
so with that figured out I I basically

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.140 
so with that figured out I I basically
fixed<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:18.019> detachment<00:03:19.019> problem<00:03:19.410> by<00:03:20.150> drilling

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
fixed the detachment problem by drilling

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.000 
fixed the detachment problem by drilling
a<00:03:21.360> small<00:03:21.600> hole<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.080> then<00:03:22.230> screwing<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:22.890> a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
a small hole and then screwing in a

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.030 
a small hole and then screwing in a
screw<00:03:23.340> through<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.180> PVC<00:03:24.690> pipe<00:03:24.900> into<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.380> pump

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
screw through the PVC pipe into the pump

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.370 
screw through the PVC pipe into the pump
fitting<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:27.660> that'll<00:03:27.870> keep<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.200> from

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
fitting and that'll keep it from

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.620 
fitting and that'll keep it from
slipping<00:03:28.650> off<00:03:29.600> so<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:32.239> reinstalled<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.390> pump

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
slipping off so I reinstalled the pump

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.590 
slipping off so I reinstalled the pump
and<00:03:33.930> as<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:34.920> can<00:03:35.040> see<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.519> water<00:03:35.760> flow<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.420> now

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
and as you can see the water flow is now

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.770 
and as you can see the water flow is now
really<00:03:37.170> strong<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:38.790> got<00:03:38.910> even<00:03:39.060> stronger<00:03:39.480> after

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
really strong it got even stronger after

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.230 
really strong it got even stronger after
this<00:03:40.110> video<00:03:40.440> as<00:03:40.799> time<00:03:41.220> went<00:03:41.370> on

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
this video as time went on

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.290 
this video as time went on
and<00:03:43.360> it's<00:03:43.960> now<00:03:44.170> now<00:03:45.130> cycling<00:03:45.610> my<00:03:45.790> siphons

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
and it's now now cycling my siphons

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.870 
and it's now now cycling my siphons
quite<00:03:47.140> nicely<00:03:47.380> so<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:48.070> seems<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.370> solve<00:03:48.760> the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
quite nicely so it seems to solve the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.110 
quite nicely so it seems to solve the
problem<00:03:49.240> and<00:03:49.390> it's<00:03:49.990> working<00:03:50.200> well<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
problem and it's working well so the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.640 
problem and it's working well so the
takeaway<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.750> if<00:03:53.080> you're<00:03:53.200> going<00:03:53.320> to<00:03:53.410> build<00:03:53.560> a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
takeaway is if you're going to build a

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.340 
takeaway is if you're going to build a
system<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:54.100> this<00:03:54.220> size<00:03:54.460> a<00:03:54.970> 400<00:03:55.930> gallon<00:03:56.200> per

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
system of this size a 400 gallon per

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.350 
system of this size a 400 gallon per
hour<00:03:56.380> pump<00:03:56.590> seems<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.550> be<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.700> pretty<00:03:57.970> good<00:03:58.120> size

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
hour pump seems to be a pretty good size

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.580 
hour pump seems to be a pretty good size
to<00:03:58.690> use<00:03:59.190> thanks<00:04:00.190> for<00:04:00.310> watching
