00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 the alpine house of santana to see one 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.710
 structure owned by the province 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.919
 of wedge for years has been managed 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.679
 directly from the province of cuneo 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:13.480
 after which it was sold to the park of the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.029
 Maritime Alps this year 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:21.390
 the park has decided to call a tender 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.390
 audience I attended 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.720
 in short, now for four years or 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.720
 of this management 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.180
 the alpine house 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.740
 a facility with 90 beds offers 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.810
 different services that can be 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.520
 those of self-management, however 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.370
 important service having this 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.010
 structure purpose also purposes also 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.040
 therefore allow holidays 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.949
 all in all low cost in one place 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.180
 quiet where the pristine environment 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.280
 or it also offers a more service 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.780
 complete that can be that of the bed 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.430
 and breakfast rather than half 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.680
 a full pension when retirement 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.629
 we thought of the alpine house and that 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.089
 what could represent him after a 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.940
 comparison with people with whom I have 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.530
 worked over the years we have chosen to have 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.560
 reasoned on the tree we chose the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.509
 leaf and we imagined that the house 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.800
 alpina was a tree that 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.149
 represented in some way the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:25.640
 solidity security stability and that 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:27.890
 the people who work or live there 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.259
 the alpine house were the leaves of the tree 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.039
 through the list beyond these leaves 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.230
 and the leaves come from this 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.790
 tree yes 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.790
 that spread throughout the territory 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.549
 the project that underlies the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.310
 project is living the alpine house like 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.920
 project and not as an accommodation facility 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.670
 this project is open to all in the sense 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:01.909
 that this project is an idea though 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:04.549
 it is transformable at any time e 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.489
 can change according to 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.649
 divides of suggestions of experiences that 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:13.650
 the neighbor arrives from anyone 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.950
 who lives here and feels certain things 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.870
 the tourist the passing hiker 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.519
 who decides to spend a night with 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.190
 we 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.930
 the animator who has a group of boys 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.700
 with which he already works and finds 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.069
 correspondence in the alpine house but gives 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.420
 suggestions on how the alpine house 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.980
 instead it could become the place 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.140
 ideal for its audience on 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.690
 the suggestions that also come from 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.610
 climatic and atmospheric conditions 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.060
 because then living the house you make yourself 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:49.170
 also consider how you can transform 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.730
 what happens here to transform the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.349
 rain is a resource transforming the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.810
 snow in a laugh turn a die 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.750
 of the wind formula in a resource e 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.490
 a little 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.490
 evolution has stuck in these things here 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.000
 I believe that the people who come out of 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.720
 this experience 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.910
 can I say I did my part too 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.490
 I made my contribution in the sense 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.720
 that whoever comes here leaves something 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.210
 he knows us 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.100
 we try to convey what 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.460
 we are but let's get to know them and 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.020
 to make something of them 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.180
 interest in the Alpine home transmits 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.230
 things to us and we do not look 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.530
 I would say positive 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.010
 I participated too I am a member 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.010
 me too
