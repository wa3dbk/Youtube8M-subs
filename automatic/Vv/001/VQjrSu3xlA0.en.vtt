00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050

a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:22.200> under<00:01:22.470> its<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.040> 160<00:01:23.759> bucks<00:01:23.939> so

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
a little under its like 160 bucks so

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.660 
a little under its like 160 bucks so
it's<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.200> too<00:01:25.409> bad<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.890> i<00:01:26.189> mean<00:01:26.460> i<00:01:26.490> could

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it's not too bad really i mean i could

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.190 
it's not too bad really i mean i could
probably<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> cheaper<00:01:27.720> from<00:01:27.840> when<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> don't

for<00:02:37.070> twelve<00:02:37.760> thirteen<00:02:38.390> dollars<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:39.020> believe

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
for twelve thirteen dollars I believe

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.350 
for twelve thirteen dollars I believe
it's<00:02:39.920> 15<00:02:40.250> inch<00:02:40.430> because<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:40.820> still<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.240> know

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
it's 15 inch because it's still you know

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.540 
it's 15 inch because it's still you know
square<00:02:41.990> I<00:02:42.290> think<00:02:42.830> once<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.040> get<00:02:43.160> larger<00:02:43.460> than

square I think once you get larger than
fifteen<00:02:43.910> they<00:02:44.060> start<00:02:44.330> becoming<00:02:44.420> widescreen

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
fifteen they start becoming widescreen

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.860 
fifteen they start becoming widescreen
so<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.710> assume<00:02:46.490> this<00:02:46.610> was<00:02:46.760> 15<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.210> cabin<00:02:47.660> i<00:02:47.720> want

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
to buy fit up to 15 inch and it's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.200 
to buy fit up to 15 inch and it's

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
about it the more I figured it might be

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.570 
about it the more I figured it might be
a<00:04:11.620> waste<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.769> honey<00:04:12.980> because<00:04:13.160> it's<00:04:13.370> going<00:04:13.519> to

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
a waste of honey because it's going to

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.670 
a waste of honey because it's going to
be<00:04:13.670> another<00:04:13.850> one<00:04:14.090> of<00:04:14.120> those<00:04:14.239> systems<00:04:14.690> where<00:04:15.650> I

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
be another one of those systems where I

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.520 
be another one of those systems where I
just<00:04:15.980> buy<00:04:16.459> an<00:04:16.669> end<00:04:16.970> up<00:04:17.060> having<00:04:17.390> two<00:04:17.959> games<00:04:18.290> or

I'm a kind of a person gets bored again
it's<00:04:21.799> really<00:04:22.010> fast<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.880> shell<00:04:23.090> out<00:04:23.120> 50<00:04:23.630> bucks<00:04:23.870> a

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
it's really fast to shell out 50 bucks a

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.940 
it's really fast to shell out 50 bucks a
game<00:04:24.760> just

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
game just

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.250 
game just
for<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.700> sake<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:26.940> wanting<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.600> try<00:04:27.840> one<00:04:28.110> or

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
for the sake of wanting to try one or

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.710 
for the sake of wanting to try one or
two<00:04:28.610> seemed<00:04:29.610> like<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.850> heck<00:04:30.120> of<00:04:30.150> an<00:04:30.330> investment

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
two seemed like a heck of an investment

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.870 
two seemed like a heck of an investment
so<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.050> figure<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.470> can<00:04:31.560> get<00:04:31.830> this<00:04:31.950> main<00:04:32.250> kab<00:04:32.520> put

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
so I figure I can get this main kab put

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.260 
so I figure I can get this main kab put
together<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:34.350> have<00:04:34.500> really<00:04:35.100> as<00:04:35.370> many<00:04:35.970> games

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
together and have really as many games

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.630 
together and have really as many games
as<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:36.540> could<00:04:36.720> ever<00:04:36.810> want<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:37.440> can<00:04:38.370> get<00:04:38.520> the

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
as I could ever want I can get the

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.400 
as I could ever want I can get the
cabinet<00:04:39.060> built<00:04:39.390> put<00:04:39.720> together<00:04:40.050> have<00:04:40.320> the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
cabinet built put together have the

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.120 
cabinet built put together have the
computer<00:04:40.710> set<00:04:41.070> up<00:04:41.100> with<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:43.500> RAM<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.040> all

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
computer set up with the the RAM and all

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.820 
computer set up with the the RAM and all
the<00:04:44.280> specs<00:04:44.610> I'd<00:04:44.880> need<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.420> get<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.410> control

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
the specs I'd need and get a control

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.010 
the specs I'd need and get a control
panel<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.220> all<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.520> for<00:04:47.970> brought<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.720> price

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
panel and all that for brought the price

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.760
