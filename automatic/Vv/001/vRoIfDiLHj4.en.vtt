so<00:00:17.020> we<00:00:18.020> all<00:00:18.140> know<00:00:18.260> that<00:00:18.290> fall<00:00:18.590> vibrating

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
so we all know that fall vibrating

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.250 
so we all know that fall vibrating
string<00:00:19.310> if<00:00:19.550> you<00:00:19.670> are<00:00:19.760> pressing<00:00:20.150> a<00:00:20.360> middle<00:00:20.930> the

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
string if you are pressing a middle the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.870 
string if you are pressing a middle the
half<00:00:21.500> of<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.800> string<00:00:22.040> you're<00:00:22.550> going<00:00:22.700> to<00:00:22.760> get

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
half of the string you're going to get

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.790 
half of the string you're going to get
an<00:00:23.000> octave<00:00:23.330> higher<00:00:23.360> so<00:00:23.900> for<00:00:24.440> example<00:00:24.740> if

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
an octave higher so for example if

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.920 
an octave higher so for example if
you're<00:00:24.950> playing<00:00:24.980> a<00:00:25.250> seat<00:00:25.490> to<00:00:26.240> a<00:00:26.270> place<00:00:26.600> below

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
you're playing a seat to a place below

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.299 
you're playing a seat to a place below
middle<00:00:27.230> C<00:00:29.230> you're<00:00:30.230> going<00:00:30.380> to<00:00:30.440> get<00:00:30.650> docked<00:00:31.520> if

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
middle C you're going to get docked if

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.030 
middle C you're going to get docked if
you're<00:00:34.309> going<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.550> get<00:00:34.670> a<00:00:34.700> see<00:00:35.030> above<00:00:35.360> dead<00:00:36.040> so

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
you're going to get a see above dead so

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.350 
you're going to get a see above dead so
once<00:00:37.220> again

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.540 

okay<00:00:41.360> but<00:00:41.540> hey<00:00:42.160> figures<00:00:43.160> like<00:00:43.400> ah<00:00:45.280> every<00:00:46.280> piano

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
okay but hey figures like ah every piano

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.360 
okay but hey figures like ah every piano
is<00:00:46.760> going<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.059> be<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:47.600> mean<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.290> lowest<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:49.220> low

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
is going to be I mean the lowest the low

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.850 
is going to be I mean the lowest the low
strings<00:00:49.640> are<00:00:49.760> going<00:00:49.790> to<00:00:49.940> be<00:00:50.030> longer<00:00:50.239> so<00:00:50.860> if

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
strings are going to be longer so if

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.860 
strings are going to be longer so if
you're<00:00:52.040> talking<00:00:52.190> about<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:53.769> grand<00:00:54.769> piano

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
you're talking about a grand piano

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.390 
you're talking about a grand piano
usually<00:00:56.870> composers<00:00:57.409> like<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:58.570> stick<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.600> the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
usually composers like to stick to the

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.899 
usually composers like to stick to the
notes<00:01:01.400> they<00:01:01.670> are<00:01:01.970> to<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.480> dampers<00:01:03.230> so<00:01:03.909> usually

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
notes they are to the dampers so usually

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.760 
notes they are to the dampers so usually
for<00:01:05.059> the<00:01:05.210> low<00:01:05.510> strings<00:01:05.840> they<00:01:05.990> like<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.260> do

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
for the low strings they like to do

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.200 
for the low strings they like to do
v<00:01:06.980> par<00:01:07.340> shows<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:08.870> for<00:01:09.080> example<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.560> C<00:01:10.210> you

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
v par shows the so for example the C you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.010 
v par shows the so for example the C you
will<00:01:11.330> do<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.320> get<00:01:12.620> a<00:01:12.650> e<00:01:13.870> do<00:01:14.870> this<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:17.479> get<00:01:17.659> a<00:01:17.720> e

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
will do a get a e do this you get a e

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.780 
will do a get a e do this you get a e
that<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.740> up<00:01:19.719> two<00:01:20.719> octaves<00:01:20.899> above<00:01:21.439> that<00:01:21.979> C<00:01:22.250> so

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.719 

but<00:01:25.790> if<00:01:25.939> you<00:01:26.060> do<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:27.619> string<00:01:28.100> slide<00:01:28.430> in<00:01:28.640> the

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
but if you do a the string slide in the

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.060 
but if you do a the string slide in the
middle<00:01:29.060> C<00:01:29.740> it's<00:01:30.740> going<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:31.070> be<00:01:32.770> it's<00:01:33.770> going<00:01:34.009> to

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
middle C it's going to be it's going to

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.399 
middle C it's going to be it's going to
be<00:01:34.130> instead<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:35.180> e<00:01:35.689> you<00:01:35.990> are<00:01:36.049> going<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.259> hear

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
be instead of a e you are going to hear

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:50.139 
be instead of a e you are going to hear
C<00:01:45.820> so<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.270> once<00:01:47.539> again<00:01:47.780> this<00:01:47.930> is<00:01:48.109> e<00:01:49.149> and

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
C so this is once again this is e and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:58.570 
C so this is once again this is e and
once<00:01:50.329> again<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.689> is

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.880 

okay<00:01:59.240> so<00:01:59.300> we're<00:01:59.600> trying<00:01:59.840> another<00:02:00.500> way<00:02:00.620> of

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
okay so we're trying another way of

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.100 
okay so we're trying another way of
doing<00:02:01.040> harmonics<00:02:01.790> with<00:02:02.270> what<00:02:02.660> is<00:02:02.750> this<00:02:02.960> guy

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
doing harmonics with what is this guy

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.480 
doing harmonics with what is this guy
said<00:02:03.860> she's<00:02:04.160> old<00:02:04.460> what<00:02:05.360> she's<00:02:05.630> all<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:07.310> can

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
said she's old what she's all you can

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.350 
said she's old what she's all you can
hear<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.880> me<00:02:08.090> use<00:02:08.300> any<00:02:08.540> tool<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.140> uh<00:02:10.360> allows

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
hear is me use any tool that uh allows

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
you to have a good slight sliding down

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.890 
you to have a good slight sliding down
the<00:02:14.270> strings

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
the strings

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.840 
the strings

I'm going to your fall board without
pedals<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.840> hitting<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.410> board<00:02:53.220> lista

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
pedals this is a hitting the board lista

pedals this is a hitting the board lista
de<00:02:54.840> carvalho<00:02:55.440> okay<00:02:55.800> put<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.069> pedal<00:02:56.400> down<00:02:56.550> like

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
de carvalho okay put the pedal down like

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.979 
de carvalho okay put the pedal down like
the<00:02:57.090> damper<00:02:57.330> pedal<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:59.989> kind

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
the damper pedal down and do this kind

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.320 
the damper pedal down and do this kind
of<00:03:01.110> resonance<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.800> can't<00:03:02.400> keep<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.700> pedal<00:03:02.970> up

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
of resonance I can't keep the pedal up

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.120 
of resonance I can't keep the pedal up
like<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.470> mean<00:03:06.530> hairdo<00:03:07.530> there<00:03:07.709> get<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.010> you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
like a I mean hairdo there get this you

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.750 
like a I mean hairdo there get this you
dang<00:03:08.310> it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.259 

nice<00:03:11.760> okay<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:13.500> one<00:03:13.800> is<00:03:13.830> hitting<00:03:14.819> on<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
nice okay this one is hitting on the

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:32.630 
nice okay this one is hitting on the
stress<00:03:16.230> bar<00:03:16.440> with<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.099> mallet<00:03:31.250> Wow

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
stress bar with the mallet Wow

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.949 
stress bar with the mallet Wow
I<00:03:32.670> think<00:03:33.299> there's<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.510> difference<00:03:33.840> between

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
I think there's a difference between

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.960 
I think there's a difference between

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
hitting the top and this is there a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.420 
hitting the top and this is there a
difference<00:03:38.630> like<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.890> way<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.310> this

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
difference like that this way and this

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.949 
difference like that this way and this
way<00:03:41.640> oh<00:03:44.690> yeah

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959
