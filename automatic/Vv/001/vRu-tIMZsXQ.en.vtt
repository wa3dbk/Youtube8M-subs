00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.380
 more than 20 years ago there is a series 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.510
 very good animated call the issuers 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.370
 which derives in a lot of articles 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.070
 promotional 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.350
 well clear with money the assistant dances 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.750
 Santa 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.029
 unfortunately said series still 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.670
 exists and is in respirator 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.040
 artificial being just a bagasse of the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.750
 genius that was once since today 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.170
 in day the chapters are very but very 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.829
 bad guys and they know that I'm going to give them a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.589
 exclusive 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.440
 I'm going to talk to you according to what 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.300
 I said a representative of Fox 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.969
 what time the chapters of the simpsons 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.210
 the chapters of 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.549
 the simpsons went bad, I do not know 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.949
 Go tell anyone the Simpsons 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.040
 They came back bad when they stopped being 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.440
 good ones 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.330
 like any successful television being 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.100
 The Simpsons also had a game of 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.020
 very, very good video 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.180
 However, as a matter of licensing and 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.800
 other legal ratchets said game 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.620
 it was never available in consoles of 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.240
 home video games but up to 20 years 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.280
 then when finally in the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.990
 comfort of our home we could play 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.090
 the best game of the simpsons ever 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.090
 I realized of course I mean 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.100
 to the fire of arcadia of the simpsons 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.140
 unfortunately, there is no edition 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.940
 physical of this game the only way to 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.110
 play it is downloading it in digital form 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.300
 in any of the virtual stores 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.160
 known with being that the only 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.200
 modern console with which I count is the 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.930
 Playstation 3 will be with it with which 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.790
 we will play now and now where is the play 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.330
 station 3 to see allow a moment 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.330
 ah 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.250
 love have you seen playstation 3 has not 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.250
 forgotten I found it 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.860
 good 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.670
 the simpsons game is a beat'em up 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.460
 of konami chalet that these gentlemen do not 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.370
 They know how to do something else, the bones story 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.740
 and it 's my they steal a jewelry for some 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.020
 reason is then when halfway 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.820
 they run into the simpson and maggi family 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.410
 inside all the confusion stays with 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.480
 the stolen diamond and therefore 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.790
 kidnapped so the rest of the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.690
 family has to go to their rescue 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.330
 counting on the help of many friends 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.870
 of the family as milhouse help between 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.280
 santa bob patiño and so when bob patiño 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.200
 he is a friend of the family 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.640
 in this game you can use a 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.940
 any member of the simpson family 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.230
 and with him or her you must chase the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.810
 women for a lot of 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.460
 scenarios like the forest where smooth 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.280
 You can show your love for animals 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.900
 the strong walks a bear a cemetery 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.930
 where you must defeat a lot of 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.600
 zombies the bar of moe that strangely 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.820
 is under the cemetery the 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.130
 land of dreams where homero can 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.590
 demonstrate your love for marc by running be 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.230
 his representations in fairs and the 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.920
 channel 6 where you must rescue April 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.050
 a fire to ninth but game 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.880
 the gameplay is not very different to 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.470
 others my fear of konami does not 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.450
 I would miss that to make these games 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.980
 with my grab the same skeleton and 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.349
 they put agile of the simpsons the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.930
 ninja or xy bills 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.790
 directito to your favorite pharmacy the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.410
 unique innovations of this game about 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.810
 others occur mainly when 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.130
 you play multiplayer since there are certain 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.569
 attacks that you can only perform 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.180
 synchronizing you against the players 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.370
 however if you are a fat mandilon 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.500
 married and 40 a like me hard 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.300
 you will have friends with whom to play and 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.069
 with it to show them everything I finish 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.830
 to say although the downloadable version 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.959
 of the game is for practical purposes the 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.510
 same as the original of arcadia still 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.019
 they have their small differences some 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.510
 for good others for evil for example a 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.220
 Once you select a character with that 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.680
 You must stay until the end of the game 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.450
 I remember that in the original Arcadia and 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.340
 similar to the others I'm afraid that konami 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.950
 you could change character when 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.870
 I lost all your life as long as 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.370
 this one was available other 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.900
 difference is that you can play online 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.880
 with any stranger that you find 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.360
 on the internet taking you with those 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.460
 typical pq 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.380
 like a frightening lake thanks to your 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.460
 greed does not allow you to hire a 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.470
 basically greater than 56 kbps 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.030
 that's something from the simpsons of arcades if 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.550
 some were the opportunity to play 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.650
 a little machine or played the games of 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.930
 the ninja charges you know what you 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.160
 you are facing quick action and 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.630
 vertiginous lose lives like crazy 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.370
 have fun as a dwarf when they play 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.040
 several fight with us for the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.540
 community that recovers your energy 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.430
 puritita fun I recommend what 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.470
 you buy soon because in one of those 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.360
 with that of exploiting the license of 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.850
 the simpsons are not handled by 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.830
 exclusivity is appointment legal place is like this 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.480
 it would not be weird that suddenly 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.060
 disappear from stores due to 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.810
 that now fox decided the rights to one 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.910
 you would bake the bread to software llc or 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.200
 some other dribble, do not go walking 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.580
 complaining that the only option that 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.560
 you have to play with the simpsons in 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.340
 home format be for another 20 years 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.340
 this guy 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.510
 I
