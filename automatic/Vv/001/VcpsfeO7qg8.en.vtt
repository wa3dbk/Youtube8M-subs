well other than that like I uh I don't

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.840 
well other than that like I uh I don't
really<00:03:52.410> have<00:03:52.560> much<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.890> tell<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.220> but<00:03:53.430> they

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
really have much to tell you but they

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:02.830 
really have much to tell you but they
said<00:03:54.060> let's<00:03:54.180> get<00:03:54.330> onto<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.600> clouds

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.870 

Queens<00:04:03.840> hitting<00:04:04.230> absolutely<00:04:04.770> amazing<00:04:05.250> let's

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
Queens hitting absolutely amazing let's

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:18.349 
Queens hitting absolutely amazing let's
try<00:04:06.090> out<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.660> Joker<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.890> openings<00:04:17.670> on<00:04:17.940> both

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
try out the Joker the openings on both

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.860 
try out the Joker the openings on both
of<00:04:18.930> these<00:04:19.170> ports<00:04:19.700> are<00:04:20.700> roughly<00:04:21.600> around<00:04:21.720> the

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
of these ports are roughly around the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.530 
of these ports are roughly around the
same<00:04:21.930> if<00:04:22.260> not<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.740> same<00:04:23.120> but<00:04:24.120> it's<00:04:24.270> just<00:04:24.360> I

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
same if not the same but it's just I

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.170 
same if not the same but it's just I
have<00:04:24.870> a<00:04:24.900> resilience<00:04:25.710> under<00:04:25.890> here<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.700> caravan

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
have a resilience under here and caravan

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.180 
have a resilience under here and caravan
here<00:04:27.510> so<00:04:28.050> they're<00:04:28.290> roughly<00:04:28.500> go<00:04:28.650> hit

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
here so they're roughly go hit

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.070 
here so they're roughly go hit
differently<00:04:29.610> but<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:30.060> bet<00:04:30.360> if<00:04:30.480> I<00:04:30.600> throw<00:04:30.810> this

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
differently but I bet if I throw this

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.100 
differently but I bet if I throw this
you<00:04:31.440> know<00:04:32.130> Brazilian<00:04:32.880> there<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.870> probably

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
you know Brazilian there you probably

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.140 
you know Brazilian there you probably
have<00:04:34.350> a<00:04:34.380> wider<00:04:34.650> draw<00:04:34.950> if<00:04:35.490> that's<00:04:35.669> what<00:04:35.820> you're

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
have a wider draw if that's what you're

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.080 
have a wider draw if that's what you're
looking<00:04:36.510> for<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:37.130> other<00:04:38.130> than<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.430> this

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
looking for that is other than that this

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.640 
looking for that is other than that this
is<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.419> end<00:04:39.510> of<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.690> review<00:04:39.810> I'm<00:04:40.320> going<00:04:40.470> to

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
is the end of the review I'm going to

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.920 
is the end of the review I'm going to
end<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.860> video<00:04:41.070> with<00:04:41.640> both<00:04:41.940> hoses<00:04:42.240> like<00:04:42.720> a

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
end this video with both hoses like a

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.010 
end this video with both hoses like a
ninja<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.380> nunchucks
