00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
example to actually come to fruition I

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.880 
example to actually come to fruition I
would<00:00:51.600> place<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> bride<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> groom<00:00:52.590> at<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
distance from each other I'd say okay

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479 
distance from each other I'd say okay
guys<00:00:54.360> come<00:00:54.719> together<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.500> walk<00:00:55.860> towards<00:00:56.340> me

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
guys come together then walk towards me

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
guys come together then walk towards me
and<00:00:56.640> now<00:00:56.879> maybe<00:00:57.270> say<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> bride<00:00:57.780> throw

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and now maybe say to the bride throw

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.139 
and now maybe say to the bride throw
your<00:00:58.379> arm<00:00:58.530> around<00:00:58.680> his<00:00:58.980> neck<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> groom

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

throw your arm around her neck however

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.860 
throw your arm around her neck however
it<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.940> moment<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.480> then

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it was going in that moment and then

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
it was going in that moment and then
they<00:01:03.989> would<00:01:04.140> walk<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.589> me<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.129> would<00:01:05.250> pan

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
they would walk to me and I would pan

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.560 
they would walk to me and I would pan
backwards<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.210> them

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
backwards with them

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420 
backwards with them
now<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.110> would<00:01:07.260> happen<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.860> between<00:01:08.280> this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
now what would happen in between this

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.980 
now what would happen in between this
time<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:09.090> they're<00:01:09.270> not<00:01:09.420> professional

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
time is because they're not professional

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.750 
time is because they're not professional
models<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.650> would<00:01:10.770> probably<00:01:11.159> walk<00:01:11.369> towards

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
models they would probably walk towards

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.950 
models they would probably walk towards
each<00:01:11.850> other<00:01:11.970> throw<00:01:12.270> their<00:01:12.420> arms<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:12.869> each

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
each other throw their arms or at each

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
each other throw their arms or at each
other<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.320> during<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.890> time<00:01:14.189> something

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
other and during this time something

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.330 
other and during this time something
would<00:01:15.270> happen<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.869> depending<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:16.890> how<00:01:17.130> they

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
would happen and depending on how they

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.070 
would happen and depending on how they
love<00:01:17.610> their<00:01:18.000> emotions<00:01:18.600> would<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.869> very

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
love their emotions would be very

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.580 
love their emotions would be very
different

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
