00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you're up to and telling them what

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.709 
you're up to and telling them what
you're<00:00:49.920> doing<00:00:50.280> usually<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.570> actually

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
you're doing usually when you actually

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.510 
you're doing usually when you actually
do<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.199> there's<00:00:52.649> actually<00:00:52.949> sort<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.280> set

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
do this there's actually sort of a set

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.920 
do this there's actually sort of a set
character<00:00:53.969> limit<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.510> guys<00:00:54.690> can

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
character limit that you guys can

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.930 
character limit that you guys can
actually<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.550> think<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.850> about

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
actually go to and so I think it's about

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.209 
actually go to and so I think it's about
30<00:00:57.329> characters<00:00:57.750> may<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.410> shorting<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.039> about

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
30 characters may be shorting out about

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.580 
30 characters may be shorting out about
15<00:00:59.670> along<00:01:00.239> those<00:01:00.420> lines<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:00.960> basically<00:01:01.469> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
15 along those lines but basically you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.840 
15 along those lines but basically you
can<00:01:01.739> only<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> certain<00:01:02.430> amount<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
can only get a certain amount of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
can only get a certain amount of
characters<00:01:02.930> now<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.170> video<00:01:04.439> I'm

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
characters now in this video I'm

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.539 
characters now in this video I'm
actually<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:04.949> showing<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.280> guys<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
actually going to be showing you guys a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.130 
actually going to be showing you guys a
cool<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:05.909> trick<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.689> guys<00:01:06.900> can

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
cool little trick that you guys can

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.630 
cool little trick that you guys can
actually<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.860> order<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.220> actually<00:01:08.340> get

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
actually do in order to actually get

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.330 
actually do in order to actually get
basically<00:01:09.119> unlimited<00:01:09.720> text<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.979> do

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
basically unlimited text on there I do

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.920 
basically unlimited text on there I do
believe<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.880> does<00:01:12.090> work<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:12.780> Apple

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260 
believe this does work on all Apple
devices<00:01:13.439> I'm<00:01:13.830> pretty<00:01:14.430> sure<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> does<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.000> work

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
devices I'm pretty sure it does not work

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
devices I'm pretty sure it does not work
on<00:01:15.450> Android<00:01:15.720> devices<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.740> any<00:01:16.920> guys<00:01:17.100> when
