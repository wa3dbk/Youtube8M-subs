00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
on high for about 30 seconds I love

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.719 
on high for about 30 seconds I love
cooking<00:01:16.749> vegetables<00:01:17.320> in<00:01:17.469> the<00:01:17.590> microwave

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
cooking vegetables in the microwave

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.849 
cooking vegetables in the microwave
because<00:01:18.729> it's<00:01:19.210> really<00:01:19.479> fast<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.229> easy<00:01:20.439> and

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
because it's really fast and easy and

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.429 
because it's really fast and easy and
because<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.789> helps<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.630> vegetables<00:01:23.259> to

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
because it helps the vegetables to

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.090 
because it helps the vegetables to
retain<00:01:23.710> all<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:24.039> its<00:01:24.159> nutrients

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
retain all of its nutrients

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.190 
retain all of its nutrients
if<00:01:25.400> we<00:01:25.580> had<00:01:25.700> boils<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.330> vegetable<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:26.900> water

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
if we had boils the vegetable and water

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.560 
if we had boils the vegetable and water
some<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.310> water-soluble<00:01:28.760> vitamins<00:01:29.360> with

some of the water-soluble vitamins with

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
microwave works though by vibrating the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.330 
microwave works though by vibrating the
molecules<00:01:35.420> inside<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.080> vegetable<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.130> in<00:01:37.250> a

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
molecules inside the vegetable so in a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.040 
molecules inside the vegetable so in a
size<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.910> vegetable<00:01:38.330> actually<00:01:38.690> steams

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
size the vegetable actually steams

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.230 
size the vegetable actually steams
itself<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.100> none<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.729> nutrients<00:01:41.180> are

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
itself and none of the nutrients are

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.870 
itself and none of the nutrients are
lost<00:01:42.190> let's<00:01:43.190> check<00:01:43.400> on<00:01:43.550> our<00:01:43.580> salmon<00:01:45.700> just<00:01:46.700> a

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
lost let's check on our salmon just a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.670 
lost let's check on our salmon just a
little<00:01:47.330> bit<00:01:47.509> longer

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:59.200 

sure<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.370> gets<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.730> side

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.430 

we'll<00:02:00.200> use<00:02:00.230> fresh<00:02:00.740> plate<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:02.810> retrieve<00:02:03.230> our

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
we'll use fresh plate to retrieve our

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.619 
we'll use fresh plate to retrieve our
salmon

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.640 

art

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.440 

now<00:02:12.650> it's<00:02:12.860> not<00:02:13.010> quite<00:02:13.250> cooked<00:02:13.610> as<00:02:13.879> you<00:02:14.060> can<00:02:14.209> see

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
now it's not quite cooked as you can see

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.949 
now it's not quite cooked as you can see
but<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:14.989> does<00:02:15.110> have<00:02:15.349> that<00:02:15.530> nice<00:02:15.799> crisp<00:02:16.370> outside

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
but it does have that nice crisp outside

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.270 
but it does have that nice crisp outside
so<00:02:17.959> what<00:02:18.109> we're<00:02:18.260> going<00:02:18.409> to<00:02:18.500> do<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.980> finish

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
so what we're going to do is finish

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.209 
so what we're going to do is finish
cooking<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.939> salmon<00:02:20.120> in<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.750> microwave<00:02:21.219> if

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:22.219 
cooking the salmon in the microwave if

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.800 
cooking the salmon in the microwave if
we<00:02:22.370> finished<00:02:22.730> cooking<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:23.299> salmon<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
we finished cooking the salmon on the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.869 
we finished cooking the salmon on the
grill<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.890> would<00:02:25.010> actually<00:02:25.189> cause<00:02:25.579> it<00:02:25.609> to

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
grill it would actually cause it to

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.589 
grill it would actually cause it to
become<00:02:26.000> tough<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.870> outside<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:28.599> by

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
become tough on the outside but by

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.660 
become tough on the outside but by
cooking<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:30.019> in<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.260> microwave<00:02:30.620> well<00:02:31.370> cook<00:02:31.549> it

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
cooking it in the microwave well cook it

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.729 
cooking it in the microwave well cook it
from<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.970> inside<00:02:32.420> out<00:02:32.629> and<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.379> will<00:02:33.470> keep<00:02:33.620> it

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
from the inside out and it will keep it

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.910 
from the inside out and it will keep it
