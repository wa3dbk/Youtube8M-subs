we're repeating four chords like that
four<00:02:28.049> times<00:02:28.290> what<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.129> have<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.810> what<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.900> jazz

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
four times what we have is what in jazz

we're going to be looping going to be
vamping<00:02:51.280> on<00:02:51.370> these<00:02:51.580> four<00:02:51.820> chords<00:02:52.090> got<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.720> make

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
vamping on these four chords got to make

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.590 
vamping on these four chords got to make
it<00:02:52.960> last<00:02:53.080> 16<00:02:53.590> bars<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.460> that's<00:02:54.880> pretty<00:02:55.060> easy<00:02:55.150> if

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
it last 16 bars so that's pretty easy if

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:11.530 
it last 16 bars so that's pretty easy if
we<00:02:55.810> imagine<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.380> bar<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.100> 1<00:02:57.520> 2<00:02:57.910> 3<00:02:58.240> 4<00:02:58.750> 2<00:02:59.110> 2<00:02:59.140> 3<00:02:59.560> 4

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.060 

not<00:03:12.540> particularly<00:03:12.930> jazzy<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.620> what<00:03:13.800> we<00:03:13.920> could

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
not particularly jazzy so what we could

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.860 
not particularly jazzy so what we could
do<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.250> put<00:03:14.280> something<00:03:14.790> like<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.940> scribe<00:03:15.300> basin

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
do is put something like a scribe basin

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.080 
do is put something like a scribe basin
and<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.310> fairly<00:03:17.430> sick<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:17.880> looks

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
and this is fairly sick this looks

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:27.190 
and this is fairly sick this looks
clever<00:03:18.480> but<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:18.870> it's<00:03:18.960> not<00:03:19.080> too<00:03:19.260> complicated

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.510 

what<00:03:28.200> I'm<00:03:28.260> doing<00:03:28.500> there<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.830> really<00:03:29.130> simple

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
what I'm doing there is really simple

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.830 
what I'm doing there is really simple
just<00:03:29.990> stabbing<00:03:30.990> the<00:03:31.080> core<00:03:31.320> in<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> right<00:03:35.840> and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
just stabbing the core in the right and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.330 
just stabbing the core in the right and
in<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.080> left<00:03:37.320> I'm<00:03:37.530> doing<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:37.800> stride<00:03:38.070> base

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
in the left I'm doing a stride base

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.650 
in the left I'm doing a stride base
which<00:03:38.580> means<00:03:38.820> hitting<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:41.820> first<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.360> fifth

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
which means hitting the first and fifth

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.770 
which means hitting the first and fifth
in<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.650> base<00:03:44.450> along<00:03:45.450> with<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.720> chord<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.540> an

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
in the base along with the chord so an

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.849 
in the base along with the chord so an
e-flat<00:03:49.080> destroyed

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:04:10.270 

'if<00:03:52.859> let's<00:03:53.250> be<00:03:54.239> flirts

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.800 

very<00:04:11.280> simple<00:04:11.670> if<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:12.000> want<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.210> vary<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.720> to

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
very simple if you want to vary it to

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.360 
very simple if you want to vary it to
make<00:04:12.960> you<00:04:13.080> out<00:04:13.200> your<00:04:13.350> 16<00:04:13.770> bars<00:04:13.980> lasts<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.340> bit

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
make you out your 16 bars lasts a bit

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:52.050 
make you out your 16 bars lasts a bit
longer<00:04:14.520> you<00:04:14.880> can<00:04:15.030> do<00:04:15.120> all<00:04:15.180> kinds<00:04:15.240> of<00:04:15.600> things

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.260 

okay<00:04:52.660> so<00:04:52.720> that's<00:04:52.900> 16<00:04:53.350> bars<00:04:53.560> done<00:04:53.920> yeah<00:04:54.280> very

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
okay so that's 16 bars done yeah very

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.790 
okay so that's 16 bars done yeah very
simple<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:56.130> so<00:04:57.180> points<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.270> take<00:04:58.420> away<00:04:58.800> don't

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
simple and so points to take away don't

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.530 
simple and so points to take away don't
worry<00:04:59.980> about<00:05:00.160> looping<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:00.910> four<00:05:01.090> bar<00:05:01.240> chord

worry about looping a four bar chord

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.580 
worry about looping a four bar chord
sequence<00:05:01.930> that's<00:05:02.110> absolutely<00:05:02.560> fine<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:04.590> just

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
sequence that's absolutely fine and just

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.710 
sequence that's absolutely fine and just
think<00:05:05.770> about<00:05:05.860> varying<00:05:06.640> the<00:05:06.790> movement<00:05:07.240> to<00:05:07.600> keep

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
think about varying the movement to keep

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.260 
think about varying the movement to keep
it<00:05:07.870> interesting<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.410> exciting<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.940> that's<00:05:10.150> an

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
it interesting and exciting so that's an

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.240 
it interesting and exciting so that's an
example<00:05:10.360> of<00:05:10.690> a<00:05:10.780> jazz<00:05:10.960> one<00:05:11.170> you<00:05:11.290> can<00:05:11.470> use<00:05:14.250> kind

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
example of a jazz one you can use kind

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.810 
example of a jazz one you can use kind
