00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
if you run into the same problem now

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.730 
if you run into the same problem now
fold<00:01:47.880> each<00:01:48.119> paper<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.600> half<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.990> run<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> bone

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
fold each paper in half and run a bone

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.270 
fold each paper in half and run a bone
folder<00:01:49.950> along<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> edge<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.030> flatten<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:55.280> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
folder along the edge to flatten it the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.639 
folder along the edge to flatten it the
step<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.820> take<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> while<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.780> maybe<00:01:58.110> pop<00:01:58.439> in

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
step can take a while so maybe pop in

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.020 
step can take a while so maybe pop in
your<00:01:58.770> favorite<00:01:59.159> movie<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.610> fold<00:02:00.180> away<00:02:02.030> now

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
your favorite movie and fold away now

your favorite movie and fold away now
stack<00:02:03.390> them<00:02:03.600> all<00:02:03.780> into<00:02:04.170> groups<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.590> four<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
stack them all into groups of four to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.350 
stack them all into groups of four to
make<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> total<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.850> 23<00:02:06.360> signatures

if you run into the same problem with
the<00:02:14.750> glue<00:02:14.989> on<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.170> paper<00:02:15.379> just<00:02:15.920> stack<00:02:16.250> the

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
the glue on the paper just stack the

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.699 
the glue on the paper just stack the
signature<00:02:16.939> so<00:02:17.269> it's<00:02:17.540> aligned<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.200> trim<00:02:18.560> about

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
signature so it's aligned and trim about

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.399 
signature so it's aligned and trim about
1/8<00:02:19.189> of<00:02:19.310> an<00:02:19.459> inch<00:02:19.549> off<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.060> end<00:02:20.239> repeat<00:02:21.170> that

covered<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.050> I'm<00:04:26.229> going<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.590> glue<00:04:26.740> them<00:04:26.979> to

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
covered and I'm going to glue them to

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.550

this<00:04:27.370> final<00:04:27.669> material<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.870> can<00:04:29.020> also<00:04:29.200> use

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
this final material you can also use

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.790 
this final material you can also use
other<00:04:29.830> fabric<00:04:30.280> for<00:04:30.460> this<00:04:30.550> if<00:04:30.789> you'd<00:04:31.090> like<00:04:31.270> on

that PVA doesn't work on the smooth side
of<00:05:29.740> vinyl<00:05:30.070> so<00:05:30.400> try<00:05:30.760> one<00:05:31.000> of<00:05:31.030> these<00:05:31.210> glues

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
of vinyl so try one of these glues

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.780

it<00:05:41.230> so<00:05:41.620> it<00:05:41.740> dries<00:05:42.010> flat<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:42.669> I<00:05:43.060> usually<00:05:43.480> like

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
it so it dries flat and I usually like

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.520 
it so it dries flat and I usually like
to<00:05:43.810> let<00:05:43.930> it<00:05:43.960> dry<00:05:44.230> overnight

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
to let it dry overnight

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.200 
to let it dry overnight
now<00:05:47.530> let's<00:05:47.800> mark<00:05:48.100> the<00:05:48.220> binding<00:05:48.520> holes<00:05:48.700> on<00:05:48.970> the

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
now let's mark the binding holes on the

now let's mark the binding holes on the
