okay<00:00:04.360> this<00:00:04.510> next<00:00:04.540> video<00:00:04.990> is<00:00:05.050> going<00:00:05.230> to<00:00:05.410> be

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.470 
okay this next video is going to be

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.679 
okay this next video is going to be
about<00:00:05.710> double<00:00:05.980> soon<00:00:06.399> but<00:00:07.060> it's<00:00:07.180> also<00:00:07.330> going<00:00:07.630> to

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:07.689 
about double soon but it's also going to

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.630 
about double soon but it's also going to
include<00:00:07.930> an<00:00:08.140> easy-to-learn<00:00:08.650> CEO<00:00:09.190> a<00:00:09.280> little

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:09.640 
include an easy-to-learn CEO a little

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.300 
include an easy-to-learn CEO a little
which<00:00:10.360> if<00:00:10.690> not<00:00:10.900> you<00:00:11.050> use<00:00:11.200> it<00:00:11.350> for<00:00:11.470> the<00:00:11.560> CLL<00:00:12.100> case

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.310 
which if not you use it for the CLL case

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.820 
which if not you use it for the CLL case
you<00:00:12.730> can<00:00:12.880> use<00:00:13.060> it<00:00:13.240> to<00:00:13.840> perform<00:00:14.020> the<00:00:14.380> algorithm

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
you can use it to perform the algorithm

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.490 
you can use it to perform the algorithm
from<00:00:15.370> this<00:00:15.790> angle<00:00:16.150> so<00:00:16.299> this<00:00:16.630> algorithm<00:00:17.170> can<00:00:17.320> be

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
from this angle so this algorithm can be

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.099 
from this angle so this algorithm can be
performed<00:00:18.010> from<00:00:18.160> any<00:00:18.429> angle<00:00:18.609> so<00:00:19.509> to<00:00:19.570> say<00:00:19.900> when

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
performed from any angle so to say when

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.710 
performed from any angle so to say when
you<00:00:20.199> finish<00:00:20.560> you're<00:00:21.039> after<00:00:21.189> up<00:00:21.460> here<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:22.029> you

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
you finish you're after up here and you

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.689 
you finish you're after up here and you
get<00:00:22.869> the<00:00:23.019> case<00:00:23.199> from<00:00:23.439> this<00:00:23.589> angle<00:00:23.800> you<00:00:24.160> don't

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
get the case from this angle you don't

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.829 
get the case from this angle you don't
have<00:00:24.909> to<00:00:25.060> do<00:00:25.210> the<00:00:25.720> Y<00:00:26.079> or<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.589> U<00:00:27.009> or<00:00:27.400> whatever

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839 
have to do the Y or the U or whatever

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.450 
have to do the Y or the U or whatever
you<00:00:28.839> can<00:00:29.050> still<00:00:29.589> perform<00:00:29.739> it<00:00:30.009> from<00:00:30.159> this<00:00:30.279> angle

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
you can still perform it from this angle

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.190 
you can still perform it from this angle
any<00:00:30.759> you<00:00:30.880> can<00:00:31.029> there<00:00:31.179> and<00:00:31.390> there<00:00:31.539> Co<00:00:31.779> a<00:00:31.900> little

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
any you can there and there Co a little

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.380 
any you can there and there Co a little
algorithm<00:00:32.650> is<00:00:33.010> just<00:00:33.070> as<00:00:33.610> fast<00:00:33.850> if<00:00:34.090> not<00:00:34.180> faster

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
algorithm is just as fast if not faster

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.439 
algorithm is just as fast if not faster
than<00:00:34.870> normal<00:00:35.230> algorithm<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:37.000> we'll<00:00:37.300> go

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
than normal algorithm so we'll go

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.410 
than normal algorithm so we'll go
through<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:37.899> normal<00:00:38.699> double<00:00:39.699> soon<00:00:39.969> algorithm

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
through the normal double soon algorithm

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.139 
through the normal double soon algorithm
a<00:00:40.480> couple<00:00:40.719> of<00:00:40.809> twice<00:00:41.710> so<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.070> can<00:00:42.340> follow

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
a couple of twice so you can follow

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.910 
a couple of twice so you can follow
along<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.510> then<00:00:43.629> we'll<00:00:43.719> move<00:00:43.840> on<00:00:44.019> to<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.320> CLO

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
along and then we'll move on to the CLO

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.560 
along and then we'll move on to the CLO
and<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:46.750> you<00:00:46.840> look<00:00:46.989> for<00:00:48.390> apart<00:00:49.390> from<00:00:49.420> the

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
and what you look for apart from the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.049 
and what you look for apart from the
headlights<00:00:50.019> on<00:00:50.199> either<00:00:50.320> side<00:00:50.679> if<00:00:50.980> you<00:00:51.760> want<00:00:51.969> to

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
headlights on either side if you want to

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.220 
headlights on either side if you want to
know<00:00:52.179> if<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.570> corners<00:00:52.899> are<00:00:52.960> going<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.170> be

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
know if the corners are going to be

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.889 
know if the corners are going to be
permuted<00:00:53.559> or<00:00:53.800> not<00:00:53.949> is<00:00:54.399> your<00:00:54.820> cystic<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.539> pair<00:00:55.750> at

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
permuted or not is your cystic a pair at

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.529 
permuted or not is your cystic a pair at
the<00:00:55.929> back<00:00:56.170> orange<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.219> orange<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.730> then

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
the back orange and orange and then

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.329 
the back orange and orange and then
you'll<00:00:58.809> see<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.019> sticker<00:00:59.289> pair<00:00:59.589> at<00:00:59.710> front<00:01:00.100> read

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
you'll see a sticker pair at front read

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.250 
you'll see a sticker pair at front read
and<00:01:00.489> write<00:01:00.640> but<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.059> could<00:01:01.210> be<00:01:01.329> any<00:01:01.570> different

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
and write but it could be any different

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.410 
and write but it could be any different
colors<00:01:02.530> like<00:01:03.219> blue<00:01:03.429> and<00:01:03.640> blue<00:01:03.789> and<00:01:04.089> then<00:01:04.210> there

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
colors like blue and blue and then there

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.440 
colors like blue and blue and then there
could<00:01:04.510> be<00:01:04.629> green<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:04.960> green<00:01:05.170> order<00:01:05.759> so<00:01:06.759> the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
could be green and green order so the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.480 
could be green and green order so the
algorithm<00:01:07.960> for<00:01:08.140> this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:10.560> hunt<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:12.310> there's

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
algorithm for this is hunt and there's

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.450 
algorithm for this is hunt and there's

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
as this CLL what you look for is like in

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
this case if this nigga pair is at the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.500 
this case if this nigga pair is at the
back<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.350> in<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.470> front<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:24.180> can<00:02:25.180> just<00:02:25.360> do

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
back and in the front you can just do

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.550 
back and in the front you can just do
the<00:02:25.660> normal<00:02:26.160> algorithm<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:29.200> get<00:02:29.410> an

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
the normal algorithm and you get an

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.590 
the normal algorithm and you get an
edges<00:02:30.990> /<00:02:31.990> muted<00:02:32.290> case<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:34.180> exactly<00:02:34.480> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
edges / muted case so the exactly the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.350 
edges / muted case so the exactly the
same<00:02:34.840> thing<00:02:35.080> applies<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.730> algorithm<00:02:37.180> from

same thing applies to the algorithm from

same thing applies to the algorithm from
this<00:02:37.570> angle<00:02:37.720> if<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.290> get<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.680> headlights

from<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.310> right<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.820> left

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
from the right and left

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.060 
from the right and left
yeah<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.020> sticker<00:02:41.290> pair<00:02:41.560> at<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.680> back<00:02:41.860> and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
yeah the sticker pair at the back and

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.190 
yeah the sticker pair at the back and
stick<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.430> pair<00:02:42.640> at<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.760> front<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.810> if<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:43.990> see

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
stick a pair at the front so if you see

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.860 
stick a pair at the front so if you see
this<00:02:44.410> let's<00:02:45.040> take<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.250> pair<00:02:45.430> on<00:02:45.460> either<00:02:45.700> side<00:02:46.030> if
