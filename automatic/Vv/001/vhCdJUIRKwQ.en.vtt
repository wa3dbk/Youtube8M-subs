00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
constraints in blender so before I get

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.210 
constraints in blender so before I get
started<00:00:06.899> please<00:00:07.379> comment<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:07.950> rate<00:00:08.069> this

go to this tab right here and as you can
see<00:00:23.910> there's<00:00:24.240> add<00:00:24.390> constraints<00:00:25.170> right<00:00:25.320> here

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
see there's add constraints right here

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.099 
see there's add constraints right here
so<00:00:26.039> there's<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.430> bunch<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.730> stuff<00:00:26.789> here<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.930> I'm

can make um this a child of another

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.160 
can make um this a child of another
object<00:00:36.000> which<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.660> pretty<00:00:36.960> much<00:00:37.110> like

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
object which is pretty much like

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.770 
object which is pretty much like
parenting<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.370> actually<00:00:38.550> exactly<00:00:39.270> like

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
parenting it's actually exactly like

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.900 
parenting it's actually exactly like
parenting<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.250> use<00:00:41.489> certain

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
parenting but you can use certain

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.700 
parenting but you can use certain
channels<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> make<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.500> only<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.570> x-axis

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
channels and make it only on the x-axis

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.580 
channels and make it only on the x-axis
all<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.899> just<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.020> bunch<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.350> stuff

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
all that you know just a bunch of stuff

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.819 
all that you know just a bunch of stuff
you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.739> only<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.610> scale<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:52.140> same<00:00:52.410> on

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you can only have the scale the same on

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.209 
you can only have the scale the same on
the<00:00:53.100> z<00:00:53.280> axis<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> rotation<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.300> same<00:00:54.600> 11

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
the z axis of the rotation the same 11

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.240 
the z axis of the rotation the same 11
CSS<00:00:56.219> location<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> y-axis<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:59.129> all

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
CSS location on the y-axis you do all

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.069 
CSS location on the y-axis you do all
that<00:00:59.370> stuff<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.850> change<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> influence<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that stuff and change the influence so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.450 
that stuff and change the influence so
if<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.350> get<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> little<00:01:01.800> bit<00:01:01.949> more<00:01:02.160> control

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
if you get a little bit more control

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
if you get a little bit more control
here<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.110> convenient

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
here but it's a little more convenient

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.090 
here but it's a little more convenient
the<00:01:05.040> other<00:01:05.189> way<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:07.189> transformation<00:01:08.270> you<00:01:09.270> can

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
the other way so transformation you can

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.140 
the other way so transformation you can
transfer<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> object<00:01:12.710> make<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.369> this

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
transfer have a object make the this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.080 
transfer have a object make the this
object<00:01:15.960> transform<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.860> if<00:01:16.979> I'll<00:01:17.130> ever<00:01:17.159> love

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
object transform like if I'll ever love

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.480 
object transform like if I'll ever love
a<00:01:18.150> cube<00:01:18.479> yeah<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.619> cube<00:01:20.570> 0001<00:01:21.570> add<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
a cube yeah this is cube 0001 add a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.990 
a cube yeah this is cube 0001 add a
transformation<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.030> add<00:01:24.290> few<00:01:26.000> then

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
transformation here and I add few then

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.649 
transformation here and I add few then
you<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.220> it's<00:01:29.220> parented<00:01:30.180> by<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.479> little

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you know it's parented by that little

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
you know it's parented by that little
line<00:01:30.930> right<00:01:30.960> there<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.670> change

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
line right there and you can change

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.410 
line right there and you can change
certain<00:01:34.070> transformations<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.790> but

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
certain transformations with this but

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.480 
certain transformations with this but
you're<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.659> snotty<00:01:36.900> necessary<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.310> is

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you're not snotty necessary now this is

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.630 
you're not snotty necessary now this is
funny<00:01:39.020> copy<00:01:40.020> location<00:01:40.259> does<00:01:41.040> exactly<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.490> it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
funny copy location does exactly what it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.149 
funny copy location does exactly what it
does<00:01:41.790> copies<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> little<00:01:42.600> location<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
does copies a little location of the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.060 
does copies a little location of the
object<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.759> type<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.890> that's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
object that you type in here so that's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.920 
object that you type in here so that's
simple

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
simple

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.860 
simple
we'll<00:01:49.590> copy<00:01:49.950> rotation<00:01:50.160> coffee<00:01:50.940> scale<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
we'll copy rotation coffee scale you

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.240 
we'll copy rotation coffee scale you
know<00:01:52.020> same<00:01:52.230> thing<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.890> change<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
know same thing you can change the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.700 
know same thing you can change the
influence<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:54.000> how<00:01:54.390> much<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.720> want<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.080> sbux

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
influence of how much you want the sbux

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.690 
influence of how much you want the sbux
to<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.010> oh<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.500> limit<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.830> location<00:01:59.490> you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
to do oh you can limit the location you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.490 
to do oh you can limit the location you
can<00:02:00.330> only<00:02:00.540> go<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.650> let's<00:02:01.950> say<00:02:02.010> I<00:02:02.130> put<00:02:02.400> oh<00:02:03.500> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
can only go like let's say I put oh the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.350 
can only go like let's say I put oh the
minimum<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.270> 111<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.780> max<00:02:07.080> is<00:02:07.320> 5<00:02:08.450> 55<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
minimum is 111 and the max is 5 55 and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.809 
minimum is 111 and the max is 5 55 and
you<00:02:12.360> only<00:02:12.510> move<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.930> out<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:13.800> far<00:02:14.600> okay

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.110 

now<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:18.659> a<00:02:18.689> rotation<00:02:19.310> limit<00:02:20.310> scale<00:02:20.849> and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
now with a rotation limit scale and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.720 
now with a rotation limit scale and
limit<00:02:21.390> distance<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.959> same<00:02:22.049> thing<00:02:22.730> track

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
limit distance is the same thing track

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.750 
limit distance is the same thing track
oh<00:02:24.030> sorry<00:02:25.730> track<00:02:26.730> two

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
oh sorry track two

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.699 
oh sorry track two
let's<00:02:29.390> say<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.540> want<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.959> track<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.680> the

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
let's say I want this track to the

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.350 
let's say I want this track to the
camera<00:02:31.599> epic<00:02:32.599> camera<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:34.129> now<00:02:34.670> being<00:02:35.209> with

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
camera epic camera and now being with

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.860 
camera epic camera and now being with
the<00:02:35.450> camera<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.790> follows<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.329> Emma<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:38.810> is

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
the camera it follows it Emma this is

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.780 
the camera it follows it Emma this is
cool<00:02:39.200> when<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.769> work<00:02:39.950> with<00:02:39.980> eyes<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.670> can

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
cool when you work with eyes you can

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.399 
cool when you work with eyes you can
make<00:02:40.939> eyes<00:02:41.120> track<00:02:41.540> to<00:02:41.689> the<00:02:41.720> camera<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:42.290> it's

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
make eyes track to the camera so it's

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.410 
make eyes track to the camera so it's
always<00:02:42.530> looking<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.040> camera<00:02:43.430> it's

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
always looking to the camera it's

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.800 
always looking to the camera it's
certain<00:02:45.230> things<00:02:45.500> like<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:46.329> floor<00:02:47.329> this<00:02:47.659> is

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
certain things like that floor this is

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.140 
certain things like that floor this is
cool<00:02:48.049> thing<00:02:48.819> let's<00:02:49.819> say<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.329> had<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.569> plane<00:02:52.150> scale

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
cool thing let's say I had a plane scale

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.759 
cool thing let's say I had a plane scale
that<00:02:53.269> up<00:02:53.530> pull<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.680> down<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:57.319> want<00:02:57.560> a

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
that up pull that down and I want a

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.559 
that up pull that down and I want a
certain<00:02:58.370> either<00:02:58.609> three<00:02:58.939> after<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.269> floor

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
certain either three after the floor

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.119 
certain either three after the floor
just<00:02:59.989> type<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.760> plane<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:03.319> turn<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:03.829> off<00:03:03.920> you

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
just type in plane and turn it off you

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.640 
just type in plane and turn it off you
only<00:03:04.310> go<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.609> far<00:03:04.790> down<00:03:04.849> and<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.480> I<00:03:05.810> think<00:03:06.440> I

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
only go so far down and it I think I

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.920 
only go so far down and it I think I
don't<00:03:07.069> know<00:03:07.190> maybe<00:03:07.760> if<00:03:07.970> we<00:03:08.090> put<00:03:08.299> on<00:03:08.450> bounds<00:03:08.810> and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
don't know maybe if we put on bounds and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.250 
don't know maybe if we put on bounds and
changes<00:03:09.319> no<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.359> matters<00:03:11.750> on<00:03:12.019> where<00:03:12.170> the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
changes no so it matters on where the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.930 
changes no so it matters on where the
center<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.590> gravity<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.370> right<00:03:13.670> now<00:03:13.700> it's

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
center of gravity is and right now it's

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.300 
center of gravity is and right now it's
in<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.090> middle<00:03:14.239> stuff<00:03:14.599> that's<00:03:14.870> gzone<00:03:15.290> it's<00:03:16.190> at

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
in the middle stuff that's gzone it's at

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.390 
in the middle stuff that's gzone it's at
the<00:03:16.400> bottom<00:03:16.549> have<00:03:17.680> put<00:03:18.680> down<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.280> can

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
the bottom have put down and you can

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.729 
the bottom have put down and you can
only<00:03:19.609> go<00:03:20.019> down<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.230> what<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:21.440> center<00:03:21.709> of

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
only go down to what the center of

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.180 
only go down to what the center of
gravity<00:03:22.389> so<00:03:23.389> you<00:03:24.260> know<00:03:24.379> all<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.829> do<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.040> much

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
gravity so you know all I can do so much

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.020 
gravity so you know all I can do so much
there

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.490 

so<00:03:30.630> I'm<00:03:30.690> discover

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:47.790 

go<00:03:34.100> eat<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.430> line<00:03:34.820> right<00:03:34.970> here<00:03:35.030> fix<00:03:35.990> this<00:03:36.140> guy

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.950 

ok<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.470> lose<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.650> their<00:03:51.570> lower<00:03:52.570> there's

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
ok so to lose that their lower there's

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.960 
ok so to lose that their lower there's
follow<00:03:53.230> track<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.830> fall<00:03:54.010> path<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.640> all

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
follow track and fall path and all

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.050 
follow track and fall path and all
there's<00:03:55.570> all<00:03:56.050> this<00:03:56.200> different<00:03:56.380> stuff<00:03:56.850> but<00:03:57.850> a

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
there's all this different stuff but a

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.820 
there's all this different stuff but a
really<00:03:58.450> cool<00:03:58.720> one<00:03:58.900> for<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.200> game<00:03:59.350> engine<00:03:59.680> is

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
really cool one for the game engine is

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.880 
really cool one for the game engine is
rigid<00:04:00.190> body<00:04:00.370> joint<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.560> i'll<00:04:02.560> show<00:04:02.590> you

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
rigid body joint and i'll show you

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.950 
rigid body joint and i'll show you
exactly<00:04:03.310> what<00:04:03.490> that<00:04:03.640> so<00:04:04.120> first<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:04.810> gotta

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
exactly what that so first you gotta

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.320 
exactly what that so first you gotta
follow<00:04:05.080> what<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.320> do<00:04:05.640> so<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:06.700> want<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.180> take

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
follow what I do so you want to take

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.490 
follow what I do so you want to take
this<00:04:07.450> cube<00:04:07.810> or<00:04:08.380> should<00:04:08.650> be<00:04:09.720> press<00:04:10.720> X<00:04:10.930> took<00:04:11.380> on

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
this cube or should be press X took on

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.430 
this cube or should be press X took on
the<00:04:11.620> x<00:04:11.740> axis<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.370> press<00:04:13.090> ctrl<00:04:13.240> I'm<00:04:14.110> actually

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
the x axis and press ctrl I'm actually

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.340 
the x axis and press ctrl I'm actually
I'm<00:04:14.740> actually<00:04:15.010> gonna<00:04:15.310> turn<00:04:15.670> this<00:04:15.790> first<00:04:16.090> one

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
I'm actually gonna turn this first one

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.320 
I'm actually gonna turn this first one
red<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.590> because<00:04:18.250> this<00:04:18.400> is<00:04:18.519> a<00:04:18.549> copy<00:04:18.850> of<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.180> in

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
red and because this is a copy of it in

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.170 
red and because this is a copy of it in
terms<00:04:19.420> right<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.900> first<00:04:20.620> ship<00:04:20.799> DX<00:04:21.220> again<00:04:21.820> or

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
terms right to first ship DX again or

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.160 
terms right to first ship DX again or
control<00:04:22.630> 50<00:04:25.830> X<00:04:26.830> or<00:04:27.190> control<00:04:27.870> over<00:04:28.870> them<00:04:28.990> you're

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
control 50 X or control over them you're

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.310 
control 50 X or control over them you're
from<00:04:29.320> it<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:30.340> now<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.610> have<00:04:30.700> four<00:04:31.240> cubes<00:04:31.930> this

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
from it so now you have four cubes this

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.310 
from it so now you have four cubes this
cube<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:33.400> 001<00:04:33.940> enter<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.750> name<00:04:34.930> right<00:04:35.110> here

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
cube that 001 enter the name right here

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.880 
cube that 001 enter the name right here
so<00:04:36.310> well<00:04:37.090> what<00:04:37.540> I'm<00:04:37.630> gonna<00:04:37.720> do<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.170> I'm<00:04:38.710> gonna

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
so well what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.450 
so well what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
have<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:40.480> joint<00:04:41.110> this<00:04:41.590> one<00:04:41.770> we<00:04:41.890> try<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.100> do<00:04:42.310> this

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
have a joint this one we try to do this

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.750 
have a joint this one we try to do this
one<00:04:42.730> this<00:04:43.090> one<00:04:43.330> this<00:04:43.660> one<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:44.950> one<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.640> this

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
one this one this one this one to this

we're<00:04:57.790> going<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:57.970> copy<00:04:58.180> that<00:04:58.620> control<00:04:59.620> C<00:05:00.010> we're

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
we're going to copy that control C we're

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.210 
we're going to copy that control C we're
gonna<00:05:00.730> show<00:05:01.090> pivot<00:05:01.450> and<00:05:01.660> there's<00:05:01.960> that<00:05:02.530> little

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
gonna show pivot and there's that little

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.909 
gonna show pivot and there's that little
thing<00:05:03.580> right<00:05:03.760> there<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:05.020> see<00:05:05.200> so<00:05:05.680> we're<00:05:05.800> going

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
thing right there you see so we're going

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.800 
thing right there you see so we're going
to<00:05:05.980> change<00:05:06.100> that<00:05:06.250> have<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.120> move<00:05:07.330> along<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.660> x

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
to change that have a move along the x

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.880 
to change that have a move along the x
axis<00:05:08.910> right<00:05:09.910> there<00:05:10.120> so<00:05:10.900> it's<00:05:11.020> like<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.290> along

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
axis right there so it's like that along

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.410 
axis right there so it's like that along
right<00:05:12.580> here

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
right here

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.260 
right here
you'll<00:05:14.960> press<00:05:15.230> this<00:05:15.380> one<00:05:15.560> actor<00:05:15.890> string<00:05:16.270> rigid

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.120 
body joint two objects cube dot 401 and
it<00:05:22.910> probably<00:05:23.150> right<00:05:23.390> there<00:05:23.630> yes<00:05:24.080> it<00:05:24.290> is<00:05:24.380> so

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
it probably right there yes it is so

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.850 
it probably right there yes it is so
four<00:05:25.460> minus<00:05:25.580> two<00:05:25.760> x<00:05:26.090> for<00:05:26.300> each<00:05:26.390> one<00:05:26.770> do<00:05:27.770> the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
four minus two x for each one do the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.580 
four minus two x for each one do the
same<00:05:28.100> with<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.700> body<00:05:28.910> joint<00:05:30.280> q<00:05:31.420> dot<00:05:32.420> 0<00:05:32.630> 2<00:05:33.170> and

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
same with the body joint q dot 0 2 and

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.500 
same with the body joint q dot 0 2 and
that<00:05:33.740> means<00:05:34.010> this<00:05:34.220> one<00:05:34.430> just<00:05:34.760> handed<00:05:35.270> to<00:05:35.360> this

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
that means this one just handed to this

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.010 
that means this one just handed to this
one<00:05:35.690> this<00:05:35.870> one<00:05:36.080> is<00:05:36.110> to<00:05:36.350> this<00:05:36.530> one<00:05:36.680> yeah<00:05:37.000> dad<00:05:38.020> ok

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
one this one is to this one yeah dad ok

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.190 
one this one is to this one yeah dad ok
so<00:05:39.860> now<00:05:40.040> if<00:05:40.190> it<00:05:40.280> was<00:05:40.430> off<00:05:40.640> a<00:05:40.910> nothing<00:05:41.690> happens

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
so now if it was off a nothing happens

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:48.040 
so now if it was off a nothing happens
but<00:05:42.710> now<00:05:43.480> return<00:05:44.480> these<00:05:44.780> three<00:05:45.200> here<00:05:47.050> rigid

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
but now return these three here rigid

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.390 
but now return these three here rigid
bodies

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.040 

the<00:05:54.970> recipe

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
the recipe

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.529 
the recipe
then<00:05:57.680> they<00:05:57.979> react<00:05:58.190> and<00:05:58.400> there's<00:05:59.090> a<00:05:59.210> little

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
then they react and there's a little

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.020 
then they react and there's a little
joint<00:05:59.930> there<00:06:00.199> that<00:06:00.500> they<00:06:00.620> react<00:06:00.919> you<00:06:01.789> free

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
joint there that they react you free

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.700 
joint there that they react you free
sliding<00:06:02.360> for<00:06:02.720> you<00:06:02.780> so<00:06:03.020> you<00:06:03.110> can<00:06:03.199> see<00:06:03.379> it<00:06:03.470> better

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.140 

he<00:06:06.879> took<00:06:07.879> it<00:06:08.000> out<00:06:08.120> it's<00:06:08.690> cool<00:06:08.900> right<00:06:09.699> and<00:06:10.699> like

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
he took it out it's cool right and like

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.159 
he took it out it's cool right and like
