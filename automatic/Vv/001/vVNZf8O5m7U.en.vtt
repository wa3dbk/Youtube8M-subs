which<00:01:03.069> you<00:01:03.519> know<00:01:03.609> convert<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.059> a<00:01:04.150> very

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
which you know convert is a very

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.630 
which you know convert is a very
aggressive<00:01:04.600> setting<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.800> conversely<00:01:06.250> we

aggressive setting and conversely we
have<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.909> conservative<00:01:07.479> aspect<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.170> protect

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
have the conservative aspect to protect

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.050 
have the conservative aspect to protect
the<00:01:08.680> ball<00:01:08.920> where<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.550> can<00:01:09.670> go<00:01:09.760> in<00:01:09.880> there<00:01:10.000> and

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
the ball where you can go in there and

the ball where you can go in there and
you're<00:01:10.180> not<00:01:10.360> going<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.600> break<00:01:10.720> nearly<00:01:11.080> as<00:01:11.170> many

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
you're not going to break nearly as many

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.530 
you're not going to break nearly as many
tackles<00:01:11.590> but<00:01:12.520> your<00:01:12.850> fumble<00:01:13.180> chance<00:01:13.390> is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
tackles but your fumble chance is

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.590 
tackles but your fumble chance is
extremely<00:01:14.110> low<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.670> defensive<00:01:16.150> side<00:01:16.330> you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
extremely low on the defensive side you

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.270 
extremely low on the defensive side you
know<00:01:16.690> it<00:01:17.170> works<00:01:17.320> in<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.620> same<00:01:17.770> way<00:01:17.830> where<00:01:18.160> you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
know it works in the same way where you

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.740 
know it works in the same way where you
know<00:01:18.370> its<00:01:18.520> aggressive<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.630> it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
know its aggressive and it's

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.290 
know its aggressive and it's
conservative<00:01:20.280> which<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:21.640> know<00:01:21.670> strip

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
conservative which is you know strip

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.570 
conservative which is you know strip
ball<00:01:22.480> versus<00:01:23.260> you<00:01:23.470> know<00:01:23.500> wrap-up<00:01:23.920> tackle<00:01:24.310> and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
ball versus you know wrap-up tackle and

ball versus you know wrap-up tackle and
again<00:01:24.760> you<00:01:24.880> know<00:01:24.940> it's<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.090> same<00:01:25.270> type<00:01:25.450> of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
again you know it's the same type of

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.790 
again you know it's the same type of
thing<00:01:25.630> with<00:01:25.930> you<00:01:26.230> know<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.410> same<00:01:26.530> thing<00:01:26.680> as

linked together and you can see as
you're<00:02:51.739> running<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.190> play<00:02:52.400> that's<00:02:52.700> linked<00:02:53.000> to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
you're running a play that's linked to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.550 
you're running a play that's linked to
another<00:02:53.180> one<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.480> running<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:53.959> successfully

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
another one and running it successfully

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.990 
another one and running it successfully
you're<00:02:55.220> starting<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.459> set<00:02:55.640> up<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.880> other

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
you're starting to set up that other

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.520 
you're starting to set up that other
play<00:02:56.270> getting<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.690> ready<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.959> go<00:02:57.080> it'll<00:02:57.380> tell

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
play getting it ready to go it'll tell

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.720 
play getting it ready to go it'll tell
you<00:02:57.680> when<00:02:57.860> it's<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.040> hundred<00:02:58.190> percent<00:02:58.340> ready<00:02:58.610> to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
you when it's a hundred percent ready to

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.400 
you when it's a hundred percent ready to
go<00:02:58.850> now<00:02:59.390> this<00:02:59.510> doesn't<00:02:59.750> mean<00:02:59.900> it'll<00:03:00.200> be<00:03:00.350> an

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
go now this doesn't mean it'll be an

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.960 
go now this doesn't mean it'll be an
automatic<00:03:00.530> touchdown<00:03:01.190> here<00:03:01.340> on<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.520> play<00:03:01.760> it

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
automatic touchdown here on this play it

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.760 
automatic touchdown here on this play it
just<00:03:02.120> means<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.959> defense<00:03:03.260> has<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.440> highest

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
just means the defense has the highest

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.140 
just means the defense has the highest
likelihood<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:04.220> being<00:03:04.370> faked<00:03:04.670> out<00:03:04.820> by<00:03:04.970> that

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
likelihood of being faked out by that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.729 
likelihood of being faked out by that
place<00:03:05.300> so<00:03:05.690> if<00:03:06.140> you're<00:03:06.290> running<00:03:06.350> a<00:03:06.500> lot<00:03:06.620> of

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
place so if you're running a lot of

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.560 
place so if you're running a lot of
dives<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.790> going<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:07.970> set<00:03:08.090> up<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.209> play-action

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
dives it's going to set up a play-action

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.510 
dives it's going to set up a play-action
pass<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.950> when<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.160> run<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.370> play

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
pass and so when you run that play

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.670 
pass and so when you run that play
action<00:03:10.640> pass<00:03:10.760> hundred<00:03:11.540> percent<00:03:11.810> setup<00:03:12.080> you

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
action pass hundred percent setup you

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.840 
action pass hundred percent setup you
have<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.830> good<00:03:12.980> chance<00:03:13.130> of<00:03:13.280> having<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.550> defense

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
have a good chance of having the defense

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.370 
have a good chance of having the defense
get<00:03:13.970> freaked<00:03:14.180> out<00:03:14.300> by<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.510> run<00:03:15.260> that

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
get freaked out by that run that

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.170 
get freaked out by that run that

screen<00:03:42.470> pass<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:43.340> have<00:03:43.490> runs<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:43.910> set<00:03:44.060> up

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
screen pass you have runs that set up

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.210 
screen pass you have runs that set up
other<00:03:44.270> runs<00:03:44.630> I<00:03:44.780> mean<00:03:44.900> there's<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.290> definite

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
other runs I mean there's a definite

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.400 
other runs I mean there's a definite
variety<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:46.970> what<00:03:47.510> it's<00:03:47.780> not<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.140> running<00:03:48.350> a

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
variety of what it's not just running a

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.570 
variety of what it's not just running a
diet<00:03:48.590> of<00:03:48.800> a<00:03:48.890> play<00:03:49.040> action<00:03:49.160> there's<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.430> lot<00:03:49.550> of

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
variety of what you can set up actually

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.080 
variety of what you can set up actually
works<00:03:51.740> it<00:03:51.920> works<00:03:52.010> backwards<00:03:52.460> to<00:03:52.670> write<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.030> I

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
works it works backwards to write so I

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.670 
works it works backwards to write so I
mean<00:03:53.270> if<00:03:53.300> you<00:03:53.900> know<00:03:54.020> if<00:03:54.110> your<00:03:54.230> team<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.590> likes

effectively under prevent setup you can

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.390 
effectively under prevent setup you can
wait<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.110> hold<00:04:42.200> on<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.530> play<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.070> use<00:04:43.250> it
