 if it really is 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.550
 the offender tore her into the lead

 in the ninth minute the 1 0 by Lucas Barrios Bolt for the third time in 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.310
 The result is BVB again away plays in the Allianz Arena in the office 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.100
 the third corner for milk less debt 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.670
 15 minutes less is still cheaper for those who can not reach them 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.540

 the top 100 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.040
 Lucas Barrios is the thug but seals of Aden 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.760
 stays once again in fourth place 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
 the CEO was on only books 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.189
 that is the 3 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.289
 Lick my ass 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:16.769

 chasing the ball in front of the guest and there is with the 21 there 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.919
 Now the little Philipp Lahm handed over the ball in the evacuate apparently 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.329
 played pretty right out quickly with really doctor ball in front of goal 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.940
 So getting started attacks that makes our team outstanding 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:00.980
 had today against Bayern lives there Billerbeck the TecDax gave 1 AktG 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.469

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.239
 as expected 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.429
 not even if he is elected 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:07.669
 I would not have thought there 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.849
 yes even if he had been in there I was sure that all 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.159
 Having reached three teams he has seen that I am at the Open Market or not 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.709
 even thinks that he had just 20 seats to get hold of then one 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.829
 made 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.479

 a good dozen earthquakes this was picked up directly at 17 that is already falling 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.439
 so that they are the 7 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.569
 who lives in Brandenburg and there so well that everyone pull off immediately and 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.569
 want to come to a conclusion is just right 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.639
 as desire such idea six hits 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.639
 what's up that's right searched 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:01.079
 what Lothar Seiwert 30 CHF in the 33 minute he stands alone butt But 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.449
 much more difficult than the 1 0 0 0 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.219
 over the gate but Boris one sees 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:12.239
 the defense at Bayern the top but right we knew that 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.709
 they are not sure if we were the chances EUR or about our chances 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.370
 which then offer 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.959
 We also scored goals and it was also 7 of the ninth minute 7 percent 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.569
 in the 2008 election are 18 Appenzell

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.539
 Portheine Red 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.979
 now again couples as a possession pipe what a court 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.069
 Boys Kevin Grosskreutz skips his opponent 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:48.840
 Ferrari belonged 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.599
 Nuri Sahin 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.599
 what is Melzer? 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.650
 Bochum played Kevin Grand Cross had he now goes on probation 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.650
 but later back to leanness years 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.240
 Zentgraf 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.370

 My wife writes two clear penalties 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.460
 Warner Bros by Andre Dolle Marcel be mature himself Martin Walser 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.820
 So it certainly was a role 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.420
 but now there are first times a corner in the 60 in minute of play for the BVB of 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.659
 the right side 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:37.739
 Price now Mario GÃ¶tze who will bring the ball in front of the box is coming now 

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:38.749
 he purely high 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.749
 and there is the 2 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.509
 Pretty Wild Friends play hugely 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.349
 the Briton 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.660
 has long been to clarify another 1 for Koch 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:16.059
 Schweinsteiger 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:19.129
 and go to the left side of the topic 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.129
 During the courtship the tempo became 11 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:28.900
 we see how I think 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.050
 and save
