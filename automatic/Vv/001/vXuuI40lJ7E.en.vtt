00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.359
 hello, I'm Manuel Oliveres, veterinarian 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.039
 the olive- tree veterinary clinic in 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:14.020
 granada and from www.iberia.es info we are going to 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.580
 start with this video today a series 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.619
 of videos that we go where we're going to 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.900
 treat compulsive problems in the 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.970
 dog seizures are a problem 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.289
 well that happens quite often 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.330
 in the practice of the veterinary clinic 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.980
 and that is quite alarming very 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.710
 Dramatic for the dog owner 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.960
 who suffers an attack of this type is very 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.829
 important in convulsive attacks 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.660
 differentiate them from those that only five 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.510
 months in convulsive attacks we 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.910
 they can be anything from mild to serious 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.920
 the slight ones can appear us common 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.050
 It looked like a nervous tic in some areas 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.800
 bodily in the head in the mouth in 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.540
 some member in the most serious can 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.010
 get good here is the dog 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.470
 ground 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.390
 with loss of consciousness the dog with 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.210
 the rigid limbs with tremors 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.980
 large one producing much I see what 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.080
 it's called a salivation can it piss 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.940
 on top you can defecate is enough 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.450
 Pretty much I say dramatic and dramatic 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.030
 for who for what the syncope sees 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.990
 it differs in that the dog 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.970
 collapses in a way and well then 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.790
 The dog on the ground is limp 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.470
 they are relaxed is a 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.710
 episode that usually lasts very little 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.930
 time and in which the good dog then 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 quickly passes this 5 that gets up 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.220
 as if nothing had happened 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.710
 It is usually due to disorders of 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.960
 heart you can see problems of type 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.759
 hypotensive sometimes when there is a 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.970
 anaphylactic reaction is also 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.950
 present this type of syncope also 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.869
 well they are apparatuses are the sense 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.149
 which is that suddenly the dog 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.410
 collapses but not as much as in the case 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.060
 of the convulsive syndrome of those who 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.550
 but I already say the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.100
 seizures these are so typical of 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.690
 the movements of members with the jungle 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.190
 I see the kicks that come with them 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.720
 convulsive problems may be due 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.819
 to many causes there may be problems of 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.649
 metabolic type as problems of a 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.810
 Hepatic encephalopathy due to a disorder 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.380
 in the circulation of the liver for example 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.540
 problems in which they may appear 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.850
 disturbances the temperature in problems 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.900
 of intense fevers, shock problems 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.090
 heat can also 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.819
 this kind of disorders problems of 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.220
 traumatismos cranioencephalic problems 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.230
 brain edemas problems 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.200
 brain hemorrhages problems 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.840
 masses that occupy a space at the level of 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.049
 skull in tumors all this is going to 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.609
 cause compressions with problems of 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.319
 irrigation in certain brain areas and 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.489
 can trigger that kind of 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.430
 attacks 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.980
 They can also be due to problems of 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.500
 neurological type strictly as they are 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.159
 Well what is epilepsy as 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.330
 well- known problems of circulation to 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.180
 brain level 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.490
 problems of degenerative type at level 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.870
 of the brain if there are good also 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.690
 these disorders may owe 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.310
 various toxicological problems 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.070
 for example in the ingestion of 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.600
 antiparasitic compounds some types 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.880
 of collars or products that can be 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.380
 apply to the dog you can ingest and give 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.060
 place to this type of disorders 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.450
 infectious problems as is the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.700
 distemper tetanus toxin all this 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.520
 to cause them to appear too 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.680
 disorders of compulsive type and I say 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.930
 that there are pictures that can be milder 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.330
 than others but everyone has a lot 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.520
 importance and when a picture appears 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.140
 of this type in which we see some 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.140
 convulsive attack in our dog 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.240
 We must contact quickly with 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.100
 our usual veterinarian or with a 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.530
 emergency service so that we 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.510
 report on what we should do 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.150
 while we move the dog to the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.650
 clinic is not something we can 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.900
 adjust the good posture I'm going to 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.280
 wait to see how it recovers because 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.440
 well there are attacks that or syncope that are 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.690
 relatively mild 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.270
 brief and others that can be serious with 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.280
 the animal life danger or even 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.370
 talk after later recovery 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.470
 neurological of our dog then you 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.150
 we have said that there are many causes of 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.250
 disorders that we make up 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.990
 convulsive and you have to come to a 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.700
 accurate diagnosis 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.860
 well then doing all the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.090
 tests that are considered relevant 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.299
 depending on the case 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.730
 Normally, studies of 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:27.240
 type of blood policies there are 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.520
 perform electrocardiograms and can be 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.190
 perform cranial level x-rays 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.250
 the ideal would be to be able to perform resonance 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.900
 N otan at the cranial level 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.720
 electroencephalography since a range of 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.000
 tests that will help us carry 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.830
 antia to our body are going to take 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.090
 a diagnosis to an accurate diagnosis 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.910
 there are cases where you test it going 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.860
 to require he will refer the dog to 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.050
 specialized centers that sometimes 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.210
 they are not even in our 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.880
 usual areas but you should always 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.340
 know that they are available to 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.380
 patients who can not specify 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.570
 with this we see that the causes of 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.580
 disorders that lead to seizures 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.530
 they are very varied that you have to get to 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.000
 that accurate diagnosis and once you 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.930
 arrives at this precise diagnosis already 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.240
 may institute the treatment 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.710
 relevant because obviously every 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.660
 disease that cause a picture 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.090
 convulsive will bring a treatment 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.460
 different can be an antitoxin 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.639
 tetanic to sedation or anesthesia of the 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.260
 dog while controlling attacks 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.030
 antibiotic treatments anti serums 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.160
 mosquitoes 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.680
 with the drugs to lower the 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.390
 intracranial pressure without a series of 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.620
 treatments that I already say are going to depend 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.540
 of the cause that originate the 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.530
 seizures 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.600
 all this good we will try in 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.610
 subsequent videos and the focusing on 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.130
 these diseases each one in particular 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.570
 because they are quite interesting and 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.250
 they give much more often than they 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.200
 that maybe it can seem like 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.480
 then remember that it is always very 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.430
 important that when some 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.350
 convulsive attack or some syncope 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.450
 directly to contact the 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.910
 veterinary services because there 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.160
 attacks that are very brief and do not have 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.900
 in principle very important but 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.060
 others I already say that if they can be very 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.130
 serious especially when they are prolonged in 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.200
 the time because I already say the life of 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.940
 our animal may be in danger or its 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.100
 complete neurological recovery 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.830
 It can also be very difficult if 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.510
 We arrived late, well you know that 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.310
 all ways you have your 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.850
 disposition the consultation telephone that 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.040
 appears on our website www point you 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.450
 veterinary point info and there good 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.700
 We can solve all the doubts that 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.849
 you can have on this or any other 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.369
 related topic 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.229
 and the care of our animals I hope 

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:44.550
 it has been interesting and we see in 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.550
 next up soon
