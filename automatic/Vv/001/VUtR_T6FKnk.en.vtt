00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.699
 billboard 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.140
 the other day I went to see the 15th movie of the twilight saga 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.480
 I really want to be negative but there are some points that 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.670
 I need 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.110
 we share with you 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.410
 this time I will finish in the 21st century a woman of 17 years in the

 and being harassed by two man I am very handsome one that is the entity is 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.680
 dead but with excellent manners kentucky wait until marriage 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.650
 so they have relationships 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.530
 and another like the sponge cake with a great body for what I'm going to do 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.860
 palm plus the accused by two men when we did not bother him that any 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.620
 woman 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.440
 for the rest 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.570
 do not stain if I were candles uanl did not know what to do good in fact already 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.230
 she is quite confused accepting the league on the bench and getting her 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.170
 a few minutes later women who wanted you and sincerely 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.610
 I knew what to do although good now that we're pretty world champions by the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.660
 I think that the quintería ask the octopus for these 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.760
 imagine yourself 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.350
 Adela Asúa putting the photos on the bench and gold waiting for it to go down 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.190
 of the psib the octopus and ask yourself ok pol pot 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.940
 if it is what I should do 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.600
 stay with the vampire 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.020
 because also with the theme who pass the elections 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.320
 thank goodness that the body is not fault because if it were to door is equal 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.330
 confuse to love her and the rest the women of the world to be in that 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.360
 situation but could be is that they are sincere those men are like to 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.150
 who would do anything for the damn sail 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.320
 bitch talking about the pig I wonder if they are going to raffle the ball worldwide 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.100
 something like that because if so, you should already be waiting for two policies to see 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.240
 if I can get out let's be honest, who would like a point that you 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.980
 have fun better options or that I can constant things I know I exceeded yesterday with 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.429
 troops 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:24.259
 Winning is wrong 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:28.289
 the week in front of the cult that if I were the octopus ban and I'm not interested 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.709

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:36.199
 fictitious cool have fun a little more I would put in a contest type 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.059
 watching over the town of my dreams 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.629
 I already imagine all the people dancing merengue auditioning to see you can 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.459
 remove the octopus she finally gretel pulp was chosen by mere coincidence 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.029
 because let's face it, what football bodies know is more to whom 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.029
 it happened to ask an octopus about the results of the world 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:59.839
 there are laws by the point of your dreams the former friend is down here if you are 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:01.899
 they would fail by the port of their dreams 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.459
 and if there is no one 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.209
