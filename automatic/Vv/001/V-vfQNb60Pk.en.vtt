 and if we have any open session 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.580
 we simply close it ok and then with 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.059
 this done then we can start gta 5 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.199
 that this serves for the two consoles 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.670

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.040

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.990
 super good this cliché and then something that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.960
 It should be noted that this clip is useful for 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.450
 sell the vehicles every 45 minutes if 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.940
 they want to do it without waiting, they can 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.740
 do with your second character and more a 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.170
 link and give them 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.390
 in the description to do so and 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.190
 Well, since we are here with people 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.960
 online as I told them I will do it with my 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.840
 primary character the main 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.540
 we will enter our garage ok me in 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.330
 this case I have the garages ordered 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.430
 one with all my personal vehicles and 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.200
 the other with pure vehicles that are the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.510
 revel streets and street cars or that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.700
 friends in this case I will use the rebel 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.610
 so to duplicate it as you can see 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.800
 here the rebel forgiveness both apologize and 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.810
 we just take it out of the garage like 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.270
 I tell them and the two garages have to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.760
 be full ok that's important the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.430
 garages have to be full good 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.920
 we take out our duck and now simply 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.720
 you know we take out the cell phone we take out 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.700
 any mission and at the moment that we 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.790
 we will be fast approaching we press 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.310
 double and this garage will appear full and 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.770
 we will wait about 10 seconds and 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.840
 we will accept or that already 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.510
 we are here in this menu we will wait 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.630
 about 5 to 10 seconds equal and you 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.489
 We will give it out or we will give it out 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.480
 and we will appear within what is 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.610
 garage 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.620
 and then we are going to move by any 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.569
 vehicle this car will be the second 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.069
 garage or after one see 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.769
 here is my duck and now simply 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.709
 we leave for the other so much that it will be 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.890
 out ok friends here we went for the duck 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.629
 which is the replica of the other we put it already 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.000
 they know the first garage because this is the 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.129
 that is full of pure setback and now yes 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.440
 is if you are going to lose this vehicle to me 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.180
 I do not care because it's one revealed that and 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.879
 Now, with this done, it is already 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.890
 done in three friends as he demands a 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.290
 garage the main one I recommend full 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.660
 of pure karen reverse and the second a 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.730
 pure vehicle person what and then as 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.090
 everyone knows everyone has to 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.129
 have therefore the same garage purchased on 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.840
 same building ok two garages in the 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.450
 same building so for them to come out 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.459
 this glitch and here we are simply going to 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.010
 sell the vehicle or if not simply 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.500
 we keep doing the game to duplicate 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.930
 all the garage that in this case I what 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.579
 I'm going to sell because and well as I 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.340
 He said so they do not have to wait for 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.400
 45 minutes this they do with their second 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.240
 character and they make the click that they 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.860
 I will leave 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.200
 in the description of going to mode 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.510
 campaign and return but with his second 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.800
 character and so they can sell one to 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.510
 one without waiting for 45 minutes ok and then 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.870
 good friends as you see here they give me almost 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.950
 the 200 well which is super good 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.200
 obviously if I sell it right now I'll have 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.720
 what to expect as I tell you 45 minutes 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.610
 but as you know they do it with their 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.680
 second staff go to campaign mode 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.020
 come back in the session by invitation 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.630
 doing all this method that I just 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.420
 do and they can sell it without waiting for 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.100
 45 minutes what we made friends with 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.020
 start in campaign mode is for 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.690
 jump the invisible patch that got 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.310
 rockstar so that it will no longer work this 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.010
 church so it's a new method that 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.740
 friends and basically everything has been 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.140
 everything can double your entire garage 200 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.510
 thousand for each vehicle but they will see that 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.540
 is for 45 minutes if you do not want to wait 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.610
 the 45 minutes they do with their second 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.770
 character and they will make eglys that I will leave them 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.170
 in the description and well good friends me 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.280

 by1 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.599
 and also because I have something important that 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.460
 tell them in the description I will leave them the 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.909
 link of my secondary channel then for 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.909
 let them pass
