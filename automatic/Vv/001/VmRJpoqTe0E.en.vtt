00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.670
 what 7 0 that happens does not work 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.750
 no the doesn't happen that often for the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.280
 competition with someone with sjoerd 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.620
 postma manner of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 did not live with great results and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.820
 his entire event is often the last one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.379
 I always believe by tycho so yes I do 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.590
 could often hear the question I think 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.880
 because degreaser per city with good figures 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.810
 ps I am a man of the match tonight 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 to manage well I do n't think I want 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.289
 three goals and an assist 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.630
 yes that 's right 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.850
 if you are any razor how that again 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.670
 acts and striker for us as a team 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.230
 it is a fantastic and Passat is a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.660
 scoring ability steam the first goals 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.670
 a little makes good promotions and out of it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.010
 midfield play what super strong 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.940
 Dislike close knows already so I think so 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.980
 such a team performance 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.079
 those guys who still drink come too 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.269
 score so I just think Kim achievement 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.870
 for in is playing with doctor, I think 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:58.739
 relief yes I hit him off time 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.129
 jump well with him and so that is 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.470
 because both for Friday and tonight 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.420
 I think you play a great game 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.670
 yes exactly that i say where you are with us 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.100
 a pointed city 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.540
 look at the first what are not good 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.920
 but you shouldn't say goodbye otherwise 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.030
 pointed position 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.650
 but you also see this station as important 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.630
 good striker you where you can fine them 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.490
 for want important that there are because 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.960
 what does a specific matter to you now 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.340
 with a head to state that leads a lot 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.440
 attention whether it is true that more 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.920
 see exactly what happens 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.420
 Well just has everybody good 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.200
 just you win if you can handle as a team 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.820
 seite 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.229
 You know that's if you hit a ball well before 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.170
 here the that it is always dangerous 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.729
 and yes it creates peace in us 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.810
 team he can in the depth organ 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.970
 plays but can also be fine in one 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.470
 photographer and yes I just before 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.450
 rest and ourselves than that they just do that 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.039
 feyenoord squirts player and i'm thinking for that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.380
 everyone but my spy players gone 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:52.009
 was because tonight be heard stadium 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.780
 you play with mussels red champion 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.490
 the past matches think much better 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.200
 then first matches how we see how 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.909
 look at it yourself go against it 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.729
 yes I think we certainly still had to 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.780
 him and also to the premier league on the heap 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.610
 and walked 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.470
 so yes that was it i think so too 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.470
 has to do and then sweet of course 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.320
 way was one 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.120
 yes I give a hot fire and yes I do 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.220
 in short, no need to 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.090
 have it made because he is playing now 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.410
 right outer 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.970
 the past tube has a different position 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.340
 played this is your best position for 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.620
 this season honor of 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.610
 well I have almost just as 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.720
 my qualities 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.010
 i think i also have phaeton midfield 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.140
 but they play midfield 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.300
 now state was just really good and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.890
 yeah I'll be good in May to my right 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.650
 on the side so I have freedom 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.060
 so yes that would be nice so this season 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.060
 think with wet son champion 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.760
 I still see with cinch and beside 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.209
 then must have good at stay work 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.670
 every day 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.330
 yes then hope that is true 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.810
