cheap<00:00:50.300> right<00:00:50.540> now<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.350> I'm<00:00:51.410> going<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:51.590> take

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
cheap right now so I'm going to take

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.520 
cheap right now so I'm going to take
Mandzukic<00:00:52.430> for<00:00:52.610> example<00:00:53.059> here<00:00:53.239> his<00:00:54.140> default

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
Mandzukic for example here his default

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.920 
Mandzukic for example here his default
position<00:00:54.920> is<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.070> striker<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.850> he<00:00:56.629> literally

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
position is a striker and he literally

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.270 
position is a striker and he literally
goes<00:00:57.200> around<00:00:57.469> like<00:00:57.649> seven<00:00:57.800> hundred<00:00:57.950> coins

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
goes around like seven hundred coins

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.459 
goes around like seven hundred coins
right<00:00:58.520> now<00:00:58.700> he<00:00:58.790> goes<00:00:58.879> for<00:00:59.210> nothing<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.290> then

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
right now he goes for nothing so then

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.260 
right now he goes for nothing so then
what<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:00.710> want<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:00.980> do<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.280> filter<00:01:01.879> through

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
what you want to do is filter through

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.180 
what you want to do is filter through
the<00:01:02.420> positions<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.500> find<00:01:03.800> them<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:04.039> my

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
the positions and find them in my

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.889 
the positions and find them in my
blindness<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:04.820> if<00:01:04.910> we<00:01:05.000> look<00:01:05.030> at<00:01:05.180> Mandzukic<00:01:05.750> in

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
blindness so if we look at Mandzukic in

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.340

kind<00:02:06.319> of<00:02:06.500> games<00:02:07.270> but

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
kind of games but

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.940 
kind of games but
big<00:02:09.269> gap<00:02:09.599> because<00:02:10.019> as<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.289> can<00:02:10.349> see<00:02:10.500> there's<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
big gap because as you can see there's a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.280 
big gap because as you can see there's a
one<00:02:11.159> point<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.459> fries<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.090> stuff<00:02:12.329> and<00:02:12.569> they

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
one point of fries and stuff and they

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.429 
one point of fries and stuff and they
would<00:02:13.590> eventually<00:02:13.950> go<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.159> 1.7<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.319> see

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
would eventually go to 1.7 you can see

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.890 
would eventually go to 1.7 you can see
here<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.159> he<00:02:17.310> was<00:02:17.519> probably<00:02:17.579> worth<00:02:18.000> about<00:02:18.090> 1.7

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
here so he was probably worth about 1.7

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.080 
here so he was probably worth about 1.7
k<00:02:18.930> there's<00:02:19.349> couple<00:02:19.709> for<00:02:19.920> 141<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:20.730> for<00:02:20.909> which

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
k there's couple for 141 but for which

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.899 
k there's couple for 141 but for which
will<00:02:21.239> get<00:02:21.390> picked<00:02:21.569> up<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.129> can<00:02:23.280> see<00:02:23.459> where

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
i can easily convert him down hopefully

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.710 
i can easily convert him down hopefully
is<00:03:51.209> it<00:03:51.419> like<00:03:52.220> 2.5<00:03:53.220> k<00:03:53.519> at<00:03:53.699> least<00:03:54.409> so<00:03:55.409> we<00:03:55.530> got<00:03:56.720> 2.7

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
is it like 2.5 k at least so we got 2.7

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.960 
is it like 2.5 k at least so we got 2.7
k<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.680> want<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.919> check<00:03:59.099> is<00:03:59.250> minimum<00:03:59.699> by

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
k you just want to check is minimum by

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.670 
k you just want to check is minimum by
now<00:04:01.579> okay<00:04:02.579> so<00:04:02.639> we<00:04:02.940> got<00:04:03.060> one<00:04:03.269> for<00:04:03.449> 2.3<00:04:04.109> i<00:04:04.379> think

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
now okay so we got one for 2.3 i think

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.550 
now okay so we got one for 2.3 i think
that<00:04:04.739> might<00:04:05.040> actually<00:04:05.250> be<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.549> deal<00:04:06.349> let's<00:04:07.349> see

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
that might actually be a deal let's see

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.930 
that might actually be a deal let's see
yep<00:04:08.159> that<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.579> probably<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:09.120> deal<00:04:10.250> 2.6<00:04:11.250> ok<00:04:11.879> so
