against<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.400> facts

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
against the facts

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.960 
against the facts
the<00:04:29.070> eight-six<00:04:29.280> won<00:04:30.560> it's<00:04:31.610> starting<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.639> get<00:04:32.910> a

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
the eight-six won it's starting to get a

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.960 
the eight-six won it's starting to get a
bit<00:04:33.150> collectible<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:34.740> 186<00:04:35.490> won<00:04:35.730> which<00:04:35.940> was

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
bit collectible the 186 won which was

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.510 
bit collectible the 186 won which was
basically<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.690> rhodium<00:04:37.350> plated<00:04:37.860> version<00:04:38.400> of

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
basically a rhodium plated version of

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.430 
basically a rhodium plated version of
the<00:04:38.669> 861<00:04:39.300> movement<00:04:41.090> it's<00:04:42.090> not<00:04:42.419> as<00:04:42.780> collectible

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
the 861 movement it's not as collectible

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.480 
the 861 movement it's not as collectible
as<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.710> 861<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.730> I<00:04:44.790> think<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.540> 861<00:04:46.260> look<00:04:46.680> it's

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
as the 861 and I think the 861 look it's

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.120 
as the 861 and I think the 861 look it's
done<00:04:47.850> enough<00:04:48.210> space<00:04:48.600> travel<00:04:49.230> to<00:04:49.260> earn<00:04:49.710> its

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
done enough space travel to earn its

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.810 
done enough space travel to earn its
place<00:04:50.490> so<00:04:50.850> I<00:04:50.930> think<00:04:51.930> myself<00:04:52.490> you're<00:04:53.490> right

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
place so I think myself you're right

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.770 
place so I think myself you're right
you're<00:04:54.419> right<00:04:54.690> but<00:04:55.700> let's<00:04:56.700> keep<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.300> punters

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
you're right but let's keep the punters

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.280 
you're right but let's keep the punters
happy<00:04:58.230> let's<00:04:58.620> keep<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:59.130> punters<00:04:59.550> happy<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.290> I

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
happy let's keep the punters happy and I

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.420 
happy let's keep the punters happy and I
think<00:05:01.830> as<00:05:01.950> long<00:05:02.130> as<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.430> got<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.640> hell<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.570> light

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
think as long as you got a hell so light

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.310 
think as long as you got a hell so light
crystal<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.700> you<00:05:05.730> got<00:05:06.360> an<00:05:06.510> eight-six<00:05:06.990> one

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
crystal and you got an eight-six one

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.760 
crystal and you got an eight-six one
movement<00:05:08.190> in<00:05:08.640> it<00:05:08.820> I<00:05:09.030> think<00:05:09.780> that's<00:05:09.990> still<00:05:10.169> okay

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
movement in it I think that's still okay

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.700 
movement in it I think that's still okay
okay<00:05:11.580> that's<00:05:11.790> what<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.030> think<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:12.540> think<00:05:13.530> it's

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
okay that's what I think I think it's

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.090 
okay that's what I think I think it's
