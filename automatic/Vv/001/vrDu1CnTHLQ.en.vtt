00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.469 
clothes and the face is kind of similar
above<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.340> can't<00:01:26.580> make<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.850> make<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
above so they can't make me make it the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.240 
above so they can't make me make it the
exact<00:01:27.780> same<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.799> would<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:28.979> like
