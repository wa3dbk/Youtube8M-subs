hello<00:00:08.519> everybody<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:09.000> today's<00:00:09.120> video<00:00:09.420> I'm

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
hello everybody in today's video I'm

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.060 
hello everybody in today's video I'm
going<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.840> show<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.019> how<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.230> solve<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.860> last

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
going to show you how I solve the last

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.280 
going to show you how I solve the last
four<00:00:11.490> edges<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> nine<00:00:12.570> by<00:00:12.780> nine<00:00:12.990> as<00:00:13.170> you

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
four edges on the nine by nine as you

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.930 
four edges on the nine by nine as you
can<00:00:13.410> see<00:00:13.559> these<00:00:13.710> four<00:00:14.070> on<00:00:14.219> top<00:00:14.429> or<00:00:14.639> done<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
can see these four on top or done the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.390 
can see these four on top or done the
four<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.690> bottom<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:16.170> done<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:17.190> last

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
four on the bottom are done and the last

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.890 
four on the bottom are done and the last
four<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.880> usually<00:00:18.180> where<00:00:18.300> people<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
four is usually where people get a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.200 
four is usually where people get a
little<00:00:19.109> bit<00:00:19.260> stuck<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.460> what<00:00:20.760> I'm<00:00:20.850> going<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.029> do

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
little bit stuck so what I'm going to do

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.820 
little bit stuck so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:21.510> show<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.140> how<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.560> now<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
is show you how to do that now the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.800 
is show you how to do that now the
algorithm<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.580> I'm<00:00:23.699> going<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:23.910> actually

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
algorithm that I'm going to use actually

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.320 
algorithm that I'm going to use actually
flips<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.289> hole<00:00:25.470> edge<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.099> I'm<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.210> show

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
flips a hole edge and I'm going to show

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.700 
flips a hole edge and I'm going to show
you<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.539> algorithm<00:00:27.960> now<00:00:28.080> it'll<00:00:28.320> also<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.619> in

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
you that algorithm now it'll also be in

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.080 
you that algorithm now it'll also be in
the<00:00:28.769> description<00:00:28.859> but<00:00:29.369> I'm<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.670> explain

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
the description but I'm going to explain

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.720 
the description but I'm going to explain
it<00:00:30.269> right<00:00:30.420> now<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.960> then<00:00:31.619> I'm<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it right now and then I'm just going to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.220 
it right now and then I'm just going to
do<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.059> after<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.840> I'm<00:00:33.930> not<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.140> to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
do it after that so I'm not going to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.450 
do it after that so I'm not going to
explain<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.620> every<00:00:34.829> single<00:00:35.010> time<00:00:35.280> I'm<00:00:35.370> just

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
explain it every single time I'm just

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.830 
explain it every single time I'm just
going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.700> call<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> flipping<00:00:36.390> algorithm

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
going to call it the flipping algorithm

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.470 
going to call it the flipping algorithm
as<00:00:36.930> most<00:00:37.140> people<00:00:37.410> know<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:39.239> algorithm

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
as most people know it and the algorithm

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.020 
as most people know it and the algorithm
flips<00:00:40.230> over<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.100> edge<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.550> right<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
flips over the edge on the right you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.160 
flips over the edge on the right you
could<00:00:42.180> probably<00:00:42.329> learn<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.870> your<00:00:42.989> left

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
could probably learn it on your left

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.569 
could probably learn it on your left
hand<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> find<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.890> easier<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.370> cube

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
hand but I find it easier to just cube

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.979 
hand but I find it easier to just cube
rotate<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.300> especially<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.809> big

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
rotate and do it especially on a big

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.200 
rotate and do it especially on a big
cube<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> algorithm

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
cube like this but the algorithm

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.549 
cube like this but the algorithm
actually<00:00:48.390> goes<00:00:48.840> R<00:00:49.370> u<00:00:50.370> R<00:00:50.640> prime<00:00:51.539> F<00:00:52.789> R<00:00:53.789> prime<00:00:54.559> F

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
actually goes R u R prime F R prime F

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.360 
actually goes R u R prime F R prime F
prime<00:00:56.160> R<00:00:56.960> what<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.109> did<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.770> flipped<00:00:59.070> this

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
prime R what that did is it flipped this

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.110 
prime R what that did is it flipped this
whole<00:00:59.609> side<00:00:59.969> over<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.370> so<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> can<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:02.879> here

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
whole side over and so I can see here

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.880 
whole side over and so I can see here
we've<00:01:03.270> got<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.480> these<00:01:03.660> oranges<00:01:04.080> done<00:01:04.320> we've

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
we've got all these oranges done we've

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.890 
we've got all these oranges done we've
got<00:01:05.070> these<00:01:05.220> three<00:01:05.460> Reds<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.420> course<00:01:06.750> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
got these three Reds but of course this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.929 
got these three Reds but of course this
is<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.290> where<00:01:07.530> they're<00:01:07.710> supposed<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.130> see

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
is not where they're supposed to be see

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.850 
is not where they're supposed to be see
this<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> orange<00:01:09.780> center<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.560> because

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
this is the orange center here because

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.670 
this is the orange center here because
this<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.430> middle<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.180> never<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.900> know<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
this the middle one never you know the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
this the middle one never you know the
middle<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.270> build

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
middle one is right so I have to build

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.270 
middle one is right so I have to build
all<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.780> them<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.080> based<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> middle<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
all of them on based on the middle and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
all of them on based on the middle and
just<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.880> actually<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.720> should

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
just like this is actually this should

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.830 
just like this is actually this should
be<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.350> blue<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.189> red<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.299> see<00:01:21.479> this

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
be the blue and red and you can see this

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.010 
be the blue and red and you can see this
group<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.380> stuff<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.270> actually<00:01:24.600> pretty

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
group of stuff this is actually pretty

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
group of stuff this is actually pretty
nice<00:01:25.170> too<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.619> similar<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.280> orange

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
nice too that's similar to the orange

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
nice too that's similar to the orange
that's<00:01:26.759> exactly<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> same<00:01:27.479> actually<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.020> so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that's exactly the same actually but so

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.780 
that's exactly the same actually but so
I'm<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.710> concentrate<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.460> orange

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
I'm going to concentrate on the orange

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.140 
I'm going to concentrate on the orange
for<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.680> what<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.909> need

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
for now so what I would do is I need

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.649 
for now so what I would do is I need
this<00:01:33.390> piece<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.530> over<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.270> need<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
this piece to go over here so I need to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.240 
this piece to go over here so I need to
bring<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> location<00:01:37.650> where<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.799> needs<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> be

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
bring the location where it needs to be

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.440 
bring the location where it needs to be
above<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.400> bring<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
above this so as you can see I bring the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.170 
above this so as you can see I bring the
location<00:01:42.960> above<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:44.340> even<00:01:44.759> easier<00:01:45.119> than

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
location above it but even easier than

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.960 
location above it but even easier than
that<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.649> go<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.729> this<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
that I don't have to go like this and

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.810 
that I don't have to go like this and
then<00:01:48.240> move<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.600> back<00:01:48.869> what<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.460> I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
then move this back what I can do is I

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.660 
then move this back what I can do is I
can<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.030> move<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.659> over<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.320> bring<00:01:52.670> both

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
can just move this over and bring both

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.340 
can just move this over and bring both
of<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> apply<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.930> flipping

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
of these so I apply the flipping

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.380 
of these so I apply the flipping
algorithm<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:59.189> now<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.790> they<00:01:59.880> are<00:01:59.909> up<00:02:00.119> here

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
algorithm and now that they are up here

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.510 
algorithm and now that they are up here
I<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.810> move<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:01.170> back<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.280> see

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I can move them back and you can see

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.420 
I can move them back and you can see
that<00:02:02.880> they<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.770> ok<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:04.829> let's<00:02:05.040> look<00:02:05.130> for

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that they are in ok so let's look for

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.630 
that they are in ok so let's look for
another<00:02:05.790> one

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
another one

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.660 
another one
here's<00:02:08.640> these<00:02:09.030> two<00:02:09.090> here<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.680> see<00:02:11.070> that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
here's these two here and I can see that

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.640 
here's these two here and I can see that
they're<00:02:11.850> already<00:02:12.210> in<00:02:12.480> line<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.080> if<00:02:13.200> these<00:02:13.350> two

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
they're already in line so if these two

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
they're already in line so if these two
came<00:02:13.950> all<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.610> way<00:02:14.640> over<00:02:14.730> here<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.570> would<00:02:15.690> see

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
came all the way over here you would see

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.630 
came all the way over here you would see
that<00:02:15.930> they<00:02:16.080> would<00:02:16.200> go<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:17.190> case<00:02:17.400> like

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
that they would go in in a case like

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.110 
that they would go in in a case like
this<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:18.960> don't<00:02:19.200> use<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.340> flipping<00:02:20.670> algorithm

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
this I don't use the flipping algorithm

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.930 
this I don't use the flipping algorithm
I<00:02:21.270> mean<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:22.050> but<00:02:22.740> I'm<00:02:23.040> not<00:02:23.100> going<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.580> what

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
I mean you can but I'm not going to what

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.940 
I mean you can but I'm not going to what
I<00:02:23.970> would<00:02:24.150> do<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.450> put<00:02:24.600> an<00:02:24.720> empty<00:02:25.050> slot<00:02:25.320> on<00:02:25.560> top

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
I would do is put an empty slot on top

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
I would do is put an empty slot on top
and<00:02:26.160> bring<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.430> solved<00:02:26.820> one<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:28.560> like<00:02:28.710> this

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
and bring a solved one in just like this

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.120 
and bring a solved one in just like this
now<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.000> can<00:02:30.330> move<00:02:30.480> these<00:02:30.690> two<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.770> into

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
now I can move these two in this into

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.690 
now I can move these two in this into
place<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:33.090> there's<00:02:33.270> one<00:02:34.340> there's<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.580> other

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
place so there's one there's the other

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.140 
place so there's one there's the other
and<00:02:36.030> now<00:02:36.240> I'm<00:02:36.360> going<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.540> replace<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.230> with

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
and now I'm going to replace this with

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.130 
and now I'm going to replace this with
the<00:02:39.230> broken<00:02:40.230> one<00:02:40.500> up<00:02:40.620> here<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.670> now<00:02:42.630> when<00:02:43.110> I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
the broken one up here and now when I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.130 
the broken one up here and now when I
realign<00:02:43.620> these<00:02:43.920> I'm<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.670> fix<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:46.020> I've

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
realign these I'm going to fix what I've

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.880 
realign these I'm going to fix what I've
smashed<00:02:47.100> up<00:02:47.370> there<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:47.730> there's<00:02:47.910> one<00:02:48.150> and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
smashed up there so there's one and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.750 
smashed up there so there's one and
there's<00:02:49.890> another<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:51.600> now<00:02:51.720> we've<00:02:51.900> created

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
there's another so now we've created

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.520 
there's another so now we've created
this<00:02:53.760> block<00:02:54.060> we've<00:02:54.420> exchanged<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.260> with<00:02:55.290> this

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
this block we've exchanged it with this

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.960 
this block we've exchanged it with this
but<00:02:55.740> that's<00:02:55.830> okay<00:02:56.190> because<00:02:56.220> now<00:02:56.640> we<00:02:56.700> only<00:02:56.880> have

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
but that's okay because now we only have

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.330 
but that's okay because now we only have
three<00:02:57.090> left<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:57.840> let's<00:02:58.800> go<00:02:58.920> ahead<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.190> see

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
three left so let's go ahead and see

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.610 
three left so let's go ahead and see
what<00:02:59.580> would<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.150> next<00:03:00.480> well<00:03:01.320> I'm<00:03:01.470> going<00:03:01.590> to

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
what would be next well I'm going to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.110 
what would be next well I'm going to
take<00:03:01.770> advantage<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.370> situation<00:03:02.550> here

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
take advantage of this situation here

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.610 
take advantage of this situation here
because<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.630> see<00:03:03.780> all<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:04.020> these<00:03:04.350> ones

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
because you can see all of these ones

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.860 
because you can see all of these ones
need<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.890> go<00:03:05.100> in<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.030> I'm<00:03:06.300> going<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.480> find<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
need to go in so I'm going to find the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.030 
need to go in so I'm going to find the
one<00:03:06.990> that<00:03:07.020> belongs<00:03:07.350> here<00:03:07.500> because<00:03:07.740> this<00:03:07.890> one

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
one that belongs here because this one

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.350 
one that belongs here because this one
obviously<00:03:08.340> doesn't<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:08.820> one<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.120> flipped

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
obviously doesn't this one is flipped

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.270 
obviously doesn't this one is flipped
over<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.810> one<00:03:09.930> belongs<00:03:10.170> up<00:03:10.440> here<00:03:10.800> so<00:03:11.220> I'm

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
over this one belongs up here so I'm

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.030 
over this one belongs up here so I'm
going<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.489> find<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.760> one<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:11.970> belongs<00:03:12.090> here

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
going to find the one that belongs here

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.460 
going to find the one that belongs here
which<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.190> right<00:03:14.430> here<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.750> need<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.170> to

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
which is right here and I need this to

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.699 
which is right here and I need this to
go<00:03:17.070> down<00:03:17.340> here<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.239> I'm<00:03:18.840> not<00:03:18.989> going<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.380> take

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
go down here and I'm not going to take

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.530 
go down here and I'm not going to take
this<00:03:20.040> out<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.730> know<00:03:20.880> I'm<00:03:21.060> not<00:03:21.180> going<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.420> bring

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
this out you know I'm not going to bring

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.150 
this out you know I'm not going to bring
this<00:03:21.870> position<00:03:22.640> all<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.700> way<00:03:24.030> over<00:03:24.330> here<00:03:24.720> and

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
this position all the way over here and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.340 
this position all the way over here and
then<00:03:26.160> flip<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:27.209> because<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.170> going<00:03:28.290> to

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
then flip this because this is going to

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.870 
then flip this because this is going to
leave<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.620> one<00:03:28.800> up<00:03:28.860> here<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:29.519> one<00:03:29.730> will

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
leave this one up here and this one will

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.330 
leave this one up here and this one will
come<00:03:30.030> back<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.630> be<00:03:31.230> correct<00:03:31.830> but<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.130> don't

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
come back and be correct but I don't

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.160 
come back and be correct but I don't
want<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.580> do<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.910> I'll<00:03:33.690> show<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.050> little

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
want to do that I'll show you a little

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.280 
want to do that I'll show you a little
trick<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.769> need<00:03:35.459> this<00:03:35.880> one<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.390> be<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.870> this

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
trick I need this one to be in this

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.199 
trick I need this one to be in this
layer<00:03:37.590> here<00:03:38.100> I'm<00:03:38.160> not<00:03:38.430> going<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.670> flip<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:38.910> I'm

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
layer here I'm not going to flip it I'm

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.400 
layer here I'm not going to flip it I'm
just<00:03:39.570> going<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.750> turn<00:03:39.989> this<00:03:40.140> whole<00:03:40.200> thing

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
just going to turn this whole thing

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.490 
just going to turn this whole thing
upside<00:03:40.980> down<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:41.910> now<00:03:42.060> it's<00:03:42.269> it's<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.290> this

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
upside down so now it's it's in this

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.810 
upside down so now it's it's in this
layer<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.890> it's<00:03:43.980> even<00:03:44.190> closer<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.670> that's

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
layer and it's even closer so that's

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.820 
layer and it's even closer so that's
even<00:03:45.000> convenient<00:03:45.630> what<00:03:46.350> I'm<00:03:46.440> going<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.650> do<00:03:46.709> is

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
even convenient what I'm going to do is

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.280 
even convenient what I'm going to do is
kick<00:03:47.130> this<00:03:47.370> one<00:03:47.550> out<00:03:47.640> using<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.200> I'm

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
kick this one out using this so I'm

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.229 
kick this one out using this so I'm
going<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.500> kick<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.950> out<00:03:50.010> which<00:03:50.730> puts<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.120> in

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
going to kick that out which puts it in

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.479 
going to kick that out which puts it in
here<00:03:51.390> I'm<00:03:51.510> going<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.660> flip<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.200> over<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:53.459> I

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
here I'm going to flip this over so I

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.390 
here I'm going to flip this over so I
flip<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:56.209> when<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.239> put<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.630> back<00:03:58.400> you'll

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
flip it and when I put this back you'll

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.130 
flip it and when I put this back you'll
now<00:03:59.610> see<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.360> actually<00:04:00.690> put<00:04:00.810> that<00:04:00.959> back

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
now see that it actually put that back

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.190 
now see that it actually put that back
so<00:04:01.620> when<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:01.860> see<00:04:02.100> one<00:04:02.310> that's<00:04:02.430> opposite<00:04:03.060> of

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
so when you see one that's opposite of

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.430 
so when you see one that's opposite of
itself<00:04:04.200> like<00:04:05.269> this<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:06.630> can<00:04:06.780> see<00:04:07.019> here<00:04:07.260> we've

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
itself like this you can see here we've

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.440 
itself like this you can see here we've
got<00:04:07.650> two<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:07.980> are<00:04:08.070> opposite<00:04:08.489> well<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.299> can

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
got two that are opposite well you can

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.539 
got two that are opposite well you can
kick<00:04:09.750> one<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.110> these<00:04:10.230> out<00:04:10.440> flip<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.280> put<00:04:11.459> it

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
kick one of these out flip it and put it

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.670 
kick one of these out flip it and put it
back<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.970> then<00:04:12.420> you'll<00:04:12.570> have<00:04:12.690> three<00:04:13.080> you<00:04:13.590> know

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
back and then you'll have three you know

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.830 
back and then you'll have three you know
I<00:04:13.709> hope<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.220> makes<00:04:14.370> sense<00:04:14.510> but<00:04:15.510> we're<00:04:15.720> not

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
I hope that makes sense but we're not

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.180 
I hope that makes sense but we're not
working<00:04:15.989> on<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.260> one<00:04:16.500> yet<00:04:16.650> we<00:04:16.829> need<00:04:16.950> the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
working on that one yet we need the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.729 
working on that one yet we need the
other<00:04:17.370> yellow<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.269> red<00:04:18.450> which<00:04:18.959> is<00:04:18.989> right<00:04:19.380> here

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
other yellow and red which is right here

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.330 
other yellow and red which is right here
now

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
now

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.189 
now
in<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.609> case<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.209> think<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.870> would<00:04:21.989> just<00:04:22.019> be

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
in this case I think it would just be

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.920 
in this case I think it would just be
faster<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.949> to<00:04:23.880> put<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.180> up<00:04:24.419> in<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.690> top

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
faster to to put this up in the top

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.290 
faster to to put this up in the top
layer<00:04:25.250> bring<00:04:26.250> this<00:04:26.400> under<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.699> flip<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.210> and

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
layer bring this under it flip it and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.719 
layer bring this under it flip it and
put<00:04:27.449> it<00:04:27.540> back<00:04:27.570> then<00:04:28.139> to<00:04:28.440> actually<00:04:28.770> put<00:04:29.160> in<00:04:29.370> a

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
put it back then to actually put in a

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.439 
put it back then to actually put in a
whole<00:04:30.240> piece<00:04:30.930> like<00:04:31.169> this<00:04:31.550> when<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.910> have

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
whole piece like this when I have

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.240 
whole piece like this when I have
multiple<00:04:34.050> pieces<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.500> put<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:34.740> like<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:35.010> did<00:04:35.070> the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
multiple pieces to put in like I did the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.460 
multiple pieces to put in like I did the
orange<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.729> white<00:04:35.790> then<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.750> would<00:04:37.080> bring<00:04:37.260> out

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
orange and white then I would bring out

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.620 
orange and white then I would bring out
a<00:04:37.500> whole<00:04:37.620> thing<00:04:38.100> but<00:04:38.669> for<00:04:38.940> this<00:04:39.060> one<00:04:39.300> it's<00:04:39.570> just

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
a whole thing but for this one it's just

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.030 
a whole thing but for this one it's just
one<00:04:39.930> piece<00:04:40.199> so<00:04:40.350> I'm<00:04:40.440> not<00:04:40.530> going<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.800> bother

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
one piece so I'm not going to bother

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.820 
one piece so I'm not going to bother
with<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.340> but<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:42.360> don't<00:04:42.960> want<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.169> spend<00:04:43.740> the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
with that but I don't want to spend the

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.409 
with that but I don't want to spend the
time<00:04:44.010> doing<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.490> flipping<00:04:44.790> algorithm<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.270> put

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
time doing a flipping algorithm to put

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.790 
time doing a flipping algorithm to put
it<00:04:45.510> there<00:04:45.660> so<00:04:45.930> again<00:04:46.169> I'm<00:04:46.320> just<00:04:46.470> going<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.620> turn

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
it there so again I'm just going to turn

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.140 
it there so again I'm just going to turn
it<00:04:46.919> over<00:04:47.010> and<00:04:47.370> put<00:04:47.729> it<00:04:47.760> here

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
it over and put it here

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.590 
it over and put it here
and<00:04:48.270> then<00:04:48.870> I'll<00:04:48.990> bring<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.350> location

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
and then I'll bring the location

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.420 
and then I'll bring the location
underneath<00:04:51.600> it

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
underneath it

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.270 
underneath it
flipping<00:04:53.430> algorithm<00:04:56.120> put<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.210> back<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:58.280> you

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
flipping algorithm put it back and you

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.540 
flipping algorithm put it back and you
can<00:04:59.430> see<00:04:59.460> that<00:04:59.760> a<00:04:59.820> continue<00:05:00.979> okay<00:05:01.979> now<00:05:02.400> we're

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
can see that a continue okay now we're

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.790 
can see that a continue okay now we're
getting<00:05:02.639> to<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:02.910> fun<00:05:03.240> one<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.600> last<00:05:03.840> two<00:05:04.260> we

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
getting to the fun one the last two we

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.310 
getting to the fun one the last two we
got<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.160> green<00:05:05.460> orange<00:05:05.820> and<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.690> red<00:05:07.139> and

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
got the green orange and the red and

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.480 
got the green orange and the red and
blue<00:05:08.300> so<00:05:09.300> what<00:05:09.389> I'm<00:05:09.450> looking<00:05:09.720> for<00:05:09.930> here<00:05:10.290> is<00:05:10.490> the

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
blue so what I'm looking for here is the

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.000 
blue so what I'm looking for here is the
fastest<00:05:11.880> way<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.090> do<00:05:12.360> things<00:05:12.630> so<00:05:13.560> what<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:13.740> think

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
fastest way to do things so what I think

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.190 
fastest way to do things so what I think
I<00:05:14.130> would<00:05:14.280> do<00:05:14.490> is<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.510> can<00:05:15.660> see<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:15.900> these<00:05:16.139> two

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
I would do is I can see that these two

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.040 
I would do is I can see that these two
here<00:05:16.830> can<00:05:17.250> be<00:05:17.400> moved<00:05:17.669> under<00:05:18.090> here<00:05:18.449> and<00:05:18.570> they

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
here can be moved under here and they

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.140 
here can be moved under here and they
would<00:05:19.199> be<00:05:19.320> correct<00:05:19.889> with<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.490> center<00:05:20.970> piece

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
would be correct with the center piece

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.909 
would be correct with the center piece
so<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:21.360> would<00:05:21.510> put<00:05:21.660> them<00:05:21.750> there<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:22.110> would<00:05:22.620> flip

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
so I would put them there I would flip

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.620 
so I would put them there I would flip
them<00:05:23.190> which<00:05:23.370> would<00:05:23.490> keep<00:05:23.669> them<00:05:23.880> safe<00:05:24.150> up<00:05:24.360> here

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
them which would keep them safe up here

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.879 
them which would keep them safe up here
for<00:05:24.870> when<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.080> move<00:05:25.410> back<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:26.460> I<00:05:26.490> flip<00:05:26.850> them<00:05:30.889> and

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
for when I move back so I flip them and

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.230 
for when I move back so I flip them and
now<00:05:32.039> I<00:05:32.070> move<00:05:32.250> this<00:05:32.400> back<00:05:32.669> and<00:05:32.940> you<00:05:33.060> can<00:05:33.210> see

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
now I move this back and you can see

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.020 
now I move this back and you can see
that<00:05:33.539> we've<00:05:33.660> created<00:05:33.930> this<00:05:34.729> now<00:05:35.729> here's

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
that we've created this now here's

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.000 
that we've created this now here's
another<00:05:36.270> case<00:05:36.539> I<00:05:36.780> would<00:05:36.900> like<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.139> discuss<00:05:37.530> we

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
another case I would like to discuss we

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.650 
another case I would like to discuss we
see<00:05:38.310> we've<00:05:38.490> got<00:05:38.700> these<00:05:38.910> two<00:05:39.150> I<00:05:39.180> was<00:05:39.389> I<00:05:39.539> was

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
see we've got these two I was I was

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.120 
see we've got these two I was I was
actually<00:05:39.780> just<00:05:40.050> looking<00:05:40.410> at<00:05:40.530> this<00:05:40.680> saying<00:05:41.010> oh

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
actually just looking at this saying oh

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.860 
actually just looking at this saying oh
I<00:05:41.160> hope<00:05:41.430> that<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:41.729> other<00:05:41.970> one<00:05:42.419> that<00:05:42.539> belongs

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
I hope that the other one that belongs

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.029 
I hope that the other one that belongs
here<00:05:43.080> is<00:05:43.200> over<00:05:43.380> here<00:05:43.530> because<00:05:43.680> we<00:05:43.800> can<00:05:43.919> use

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
here is over here because we can use

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.589 
here is over here because we can use
that<00:05:44.160> same<00:05:44.370> maneuver<00:05:44.639> kick<00:05:44.970> it<00:05:45.090> out<00:05:45.210> flip<00:05:45.450> it

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
that same maneuver kick it out flip it

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.330 
that same maneuver kick it out flip it
put<00:05:45.630> it<00:05:45.810> back<00:05:45.840> but<00:05:46.500> you<00:05:46.590> can<00:05:46.650> see<00:05:46.979> it's<00:05:47.099> down

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
put it back but you can see it's down

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.390 
put it back but you can see it's down
here<00:05:47.700> so<00:05:48.479> there's<00:05:48.990> a<00:05:49.080> problem<00:05:49.470> so<00:05:50.130> what<00:05:50.280> we're

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
here so there's a problem so what we're

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.529 
here so there's a problem so what we're
going<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.550> do<00:05:50.700> is<00:05:50.820> we're<00:05:50.940> going<00:05:50.970> to<00:05:51.090> move<00:05:51.210> both

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
going to do is we're going to move both

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.810 
going to do is we're going to move both
of<00:05:51.750> these<00:05:51.840> out<00:05:52.080> into<00:05:52.349> the<00:05:53.070> layer<00:05:53.280> that's<00:05:53.580> not

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
of these out into the layer that's not

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.850 
of these out into the layer that's not
built<00:05:54.090> this<00:05:54.270> is<00:05:54.419> our<00:05:54.539> building<00:05:54.900> layer<00:05:55.050> now<00:05:55.260> so

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
built this is our building layer now so

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.990 
built this is our building layer now so
we're<00:05:55.979> going<00:05:56.099> to<00:05:56.160> move<00:05:56.280> both<00:05:56.490> of<00:05:56.550> these<00:05:56.789> out

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
we're going to move both of these out

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.070 
we're going to move both of these out
now<00:05:59.419> we're<00:06:00.419> going<00:06:00.510> to<00:06:00.570> flip<00:06:00.840> these<00:06:01.020> over

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
now we're going to flip these over

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.050 
now we're going to flip these over
because<00:06:01.710> they<00:06:01.860> were<00:06:01.889> flipped<00:06:02.430> incorrect<00:06:02.880> so

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
because they were flipped incorrect so

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.490 
because they were flipped incorrect so
if<00:06:03.120> we<00:06:03.240> flip<00:06:03.479> them<00:06:03.570> over<00:06:03.720> and<00:06:03.930> put<00:06:04.080> them<00:06:04.200> back

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
if we flip them over and put them back

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.159 
if we flip them over and put them back
they'll<00:06:05.160> be<00:06:05.340> correct<00:06:05.669> so<00:06:05.849> let's<00:06:06.000> flip<00:06:06.150> it<00:06:09.169> and

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
they'll be correct so let's flip it and

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:16.730 
they'll be correct so let's flip it and
now<00:06:10.940> put<00:06:11.940> them<00:06:12.030> back<00:06:13.760> now<00:06:14.760> we've<00:06:15.000> got<00:06:15.240> just<00:06:15.740> the

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
now put them back now we've got just the

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.050 
now put them back now we've got just the
one<00:06:16.770> left<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:17.990> here<00:06:18.990> we<00:06:19.229> can<00:06:19.349> see<00:06:19.650> that<00:06:20.060> this

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
one left and here we can see that this

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.029 
one left and here we can see that this
needs<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.419> go<00:06:21.660> in<00:06:21.690> but<00:06:22.289> I<00:06:22.320> can't<00:06:22.590> just<00:06:22.740> put<00:06:22.950> it

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
needs to go in but I can't just put it

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.830 
needs to go in but I can't just put it
in<00:06:23.190> because<00:06:23.789> I<00:06:23.849> have<00:06:23.880> nothing<00:06:24.120> on<00:06:24.360> the<00:06:24.450> top<00:06:24.660> to

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
in because I have nothing on the top to

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.029 
in because I have nothing on the top to
replace<00:06:25.169> it<00:06:25.349> with<00:06:25.470> so<00:06:25.650> we're<00:06:25.740> going<00:06:25.830> to<00:06:25.919> have

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
replace it with so we're going to have

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.370 
replace it with so we're going to have
to<00:06:26.160> use<00:06:26.250> the<00:06:26.370> flipping<00:06:26.669> algorithm<00:06:27.090> again<00:06:27.419> but

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
to use the flipping algorithm again but

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.570 
to use the flipping algorithm again but
I<00:06:29.990> I've<00:06:30.990> got<00:06:31.289> two<00:06:31.469> choices<00:06:31.710> here<00:06:32.039> okay<00:06:32.310> I<00:06:32.340> can

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
I I've got two choices here okay I can

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.279 
I I've got two choices here okay I can
either<00:06:32.700> use<00:06:33.599> the<00:06:33.719> flipping<00:06:34.050> out

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
either use the flipping out

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.189 
either use the flipping out
rhythm<00:06:34.559> to<00:06:35.009> flip<00:06:35.279> this<00:06:35.430> over<00:06:35.969> put<00:06:36.869> this<00:06:36.990> under

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 
rhythm to flip this over put this under

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.689 
rhythm to flip this over put this under
flip<00:06:37.949> it<00:06:38.099> again<00:06:38.189> put<00:06:38.849> it<00:06:38.939> back<00:06:39.149> or<00:06:39.449> I<00:06:40.550> can<00:06:41.550> put

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 
flip it again put it back or I can put

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.070 
flip it again put it back or I can put
this<00:06:41.789> over<00:06:41.969> here<00:06:42.089> by<00:06:42.389> turning<00:06:42.449> it<00:06:42.749> upside<00:06:42.869> down

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
this over here by turning it upside down

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.739 
this over here by turning it upside down
and<00:06:43.439> that's<00:06:43.680> a<00:06:43.800> lot<00:06:44.099> faster<00:06:44.759> so<00:06:45.389> I<00:06:45.419> think<00:06:45.539> I'm

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:45.749 
and that's a lot faster so I think I'm

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:47.179 
and that's a lot faster so I think I'm
going<00:06:45.899> to<00:06:45.930> do<00:06:46.050> that<00:06:46.229> now<00:06:46.860> I'm<00:06:46.919> going<00:06:46.949> to<00:06:47.099> bring

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:47.189 
going to do that now I'm going to bring

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:48.290 
going to do that now I'm going to bring
the<00:06:47.309> location<00:06:47.759> where<00:06:47.879> it<00:06:47.909> needs<00:06:48.089> to<00:06:48.210> be

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
the location where it needs to be

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.909 
the location where it needs to be
underneath<00:06:48.719> it<00:06:51.439> I'm<00:06:52.439> going<00:06:52.589> to<00:06:52.649> turn<00:06:52.800> this

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
underneath it I'm going to turn this

00:06:52.919 --> 00:07:00.129 
underneath it I'm going to turn this
over<00:06:53.129> and<00:06:56.059> I'm<00:06:57.059> going<00:06:57.180> to<00:06:57.210> put<00:06:57.330> it<00:06:57.419> back<00:06:57.979> and

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:00.139 
over and I'm going to put it back and

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:04.129 
over and I'm going to put it back and
you<00:07:01.139> can<00:07:01.289> see<00:07:01.559> that<00:07:01.860> that<00:07:02.119> has<00:07:03.119> fixed<00:07:03.539> all<00:07:03.809> of

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
you can see that that has fixed all of

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.320 
you can see that that has fixed all of
our<00:07:04.259> edges<00:07:04.589> without<00:07:04.710> parity<00:07:05.460> but<00:07:05.969> this<00:07:06.149> wasn't

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
our edges without parity but this wasn't

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.389 
our edges without parity but this wasn't
a<00:07:06.479> parody<00:07:06.779> tutorial<00:07:07.289> anyways<00:07:07.649> it's<00:07:08.309> not

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:08.399 
a parody tutorial anyways it's not

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:10.219 
a parody tutorial anyways it's not
really<00:07:08.639> tutorials<00:07:09.059> just<00:07:09.089> a<00:07:09.270> walkthrough<00:07:09.749> but

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
really tutorials just a walkthrough but

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.839 
really tutorials just a walkthrough but
that's<00:07:10.439> how<00:07:10.589> I<00:07:10.619> do<00:07:10.740> the<00:07:10.949> last<00:07:11.129> four<00:07:11.459> it's<00:07:11.669> the

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:11.849 
that's how I do the last four it's the

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:13.399 
that's how I do the last four it's the
flipping<00:07:12.240> algorithm<00:07:12.749> and<00:07:12.899> I<00:07:13.169> pretty<00:07:13.319> much

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:13.409 
flipping algorithm and I pretty much

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:15.290 
flipping algorithm and I pretty much
demonstrated<00:07:14.189> pretty<00:07:14.369> much<00:07:14.490> every<00:07:14.789> case<00:07:15.059> that

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
demonstrated pretty much every case that

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.749 
demonstrated pretty much every case that
you<00:07:15.389> can<00:07:15.569> get<00:07:16.219> to<00:07:17.219> use<00:07:17.369> the<00:07:17.490> flipping

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 
you can get to use the flipping

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:18.679 
you can get to use the flipping
algorithm<00:07:18.119> there's<00:07:18.300> just<00:07:18.449> certain<00:07:18.539> things

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:18.689 
algorithm there's just certain things

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:19.670 
algorithm there's just certain things
you<00:07:18.869> got<00:07:19.020> to<00:07:19.110> look<00:07:19.169> for<00:07:19.409> like<00:07:19.529> those

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
you got to look for like those

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.709 
you got to look for like those
upside-down<00:07:20.069> pieces<00:07:20.759> you<00:07:21.240> know<00:07:21.360> and<00:07:21.449> then<00:07:21.539> put

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:21.719 
upside-down pieces you know and then put

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:22.639 
upside-down pieces you know and then put
the<00:07:21.839> one<00:07:21.959> that's<00:07:22.110> supposed<00:07:22.199> to<00:07:22.409> be<00:07:22.469> there

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:22.649 
the one that's supposed to be there

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:24.529 
the one that's supposed to be there
there<00:07:23.099> flip<00:07:23.490> it<00:07:23.610> and<00:07:23.699> put<00:07:23.789> it<00:07:23.879> back<00:07:23.909> it's

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 
there flip it and put it back it's

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:26.119 
there flip it and put it back it's
really<00:07:24.899> fast<00:07:25.199> that<00:07:25.439> way<00:07:25.499> you've<00:07:25.709> just<00:07:25.979> created

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:26.129 
really fast that way you've just created

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:28.429 
really fast that way you've just created
three<00:07:26.580> pieces<00:07:26.849> with<00:07:27.479> one<00:07:27.719> move<00:07:28.080> you<00:07:28.259> know<00:07:28.349> what

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:28.439 
three pieces with one move you know what

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:29.719 
three pieces with one move you know what
I<00:07:28.499> mean<00:07:28.619> like<00:07:28.740> it<00:07:28.889> just<00:07:29.099> it<00:07:29.279> works<00:07:29.490> really

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:29.729 
I mean like it just it works really

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:31.369 
I mean like it just it works really
really<00:07:29.819> well<00:07:30.029> and<00:07:30.719> there's<00:07:30.899> little<00:07:31.080> tricks<00:07:31.289> to

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:31.379 
really well and there's little tricks to

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:32.779 
really well and there's little tricks to
look<00:07:31.559> out<00:07:31.709> for<00:07:31.860> like<00:07:32.009> that<00:07:32.129> same<00:07:32.399> with<00:07:32.520> the<00:07:32.610> two

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:32.789 
look out for like that same with the two

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:36.739 
look out for like that same with the two
flipped<00:07:33.119> you<00:07:33.869> know<00:07:33.990> like<00:07:34.110> that<00:07:34.319> so<00:07:35.219> anyways<00:07:35.749> if

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:36.749 
flipped you know like that so anyways if

00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:38.389 
flipped you know like that so anyways if
you<00:07:36.809> guys<00:07:36.930> want<00:07:37.319> some<00:07:37.559> more<00:07:37.709> like<00:07:37.979> maybe<00:07:38.189> for

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:38.399 
you guys want some more like maybe for

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:41.059 
you guys want some more like maybe for
the<00:07:38.459> 7<00:07:38.729> by<00:07:38.849> 7<00:07:38.909> the<00:07:39.599> 8<00:07:39.749> by<00:07:39.930> 8<00:07:39.959> you<00:07:40.740> know<00:07:40.860> want<00:07:41.009> me

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:41.069 
the 7 by 7 the 8 by 8 you know want me

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:42.379 
the 7 by 7 the 8 by 8 you know want me
to<00:07:41.159> go<00:07:41.249> through<00:07:41.519> it<00:07:41.610> for<00:07:41.639> that<00:07:41.879> especially<00:07:42.330> the

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:42.389 
to go through it for that especially the

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:43.699 
to go through it for that especially the
8<00:07:42.479> by<00:07:42.659> 8<00:07:42.689> it's<00:07:42.959> a<00:07:43.050> little<00:07:43.229> bit<00:07:43.319> different<00:07:43.499> you

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:43.709 
8 by 8 it's a little bit different you

00:07:43.709 --> 00:07:45.949 
8 by 8 it's a little bit different you
know<00:07:43.860> it's<00:07:43.979> it's<00:07:44.219> tricky<00:07:44.639> for<00:07:45.539> the<00:07:45.569> last<00:07:45.779> 2

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:45.959 
know it's it's tricky for the last 2

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:47.749 
know it's it's tricky for the last 2
centers<00:07:46.289> on<00:07:46.439> the<00:07:46.559> edges<00:07:46.860> so<00:07:47.009> let<00:07:47.550> me<00:07:47.639> know

00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 
centers on the edges so let me know

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.369 
centers on the edges so let me know
thanks<00:07:48.689> for<00:07:48.779> watching<00:07:48.990> I'll<00:07:49.080> see<00:07:49.110> you<00:07:49.229> on<00:07:49.319> my
