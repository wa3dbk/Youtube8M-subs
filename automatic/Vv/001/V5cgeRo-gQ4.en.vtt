with a new side grommet which is
different<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:44.969> stringing<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
different for stringing so if you are to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.910 
different for stringing so if you are to
track<00:00:46.050> these<00:00:46.140> records<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> want<00:00:46.829> to

track these records and you want to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.170 
track these records and you want to
restring<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> make<00:00:47.520> sure<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.730> check<00:00:47.969> at<00:00:48.120> the

otherwise<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.219> make<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.550> fly<00:00:53.730> confused<00:00:54.180> now

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
otherwise you make it fly confused now

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.880 
otherwise you make it fly confused now
that's<00:00:54.989> got<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> little<00:00:55.260> bit<00:00:55.440> more<00:00:55.559> about<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
that's got a little bit more about the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.619 
that's got a little bit more about the
new<00:00:56.090> technology<00:00:57.090> they've<00:00:57.210> put<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
new technology they've put into the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.810 
new technology they've put into the
handle<00:00:57.899> okay<00:00:58.649> well<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.550> we're

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
handle okay well as you can see we're

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.130 
handle okay well as you can see we're
holding<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:01.260> 400<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.219> 400<00:01:02.820> tour<00:01:03.149> basically

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
holding the 400 and 400 tour basically

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
holding the 400 and 400 tour basically
it's<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.350> show<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.860> it's<00:01:05.519> got<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> anatomic

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it's to show that it's got the anatomic

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.969 
it's to show that it's got the anatomic
construction<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.930> both<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> them<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> again

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
construction on both of them and again

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.340 
construction on both of them and again
this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.250> inspired<00:01:08.640> by<00:01:08.700> nature<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.270> adds<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this is inspired by nature it adds a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.020 
this is inspired by nature it adds a
little<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> extra<00:01:10.920> strength<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.700> core

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
little bit of extra strength to the core

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.600 
little bit of extra strength to the core
here<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:13.260> combined<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> HM<00:01:14.250> 6

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
here and it's combined with the HM 6

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.550 
here and it's combined with the HM 6
carbon<00:01:15.060> material<00:01:15.509> which<00:01:15.659> that's<00:01:16.110> stiffness

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
carbon material which that's stiffness

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.960 
carbon material which that's stiffness
of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> correct<00:01:17.040> points<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> racket

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
of the correct points of the racket

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.940 
of the correct points of the racket
really<00:01:18.509> determines<00:01:19.020> how<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.170> racket<00:01:19.530> flexes

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
really determines how the racket flexes

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
really determines how the racket flexes
now<00:01:20.340> they're<00:01:20.490> both<00:01:20.610> quite<00:01:20.850> stiff<00:01:21.180> racket<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
now they're both quite stiff racket and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.920 
now they're both quite stiff racket and
they<00:01:22.740> actually<00:01:23.299> surprisingly<00:01:24.299> plate<00:01:24.630> like

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
they actually surprisingly plate like

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.399 
they actually surprisingly plate like
quite<00:01:25.140> stiff<00:01:25.380> racket<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.840> really<00:01:27.840> enjoyed<00:01:28.170> both

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
quite stiff racket I really enjoyed both

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.910 
quite stiff racket I really enjoyed both
of<00:01:28.619> them<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.240> 300<00:01:30.240> tour<00:01:30.420> sorry<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.259> little

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
of them the 300 tour sorry is a little

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.319 
of them the 300 tour sorry is a little
bit<00:01:32.070> heavier<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.520> was<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> little<00:01:32.850> bit<00:01:33.060> less

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
bit heavier it was a little bit less

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.090 
bit heavier it was a little bit less
maneuverable<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:34.710> really<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
maneuverable and it will really be a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.920 
maneuverable and it will really be a
personal<00:01:35.490> preference<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.509> both<00:01:36.689> hit

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
personal preference to they both hit

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.719 
personal preference to they both hit
loads<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.590> spin<00:01:37.799> from<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> court

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
loads of spin from the back of the court

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.940 
loads of spin from the back of the court
you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.270> also<00:01:39.420> flatten<00:01:40.049> them<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.530> said<00:01:40.829> in

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you can also flatten them out I said in

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380 
you can also flatten them out I said in
the<00:01:41.040> other<00:01:41.070> review<00:01:41.490> they're<00:01:41.640> very<00:01:41.820> versatile

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the other review they're very versatile

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.899 
the other review they're very versatile
and<00:01:42.540> I'll<00:01:42.659> stick<00:01:42.960> by<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.640> really

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and I'll stick by that and you do really

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.300 
and I'll stick by that and you do really
get<00:01:45.060> out<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.360> put<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.320> serving<00:01:47.100> with

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
get out what you put it the serving with

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.399 
get out what you put it the serving with
the<00:01:47.549> tour<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.240> actually<00:01:48.390> prefer<00:01:48.960> because<00:01:49.320> it's

little bit my foot works not the best
and<00:02:05.149> my<00:02:05.210> hands<00:02:05.540> aren't<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:05.780> best<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.220> this

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
and my hands aren't the best and this

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.339 
and my hands aren't the best and this
racket<00:02:07.670> really<00:02:08.270> helped<00:02:08.539> me<00:02:08.690> out<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:09.170> got

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
it's more of an oval head shape so you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.620 
it's more of an oval head shape so you
know<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.340> don't<00:02:13.459> have<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.790> be<00:02:13.910> quite<00:02:14.120> as<00:02:14.270> precise

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
know I don't have to be quite as precise

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
feel on the rackets great so I could

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.740 
feel on the rackets great so I could
really<00:02:18.770> found<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.220> could<00:02:19.489> drop<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.209> ball<00:02:20.390> short
