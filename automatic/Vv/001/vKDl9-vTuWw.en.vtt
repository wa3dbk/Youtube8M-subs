00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.220 
crazy card because he's still six foot
he's<00:02:59.820> like<00:02:59.940> six<00:03:00.090> foot<00:03:00.330> two<00:03:00.600> or<00:03:00.780> something<00:03:00.990> as

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
he's like six foot two or something as

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.060 
he's like six foot two or something as
well<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.920> when<00:03:02.100> once<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.550> do<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:04.320> sky's

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
well so when once you do that the sky's

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.280 
well so when once you do that the sky's
the<00:03:05.100> limit<00:03:05.310> basically<00:03:06.150> he<00:03:06.540> turns<00:03:06.840> into<00:03:07.050> an

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
the limit basically he turns into an

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.730 
the limit basically he turns into an
absolute<00:03:08.010> monster<00:03:08.700> now<00:03:09.330> where<00:03:09.630> this<00:03:10.470> squads

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
absolute monster now where this squads

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.740 
absolute monster now where this squads
about<00:03:10.950> three<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.400> half<00:03:11.430> million<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.690> you

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
about three and a half million so you

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.060 
about three and a half million so you
could<00:03:12.959> replace<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.470> with<00:03:13.590> people<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
could replace that with people like the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.160 
could replace that with people like the
regular<00:03:14.220> yar<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.000> regular<00:03:15.360> David<00:03:15.660> Luiz<00:03:15.930> all

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
regular yar the regular David Luiz all

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.690 
regular yar the regular David Luiz all

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
of that good stuff and it's going to

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.220 
of that good stuff and it's going to
