what's going on out there is that you
guys<00:00:16.309> we're<00:00:16.460> all<00:00:16.550> going<00:00:16.850> into<00:00:17.060> your<00:00:17.180> busy

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
guys we're all going into your busy

guys we're all going into your busy
spring<00:00:17.780> you<00:00:18.050> know<00:00:18.140> typically<00:00:18.560> a<00:00:18.590> practice

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
spring you know typically a practice

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.339 
spring you know typically a practice
will<00:00:19.160> slow<00:00:19.400> down<00:00:19.429> in<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:19.880> fall<00:00:20.140> going<00:00:21.140> into

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:21.349 
will slow down in the fall going into

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:22.839 
will slow down in the fall going into
winter<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:21.859> then<00:00:21.980> about<00:00:22.130> this<00:00:22.310> time<00:00:22.519> of<00:00:22.550> year

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
winter and then about this time of year

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.460 
winter and then about this time of year
where<00:00:23.029> an<00:00:23.150> early<00:00:23.449> March<00:00:23.720> it<00:00:23.900> starts<00:00:24.109> to<00:00:24.230> take

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
where an early March it starts to take

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.290 
where an early March it starts to take
off<00:00:24.679> those<00:00:25.310> of<00:00:25.519> you<00:00:25.609> in<00:00:25.730> large<00:00:25.939> animal

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
off those of you in large animal

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.820 
off those of you in large animal
practice<00:00:26.480> you're<00:00:26.869> running<00:00:27.109> that<00:00:27.259> wild<00:00:27.679> and

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
practice you're running that wild and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.950 
practice you're running that wild and
crazy<00:00:28.130> up<00:00:28.640> doing<00:00:29.060> c-sections<00:00:29.630> in<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.779> middle

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
crazy up doing c-sections in the middle

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.269 
crazy up doing c-sections in the middle
of<00:00:30.050> night<00:00:30.169> the<00:00:30.410> small<00:00:30.650> animal<00:00:30.890> guys<00:00:31.070> you've

of night the small animal guys you've
got<00:00:31.400> a<00:00:31.429> lot<00:00:31.609> of<00:00:31.640> you<00:00:31.880> know<00:00:31.939> kind<00:00:32.150> of<00:00:32.180> bite

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
got a lot of you know kind of bite

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.720 
got a lot of you know kind of bite
wounds<00:00:32.689> coming<00:00:32.870> in<00:00:33.280> animals<00:00:34.280> who<00:00:34.370> start<00:00:34.579> need

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
wounds coming in animals who start need

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.980 
wounds coming in animals who start need
to<00:00:34.760> get<00:00:34.940> out<00:00:35.060> and<00:00:35.180> move<00:00:35.330> around<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:35.810> then<00:00:35.900> on

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
to get out and move around and then on

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.510 
to get out and move around and then on
top<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:36.380> we've<00:00:36.530> got<00:00:36.680> heart<00:00:36.920> room<00:00:37.070> testing

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
top of that we've got heart room testing

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.040 
top of that we've got heart room testing
and<00:00:37.670> all<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.150> replenishing<00:00:38.690> of<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:38.900> heart

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
and all the replenishing of the heart

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.200 
and all the replenishing of the heart
room<00:00:39.200> meds<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:40.460> far<00:00:40.640> that<00:00:40.730> goes<00:00:40.880> on<00:00:41.090> and

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
room meds and so far that goes on and

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.330 
room meds and so far that goes on and
early<00:00:41.420> spring<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.140> bottom<00:00:42.470> line<00:00:42.620> in<00:00:42.860> this

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
early spring so the bottom line in this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.070 
early spring so the bottom line in this
is<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.670> time<00:00:43.940> of<00:00:44.090> year<00:00:44.330> where<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:44.720> should<00:00:44.930> be

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
is the time of year where you should be

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.930 
is the time of year where you should be
nice<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.590> busy<00:00:45.740> and<00:00:46.070> you<00:00:46.460> should<00:00:46.670> be<00:00:46.790> making

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
nice and busy and you should be making

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.790 
nice and busy and you should be making
lots<00:00:47.240> of<00:00:47.450> money<00:00:47.600> but<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.110> problem<00:00:48.530> that<00:00:48.560> we

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
lots of money but the problem that we

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.010 
lots of money but the problem that we
went<00:00:49.010> into<00:00:49.160> is<00:00:49.430> this<00:00:49.690> typically<00:00:50.690> what<00:00:50.900> will

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
went into is this typically what will

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.010 
went into is this typically what will
happen<00:00:51.440> is<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:52.160> as<00:00:52.430> your<00:00:52.790> numbers<00:00:53.600> start<00:00:53.870> to

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
happen is that as your numbers start to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.830 
happen is that as your numbers start to
go<00:00:54.170> up<00:00:54.200> like<00:00:54.560> this<00:00:54.790> okay<00:00:55.790> this<00:00:56.240> is<00:00:56.390> your<00:00:56.510> number

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
go up like this okay this is your number

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.140 
go up like this okay this is your number
of<00:00:56.930> transactions<00:00:57.910> typically<00:00:58.910> what<00:00:59.120> happens

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
of transactions typically what happens

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.870 
of transactions typically what happens
is<00:00:59.900> that<00:01:00.470> your<00:01:00.680> average<00:01:01.040> plant<00:01:01.280> transactions

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
is that your average plant transactions

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.280 
is that your average plant transactions
start<00:01:02.090> to<00:01:02.180> go<00:01:02.300> up<00:01:02.450> and<00:01:02.660> then<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:02.900> starts<00:01:03.200> to

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
start to go up and then it starts to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.460 
start to go up and then it starts to
peak<00:01:03.590> and<00:01:03.800> it<00:01:04.009> falls<00:01:04.339> off<00:01:04.720> we<00:01:05.720> actually<00:01:05.900> reach

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
peak and it falls off we actually reach

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.520 
peak and it falls off we actually reach
at<00:01:07.130> what<00:01:07.370> I<00:01:07.400> call<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.060> maximum<00:01:08.810> clients<00:01:09.320> per

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
at what I call the maximum clients per

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.680 
at what I call the maximum clients per
minute<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.980> maximum<00:01:10.460> CPM<00:01:11.060> that's<00:01:11.420> like<00:01:11.540> their

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
minute the maximum CPM that's like their

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.570 
minute the maximum CPM that's like their
the<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:11.990> rate<00:01:12.470> limiter<00:01:12.860> on<00:01:12.980> a<00:01:13.010> car<00:01:13.370> engine

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
the the rate limiter on a car engine

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.150 
the the rate limiter on a car engine
that'll<00:01:14.330> cut<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.230> what<00:01:15.350> happens<00:01:15.740> we<00:01:15.980> see

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
that'll cut it and what happens we see

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.500 
that'll cut it and what happens we see
this<00:01:16.280> routinely<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.000> use<00:01:17.150> just<00:01:17.420> as

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
this routinely is that use just as

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.610 
this routinely is that use just as
you're<00:01:17.630> starting<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:17.930> get<00:01:18.020> really<00:01:18.260> busy<00:01:18.409> and

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
you're starting to get really busy and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.020 
you're starting to get really busy and
you<00:01:18.680> should<00:01:18.860> be<00:01:18.950> making<00:01:19.100> great<00:01:19.430> profit<00:01:19.909> in<00:01:19.970> the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
you should be making great profit in the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.060 
you should be making great profit in the
practice<00:01:20.480> your<00:01:21.080> average<00:01:21.320> client<00:01:21.500> transaction

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
practice your average client transaction

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.870 
practice your average client transaction
falls<00:01:22.250> down<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.330> reason<00:01:23.720> for<00:01:23.900> that<00:01:23.960> is

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
falls down so the reason for that is

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.340 
falls down so the reason for that is
interruptions<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.330> what<00:01:26.630> will<00:01:26.750> happen<00:01:27.200> is

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
interruptions and what will happen is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.260 
interruptions and what will happen is
that<00:01:27.380> when<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.070> I<00:01:28.130> are<00:01:28.159> super<00:01:28.700> busy<00:01:28.850> and

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
that when you and I are super busy and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.210 
that when you and I are super busy and
we're<00:01:29.840> working<00:01:30.020> with<00:01:30.290> patients<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.800> so<00:01:30.950> forth

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
we're working with patients and so forth

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.860 
we're working with patients and so forth
just<00:01:31.280> as<00:01:31.640> we're<00:01:31.790> about<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:32.060> complete<00:01:32.600> writing

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
just as we're about to complete writing

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.870 
just as we're about to complete writing
up<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.229> record<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:33.740> all<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.250> charges<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.670> so

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
up the record and all the charges and so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.700 
up the record and all the charges and so
forth<00:01:35.120> we'll<00:01:35.420> get<00:01:35.540> into<00:01:35.690> an<00:01:35.870> interruption<00:01:36.560> or

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
forth we'll get into an interruption or
