00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.910
 games as advertising when they come out today 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.370
 games that clone something 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.170
 they usually advertises the phone well 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.179
 such as a poster racing game 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.040
 insert any advertising or there 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.520
 real cars in the same racing games 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.220
 or real footballers out there 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.230
 that is, advertising is a background if today 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.960
 is the game that bought exactly what 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.599
 it is usually a game in the browser 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.109
 That is, the game writes either in flash, which is like 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.380
 the rule 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.540
 more often occurs either on html5 which k 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.910
 Unfortunately today not in all browsers 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.770
 works the same way the game is written 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.850
 In this way, forget far from everyone 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.030
 site visitors 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.379
 that of course you need to consider yes but there were 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.210
 times when these games are not easy 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.780
 created games that are something 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.180
 advertise 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.550
 but laid out for free naturally 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.469
 were not for browsers where games 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.390
 browser in the year this 95 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.460
 they could simply be downloaded from either the site 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.309
 companies or for example with a baby ski 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.870
 and start playing this and today's game 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.549
 of these here we are playing beer and this 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.920
 beer shoots and destroys another beer 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.049
 the plot with more than curious is not in the game 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.119
 really have a plot but if you want 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.420
 read out and not the main game 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.570
 process and it's funny that is, we are flying 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.479
 we shoot with the help of poobag more precisely covers 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 and all we fly we shoot letting we shoot 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.100
 nothing special well, except for 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.409
 entourage of course the game consists of five 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.479
 levels the first level is very simple then 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.729
 there are literally having in 30 seconds 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.020
 40 and lose it almost impossible 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.630
 Well, unless of course specifically 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.579
 try and between levels we can 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.200
 buy various other beer bottles 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.880
 that is, our u taboo remains 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.820
 near suspended on your chosen 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.040
 position still bottles and they along with you 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.110
 fly and shoot and hit them 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.060
 You do not have to destroy so very 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.979
 watch carefully for what flies you 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.990
 and dodge only central 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.030
 the bottle is not the rest is a bit 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.890
 complicates the process and 1 equals simplifies 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.229
 because you can 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.570
 don't follow so here between levels we 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.179
 buy these bonus bottles plus you can 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.129
 buy extra life 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.469
 more likely akk and a bonus on a bottle too 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.989
 different ones shoot back others by 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:18.530
 some tricky corner 3 passes doody 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.840
 incomprehensible 4 self-guided general choice 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.299
 rich but what I want to mention is the game 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.879
 complicated at least she to me 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.760
 seemed very complex I personally reach 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.569
 where then 1 3 3 levels of today 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.090
 I will remind 5 and 1 absolutely no yes 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.040
 I play hard you try it yourself 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.049
 maybe you will have better luck but not 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.599
 less it seemed very hard for me 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.700
 this video from level five I want you 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.799
 show found on y tube itself not 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.230
 give as I said could not in this 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.379
 level opponents act themselves 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.750
 You see that if the appearance of packs there 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.849
 Aspirin mile toilet bowls, I still understand and 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.859
 from and the level is called money after 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.840
 it is clear what day and then even 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.629
 comment is not worth the appearance 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.099
 enemies like microsoft windows emblems 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.889
 or emblems 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.959
 apple is completely incomprehensible to me 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.969
 attitude do not know in general 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.949
 the atmosphere of the game is more than insane it 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.440
 cool for a long time not the madness of the game 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:17.750
 which you are in the role of camels along with 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.659
 a goat who rides you 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.010
 shoot from falling umbrellas 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.079
 certainly not up to this level falls short 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.819
 But in general, in principle, the toy is cool 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.620
 I recommend trying 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.720
 lovers of scoo shooters because they 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.790
 very difficult and again I repeat 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.949
 my feelings and in the comments I wanted 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.669
 would hear from you go you know 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:39.949
 crazy toys or what crazy but 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.620
 promotional free promotional 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:44.720
 and no browser is exactly old i 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.090
 I will highlight the juice especially because 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.629
 what kind of toys is there a course under for example 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.069
 or they could lose their ads 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.259
 sold on computer cartridges 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.000
 and buys with people and I wonder 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:58.220
 what games are exactly free companies 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.500
 promoted to tell about your 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.780
 products to computer players or 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.009
 they want to be free for consoles 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.699
 this is rare so we limit ourselves 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.250
 by computers 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.900
 Well, something like this, I really hope that we 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.370
 see will not be considered huge because 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.590
 that I don't even know where it is possible 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.500
 to find and whether it is sold in Russia at all 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.910
 through official channels so I am very 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.670
 hope so 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.800
 here somehow and all thanks for attention 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.800
 and wait for your comments bye
