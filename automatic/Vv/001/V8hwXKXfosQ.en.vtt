have that on the end of a sniper rifle
that's<00:00:32.820> gonna<00:00:33.000> that's<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.540> gonna<00:00:33.630> give<00:00:33.809> away

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
that's gonna that's just gonna give away

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.810 
that's gonna that's just gonna give away
your<00:00:34.140> position<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.770> while<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> guess<00:00:35.579> some

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
your position and while I guess some

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.209 
your position and while I guess some
could<00:00:36.000> argue<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.809> laser<00:00:37.140> beam<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
could argue that the laser beam or the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.400 
could argue that the laser beam or the
laser<00:00:38.489> sight<00:00:38.850> laser<00:00:39.120> beam<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.780> laser<00:00:40.020> sight

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
laser sight laser beam the laser sight

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.920 
laser sight laser beam the laser sight
is<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.160> decent<00:00:41.820> attachment<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.750> can

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
is a decent attachment because you can

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.290 
is a decent attachment because you can
get<00:00:43.050> no<00:00:43.590> scopes<00:00:43.920> off<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> little<00:00:44.520> bit<00:00:44.700> easier<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
get no scopes off a little bit easier it

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.410 
get no scopes off a little bit easier it
doesn't<00:00:45.960> suit<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.710> Recon<00:00:47.070> class<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:47.969> I've

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
doesn't suit the Recon class and so I've

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.270 
doesn't suit the Recon class and so I've
kind<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.840> come<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.739> couple<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
kind of come up with just a couple of

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.340 
kind of come up with just a couple of
ideas<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> would<00:00:51.270> kind<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> see

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
ideas that I would kind of like to see

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.619 
ideas that I would kind of like to see
in<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.219> upcoming<00:00:53.250> game<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.449> would

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
in the upcoming game that would

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.930 
in the upcoming game that would
hopefully<00:00:54.780> give<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.649> Recon<00:00:56.039> class<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.610> little

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
hopefully give the Recon class a little

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.660 
hopefully give the Recon class a little
bit<00:00:57.149> more<00:00:57.660> customization<00:00:58.520> especially<00:00:59.520> when

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
bit more customization especially when

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.970 
bit more customization especially when
they're<00:00:59.969> using<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.570> bolt-action<00:01:00.960> rifles<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
they're using the bolt-action rifles and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.770 
they're using the bolt-action rifles and
so<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.460> first<00:01:02.699> thing<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.210> kind<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.480> had<00:01:03.660> in

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
so the first thing that I kind of had in

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
so the first thing that I kind of had in
mind<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> implement<00:01:04.650> three<00:01:05.220> different

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
mind is to implement three different

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.250 
mind is to implement three different
bullet<00:01:06.060> types<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.600> first<00:01:06.840> bullet<00:01:07.020> type

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
bullet types and the first bullet type

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.929 
bullet types and the first bullet type
would<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.439> exactly<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.640> in

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
would be exactly like what we have in

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.060 
would be exactly like what we have in
battle<00:01:09.689> 2<00:01:09.780> 3<00:01:10.020> where<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.710> an<00:01:10.830> upper

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
battle 2 3 where if you get an upper

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.130 
battle 2 3 where if you get an upper
chest<00:01:11.310> shot<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.760> an<00:01:12.060> upper<00:01:12.330> chest<00:01:12.540> body<00:01:12.750> shot

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
chest shot or an upper chest body shot

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.840 
chest shot or an upper chest body shot
up<00:01:13.530> close<00:01:13.950> you're<00:01:14.159> gonna<00:01:14.220> drop<00:01:14.520> them<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.820> one

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
up close you're gonna drop them in one

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.880 
up close you're gonna drop them in one
shot<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.780> anything<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.290> medium<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> long

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
shot but then anything at medium to long

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.740 
shot but then anything at medium to long
range<00:01:17.159> you're<00:01:17.670> still<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.240> need<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> get

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
range you're still going to need to get

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.810 
range you're still going to need to get
a<00:01:18.960> head<00:01:19.200> shot<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.590> drop<00:01:19.830> them<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.549> then<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
a head shot to drop them but then the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
a head shot to drop them but then the
other<00:01:21.000> bullet<00:01:21.240> type<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.720> had<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.080> mind<00:01:22.259> is

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
other bullet type that I had in mind is

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.289 
other bullet type that I had in mind is
something<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> does<00:01:23.220> less<00:01:23.490> damage<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.119> it's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
something that does less damage and it's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.880 
something that does less damage and it's
not<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> give<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> one-shot<00:01:25.619> kill

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
not going to give you the one-shot kill

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.740 
not going to give you the one-shot kill
even<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.430> you're<00:01:26.549> up<00:01:26.759> close<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.360> hit<00:01:27.540> them

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
even if you're up close and you hit them

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.450 
even if you're up close and you hit them
in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> upper<00:01:28.290> chest<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
in the upper chest but it's going to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.700 
in the upper chest but it's going to
travel<00:01:29.850> extremely<00:01:30.390> fast<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.530> gonna<00:01:31.619> be

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
travel extremely fast and it's gonna be

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
travel extremely fast and it's gonna be

long<00:01:34.590> range<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
long range it's going to get to the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.010 
long range it's going to get to the
target<00:01:35.820> faster<00:01:36.390> they're<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.869> have

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
target faster they're not going to have

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.319 
target faster they're not going to have
to<00:01:37.140> deal<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.770> much<00:01:38.070> bullet<00:01:38.729> travel<00:01:39.119> speed

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
to deal with as much bullet travel speed

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.240 
to deal with as much bullet travel speed
and<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> would<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.810> perfect<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.950> type<00:01:40.979> of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and it would be perfect for that type of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.160 
and it would be perfect for that type of
play<00:01:41.549> style<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.750> third<00:01:42.960> option

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
play style and then the third option

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.560 
play style and then the third option
would<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.280> completely<00:01:44.759> opposite<00:01:45.390> end

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
would be on the completely opposite end

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.760 
would be on the completely opposite end
of<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.659> spectrum<00:01:45.899> where<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> hit

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
of the spectrum where it's going to hit

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.490 
of the spectrum where it's going to hit
really<00:01:47.189> hard<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:48.149> one-shot<00:01:48.960> killing

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
really hard that one-shot killing

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.380 
really hard that one-shot killing
potential<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:50.100> an<00:01:50.159> upper<00:01:50.430> chest<00:01:50.700> shot<00:01:50.909> would

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
potential for an upper chest shot would

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.630 
potential for an upper chest shot would
be<00:01:51.540> extended<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> drawback<00:01:52.920> would<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.490> is

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
be extended but the drawback would be is

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.280 
be extended but the drawback would be is
that<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.850> has<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> lot<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> bullet<00:01:54.780> drop<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that it has a lot of bullet drop and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.749 
that it has a lot of bullet drop and
it's<00:01:55.409> gonna<00:01:55.500> take<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.860> lot<00:01:56.009> longer<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.399> reach

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
it's gonna take it a lot longer to reach

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.160 
it's gonna take it a lot longer to reach
its<00:01:57.000> target<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.600> not<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.049> very

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
its target so it's not going to be very

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.289 
its target so it's not going to be very
good<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.710> long-range<00:01:59.670> combat<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.210> be

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
good for long-range combat but be

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.179 
good for long-range combat but be
perfect<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.259> players<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.159> play

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
perfect for players that like to play

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.249 
perfect for players that like to play
the<00:02:02.610> aggressive<00:02:03.149> recon<00:02:03.360> role<00:02:03.750> they<00:02:03.869> really

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the aggressive recon role they really

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.649 
the aggressive recon role they really
enjoy<00:02:04.590> they<00:02:05.100> really<00:02:05.430> enjoy<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.450> type<00:02:06.630> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
enjoy they really enjoy that type of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.300 
enjoy they really enjoy that type of
play<00:02:06.930> style<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.649> think<00:02:07.890> if<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.160> added

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
play style and I think if they added

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.690 
play style and I think if they added
just<00:02:08.970> these<00:02:09.179> three

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
just these three

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.940 
just these three
types<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.239> bullets<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:11.050> would<00:02:11.200> open<00:02:11.349> up<00:02:11.560> so

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
types of bullets it would open up so

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.369 
types of bullets it would open up so
many<00:02:12.250> more<00:02:12.489> options<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:13.450> recon<00:02:13.900> players<00:02:14.170> not

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
many more options for recon players not

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.050 
many more options for recon players not
only<00:02:14.620> could<00:02:14.830> they<00:02:14.920> choose<00:02:15.129> their<00:02:15.310> weapon<00:02:15.700> but

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
only could they choose their weapon but

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.729 
only could they choose their weapon but
they<00:02:16.150> could<00:02:16.300> also<00:02:16.420> choose<00:02:16.810> what<00:02:17.379> bullets

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
they could also choose what bullets

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.199 
they could also choose what bullets
height<00:02:17.920> would<00:02:18.069> they<00:02:18.190> want<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.580> use<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.030> then

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
height would they want to use and then

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.750 
height would they want to use and then
really<00:02:19.780> tailor<00:02:20.319> their<00:02:20.800> class<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.519> their

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
really tailor their class and their

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.940 
really tailor their class and their
setup<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.330> exactly<00:02:23.080> how<00:02:23.319> they<00:02:23.530> want<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.800> play

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
setup to exactly how they want to play

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.759 
setup to exactly how they want to play
the<00:02:24.069> game<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.879> so<00:02:25.090> my<00:02:25.420> next<00:02:25.450> idea<00:02:25.900> involves

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
the game and so my next idea involves

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.740 
the game and so my next idea involves
sniper<00:02:27.370> glints<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:27.849> while<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.180> don't<00:02:28.330> know<00:02:28.480> if

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
sniper glints and while we don't know if

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.540 
sniper glints and while we don't know if
it's<00:02:28.870> gonna<00:02:28.959> be<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.230> upcoming<00:02:29.620> game<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:30.220> could

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
it's gonna be the upcoming game it could

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.550 
it's gonna be the upcoming game it could
make<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.090> return<00:02:31.660> even<00:02:31.989> though<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.200> lot<00:02:32.530> of

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
make a return even though a lot of

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.259 
make a return even though a lot of
people<00:02:32.769> currently<00:02:33.190> don't<00:02:33.489> like<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.910> battle

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
people currently don't like it in battle

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.960 
people currently don't like it in battle
three<00:02:34.599> and<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.260> if<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.620> does<00:02:35.890> make<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.190> return<00:02:36.640> it

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
three and so if it does make a return it

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.000 
three and so if it does make a return it
would<00:02:37.269> be<00:02:37.390> really<00:02:37.660> nice<00:02:37.989> if<00:02:38.260> there<00:02:38.410> was<00:02:38.470> some

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
would be really nice if there was some

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.220 
would be really nice if there was some
sort<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.310> attachment<00:02:39.879> that<00:02:40.230> significantly

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
sort of attachment that significantly

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.350 
sort of attachment that significantly
reduced<00:02:41.739> its<00:02:42.040> effect<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.940> wasn't<00:02:43.209> so

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
reduced its effect so that it wasn't so

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.600 
reduced its effect so that it wasn't so
apparent<00:02:43.810> at<00:02:43.930> range<00:02:44.170> or<00:02:44.610> completely

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
apparent at range or completely

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.449 
apparent at range or completely
eliminated<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.870> dunno<00:02:47.110> why<00:02:47.590> dice<00:02:48.160> has

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
eliminated it and I dunno why dice has

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.220 
eliminated it and I dunno why dice has
it<00:02:48.700> in<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.060> game<00:02:49.269> it's<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> mechanic<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.019> place

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
it in the game it's a mechanic in place

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.380 
it in the game it's a mechanic in place
so<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.500> people<00:02:50.980> know<00:02:51.549> where<00:02:51.790> snipers<00:02:52.209> are

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
so that people know where snipers are

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.030 
so that people know where snipers are
and<00:02:52.510> they<00:02:52.569> can't<00:02:52.750> just<00:02:52.989> stay<00:02:53.170> way<00:02:53.560> off<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:53.920> the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
and they can't just stay way off in the

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.920 
and they can't just stay way off in the
distance<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.610> snipe<00:02:54.880> people<00:02:55.060> all<00:02:55.390> day<00:02:55.690> and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
distance and snipe people all day and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.470 
distance and snipe people all day and
have<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.470> enemy<00:02:56.620> not<00:02:57.010> know<00:02:57.400> where<00:02:58.239> they<00:02:58.450> are

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
have the enemy not know where they are

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.880 
have the enemy not know where they are
and<00:02:58.840> just<00:02:58.930> continually<00:02:59.349> die<00:02:59.560> from<00:02:59.739> that

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
and just continually die from that

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.470 
and just continually die from that
because<00:03:00.099> that<00:03:00.250> would<00:03:00.489> that<00:03:00.849> would<00:03:00.910> get<00:03:01.329> very

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
because that would that would get very

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.420 
because that would that would get very
annoying<00:03:01.870> but<00:03:02.470> at<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.680> same<00:03:02.890> time<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.340> would

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
annoying but at the same time it would

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.330 
annoying but at the same time it would

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
video game and so what I kind of want to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.470 
video game and so what I kind of want to
see<00:04:08.590> is<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:08.919> eliminate<00:04:09.130> those<00:04:09.549> two<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.269> tugs

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
see is to eliminate those two the tugs

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.000 
see is to eliminate those two the tugs
of<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.690> nav<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.230> replace<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.620> with<00:04:11.680> emotion

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
of the nav and replace it with emotion

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.490 
of the nav and replace it with emotion
ball<00:04:12.400> because<00:04:13.060> personally<00:04:13.660> I<00:04:13.810> think<00:04:14.109> that<00:04:14.349> the

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
ball because personally I think that the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.589 
ball because personally I think that the
motion<00:04:14.829> ball<00:04:14.980> keeps<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.549> interacting<00:04:16.239> with

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
motion ball keeps you interacting with

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.810 
motion ball keeps you interacting with
the<00:04:16.780> world<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.320> doesn't<00:04:17.590> just<00:04:17.620> turn<00:04:18.609> into

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
the world and doesn't just turn into

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.000 
the world and doesn't just turn into
kind<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:19.780> thing<00:04:19.959> that<00:04:20.140> you<00:04:20.200> placed<00:04:20.500> on<00:04:20.739> the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
kind of a thing that you placed on the

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.390 
kind of a thing that you placed on the
ground<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.700> becomes

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
ground and becomes

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.850 
ground and becomes
that<00:04:22.850> just<00:04:23.210> allows<00:04:23.389> camping<00:04:24.080> snipers<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.650> be

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
that just allows camping snipers to be

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.670 
that just allows camping snipers to be
notified<00:04:25.340> if<00:04:25.669> someone<00:04:26.449> is<00:04:26.810> trying<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.410> flank

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
notified if someone is trying to flank

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.290 
notified if someone is trying to flank
them<00:04:27.889> or<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.280> knife<00:04:28.460> them<00:04:28.669> in<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.850> back<00:04:29.030> that's

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
them or to knife them in the back that's

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.330 
them or to knife them in the back that's
because<00:04:29.660> kind<00:04:29.900> of<00:04:30.169> what<00:04:30.680> things<00:04:30.949> have<00:04:31.100> kind<00:04:31.220> of

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
because kind of what things have kind of

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.700 
because kind of what things have kind of
turned<00:04:31.490> into<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:32.449> so<00:04:32.600> if<00:04:32.810> they<00:04:32.990> did<00:04:33.229> add<00:04:33.500> the

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
turned into and so if they did add the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.219 
turned into and so if they did add the
motion<00:04:34.070> ball<00:04:34.250> not<00:04:34.850> only<00:04:34.880> would<00:04:35.479> recons<00:04:36.050> if

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
motion ball not only would recons if

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:37.689 
motion ball not only would recons if
they<00:04:36.350> want<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.680> take<00:04:36.800> advantage<00:04:36.949> of<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.520> need

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
they want to take advantage of it need

in the battle you need to be throwing it
everywhere<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:54.830> think<00:04:55.070> an<00:04:55.160> enemy<00:04:55.400> is

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490

everywhere that you think an enemy is
going<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.639> be<00:04:55.729> coming<00:04:55.940> from<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.419> supporting

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
going to be coming from and supporting

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.140 
going to be coming from and supporting
your<00:04:57.410> team<00:04:57.470> that<00:04:58.190> way<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:58.580> personally<00:04:59.120> I

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
your team that way and personally I

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.150 
your team that way and personally I
think<00:04:59.510> that<00:04:59.660> would<00:04:59.780> be<00:04:59.900> a<00:04:59.930> much<00:05:00.229> a<00:05:00.440> much<00:05:00.919> better

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
think that would be a much a much better

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.520 
think that would be a much a much better
direction<00:05:01.850> for<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.479> motion<00:05:02.870> sensor<00:05:03.199> and<00:05:03.380> kind

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
direction for the motion sensor and kind

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.610 
direction for the motion sensor and kind
of<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.680> recon<00:05:04.130> aspect<00:05:04.729> of<00:05:04.880> this<00:05:05.360> class<00:05:05.620> but

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
of the recon aspect of this class but

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.379 
of the recon aspect of this class but
yeah<00:05:06.680> so<00:05:07.039> those<00:05:07.460> are<00:05:07.639> just<00:05:07.729> a<00:05:07.880> couple<00:05:08.060> of<00:05:08.270> ideas

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
yeah so those are just a couple of ideas
