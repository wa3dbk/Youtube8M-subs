so I was preparing to do a video on
connect<00:00:10.170> animals<00:00:10.770> and<00:00:11.360> I<00:00:12.360> decided<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.410> tune<00:00:13.769> my

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429

Xbox<00:00:15.439> 360<00:00:16.439> Kinect<00:00:17.369> tuner<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.930> I<00:00:18.930> noticed<00:00:19.470> that

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
Xbox 360 Kinect tuner and I noticed that

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.320 
Xbox 360 Kinect tuner and I noticed that
it<00:00:20.369> was<00:00:20.430> going<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> little<00:00:20.699> slow<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> wasn't

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
it was going a little slow and I wasn't

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.790 
it was going a little slow and I wasn't
sure<00:00:21.480> if<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.750> because<00:00:21.869> I'm<00:00:22.109> capturing<00:00:22.560> video

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
sure if it's because I'm capturing video

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
sure if it's because I'm capturing video
or<00:00:23.010> not<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.670> stumbled<00:00:24.330> across<00:00:24.420> something

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
or not but I stumbled across something

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.500 
or not but I stumbled across something
that<00:00:25.020> I<00:00:25.410> don't<00:00:25.619> remember<00:00:25.890> setting<00:00:26.400> up<00:00:26.580> ever<00:00:26.850> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
that I don't remember setting up ever I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.029 
that I don't remember setting up ever I
don't<00:00:27.720> know<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.109> was<00:00:28.199> prompted<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.859> it

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
don't know that I was prompted to do it

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.859

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the calibration card and I just thought

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.390 
the calibration card and I just thought
