both sides of the goggle a few benefits
to<00:00:51.089> this<00:00:51.210> really<00:00:51.629> first<00:00:52.409> probably<00:00:52.769> being<00:00:53.100> is

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
to this really first probably being is

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.759 
to this really first probably being is
it<00:00:53.719> causes<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.839> pressure<00:00:55.109> from<00:00:55.319> the<00:00:55.499> strap

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
it causes the pressure from the strap

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.439 
it causes the pressure from the strap
across<00:00:55.979> the<00:00:56.249> face<00:00:56.459> rather<00:00:56.789> than<00:00:57.030> pinning<00:00:57.359> it

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
across the face rather than pinning it

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.000 
across the face rather than pinning it
down<00:00:57.479> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> side<00:00:58.170> making<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.709> lot<00:00:58.889> more

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
down on the side making a lot more

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.359 
down on the side making a lot more
comfortable<00:00:59.249> to<00:00:59.670> wear<00:01:00.079> also<00:01:01.079> helps<00:01:01.469> wider

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369 
comfortable to wear also helps wider

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:05.030 
comfortable to wear also helps wider
than<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> range<00:01:03.269> of<00:01:03.449> fit<00:01:03.749> of<00:01:03.929> the<00:01:04.229> goggle

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
than the range of fit of the goggle

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.410 
than the range of fit of the goggle
strap<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.760> decide<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.180> wear<00:01:06.330> the
