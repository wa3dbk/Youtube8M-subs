production on that this is a kind of
quite<00:00:20.609> futuristic<00:00:20.910> production<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.960> we'd

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
quite futuristic production so we'd

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.840 
quite futuristic production so we'd
spent<00:00:22.350> 80<00:00:22.500> s<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.710> studio<00:00:23.010> making<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.430> sort<00:00:23.820> of

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
spent 80 s in studio making this sort of

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.730 
spent 80 s in studio making this sort of
really<00:00:24.090> nice<00:00:24.210> production<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.470> then<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.650> go

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
really nice production and then you go

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.500 
really nice production and then you go
and<00:00:25.800> play<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.640> concert<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> sound

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and play in a concert and the sound

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.880 
and play in a concert and the sound
engine<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.779> just<00:00:27.960> turns<00:00:28.199> everything<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.680> loud

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
engine you just turns everything it loud

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.009 
engine you just turns everything it loud
and<00:00:29.160> that's<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> end<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.840> sounds

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
and that's the end and it just sounds

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.319 
and that's the end and it just sounds
like<00:00:31.080> any<00:00:31.320> old<00:00:31.500> rock<00:00:31.650> band<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.489> we'd<00:00:32.940> said<00:00:33.180> we

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
like any old rock band so we'd said we

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.940 
like any old rock band so we'd said we
don't<00:00:33.420> want<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.780> anymore<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.320> now

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
don't want to do that anymore and now

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.430 
don't want to do that anymore and now
it's<00:00:35.700> pretty<00:00:35.940> difficult<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.600> ruin<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.170> sound

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
it's pretty difficult to ruin the sound

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.229 
it's pretty difficult to ruin the sound
when<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.070> cello<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.579> double<00:00:38.610> bass<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
when it's just cello and double bass and

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.819 
when it's just cello and double bass and
which<00:00:39.660> there's<00:00:39.960> normally<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> violinist<00:00:40.620> but

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
which there's normally a violinist but

00:00:40.829 --> 00:01:23.290
