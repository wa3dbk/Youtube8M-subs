should<00:03:58.730> say<00:03:58.940> so<00:04:00.849> you<00:04:01.849> will<00:04:02.060> see<00:04:02.299> that<00:04:02.629> it's

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
should say so you will see that it's

loading up our website and the browser

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.900 
loading up our website and the browser
seems<00:04:05.859> comparatively<00:04:06.859> slower<00:04:07.250> compared<00:04:07.790> to

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910

other browsers if I quickly switch from

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.460 
other browsers if I quickly switch from
portrait<00:04:12.620> into<00:04:12.889> landscape<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:15.019> phone<00:04:15.260> will

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
portrait into landscape the phone will

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.170 
portrait into landscape the phone will
not<00:04:15.500> quickly<00:04:15.919> switch<00:04:16.310> from<00:04:16.549> portrait<00:04:16.880> into

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
not quickly switch from portrait into

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.940 
not quickly switch from portrait into
landscape<00:04:17.599> in<00:04:17.750> fact<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.109> didn't<00:04:18.409> even<00:04:18.530> try<00:04:18.919> to

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
landscape in fact it didn't even try to

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.950 
landscape in fact it didn't even try to
switch<00:04:19.370> from<00:04:19.549> portrait<00:04:19.909> into<00:04:20.209> landscape

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.870 

so<00:04:23.960> maybe<00:04:24.290> there<00:04:25.010> is<00:04:25.130> some<00:04:25.400> sort<00:04:25.700> of

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
so maybe there is some sort of

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.360 
so maybe there is some sort of
orientation<00:04:26.780> setting<00:04:27.170> that<00:04:27.950> needs<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.280> be

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
orientation setting that needs to be

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.010 
orientation setting that needs to be
turned<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:29.180> I'm<00:04:29.270> quickly<00:04:29.690> jump<00:04:29.900> into

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
turned on so I'm quickly jump into

settings over here go into display and

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.590

see yes auto rotate screen was turned

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.590 
see yes auto rotate screen was turned
off<00:04:35.840> if<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.680> quickly<00:04:36.890> jump<00:04:37.190> back<00:04:37.340> into<00:04:37.610> the
