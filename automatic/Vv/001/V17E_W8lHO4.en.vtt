with<00:00:00.510> any<00:00:00.690> booster<00:00:01.199> and<00:00:01.350> any<00:00:01.800> pedal<00:00:02.129> in

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
with any booster and any pedal in

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.860 
with any booster and any pedal in
general<00:00:02.520> you<00:00:02.639> can<00:00:02.760> say<00:00:02.790> it's<00:00:03.510> really

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
general you can say it's really

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.110 
general you can say it's really
simplicity<00:00:04.620> that's<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.980> key<00:00:05.190> so<00:00:05.910> having

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
simplicity that's the key so having

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.940 
simplicity that's the key so having
something<00:00:06.450> that's<00:00:06.750> just<00:00:06.960> small<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.649> super

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
something that's just small and super

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.180 
something that's just small and super
simple<00:00:08.220> just<00:00:08.910> one<00:00:09.120> enough<00:00:09.330> for<00:00:09.540> volume<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:10.190> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
simple just one enough for volume is the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:29.570 
simple just one enough for volume is the
way<00:00:11.340> guitar<00:00:11.730> players<00:00:11.969> like<00:00:12.179> things<00:00:28.460> coming<00:00:29.460> up

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
way guitar players like things coming up

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.220 
way guitar players like things coming up
with<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> idea<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.179> spark<00:00:30.630> mini<00:00:30.810> booster

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
with the idea for spark mini booster

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.410 
with the idea for spark mini booster
doesn't<00:00:31.920> really<00:00:32.130> feel<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.579> coming<00:00:33.149> up<00:00:33.270> with

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
doesn't really feel like coming up with

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 
doesn't really feel like coming up with
an<00:00:33.510> idea<00:00:33.570> at<00:00:33.899> all<00:00:33.989> because<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
an idea at all because it's just it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.970 
an idea at all because it's just it
seems<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.790> obvious<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.410> honest<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.890> a

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
seems so obvious and to be honest it's a

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.650 
seems so obvious and to be honest it's a
pedal<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.670> wanted<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.059> myself<00:00:39.480> for

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
pedal that I just wanted for myself for

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.090 
pedal that I just wanted for myself for
so<00:00:39.840> long<00:00:40.020> I've<00:00:40.290> been<00:00:40.320> using<00:00:40.590> different

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
so long I've been using different

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.069 
so long I've been using different
boosters<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.969> course<00:00:42.180> spark<00:00:42.570> booster<00:00:42.930> for

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
boosters and of course spark booster for

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.840 
boosters and of course spark booster for
a<00:00:43.140> while<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> clintons<00:00:44.610> mode

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
a while now just in the clintons mode

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.880 
a while now just in the clintons mode
and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:46.170> wanted<00:00:46.410> something<00:00:46.649> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and I just really wanted something that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.490 
and I just really wanted something that
did<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.700> clean<00:00:47.879> boost<00:00:48.059> side<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:49.050> super

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
did just a clean boost side in a super

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.139 
did just a clean boost side in a super
small<00:00:49.710> form<00:00:50.039> factor<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.670> fit<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:50.969> any

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
small form factor that I can fit on any

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.110 
small form factor that I can fit on any
of<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.420> pedal<00:00:51.719> boards<00:00:55.610> but<00:00:56.610> obviously<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
of my pedal boards but obviously the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.029 
of my pedal boards but obviously the
most<00:00:57.360> important<00:00:57.870> part<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.140> any<00:00:58.379> pedal<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
most important part of any pedal is the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
most important part of any pedal is the
sound<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.609> sparklingly<00:01:00.239> booster<00:01:00.600> just

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
sound and sparklingly booster just

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.049 
sound and sparklingly booster just
sounds<00:01:01.109> great<00:01:01.410> we're<00:01:02.340> really<00:01:02.579> privileged

taking in spark mini booster just make

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:26.360 
taking in spark mini booster just make
them<00:01:15.750> sound<00:01:16.049> better<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.159> simple

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.740 

despite<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.520> fact<00:01:27.760> that<00:01:27.880> sounds<00:01:28.480> are<00:01:28.660> the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
of pedal as guitar plays we have to

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.550 
of pedal as guitar plays we have to
admit<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.210> looks<00:01:34.510> are<00:01:34.780> really<00:01:35.110> important<00:01:35.440> as

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
admit that looks are really important as

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.370 
admit that looks are really important as
well<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:37.090> think<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.570> nikolai<00:01:38.080> our

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
well and I think that nikolai our

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.560 
well and I think that nikolai our

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
matter of we got to make this pedal it

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.330 
matter of we got to make this pedal it
just<00:01:48.850> looks<00:01:49.060> too<00:01:49.270> cool<00:01:49.510> I<00:01:49.750> was<00:01:50.380> having<00:01:51.220> him

on<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.660> product<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.230> I<00:02:05.800> just<00:02:06.610> started<00:02:07.180> down

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
on a product and I just started down

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.660 
on a product and I just started down
sketching<00:02:07.960> some<00:02:08.229> different<00:02:08.740> drawings<00:02:09.310> trying

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
sketching some different drawings trying

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.930 
sketching some different drawings trying
to<00:02:09.850> make<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.149> have<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.740> engravings<00:02:11.740> look<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
to make it have that engravings look the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.750 
to make it have that engravings look the
first<00:02:13.740> drawing<00:02:14.740> off<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:16.020> this<00:02:17.020> bakhmina<00:02:17.350> here

features<00:02:24.520> we<00:02:25.450> took<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.520> design<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:28.330> took<00:02:28.570> it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
features we took the design and took it

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.520 
features we took the design and took it
into<00:02:28.900> 3d<00:02:29.370> did<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.520> colors<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.330> added<00:02:32.230> all<00:02:32.350> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
into 3d did the colors and added all the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.710 
into 3d did the colors and added all the
all<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.250> details<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.940> added<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.360> detail

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
all the details and added the detail

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.920 
all the details and added the detail
just<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.790> make<00:02:36.940> sure<00:02:37.090> everything<00:02:37.630> fit

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
just to to make sure everything fit

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.420 
just to to make sure everything fit
because<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.650> such<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.860> small<00:02:39.190> panel<00:02:44.430> coming

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
because it's such a small panel coming

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.890 
because it's such a small panel coming
up<00:02:45.640> with<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.850> idea<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.180> primetime<00:02:46.540> what's

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
up with the idea for primetime what's

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.120 
up with the idea for primetime what's
really<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.140> matter<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.470> watching<00:02:47.650> guitar

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
really a matter of watching guitar

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.040 
really a matter of watching guitar
players<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.580> action<00:02:48.700> if<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.690> have<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.930> do<00:02:50.020> a

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
players in action if you have to do a

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.630 
players in action if you have to do a
short<00:02:50.380> solo<00:02:50.650> or<00:02:50.920> a<00:02:50.980> little<00:02:51.250> lick<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.519> you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
short solo or a little lick that you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.250 
short solo or a little lick that you
want<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.880> raise<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.209> volume<00:02:52.330> of<00:02:52.720> it's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
want to raise the volume of it's

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.960 
want to raise the volume of it's
annoying<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.800> do<00:02:53.950> multiple<00:02:54.400> taps<00:02:54.700> on<00:02:54.880> the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
annoying to do multiple taps on the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.630 
annoying to do multiple taps on the
footswitch<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:55.690> Peter<00:02:56.080> one<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.380> our<00:02:56.640> hardware

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
footswitch so Peter one of our hardware

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.759 
footswitch so Peter one of our hardware
engineers<00:02:58.030> basically<00:02:58.780> said<00:02:58.989> well<00:02:59.620> why<00:02:59.709> don't

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
engineers basically said well why don't

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.500 
engineers basically said well why don't
we<00:02:59.920> just<00:03:00.100> make<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.430> foot<00:03:00.640> switch<00:03:00.850> work<00:03:01.300> as<00:03:01.480> a

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
we just make the foot switch work as a

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.240 
we just make the foot switch work as a
momentary<00:03:01.959> switch<00:03:02.170> if<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.620> hold<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.950> for<00:03:03.160> more

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
momentary switch if you hold it for more

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.920 
momentary switch if you hold it for more
than<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.489> second<00:03:03.820> when<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.330> release<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:04.600> begin

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
than a second when you release it begin

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.960 
than a second when you release it begin
it's<00:03:05.320> off<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.860> it's<00:03:06.130> back<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.550> regular

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
it's off and it's back to a regular

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.449 
it's off and it's back to a regular
latching<00:03:07.269> switch<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:08.070> blew<00:03:09.070> our<00:03:09.220> minds

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
latching switch and it blew our minds

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.640 
latching switch and it blew our minds
it's<00:03:09.760> just<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.120> simple<00:03:10.420> but<00:03:11.110> it's<00:03:11.290> just<00:03:11.440> so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
it's just so simple but it's just so

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:21.610 
it's just so simple but it's just so
perfect<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.310> works<00:03:12.519> great

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.170 

so<00:03:22.620> summing<00:03:22.920> up<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.280> essence<00:03:23.610> of<00:03:23.670> spark<00:03:23.970> mini

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
so summing up the essence of spark mini

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.980 
so summing up the essence of spark mini
gusta<00:03:24.570> it's<00:03:25.020> really<00:03:25.380> about<00:03:25.650> awesome<00:03:26.310> sounds

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
gusta it's really about awesome sounds

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.840 
gusta it's really about awesome sounds
simplicity<00:03:27.990> and<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.740> really<00:03:29.190> really<00:03:29.220> cool<00:03:29.610> look

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
simplicity and a really really cool look

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.940 
simplicity and a really really cool look
and<00:03:30.570> it's<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.810> kind<00:03:30.990> of<00:03:31.050> pedal<00:03:31.320> where<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.830> know

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
and it's a kind of pedal where you know

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.440 
and it's a kind of pedal where you know
no<00:03:32.130> matter<00:03:32.310> if<00:03:32.490> you<00:03:32.610> needed<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.060> raise<00:03:33.270> the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
no matter if you needed to raise the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.390 
no matter if you needed to raise the
volume<00:03:33.570> for<00:03:33.960> a<00:03:33.990> solo<00:03:34.290> or<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.800> want<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.100> kick<00:03:35.280> it

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
volume for a solo or you want to kick it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.490 
volume for a solo or you want to kick it
on<00:03:35.490> to<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.880> basically<00:03:36.570> an<00:03:36.720> extra<00:03:37.020> channel<00:03:37.290> to

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
on to a basically an extra channel to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.900 
on to a basically an extra channel to
your<00:03:37.620> hand<00:03:37.770> or<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.130> have<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.460> all<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
your hand or just have it on all the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.760 
your hand or just have it on all the
time<00:03:38.940> because<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:39.930> sounds<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:40.290> great

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770
