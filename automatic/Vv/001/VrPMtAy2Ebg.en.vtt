of paper okay now a piece of paper

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.890 
of paper okay now a piece of paper
itself<00:00:20.550> paper<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> an<00:00:21.029> amazing<00:00:21.480> thing<00:00:21.660> it's

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
itself paper is an amazing thing it's

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.370 
itself paper is an amazing thing it's
actually<00:00:22.260> really<00:00:22.439> strong<00:00:22.890> when<00:00:23.850> it's<00:00:24.029> layered

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
actually really strong when it's layered

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.540 
actually really strong when it's layered
and<00:00:25.380> that's<00:00:26.010> what<00:00:26.099> we're<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.340> do<00:00:26.430> we're

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
and that's what we're going to do we're

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.070 
and that's what we're going to do we're
going<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> layer<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.060> paper<00:00:27.269> by<00:00:27.660> basically

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
going to layer this paper by basically

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.019 
going to layer this paper by basically
folding<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.769> half<00:00:28.980> over<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.519> over<00:00:29.760> again

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
folding it in half over and over again

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.820 
folding it in half over and over again
now<00:00:30.539> I'm<00:00:30.660> not<00:00:30.810> certain<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.260> there's<00:00:31.529> just

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
now I'm not certain that there's just

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.760 
now I'm not certain that there's just
one<00:00:32.219> exact<00:00:32.969> right<00:00:33.270> way<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.710> is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
one exact right way to do this this is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440 
one exact right way to do this this is
the<00:00:34.980> way<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.250> I've<00:00:35.370> been<00:00:35.399> doing<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.239> you

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the way that I've been doing it if you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.280 
the way that I've been doing it if you
can<00:00:36.600> come<00:00:36.750> up<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:36.899> something<00:00:37.260> different

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
can come up with something different

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.150 
can come up with something different
that's<00:00:37.710> fine

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
that's fine

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.860 
that's fine
the<00:00:38.550> easiest<00:00:39.120> way<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.300> could<00:00:39.480> tell<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.719> do

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the easiest way I could tell you to do

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.810 
the easiest way I could tell you to do
this<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.739> keep<00:00:40.920> folding<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.430> paper<00:00:41.640> in

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
this is just keep folding this paper in

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.450 
this is just keep folding this paper in
half<00:00:42.110> until<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.590> can't<00:00:43.800> okay<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.190> we're<00:00:44.370> going

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
half until you can't okay so we're going

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.069 
half until you can't okay so we're going
to<00:00:44.520> take<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.760> piece<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> paper<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.450> we're

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
to take this piece of paper and we're

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.170 
to take this piece of paper and we're
going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> fold<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.620> half<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:47.489> way<00:00:47.520> okay

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
going to fold it in half one way okay

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.779 
going to fold it in half one way okay
like<00:00:48.870> we're<00:00:49.020> making<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.289> paper<00:00:49.440> airplane<00:00:49.789> nice

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789

like we're making a paper airplane nice
crisp<00:00:51.629> lines<00:00:52.170> okay<00:00:52.680> not<00:00:53.280> only<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
going to help you fold it the other way

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.130 
going to help you fold it the other way
better<00:00:56.910> okay<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:57.690> again<00:00:57.780> we're<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
crisp lines okay we're going to fold it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.410 
crisp lines okay we're going to fold it
over<00:01:05.549> again<00:01:07.070> like<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.460> guess<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.240> we're

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
over again like that guess what we're

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.480 
over again like that guess what we're
gonna<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.689> next<00:01:09.900> we're<00:01:10.830> gonna<00:01:10.920> fold<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.369> over

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
gonna do next we're gonna fold it over

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.830 
gonna do next we're gonna fold it over
again<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.619> okay<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.610> slowly<00:01:15.390> but

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
again just like that okay and slowly but

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.469 
again just like that okay and slowly but
surely<00:01:15.950> as<00:01:16.950> we're<00:01:17.220> folding<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.210> thing

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
surely as we're folding it this thing

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.450 
surely as we're folding it this thing
actually<00:01:18.659> become<00:01:19.140> becomes<00:01:19.619> quite<00:01:19.890> durable<00:01:20.159> in

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
actually become becomes quite durable in

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.830 
actually become becomes quite durable in
fact<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.759> think<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> how<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> make<00:01:21.630> some

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
fact I think this is how to make some

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.289 
fact I think this is how to make some
prison<00:01:22.229> weapons<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.640> sure<00:01:23.880> I'm<00:01:24.150> not

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
prison weapons I'm not sure I'm not

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.789 
prison weapons I'm not sure I'm not
certain<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.200> I've<00:01:25.380> never<00:01:25.500> been<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
certain of that I've never been to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.980 
certain of that I've never been to
prison<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.610> watch<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.970> lot<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.180> TV<00:01:27.390> okay

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
prison but I watch a lot of TV okay

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.899 
prison but I watch a lot of TV okay
anyways<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.799> gets<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> point<00:01:29.369> where<00:01:29.549> it

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
anyways it gets to the point where it

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940 
anyways it gets to the point where it
becomes<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.360> difficult<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.990> fold<00:01:31.259> once

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
becomes really difficult to fold once

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.440 
becomes really difficult to fold once
you've<00:01:32.100> gotten<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.579> point<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.240> lets

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
you've gotten to that point that lets

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.590 
you've gotten to that point that lets
you<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.470> thing<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.740> structural

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
you know that this thing is structural

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.910 
you know that this thing is structural
structurally<00:01:36.600> sound<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.680> probably

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
structurally sound and it's probably

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.260 
structurally sound and it's probably
good<00:01:38.189> enough<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> open<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.820> your<00:01:38.939> bottle<00:01:39.180> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
good enough to open up your bottle of
