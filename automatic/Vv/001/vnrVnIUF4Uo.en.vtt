00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
database one I think it's like the

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.879 
database one I think it's like the
different<00:03:24.810> one<00:03:24.959> click<00:03:25.230> page<00:03:25.410> bicycle<00:03:25.709> store

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
different one click page bicycle store

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.780 
different one click page bicycle store
it<00:03:26.609> has<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:27.120> be<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.840> same<00:03:28.169> file<00:03:28.349> again<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
it has to be the same file again and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.339 
it has to be the same file again and
obviously<00:03:29.790> here<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.150> can<00:03:30.299> choose<00:03:30.480> which

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
one database it's pretty simple so that

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.770
