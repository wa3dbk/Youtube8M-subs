of going for my typical moisturizing
foundation<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.050> like<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.410> go<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.920> tiny

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
foundation I like to go with a tiny

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400 
foundation I like to go with a tiny
amount<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.940> concealer<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.110> really

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
amount of concealer so that it really

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.800 
amount of concealer so that it really
sticks<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.009> stays<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:14.759> face<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:20.810> did

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
sticks and stays on my face I did

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.109 
sticks and stays on my face I did
actually<00:00:22.199> apply<00:00:22.500> my<00:00:22.740> Innisfree<00:00:23.369> primer<00:00:23.699> but

actually apply my Innisfree primer but
for<00:00:24.420> some<00:00:24.600> reason<00:00:24.990> I'm<00:00:25.140> missing<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.619> clip<00:00:25.890> so

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
for some reason I'm missing that clip so

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.890 
for some reason I'm missing that clip so
it's<00:00:26.640> always<00:00:26.939> good<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.449> prime<00:00:27.660> your<00:00:27.869> face

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it's always good to prime your face

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.290 
it's always good to prime your face
before<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.710> bass-driven<00:00:29.250> summer<00:00:29.609> times<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
before the bass-driven summer times and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.540 
before the bass-driven summer times and
with<00:00:30.840> another<00:00:31.230> long-lasting<00:00:31.890> concealer<00:00:32.399> I'm

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
with another long-lasting concealer I'm

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.639 
with another long-lasting concealer I'm
basically<00:00:32.910> using<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.450> as<00:00:33.660> an<00:00:33.899> alternative<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
basically using it as an alternative to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
basically using it as an alternative to
my<00:00:35.040> typical<00:00:35.460> foundation<00:00:36.239> because<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.690> find

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
my typical foundation because I find

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.380 
my typical foundation because I find
this<00:00:37.200> concealer<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.010> last<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.640> lot<00:00:38.850> longer<00:00:38.910> than

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this concealer to last a lot longer than

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
this concealer to last a lot longer than
my<00:00:39.600> other<00:00:39.840> foundations<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.010> reason<00:00:41.340> why<00:00:41.460> I'm

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
my other foundations the reason why I'm

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.459 
my other foundations the reason why I'm
using<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.940> sponge<00:00:42.270> instead<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> brush<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
using a sponge instead of a brush is

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.560 
using a sponge instead of a brush is
just<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.980> really<00:00:44.280> push<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> product<00:00:45.180> into<00:00:45.539> my

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
just to really push the product into my

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
just to really push the product into my
skin<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.620> doesn't<00:00:46.950> slip<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.309> slide

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
skin so that it doesn't slip and slide

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.729 
skin so that it doesn't slip and slide
later<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.120> patterning<00:00:48.899> your<00:00:49.079> skin<00:00:49.320> would<00:00:49.530> also

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
later on patterning your skin would also

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
later on patterning your skin would also
help<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.520> skipped<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.449> don't

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
help but I skipped it because I don't

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
help but I skipped it because I don't
tend<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.020> use<00:00:52.110> powders<00:00:52.800> moving<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.670> I'm<00:00:53.820> going

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
tend to use powders moving on I'm going

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.060 
tend to use powders moving on I'm going
to<00:00:54.149> fill<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.629> brows<00:00:54.870> using<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.590> Holika

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
to fill in my brows using the Holika

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.860 
to fill in my brows using the Holika
Holika<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.670> you're<00:00:56.850> drawing<00:00:57.030> skinny<00:00:57.420> eyebrow

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
Holika one you're drawing skinny eyebrow

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.500 
Holika one you're drawing skinny eyebrow
in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> shade<00:00:58.559> dark<00:00:59.010> brown<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.699> I<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.270> going

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
in the shade dark brown and I was going

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.439 
in the shade dark brown and I was going
to<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:01.079> those<00:01:01.289> eyebrow<00:01:01.949> tints<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.000> find

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
to go for those eyebrow tints but I find

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
to go for those eyebrow tints but I find
those<00:01:03.660> tips<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.379> very<00:01:04.650> thick<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.309> it's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
those tips to be very thick so it's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.010 
those tips to be very thick so it's
really<00:01:05.729> hard<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.090> draw<00:01:06.299> really<00:01:06.600> precise

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
really hard to draw really precise

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.950 
really hard to draw really precise
strokes<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.220> decided<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.180> with<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.630> really

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
strokes so I decided to go with a really

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.109 
strokes so I decided to go with a really
thin<00:01:10.200> eyebrow<00:01:10.650> pencil<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.760> simply

thin eyebrow pencil and just simply

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
thin eyebrow pencil and just simply
follow<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:12.810> natural<00:01:12.869> eyebrow<00:01:13.680> shape<00:01:13.979> and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
brown pencil liner for that and then I'm

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.560

a bit of curl and lift to my eyelashes

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.970 
a bit of curl and lift to my eyelashes
and<00:02:28.120> they<00:02:28.300> say<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.960> like<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.320> use<00:02:29.680> false

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.130 
and they say I like to use false
eyelashes<00:02:30.700> instead<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.270> mascara<00:02:31.660> because<00:02:31.930> I

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
eyelashes instead of a mascara because I

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.170 
eyelashes instead of a mascara because I
find<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.770> be<00:02:32.800> a<00:02:32.890> lot<00:02:33.280> more<00:02:33.460> less<00:02:33.730> smudgy

find that to be a lot more less smudgy

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.570 
find that to be a lot more less smudgy
then<00:02:34.360> using<00:02:34.720> even<00:02:34.960> waterproof<00:02:35.650> mascara<00:02:36.220> so

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580
