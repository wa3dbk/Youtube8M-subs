00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.980
 welcome to the battle rap 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.590
 Number one today, it finally starts 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.100
 with my new category by being in 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.660
 I tried your attacks first 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.310
 Thanks for all the submissions to me 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.779
 made the problem was what it was 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.000
 it probably by mail as well as on facebook 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.580
 is that the quality really always 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.080
 really really weak so that you are there 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.039
 little zoom in relationship at all 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.510
 could recognize 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.180
 That's why I thought that today 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.930
 somebody raided someone in the eastern battle 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.670
 my plan 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.170
 there is just so much the whole thing cool 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.300
 that I can purely search to go out 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.399
 can and at the end also exactly that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.320
 Info can see beautiful that is who in 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.510
 my plan is like back then 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.250
 as far advertise the simply cool attack 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 shares and if that is convincing then 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.440
 or learning factor offers then I snap 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.160
 That's what happened to me today 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.230
 I have to find msi again 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.350
 2001 has attacked in the of 100 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.210
 managed as a rough info before had 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:10.110
 Magier carrying he had his heroes with him 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.939
 He also had healing magic 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.830
 and also had pigs doing that 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.330
 It's a bit like me 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.040
 Just look at it behind you 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.939
 the town hall level 8 the outer 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.450
 Wall still quite weak 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.610
 he starts it here by making small ones 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.729
 The rider is what he does 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.229
 on the one hand wants the agro of the dad 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.360
 get a king and now he wants to be here 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.880
 with the next pig rider he 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.070
 Soon the agro sets out of the clammy book 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.600
 get the more because the troops then 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.200
 to lure out what he also succeeded well 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.549
 is 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.840
 that means he has it here 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.030
 immediately lured out and has too 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.520
 at the same time the barbarian king 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.290
 his battery looks like it was putting on the outside and 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.939
 after a few turns there so that 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.159
 both the barbarian king and the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.689
 come bow 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.210
 There are still several bends behind 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.740
 turn off the bow and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.869
 now as soon as the barbarian 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.790
 King's entry also sets a few 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.969
 Magier then the accordingly 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.310
 of course the faster off of 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.329
 12 were turned off, that is to say 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.399
 is sustainable 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.959
 and now comes the very classic 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.790
 swine rider tactics like it already 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.560
 knows of me now knows decided 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.900
 To attack here is everything 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.160
 small rider at once one would have 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.930
 maybe divide it into two 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.730
 and now it works 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.080
 right now he's here with one 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.849
 pusch have that already here 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.319
 the east giant bomb you have now 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.650
 in any case fortunately for him 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.400
 automatically split into two parts 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.220
 accordingly, there is once up here 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.390
 a healing spell and the next one if I am 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.400
 that's right in remembering exactly 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.959
 comes down here a bit too 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.230
 set it up a bit early 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.239
 but next to it still fit and straight 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.370
 because here is the defense units 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.840
 not so super strong have become 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.900
 the pigging is quite easy 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.400
 fought it all out once 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.819
 defense units off 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.100
 were 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.630
 he still makes his heroes up here 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.950
 you would have a bit in the case 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.630
 You can do it sooner 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.940
 guarantee that with the 100 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.650
 also works in time but that was in the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.239
 falling as far as no problem here, the magician 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.410
 Magician I say already the barbarians can 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.970
 I have the ability right at the beginning 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.709
 activates the raise but good out 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.930
 has something besides case also completely okay 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.799
 So nothing much to endure 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.330
 and to defend 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.709
 The idea behind it is simply that he 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.049
 As soon as possible I say harm 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.220
 Doing the year makes you do it earlier 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.170
 otherwise spatial 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.609
 remaining troops where to pig 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.400
 Reithebuch is quite a bit have quite 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.410
 relaxed on heater minimal 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.620
 maybe something set too early 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.880
 but offset otherwise really super 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.420
 Attack that means something in one 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.180
 running battle 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.310
 everyone is dreaming about something 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.019
 many ignore just leave often 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.450
 ignore what but to the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.400
 the most important thing is that she is watching 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.950
 archers kÃ¶ning barbarian king and 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.569
 the gorge castle comes out with it 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.079
 troops partially folds it with bow 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.760
 quite well 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.380
 Or you can also make wall breakers 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.760
 and then with huge behind or how 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.139
 Here, what works well is easy 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.850
 pigs of the helpful about the 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.500
 wall is usually then immediately in 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.569
 radius in there from the respective 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.220
 distribution unit and then im 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.350
 retrospect that cheap easy with ground 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.480
 or bend the whole one out 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.430
 can also use to the heroes around the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.810
 opponents turn off heroes if 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.380
 you will have a look here again what became 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.100
 attacked 10 bows 36 swine riders 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.049
 five magician an archer queen 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.579
 clearly the barbarian king and four 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.840
 healing magic so really and solid 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.979
 Attack of resources also completely 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.970
 neatly 112000 gold 200,000 alexy 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.420
 around 600 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.600
 by dark elexxion and a solid 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.310
 100% attack than in everyday life little to even 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.650
 nothing wrong so absolutely good 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.750
 attack can continue just like that 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.430
 handle on duration I know myself 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.830
 it's probably a bit like this 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.450
 far that one after the dark elixir and 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.190
 after more and more minimized that means there 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.080
 best time to insert a time where 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.760
 then you attack without dark troops 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.710
 Accordingly, the dark elaxy 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.470
 also be filled a bit again 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.520
 That's what it was like to follow the bed 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.590
 Hope you liked me 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.280
 Of course, very much about your opinion thumb 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.440
 up 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.050
 comments on facebook likes from the 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.640
 same happy for the next follow on 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.410
 best if you have great interest 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.690
 Are you already clear or apply 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.940
 We have a few left 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.620
 vacant places has 43 members 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.300
 because I think she is herself 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.920
 easy to rate with the easiest 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.300
 you can zoom in pretty well she is 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.490
 in the end the statistics are beautiful 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.320
 listed and such a filmed video 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.030
 It's difficult to make one of them 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.710
 couple have also suggested something too 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.350
 a very good idea is that one 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.940
 maybe you say you join in 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.460
 own clan where i do it all then 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.110
 proven if technically and in time 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.360
 Sometimes it may be fine 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.030
 be that burning battle road plan 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.590
 created but is best on site 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.720
 be in the club member or can also 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.820
 stop by and I'm in a cool attack 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.979
 then i can also share the region 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.910
 So as much given to number one I 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.350
 hope you liked it 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.350
 will be fine until next time
