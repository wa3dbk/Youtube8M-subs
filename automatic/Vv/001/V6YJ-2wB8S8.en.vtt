the section one more time and then I

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.520 
the section one more time and then I
begin<00:01:05.780> toiling<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.960> starting<00:01:08.960> at<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.260> root

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
begin toiling so starting at the root

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.700 
begin toiling so starting at the root
you<00:01:09.800> just<00:01:10.070> want<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.370> twist<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.270> then<00:01:11.960> hold<00:01:12.350> and

then twist and then hold and then keep

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.190 
then twist and then hold and then keep
twisting<00:01:15.860> until<00:01:16.010> you<00:01:16.310> go<00:01:16.430> all<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.790> way<00:01:16.850> down

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
twisting until you go all the way down

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.740 
twisting until you go all the way down
coiling<00:01:18.200> all<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.920> way<00:01:19.040> down<00:01:19.220> now<00:01:19.610> this<00:01:20.420> is<00:01:20.600> my

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
coiling all the way down now this is my

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.410 
coiling all the way down now this is my
first<00:01:20.990> time<00:01:21.350> doing<00:01:22.070> finger<00:01:22.520> coils<00:01:22.940> all<00:01:23.060> over

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
first time doing finger coils all over

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.900 
first time doing finger coils all over
my<00:01:23.570> head<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:24.080> usually<00:01:24.560> just<00:01:24.830> do<00:01:25.490> them<00:01:25.670> on<00:01:25.790> the

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
my head I usually just do them on the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.300 
my head I usually just do them on the
short<00:01:26.210> hair<00:01:26.450> in<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:26.750> back<00:01:26.960> but<00:01:27.710> when<00:01:28.130> you're

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
short hair in the back but when you're

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.580 
short hair in the back but when you're
done<00:01:28.490> they<00:01:28.790> should<00:01:28.820> resemble<00:01:29.750> something<00:01:30.410> a

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
done they should resemble something a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:43.360 
done they should resemble something a
little<00:01:30.890> bit<00:01:31.010> like<00:01:31.160> this<00:01:31.370> so<00:01:42.190> keeping<00:01:43.190> that

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
little bit like this so keeping that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.550 
little bit like this so keeping that
same<00:01:43.700> technique<00:01:44.330> I'm<00:01:44.750> going<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:45.080> finish<00:01:45.320> the

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
same technique I'm going to finish the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:03:12.490 
same technique I'm going to finish the
style

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.410 

if<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.739> find<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.250> your<00:03:14.489> roots<00:03:14.730> are<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.030> little

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
if you find that your roots are a little

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.750 
if you find that your roots are a little
puffy<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:16.170> can<00:03:16.349> start<00:03:16.769> your<00:03:16.980> coil<00:03:17.310> with<00:03:17.730> a

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
puffy you can start your coil with a

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.990 
puffy you can start your coil with a
twist<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:19.099> twisting<00:03:20.099> maybe<00:03:20.489> once<00:03:20.819> or<00:03:20.940> twice

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
twist so twisting maybe once or twice

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.729 
twist so twisting maybe once or twice
and<00:03:21.569> then<00:03:21.989> continuing<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.890> coil<00:03:23.160> down<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.530> this

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
and then continuing to coil down so this

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.770 
and then continuing to coil down so this
is<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.010> finished<00:03:32.370> product<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.720> don't

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
is the finished product and I don't

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.750 
is the finished product and I don't
think<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.170> did<00:03:34.350> too<00:03:34.530> bad<00:03:34.769> for<00:03:35.069> my<00:03:35.160> first<00:03:35.370> time

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
think I did too bad for my first time

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.430 
think I did too bad for my first time
what<00:03:36.329> do<00:03:36.389> y'all<00:03:36.540> think<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:39.139> would<00:03:40.139> suggest

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
what do y'all think I would suggest

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.490 
what do y'all think I would suggest
trying<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.519> do<00:03:41.670> these<00:03:41.819> earlier<00:03:42.359> in<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.750> day<00:03:42.930> so

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
trying to do these earlier in the day so

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.410 
trying to do these earlier in the day so
that<00:03:43.680> they<00:03:43.829> will<00:03:43.980> be<00:03:44.069> fully<00:03:44.340> dry<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.700> next<00:03:45.090> day

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
that they will be fully dry the next day

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.030 
that they will be fully dry the next day
unravel<00:03:46.200> them<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.810> unravel<00:03:49.620> my<00:03:49.709> finger

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
coils I'm going to be taking a little

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.530 
coils I'm going to be taking a little
bit<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.750> oil<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.530> give<00:03:53.190> my<00:03:53.340> hair<00:03:53.579> sunshine<00:03:54.120> and

to make unraveling my hair a little bit

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.449 
to make unraveling my hair a little bit
easier<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:58.069> also<00:03:59.069> give<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> little

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
easier and also give it a little

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:07.069 
easier and also give it a little
moisture<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.760> I'm<00:04:05.910> starting<00:04:06.359> to<00:04:06.389> unravel<00:04:06.989> the

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
moisture so I'm starting to unravel the

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.910 
moisture so I'm starting to unravel the
back<00:04:07.319> and<00:04:07.709> as<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.430> unravel<00:04:08.880> I<00:04:09.329> am<00:04:09.599> twisting<00:04:10.319> the

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
back and as I unravel I am twisting the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.370 
back and as I unravel I am twisting the
mini<00:04:11.190> section<00:04:11.760> around<00:04:12.090> my<00:04:12.299> fingers<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:13.079> keep

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
mini section around my fingers to keep

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.379 
mini section around my fingers to keep
the<00:04:13.590> curl<00:04:13.829> pattern<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.569> prevent<00:04:15.569> frizz

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.230 

and<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:20.470> just<00:04:20.709> keep<00:04:20.889> that<00:04:21.130> same<00:04:21.400> technique<00:04:21.940> all

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
and I just keep that same technique all

00:04:22.240 --> 00:05:47.749 
and I just keep that same technique all
over<00:04:22.630> my<00:04:22.780> head

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:53.370 

so<00:05:48.759> taking<00:05:49.330> my<00:05:49.509> little<00:05:49.750> comb<00:05:50.229> pick<00:05:51.000> hybrid<00:05:52.380> I'm

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
so taking my little comb pick hybrid I'm

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.700 
so taking my little comb pick hybrid I'm
going<00:05:53.800> to<00:05:54.130> give<00:05:55.000> my<00:05:55.180> hair<00:05:55.360> volume<00:05:55.870> by<00:05:56.259> sticking

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
going to give my hair volume by sticking

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:32.120 
going to give my hair volume by sticking
out<00:05:56.919> the<00:05:57.100> roots<00:05:57.400> just<00:05:58.110> lifting<00:05:59.110> my<00:05:59.320> roots<00:05:59.650> up

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:57.570

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
so this is a finished look I think I

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.700
