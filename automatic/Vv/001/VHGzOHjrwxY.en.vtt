 hi guys today i want to show you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.390
 how to record videos from your 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.120
 device this time however with 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.820
 high resolution is a bitrate 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.389
 really very high 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.699
 the only thing we need, however, is android 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.359
 4.4 installed on the device 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:24.600
 otherwise it won't work if you have this 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.060
 requirement we can start with 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.920
 download our drivers 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.349
 device I don't put you in linking 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.420
 description because i don't know if i am 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.370
 different for each device anyway 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.620
 very easy to find them on google enough 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.980
 a simple search once 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.500
 installed and let's activate the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.890
 debugging usb on our device by going 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 in general settings options 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.170
 developer the usb bug we activate it and 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.870
 the game is done 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.350
 we connect the phone to the computer with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.000
 usb and download this folder vi 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.010
 I'll put the link in this description 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.680
 once we open it and find ourselves the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.280
 classic windows command prompt 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.020
 with the addition of the adb folder for 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.510
 start recording 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:21.060
 dial this really heroine stinga 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:23.340
 description adb shell screen record la 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.750
 destination folder of the file in the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.939
 my case the sd card and here it will be necessary 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.790
 write the name of the video file 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.009
 you can choose it the way you want I will put it 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.420
 try the important thing is to leave 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.250
 mp4 extension press enter to me 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.640
 at least these writings appear on the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.370
 no one appears on the phone 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.820
 icon 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.790
 does not warn you that you are recording but 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.780
 however you are doing it and do the 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.480
 your video in the meantime I will record 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.370
 a game of the trigger 2 to see a 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.020
 bit like the graphics because a game a lot 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.240
 I don't know if you know how heavy it is 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.869
 we'll see how it behaves for 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.780
 complete to complete the registration 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.430

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.110

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.070
