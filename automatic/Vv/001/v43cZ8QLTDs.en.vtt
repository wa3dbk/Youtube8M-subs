00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
Bernice is kind of studying checking a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.389 
Bernice is kind of studying checking a
little<00:00:58.469> bit<00:00:58.559> toward<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.800> back<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.190> pack

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
little bit toward the back of the pack

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.099 
little bit toward the back of the pack
losing<00:00:59.760> some<00:00:59.910> position<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.390> i<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
losing some position but i think the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.229 
losing some position but i think the
position<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.920> storm<00:01:02.219> hope<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.579> losing<00:01:02.969> here

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
is going to play in key throughout the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.380 
is going to play in key throughout the
rest<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> race<00:01:05.250> i<00:01:05.460> agree<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
rest of the race i agree and it's a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.789 
rest of the race i agree and it's a
question<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.049> maintaining<00:01:07.290> your

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
question of you know maintaining your

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.679 
question of you know maintaining your
position<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.549> easier<00:01:08.970> said<00:01:09.240> than<00:01:09.450> done

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
position and it's easier said than done

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.750 
position and it's easier said than done
but<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.590> feel<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:10.860> storm<00:01:11.280> hope<00:01:11.490> went

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
but it really feel like storm hope went

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.130 
but it really feel like storm hope went

opening<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.479> too<00:01:24.689> big<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> lead<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
opening up just too big a lead now the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.560 
opening up just too big a lead now the
other<00:01:26.220> thing<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.850> totally<00:01:27.210> smile<00:01:27.420> an

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
other thing is we totally smile an

eighth<00:01:27.720> races<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.680> turf<00:01:29.070> they're<00:01:29.850> tricky

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
eighth races on the turf they're tricky

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
eighth races on the turf they're tricky
races<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.810> seems<00:01:31.140> like<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.619> force<00:01:32.009> that

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
races and it seems like that force that

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.190 
races and it seems like that force that
establishes<00:01:33.119> itself<00:01:33.390> top<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.930> stretch

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
establishes itself top of the stretch

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.020 
establishes itself top of the stretch
early<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> stretch<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.880> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
early in the stretch is the one that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.850 
early in the stretch is the one that
wins<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> race<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:36.780> often<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.680> for

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
wins the race very often I think for

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.100 
wins the race very often I think for
this<00:01:38.159> particular<00:01:38.369> age<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.060> 24<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.750> open

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
this particular age of 24 and for open

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.289 
this particular age of 24 and for open
and<00:01:40.200> quarter<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.619> quick<00:01:41.100> pace<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.090> racy

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and quarter a quick pace on in this racy

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.160 
and quarter a quick pace on in this racy
area<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.540> you're<00:01:42.659> probably<00:01:42.810> looking<00:01:43.140> for

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
area so you're probably looking for

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.810 
area so you're probably looking for
someone<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.649> come<00:01:43.829> from<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.640> bit<00:01:44.729> off

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
someone to come from a little bit off

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.490 
someone to come from a little bit off
the<00:01:44.939> pace<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.270> indeed<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.689> was<00:01:45.810> some<00:01:46.320> kind

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the pace and indeed there was some kind

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.899 
the pace and indeed there was some kind
of<00:01:46.530> pace<00:01:46.710> collapse<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> two

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
of pace collapse in here is the two

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.370 
of pace collapse in here is the two
frontrunners<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.630> finished<00:01:48.899> off<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> board

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
frontrunners that finished off the board

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.960 
frontrunners that finished off the board
in<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.530> spot<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.369> once<00:01:50.850> they

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
in the spot here but you see once they

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.609 
in the spot here but you see once they
pass<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> trees<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.689> where<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> two<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.590> a

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
any running of the race and also make

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.870 
any running of the race and also make
victories<00:03:51.470> worse<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:51.890> probably<00:03:52.580> would<00:03:52.730> like

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
victories worse that probably would like

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.910 
victories worse that probably would like
to<00:03:53.030> have<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.180> little<00:03:53.420> bit<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.720> maybe<00:03:54.290> more<00:03:54.620> pace

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
to have a little bit of maybe more pace

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.199 
to have a little bit of maybe more pace
but<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.220> don't<00:03:55.340> even<00:03:55.550> know<00:03:55.790> if<00:03:55.820> that's<00:03:56.060> the

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
but I don't even know if that's the

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.400 
but I don't even know if that's the
problem<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.540> problem<00:03:56.570> it<00:03:56.959> Victor<00:03:57.200> II<00:03:57.260> never

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
problem the problem it Victor II never

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.080 
problem the problem it Victor II never
gets<00:03:57.709> in<00:03:57.830> any<00:03:58.010> kind<00:03:58.100> of<00:03:58.340> comfortable<00:03:58.790> spot

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
gets in any kind of comfortable spot

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.750 
gets in any kind of comfortable spot
yeah<00:03:59.690> definitely<00:04:00.020> that<00:04:00.560> early<00:04:01.130> on<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.430> racer

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
yeah definitely that early on the racer

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.400 
yeah definitely that early on the racer
to<00:04:01.970> tears<00:04:02.209> or<00:04:02.390> horses<00:04:02.600> that<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.019> front<00:04:03.230> group

the<00:04:03.530> back<00:04:03.709> group<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.070> then<00:04:04.160> they're<00:04:04.519> all

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
the back group and then they're all

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.070 
the back group and then they're all
stacked<00:04:04.910> three<00:04:05.120> or<00:04:05.239> four<00:04:05.420> wide<00:04:05.570> across<00:04:05.840> his

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
stacked three or four wide across his

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.810 
stacked three or four wide across his
track<00:04:06.200> but<00:04:06.500> right<00:04:07.100> here<00:04:07.280> you<00:04:07.430> see<00:04:07.580> Jackie

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
track but right here you see Jackie

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.250 
track but right here you see Jackie
kounia<00:04:08.209> Velasco<00:04:08.660> seems<00:04:08.900> like<00:04:09.019> he<00:04:09.110> just

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
kounia Velasco seems like he just

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.750 
kounia Velasco seems like he just
doesn't<00:04:09.530> know<00:04:09.560> quite<00:04:09.769> where<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.070> where<00:04:10.489> to<00:04:10.550> go

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
doesn't know quite where to where to go

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.009 
doesn't know quite where to where to go
with<00:04:10.850> my<00:04:11.030> victory<00:04:11.360> if<00:04:11.510> you<00:04:11.630> should<00:04:11.810> try<00:04:11.959> to

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
with my victory if you should try to

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.930 
with my victory if you should try to
move<00:04:12.320> them<00:04:12.470> up<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:12.770> make<00:04:13.310> some<00:04:13.340> remove<00:04:13.760> hurry

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
move them up and make some remove hurry

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.190 
move them up and make some remove hurry
up<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.180> make<00:04:14.240> some<00:04:14.300> kind<00:04:14.600> of<00:04:14.660> run<00:04:14.810> or<00:04:14.930> just<00:04:15.080> sit

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
up and make some kind of run or just sit

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.690 
up and make some kind of run or just sit
toward<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.470> back<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.800> pack<00:04:16.010> I<00:04:16.220> think

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
toward the back of the pack I think

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.479 
toward the back of the pack I think
eventually<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.239> gets

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
eventually it gets

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.309 
eventually it gets
kind<00:04:17.759> of<00:04:17.789> a<00:04:17.880> comfortable<00:04:18.269> spot<00:04:18.479> here<00:04:18.810> sitting

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:19.319 
kind of a comfortable spot here sitting

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:20.839 
kind of a comfortable spot here sitting
toward<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.650> middle<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:19.949> pack<00:04:20.190> but<00:04:20.459> you

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
toward the middle of the pack but you

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.279 
toward the middle of the pack but you
know<00:04:20.970> but<00:04:21.329> we'll<00:04:21.479> see<00:04:21.630> Mac<00:04:21.780> victory<00:04:22.139> come

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
know but we'll see Mac victory come

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.809 
know but we'll see Mac victory come
around<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.590> second<00:04:22.949> turn<00:04:23.099> now<00:04:23.340> make<00:04:23.580> Victor

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:23.819 
around the second turn now make Victor

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.370 
around the second turn now make Victor
we<00:04:23.910> kind<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.090> drops<00:04:24.270> back<00:04:24.509> off<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.900> off<00:04:25.199> those

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
we kind of drops back off the off those

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.480 
we kind of drops back off the off those
are<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.590> two<00:04:25.710> horses<00:04:25.979> that<00:04:26.130> were<00:04:26.250> right<00:04:26.400> to

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
are the two horses that were right to

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.950 
are the two horses that were right to
her<00:04:26.610> inside<00:04:26.970> they<00:04:27.120> kind<00:04:27.360> of<00:04:27.449> make<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.870> little

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
her inside they kind of make a little

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.570 
her inside they kind of make a little
bit<00:04:28.199> of<00:04:28.259> a<00:04:28.410> move<00:04:28.560> up<00:04:28.740> here<00:04:28.830> anomic<00:04:29.220> victims

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
bit of a move up here anomic victims

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.129 
bit of a move up here anomic victims
kind<00:04:29.789> of<00:04:29.880> back<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.180> last<00:04:30.360> this<00:04:30.569> bout<00:04:30.810> here<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.080> a

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
kind of back to last this bout here so a

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.900 
kind of back to last this bout here so a
real<00:04:31.319> tricky<00:04:31.680> spot<00:04:31.949> I<00:04:31.979> think<00:04:32.069> Renee<00:04:32.430> Velasquez

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
real tricky spot I think Renee Velasquez

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.089 
real tricky spot I think Renee Velasquez
found<00:04:33.120> himself<00:04:33.240> in<00:04:33.539> here<00:04:33.690> yeah<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.050> agree<00:04:34.620> it's

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
found himself in here yeah I agree it's

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.010 
found himself in here yeah I agree it's
just<00:04:35.160> I<00:04:35.340> mean<00:04:35.370> it's<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.150> dynamics<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.900> the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
just I mean it's the dynamics of the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.839 
just I mean it's the dynamics of the
race<00:04:37.229> it's<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.680> dynamics<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.370> mile<00:04:38.580> in<00:04:38.759> a

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
race it's the dynamics of a mile in a

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.450 
race it's the dynamics of a mile in a
turf<00:04:39.210> race<00:04:39.479> here<00:04:39.810> it's<00:04:40.470> very<00:04:40.710> tricky<00:04:41.099> and

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
turf race here it's very tricky and

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.189 
turf race here it's very tricky and
Nikoli<00:04:41.940> I'm<00:04:42.330> not<00:04:42.509> saying<00:04:42.750> I<00:04:42.870> don't<00:04:42.990> think

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
Nikoli I'm not saying I don't think

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.629 
Nikoli I'm not saying I don't think
either<00:04:43.319> of<00:04:43.470> us<00:04:43.590> or<00:04:43.770> suggested<00:04:44.250> make<00:04:44.370> victory

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
either of us or suggested make victory

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.159 
either of us or suggested make victory
should<00:04:44.819> have<00:04:44.910> won<00:04:45.060> this<00:04:45.240> race<00:04:45.479> but<00:04:45.810> the

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
should have won this race but the

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.450 
should have won this race but the
question<00:04:46.560> of<00:04:46.620> course<00:04:46.770> with<00:04:46.949> all<00:04:47.039> these<00:04:47.099> races

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
question of course with all these races

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.589 
question of course with all these races
what<00:04:47.639> do<00:04:47.699> you<00:04:47.759> do<00:04:47.849> going<00:04:48.030> forward<00:04:48.330> now<00:04:48.539> the

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
what do you do going forward now the

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.120 
what do you do going forward now the
horses<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.139> lead<00:04:49.349> finishes<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:49.949> think

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
horses and the lead finishes I think

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.309 
horses and the lead finishes I think
forth<00:04:50.819> from<00:04:50.970> this<00:04:51.090> race<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.810> winners<00:04:52.080> or<00:04:52.229> is

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
forth from this race the winners or is

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.050 
forth from this race the winners or is
right<00:04:52.470> behind<00:04:52.650> her<00:04:53.009> the<00:04:53.310> worst<00:04:53.460> right<00:04:53.669> behind

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
right behind her the worst right behind

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.730 
right behind her the worst right behind
her<00:04:54.389> finishes<00:04:54.870> third<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.409> horse<00:04:55.590> outside

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
her finishes third and the horse outside

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.170 
her finishes third and the horse outside
of<00:04:56.069> that<00:04:56.159> and<00:04:56.370> inside<00:04:56.639> of<00:04:56.789> my<00:04:56.849> victory

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
of that and inside of my victory

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.300 
of that and inside of my victory
finishes<00:04:57.960> second<00:04:58.319> this<00:04:58.440> race<00:04:58.620> but<00:04:58.800> mcvicar<00:04:59.130> he

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
finishes second this race but mcvicar he

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.980 
finishes second this race but mcvicar he
takes<00:04:59.580> all<00:04:59.789> the<00:04:59.970> worst<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:00.449> now<00:05:00.599> making

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
takes all the worst of it now making

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.430 
takes all the worst of it now making
this<00:05:01.080> turn<00:05:02.069> move<00:05:02.370> for<00:05:02.849> wide<00:05:03.210> really<00:05:03.720> five<00:05:04.080> wide

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
this turn move for wide really five wide

this turn move for wide really five wide
at<00:05:04.680> this<00:05:04.830> point<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.580> just<00:05:05.789> felt<00:05:06.090> like<00:05:06.180> Nick

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
at this point and I just felt like Nick

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:07.820 
at this point and I just felt like Nick
victor<00:05:06.720> is<00:05:06.810> one<00:05:06.960> of<00:05:07.020> these<00:05:07.110> horses<00:05:07.409> that<00:05:07.500> never

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
victor is one of these horses that never

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.010 
victor is one of these horses that never
really<00:05:08.220> had<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.430> fair<00:05:08.759> chance<00:05:08.789> now<00:05:09.330> she's<00:05:09.810> not

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
really had a fair chance now she's not

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.589 
really had a fair chance now she's not
also<00:05:10.349> not<00:05:10.770> really<00:05:11.130> good<00:05:11.370> enough<00:05:11.400> maybe<00:05:12.330> she

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
also not really good enough maybe she

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.990 
also not really good enough maybe she
needs<00:05:12.810> a<00:05:12.900> drop<00:05:13.169> in<00:05:13.380> for<00:05:13.590> $50,000<00:05:14.490> claiming<00:05:14.880> or

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
three Boyle vessel in my mind had

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.529 
three Boyle vessel in my mind had
absolutely<00:06:13.889> no<00:06:14.400> chance<00:06:14.729> given<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.300> trip

absolutely no chance given the trip

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.149 
absolutely no chance given the trip
where<00:06:16.050> a<00:06:16.080> vessel<00:06:16.440> kind<00:06:16.620> of<00:06:16.710> gets<00:06:16.830> one<00:06:16.979> of<00:06:17.039> those

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:17.159 
where a vessel kind of gets one of those

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:18.980 
where a vessel kind of gets one of those
stuck<00:06:17.400> down<00:06:17.580> inside<00:06:17.969> trips<00:06:18.330> that<00:06:18.539> you<00:06:18.870> know

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
them until the top of the stretch when

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.420 
them until the top of the stretch when
it<00:06:22.020> doesn't<00:06:22.169> pan<00:06:22.409> out<00:06:22.440> so<00:06:22.620> well<00:06:22.949> you<00:06:23.310> know

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
it doesn't pan out so well you know

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.219 
it doesn't pan out so well you know
right<00:06:23.610> here<00:06:23.880> I<00:06:23.909> think<00:06:24.150> royal<00:06:24.389> vessels<00:06:24.780> getting

here<00:06:34.600> but<00:06:34.780> like<00:06:34.900> you<00:06:35.020> said<00:06:35.170> I<00:06:35.380> mean<00:06:35.470> this<00:06:35.590> is<00:06:35.650> a

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
here but like you said I mean this is a

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.520 
here but like you said I mean this is a
15,000<00:06:36.580> to<00:06:36.670> lifetime<00:06:37.060> claimer<00:06:37.390> royal<00:06:38.110> vessel

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
15,000 to lifetime claimer royal vessel

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.960 
15,000 to lifetime claimer royal vessel
you<00:06:38.740> know<00:06:38.830> these<00:06:38.950> horses<00:06:39.340> might<00:06:39.490> meet<00:06:39.670> again

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:39.970 
you know these horses might meet again

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.820 
you know these horses might meet again
but<00:06:40.180> I<00:06:40.210> don't<00:06:40.480> think<00:06:40.600> this<00:06:41.050> spot<00:06:41.290> here<00:06:41.500> how

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
but I don't think this spot here how

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.320 
but I don't think this spot here how
much<00:06:41.950> you're<00:06:42.100> gonna<00:06:42.160> see<00:06:42.400> royal<00:06:42.670> vessel<00:06:43.000> over

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
much you're gonna see royal vessel over

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.360 
much you're gonna see royal vessel over
the<00:06:43.480> six<00:06:43.690> weeks<00:06:43.900> up<00:06:44.020> at<00:06:44.140> Saratoga<00:06:44.560> I<00:06:44.710> agree<00:06:45.340> i

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
the six weeks up at Saratoga I agree i

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.860 
the six weeks up at Saratoga I agree i
think<00:06:45.550> where<00:06:45.790> to<00:06:45.880> get<00:06:46.000> one<00:06:46.150> more<00:06:46.210> chance<00:06:46.390> with

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
think where to get one more chance with

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.510 
think where to get one more chance with
royal<00:06:47.050> vessel<00:06:47.500> and<00:06:47.680> that's<00:06:47.950> all<00:06:48.100> i<00:06:48.160> want<00:06:48.400> is

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
royal vessel and that's all i want is

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.130 
royal vessel and that's all i want is
one<00:06:48.700> more<00:06:48.880> chance<00:06:49.150> against<00:06:49.600> a<00:06:49.660> very<00:06:49.840> similar

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
one more chance against a very similar

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.360 
one more chance against a very similar
field<00:06:50.590> it's<00:06:51.250> a<00:06:51.370> situation<00:06:52.090> where<00:06:52.330> you<00:06:53.170> know

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
field it's a situation where you know

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.590 
field it's a situation where you know
ends<00:06:54.370> up<00:06:54.490> dropping<00:06:55.000> will<00:06:55.180> that's<00:06:55.450> ones

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
ends up dropping will that's ones

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.420 
ends up dropping will that's ones
dropping<00:06:56.080> really<00:06:56.200> more<00:06:56.560> the<00:06:56.710> fence<00:06:57.010> here<00:06:57.340> and

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
dropping really more the fence here and

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.680 
dropping really more the fence here and
you<00:06:57.490> can<00:06:57.580> see<00:06:57.790> right<00:06:57.820> here<00:06:58.240> it's<00:06:58.390> not<00:06:58.540> getting

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
you can see right here it's not getting

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.510 
you can see right here it's not getting

through<00:07:28.930> and<00:07:28.990> between<00:07:29.260> horses<00:07:29.620> they're<00:07:29.890> a

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 
through and between horses they're a

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:31.500 
through and between horses they're a
little<00:07:30.130> bit<00:07:30.310> has<00:07:30.460> to<00:07:30.610> all<00:07:30.820> the<00:07:31.060> course<00:07:31.270> back

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:31.510 
little bit has to all the course back

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.240 
little bit has to all the course back
off<00:07:31.720> the<00:07:31.840> rail<00:07:32.020> in<00:07:32.140> between<00:07:32.410> so<00:07:32.560> never<00:07:33.010> really

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.250 
off the rail in between so never really

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.110 
off the rail in between so never really
got<00:07:33.400> a<00:07:33.430> full<00:07:33.640> head<00:07:33.790> of<00:07:33.820> steam<00:07:33.940> going

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 
got a full head of steam going

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.220 
got a full head of steam going
throughout<00:07:34.570> the<00:07:34.660> stretch<00:07:34.900> of<00:07:35.020> it<00:07:35.110> I<00:07:35.169> don't

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:35.230 
throughout the stretch of it I don't

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.540 
throughout the stretch of it I don't
think<00:07:35.470> she<00:07:35.590> finished<00:07:35.890> up<00:07:36.010> for<00:07:36.160> mush<00:07:36.310> run

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:36.550 
think she finished up for mush run

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.640 
think she finished up for mush run
either<00:07:37.030> in<00:07:37.270> this<00:07:37.390> spot<00:07:37.570> here<00:07:37.750> but<00:07:37.930> I<00:07:37.990> think<00:07:38.020> the

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:38.650 
either in this spot here but I think the

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.020 
either in this spot here but I think the
point<00:07:38.860> where<00:07:39.040> she<00:07:39.190> was<00:07:39.340> going<00:07:39.370> to<00:07:39.520> be<00:07:39.640> asked<00:07:39.970> at

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.030 
point where she was going to be asked at

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.520 
point where she was going to be asked at
the<00:07:40.060> top<00:07:40.300> of<00:07:40.330> the<00:07:40.450> stretch<00:07:40.690> was<00:07:40.990> when<00:07:41.230> she<00:07:41.380> got

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.530 
the top of the stretch was when she got

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.380 
the top of the stretch was when she got
into<00:07:41.740> that<00:07:41.919> trouble<00:07:42.310> and<00:07:42.400> I<00:07:42.850> think<00:07:43.060> that<00:07:43.180> cost

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:43.390 
into that trouble and I think that cost

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.000 
into that trouble and I think that cost
us<00:07:43.510> some<00:07:43.540> momentum<00:07:43.750> and<00:07:44.200> probably<00:07:44.560> led<00:07:44.710> to<00:07:44.860> her

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.010 
us some momentum and probably led to her

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.680 
us some momentum and probably led to her
getting<00:07:45.640> beaten<00:07:45.850> by<00:07:45.970> a<00:07:46.090> few<00:07:46.300> more<00:07:46.390> lines<00:07:46.540> since

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:46.690 
getting beaten by a few more lines since

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.450 
getting beaten by a few more lines since
she<00:07:46.780> did<00:07:46.930> I<00:07:47.050> agree<00:07:47.440> in<00:07:47.560> there<00:07:47.680> cheaper<00:07:48.040> horses

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.460 
she did I agree in there cheaper horses

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.710 
she did I agree in there cheaper horses
