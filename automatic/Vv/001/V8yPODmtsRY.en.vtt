fridge looks like I really like a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.710 
fridge looks like I really like a
refrigerator<00:00:22.140> because<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.800> does<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
refrigerator because it does have the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.320 
refrigerator because it does have the
French<00:00:24.720> doors<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.160> freezer<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.820> down<00:00:27.180> at

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330

French doors and the freezer is down at
the<00:00:27.420> bottom<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.289> gives<00:00:28.920> me<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> lot<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.460> space

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the bottom so it gives me a lot of space

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.209 
the bottom so it gives me a lot of space
and<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.170> feel<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.590> really<00:00:31.710> opens

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
and I just feel like it really opens

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.479 
and I just feel like it really opens
everything<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.320> you<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.440> allows<00:00:34.890> me<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
everything up and you know allows me to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.380 
everything up and you know allows me to
see<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.719> inside<00:00:37.320> better<00:00:38.210> but<00:00:39.210> I'm

sort of a fridge you have I think that

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.330

it's amazing if you can kind of organize

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.490

it<00:07:14.520> however<00:07:14.700> you<00:07:15.150> want<00:07:15.360> whether<00:07:15.570> it's<00:07:16.230> similar

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
it however you want whether it's similar

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.530 
it however you want whether it's similar
to<00:07:16.770> this<00:07:16.890> with<00:07:17.130> labels<00:07:17.550> and<00:07:17.670> bins<00:07:17.970> or<00:07:18.300> a

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:18.540 
to this with labels and bins or a

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.360 
to this with labels and bins or a
completely<00:07:19.200> different<00:07:19.350> way<00:07:19.620> I<00:07:19.860> just<00:07:19.890> think

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
completely different way I just think

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.150 
completely different way I just think
that<00:07:20.520> it<00:07:20.730> makes<00:07:20.970> cooking<00:07:21.690> and<00:07:22.140> snacking<00:07:22.620> and

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 
that it makes cooking and snacking and

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.940 
that it makes cooking and snacking and
just<00:07:23.790> eating<00:07:24.260> healthier<00:07:25.260> and<00:07:25.440> eating<00:07:25.650> at<00:07:25.770> home

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:25.950

just eating healthier and eating at home
more<00:07:26.220> often<00:07:26.720> so<00:07:27.720> much<00:07:27.900> easier<00:07:28.320> when<00:07:29.090> things

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.090 
more often so much easier when things

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.660 
more often so much easier when things
are<00:07:30.450> arranged<00:07:31.260> in<00:07:31.470> a<00:07:31.920> way<00:07:31.950> that<00:07:32.220> you<00:07:32.310> can<00:07:32.490> see

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:32.670
