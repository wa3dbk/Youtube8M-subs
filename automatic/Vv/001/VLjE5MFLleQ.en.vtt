weather camping a snow shoeing so I

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.130 
weather camping a snow shoeing so I
wanted<00:00:17.949> to<00:00:18.009> take<00:00:18.310> a<00:00:18.339> minute<00:00:18.669> and<00:00:18.970> share<00:00:19.689> the

cook set that I bring with me in the

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.859 
cook set that I bring with me in the
winter<00:00:24.689> what<00:00:25.689> I<00:00:25.720> use<00:00:26.079> here<00:00:26.499> is<00:00:26.739> the<00:00:27.149> MSR<00:00:28.149> Alpine

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
winter what I use here is the MSR Alpine

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:37.380 
winter what I use here is the MSR Alpine
2<00:00:31.619> weighing<00:00:32.619> at<00:00:32.980> a<00:00:33.010> staggering<00:00:35.010> 21<00:00:36.010> ounces<00:00:36.390> but

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
2 weighing at a staggering 21 ounces but

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.490 
2 weighing at a staggering 21 ounces but
I<00:00:37.719> think<00:00:38.050> it's<00:00:38.850> justified<00:00:39.850> for<00:00:40.390> winter<00:00:40.750> the

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
I think it's justified for winter the

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
I think it's justified for winter the
distances<00:00:42.160> are<00:00:42.370> shorter<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:43.739> pace<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:45.039> slower

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
distances are shorter the pace is slower

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
distances are shorter the pace is slower
you<00:00:46.510> bring<00:00:46.780> more<00:00:46.989> food<00:00:47.379> it's<00:00:48.179> time<00:00:49.179> to<00:00:49.510> kind<00:00:49.719> of

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
you bring more food it's time to kind of

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.020 
you bring more food it's time to kind of
slow<00:00:51.070> down<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.489> enjoy<00:00:53.550> instead<00:00:54.550> of<00:00:54.730> just

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
slow down and enjoy instead of just

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.000 
slow down and enjoy instead of just
pounding<00:00:55.749> the<00:00:55.870> trail<00:00:56.170> and<00:00:56.499> clicking<00:00:56.859> off

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
pounding the trail and clicking off

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.899 
pounding the trail and clicking off
miles<00:00:57.429> and<00:00:57.969> going<00:00:58.239> from<00:00:58.390> A<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:58.629> B<00:00:58.809> I<00:00:59.519> that's<00:01:00.519> one

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
miles and going from A to B I that's one

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.669 
miles and going from A to B I that's one
of<00:01:00.999> the<00:01:01.059> reasons<00:01:01.300> why<00:01:01.420> I<00:01:01.449> really<00:01:01.780> enjoy<00:01:02.320> winter

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
it's not necessarily based on mileage or

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.650 
it's not necessarily based on mileage or
a<00:01:10.090> pace<00:01:10.420> it's<00:01:10.810> based<00:01:11.080> off<00:01:11.410> of<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:13.270> what

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.399 

comes<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.920> aluminum<00:02:05.850> pot<00:02:06.090> handle<00:02:06.630> it's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
comes with the aluminum pot handle it's

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.040 
comes with the aluminum pot handle it's
a<00:02:07.979> soft<00:02:08.660> soft<00:02:09.660> aluminum<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:11.180> these<00:02:12.180> bent<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
a soft soft aluminum and these bent and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.809 
a soft soft aluminum and these bent and
I<00:02:13.170> was<00:02:13.319> bending<00:02:13.800> them<00:02:13.950> back<00:02:14.160> with<00:02:14.370> my<00:02:14.550> pliers

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
I was bending them back with my pliers

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.240 
I was bending them back with my pliers
but<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:16.190> figured<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:18.680> was<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:19.920> going<00:02:20.160> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
but I figured that I was just going to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.570 
but I figured that I was just going to
break<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.819> but<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.560> mean<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.739> still<00:02:23.040> locks<00:02:23.340> up

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
break it but I mean it still locks up

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.470 
break it but I mean it still locks up
tight<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.510> still<00:02:25.489> maneuver<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.910> pan

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
tight and you can still maneuver the pan

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.070 
tight and you can still maneuver the pan
or<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> pot<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:29.670> leave<00:02:29.849> them<00:02:30.000> bent<00:02:30.300> but

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
or the pot so I just leave them bent but

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.020 
or the pot so I just leave them bent but
you<00:02:31.349> know<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.560> think<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.790> want<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
you know I think for if you want to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.479 
you know I think for if you want to
consider<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.630> set<00:02:33.930> an<00:02:34.140> entry-level<00:02:34.620> set

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
consider this set an entry-level set

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.410 
consider this set an entry-level set
I<00:02:35.989> think<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.170> pot<00:02:37.440> holders<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.700> great<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.239> mean

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
I think this pot holders is great I mean

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.650 
I think this pot holders is great I mean
if<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.690> wanted<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.019> upgrade<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.709> titanium
