 here we are together here is a lot 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.280
 ideas are spoken designed for 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.170
 the videos you do not know yet 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.760
 that's what's down there sometimes 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.290
 I've seen that up there 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.390
 many wanted to know what is there 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.689
 below what happened, you come with me 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.689

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.920
 and come see through her 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.400
 completely disheveled but still completely 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 fresh i set up a little home jim 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.229
 a small office jim i can call you as 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.810
 psychologist and especially as well 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.700
 Personal trainers say that sport 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.280
 really the motivation also at the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.350
 promotes work 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.479
 making many companies that I 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.410
 I also have a pacified 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.660
 Health management and much recognition 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.640
 It's just that sport as a whole 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.220
 Whole attitude within the company 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.500
 within the whole structure 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.509
 improves the well-being improved 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.580
 That's why people are seen first 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.660
 work very diligent hard up 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.430
 Need a bit of course 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.350
 We compensate for that 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.149
 little jim but also for you for the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.009
 videos we are from here 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.259
 show a little what you can with a little bit 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.640
 small equipment on good on the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.340
 legs can do what training plans 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.650
 As far as we are concerned, we will show that you too 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.150
 at home really without equipment too 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.770
 good things can make you whole 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.700
 I can cobble together workouts 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.090
 will help you with that 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.530
 with little effort and the video should 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.030
 not just a little behind the scenes 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.100
 but I wanted to be like that 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.560
 as a second point a bit the topic 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.799
 appeal to fitness studio 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.120
 many ask me simon where do you train 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.540
 why do you not only train in yours? 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.920
 job 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.850
 you may know my job at the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.290
 uni and many ask me why 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.970
 do not you train in the difference 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.040
 is in very different 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.570
 gyms you probably will 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.000
 ask yourself now why is he judging 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.060
 another when he teams in so many 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.459
 The answer is really great 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.070
 Clearly I am a fan of 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.049
 different jims i'm fan of it 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.370
 to train very differently though 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.860
 you know my programs if you the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.819
 programs you will see that 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.590
 my programs 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.780
 are that the flexibility it again 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.780
 new exercises also start as 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.189
 I noticed personal trainer or 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.450
 That's what we do over the years 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.519
 Again and again we change exercises 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.569
 you might change as well 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.609
 Remember if in my other gym 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.189
 have trained the next part of the 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.810
 Muscular hangover much stronger than 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.459
 if you're so regular in your own 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.079
 That's why I train 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.700
 always very different always 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.909
 new stimuli set again and again 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.489
 bring the body to something new with what 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.519
 he does not expect the body wants to be safe 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.419
 do not change you know the videos 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.950
 Muscle building is nothing for the body 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.989
 beautiful for us but the body 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.400
 need for much more energy that wants 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.870
 not necessarily spend now 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.730
 that is why it is quite good when we have the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.859
 always expose you to new irritants 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.560
 different teams are very good for that 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.359
 well i'm really big fan of 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.669
 I also train all these chains 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.530
 many ask where else do you train like that? 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.469
 I like to train in this too 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.900
 all wittigs mcfit and so on me 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.250
 think it's cool because I'm very much there 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.810
 I am independent since sometimes 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.449
 train at night because i can in the morning 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.829
 The days of the day also work out 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.329
 really good if you do not always like that 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.530
 have your time of day but if you 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.970
 sometimes in the morning, sometimes at night 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.009
 many ask me but make another 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.840
 separate video to when should I 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.430
 It also works out 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.720
 is different at night 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.340
 train you will see that is one 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.159
 Another delight for the body of it 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.620
 not counting and also between the 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:29.509
 work a bit 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.919
 The body will not be so good at it 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.630
 adjust ebert and beautiful muscle hangover 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.190
 get and it will be your training 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.259
 Just freshen up a bit 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.330
 that's why the theme behind the scenes 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.460
 my little Jim i like to go in 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.990
 like to train different jobs 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.759
 in felix genn in june gem 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.380
 That's why I was here again 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.970
 little Jim will be on my whole 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.430
 People show how to get here right 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.620
 I want to motivate everybody 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.219
 to make sport motivating in the sense 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.380
 friends 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.240

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.810
