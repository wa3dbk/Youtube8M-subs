00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.429
 first official day of work 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.440
 World Mobile Congress 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.809
 Barcelona I decided to close myself 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.000
 samsung company late in the evening 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.520
 special step for journalists and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.859
 partners took everyone to on the king 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.109
 or speaking simple Russian we 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.500
 arrived to unpack your event 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.060
 Koreans call it not the first time 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.429
 the novelties of this evening were samsung 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.130
 galaxy number five smart watch gear number 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.320
 2 and fitness bracelet gear fit not to say 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.090
 that the announcement caused a storm of enthusiasm there 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.290
 very doubtful and I would say 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.300
 bad decisions 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.079
 and there are very interesting and useful 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 finds let's understand together 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.910
 then the Korean announcement bloggers became 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.100
 of course samsung galaxy s5 new 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.260
 the company 's flagship smartphone about him 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.239
 He talked a lot of high expectations but 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.840
 waiting for a holiday is always better 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.030
 holiday 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.160
 perhaps this is the reason why 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.719
 the product caused quite ambiguous 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.090
 emotions for example 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.129
 design did not cause much enthusiasm 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.150
 Korean design devices in principle 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.369
 amateur stories 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.740
 and here did not have time to get used to the user 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.200
 gloss and re- plastics under the skin 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.020
 how the company made a feint with ears changed 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.630
 the texture is now plastic with perforation on 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.400
 my taste decision is very controversial and quite 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.680
 no good for expensive device 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.360
 claims on the premium segment but 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.340
 distract from the external parameters 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.070
 After all, you can always find a cover on 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 your taste and so vest any floor 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 Samsung is traditionally a complete order 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.119
 quad-core processor with a frequency of 2 s 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.100
 half gigahertz 2 gigabytes 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.729
 operational and 16 gigabytes of built-in 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.939
 Memory + micro sd card support up to one hundred 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.619
 twenty eight gigabytes and also from 530 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.829
 and to nfc port and 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.780
 lp all this is very commendable screen too 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.990
 traditionally quality and here it is 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.049
 full hd super amoled diagonal 5.1 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.460
 inches highlight unsurpassed 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.320
 black depth 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.210
 but such things we love to check 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.509
 calorimeter in full mode 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.720
 testing an important point the battery and its 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.910
 capacity optimization is 2800 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.160
 miliamper hours 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.460
 and according to the company it should 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.650
 enough for 10 hours of browsing and 12 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.080
 hours watching video but the most 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.790
 interesting is not there 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.310
 special mode extreme 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.170
 energy saving whether it is a background 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.350
 were inspired by more electronic 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.750
 Readers in general, the essence is this if you have 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.000
 only 10 percent left charge you can 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.920
 activate this feature to get 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.790
 additional 25 hours in mode 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.280
 expectations 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.750
 press the button to fade all colors except 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.690
 black and white 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.660
 nice so light noir on the screen 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.490
 there are only the most necessary applications 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.830
 turn off auto-rotate screen all for 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.690
 maintaining autonomous life think 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.880
 there are even those who will use 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.970
 this mode is permanent 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.760
 but what stylish still liked how 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.980
 chamber 16 is finalized megapixel 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.630
 with amazing fast focusing itself 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.210
 company to voice three tenths 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.130
 second orphan mask here wide 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.620
 dynamic range and new feature 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.300
 selective focus by touch 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.820
 choose the desired object in the near or 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.280
 in the background he will be the focus and all 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.300
 the rest is artistically divorced 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.270
 the right decision was to protect 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.400
 the device according to the ip67 standard 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.930
 a six in this combination means that 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.270
 dust won't be able to get into 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.030
 device full contact protection 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.650
 and the seven says that it is permissible 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.930
 short dive to depth 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.540
 less than a meter to half an hour 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.640
 pay attention to the fact that I am constant 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.820
 no underwater operation 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.890
 for this you need already 39 questionable 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.810
 solution can be attributed for example sensor 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.510
 heart rate he is under 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.640
 eye camera and is similar to its flash 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.500
 readings diverge very much even in 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.690
 within a couple of minutes on the example of one and 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.360
 the same test seriously rely 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.930
 these measurements I would not here as we 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.540
 were expecting 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.760
 appeared became fingerprints but on 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.180
 I didn't really like this stage 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.950
 how does it work unlike iphone 5s 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.770
 bioscanner built-in power button and 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.990
 recognizes 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.360
 already the seals instantly how not to attach 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.310
 here everything is not going so smoothly for 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.290
 successful recognition as you can see 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.690
 several attempts are required 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.060
 by the way there is a child mode 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.770
 now this smartphone can be given 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.140
 child without fear that he will write 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.180
 your boss or upload a photo from 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.860
 personal archive in instagram except 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.710
 flagship smartphone Koreans showed 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.660
 smart watch gear 2 generation camera 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.520
 moved the strap on the case that 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.860
 made the device look more elegant 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.930
 among applications there is for example software for 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.790
 control TV or set-top box and 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.820
 good set quit us app 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.620
 they work on the tizen 2 platform 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.310
 wearable gadget from samsung is called 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.010
 gear fit 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.870
 This is a fitness bracelet that is a fashionable theme. 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.390
 demanded special pride 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.780
 koreans cause bent super amoled 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.970
 screen 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.040
 wrist shape he can and repeats but 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.900
 perceive information from the screen at all 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.970
 uncomfortable unless of course unscrew 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.070
 arm developers have provided replaceable 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.140
 aspirations main unit easily removable 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.330
 there is a sensor on the back 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.430
 heart rate here it is much 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.500
 more relevant and works more correctly than 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.000
 in the smartphone as i understood it does in 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.280
 during a given period of several 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.560
 measurements and then gives their average 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.170
 arithmetic value set of applications 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.690
 for sport by itself is quite thought out and 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.030
 just like in a smart watch you can choose 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.890
 clock style from retro to 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.440
 hi-tech 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.780
 What to Samsung for us all but we do not 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.580
 treat you go further they 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.290
 Feoktistov and page terokhin hi-tech 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.290
 mail.ru stay pouring
