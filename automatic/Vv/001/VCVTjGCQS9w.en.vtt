if I already had a black castor or two I

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.690 
if I already had a black castor or two I
definitely<00:04:37.450> would<00:04:37.900> would<00:04:38.350> take<00:04:38.560> it<00:04:38.770> I'm<00:04:38.980> or<00:04:39.580> if

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
definitely would would take it I'm or if

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.480 
definitely would would take it I'm or if
I<00:04:39.790> drafted<00:04:40.240> several<00:04:40.570> enchantments<00:04:41.170> I'm

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
I drafted several enchantments I'm

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.710 
I drafted several enchantments I'm
assuming<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:42.580> haven't<00:04:42.910> done<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.450> think

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
assuming I haven't done that I think

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.660 
assuming I haven't done that I think
hunt<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:44.080> week<00:04:44.260> while<00:04:44.590> is<00:04:44.920> pretty<00:04:45.340> terrible

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
hunt the week while is pretty terrible

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.430 
hunt the week while is pretty terrible
in<00:04:46.240> general<00:04:47.200> um<00:04:47.470> if<00:04:48.460> you're<00:04:48.790> playing<00:04:49.000> green

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
in general um if you're playing green

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.270 
in general um if you're playing green
and<00:04:50.460> you<00:04:51.460> know<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:52.690> need<00:04:52.870> removal<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.680> this

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
and you know you need removal and this

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.830 
and you know you need removal and this
is<00:04:54.430> as<00:04:54.520> good<00:04:54.670> as<00:04:54.820> it<00:04:54.850> gets<00:04:55.030> for<00:04:55.180> green<00:04:55.480> as<00:04:55.660> far

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
is as good as it gets for green as far

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.070 
is as good as it gets for green as far
as<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.020> can<00:04:56.080> think<00:04:56.850> a<00:04:57.850> cursed<00:04:58.270> spirit<00:04:58.510> is<00:04:58.690> great

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
as I can think a cursed spirit is great

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.880 
as I can think a cursed spirit is great
so<00:05:00.070> my<00:05:00.280> top<00:05:00.790> two<00:05:00.970> picks<00:05:01.150> would<00:05:01.540> really<00:05:01.900> be<00:05:02.080> hunt

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
so my top two picks would really be hunt

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.830 
so my top two picks would really be hunt
the<00:05:03.040> weak<00:05:03.190> light<00:05:03.550> caster<00:05:04.000> or<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.210> cursed<00:05:04.510> spirit

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
the weak light caster or a cursed spirit

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.250 
the weak light caster or a cursed spirit
if<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.740> were<00:05:05.890> any<00:05:06.100> other<00:05:06.190> draft<00:05:06.730> I<00:05:07.120> mean<00:05:07.390> the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
if this were any other draft I mean the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.810 
if this were any other draft I mean the
folly<00:05:08.440> of<00:05:08.560> seek<00:05:08.830> aight<00:05:09.010> i<00:05:09.040> think<00:05:09.340> is<00:05:09.460> really

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
folly of seek aight i think is really

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.230 
folly of seek aight i think is really
good<00:05:10.030> being<00:05:10.570> flash<00:05:10.930> and<00:05:11.890> evasion<00:05:14.910> orem<00:05:15.910> answer

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
good being flash and evasion orem answer

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.490 
good being flash and evasion orem answer
is<00:05:16.330> pretty<00:05:16.510> good<00:05:16.780> if<00:05:16.990> you're<00:05:17.140> playing<00:05:17.350> with

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
is pretty good if you're playing with

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.770 
is pretty good if you're playing with
enchantments<00:05:18.190> I<00:05:18.400> mean<00:05:19.180> if<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.390> were<00:05:19.540> red

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
enchantments I mean if I were red

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.420 
enchantments I mean if I were red
obviously<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.560> pic<00:05:20.740> would<00:05:20.890> be<00:05:20.980> easy<00:05:21.190> but

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
obviously the pic would be easy but

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.770 
obviously the pic would be easy but
sometimes<00:05:21.640> that's<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.090> way<00:05:22.210> it<00:05:22.300> goes<00:05:22.360> right

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
sometimes that's the way it goes right

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.240 
sometimes that's the way it goes right
like<00:05:23.080> you've<00:05:23.260> committed<00:05:23.620> to<00:05:23.800> your<00:05:23.890> colors

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
like you've committed to your colors

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.250 
like you've committed to your colors
pretty<00:05:24.850> much<00:05:25.030> by<00:05:25.210> pac-3<00:05:25.660> you're<00:05:25.900> looking<00:05:26.140> just

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
pretty much by pac-3 you're looking just

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.800 
pretty much by pac-3 you're looking just
to<00:05:26.350> fill<00:05:26.590> it<00:05:26.740> in<00:05:26.920> it<00:05:27.910> seems<00:05:28.090> like<00:05:28.210> when<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.390> draft

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
to fill it in it seems like when I draft

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.930 
to fill it in it seems like when I draft
when<00:05:29.230> you<00:05:29.350> get<00:05:29.620> that<00:05:29.800> third<00:05:30.130> rare<00:05:30.430> that<00:05:30.670> fits

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
when you get that third rare that fits

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.400 
when you get that third rare that fits
your<00:05:31.060> deck<00:05:31.300> that<00:05:31.570> obviously<00:05:31.960> those<00:05:32.200> are<00:05:32.230> the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
your deck that obviously those are the

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.800 
your deck that obviously those are the
ones<00:05:32.530> that<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:33.310> gamble<00:05:33.730> right<00:05:33.940> like<00:05:34.360> it<00:05:34.600> could

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
ones that you gamble right like it could

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.760 
ones that you gamble right like it could
have<00:05:34.900> been<00:05:34.960> green<00:05:35.170> it<00:05:35.290> could<00:05:35.380> have<00:05:35.470> been<00:05:35.530> black

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
have been green it could have been black

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.560 
have been green it could have been black
uh<00:05:36.870> could<00:05:37.870> have<00:05:37.930> been<00:05:38.080> a<00:05:38.110> Garrick<00:05:39.480> but<00:05:40.480> it

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
uh could have been a Garrick but it

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.180 
uh could have been a Garrick but it
wasn't<00:05:40.720> so<00:05:41.200> i<00:05:41.670> think<00:05:42.670> i<00:05:42.940> take<00:05:43.180> i<00:05:43.920> think<00:05:44.920> i<00:05:45.010> take

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
wasn't so i think i take i think i take

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.910 
wasn't so i think i take i think i take
hunt<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.520> week<00:05:45.700> and<00:05:45.970> I<00:05:46.630> see<00:05:47.170> this<00:05:47.320> wheel<00:05:47.590> all<00:05:47.800> the

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
time certainly I think blight casters

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.460 
time certainly I think blight casters
probably<00:05:51.360> maybe<00:05:52.360> a<00:05:52.480> better<00:05:52.660> card<00:05:52.990> but<00:05:53.200> I'm<00:05:53.320> not

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
probably maybe a better card but I'm not

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.410 
probably maybe a better card but I'm not
