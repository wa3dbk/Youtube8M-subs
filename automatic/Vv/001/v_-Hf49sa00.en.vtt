00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
hi everyone I'd like to do a review on

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.589 
hi everyone I'd like to do a review on
the<00:00:07.649> Torah<00:00:07.980> Knox<00:00:08.250> ambassador<00:00:10.130> which<00:00:11.389> by<00:00:12.389> me<00:00:12.570> I

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the Torah Knox ambassador which by me I

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.200 
the Torah Knox ambassador which by me I
think<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.200> basically<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.519> Victorinox

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
think it's basically the Victorinox

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.250 
think it's basically the Victorinox
class<00:00:15.920> but<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:18.289> a<00:00:19.289> much<00:00:19.770> larger<00:00:20.039> size<00:00:21.260> see

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
class but it's in a much larger size see

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.650 
class but it's in a much larger size see
here's<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.560> Swiss<00:00:22.890> champ<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.910> comparison<00:00:24.510> it's

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
here's a Swiss champ for comparison it's

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.470 
here's a Swiss champ for comparison it's
almost<00:00:24.990> as<00:00:25.320> big<00:00:25.590> as<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.859> Swiss<00:00:26.099> champ<00:00:26.480> whereas

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
almost as big as the Swiss champ whereas

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.870 
almost as big as the Swiss champ whereas
the<00:00:27.660> classic<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.800> year<00:00:29.250> your<00:00:29.429> classic

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
kind of looks like a knife blade I'm not

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.620 
kind of looks like a knife blade I'm not
really<00:01:22.159> sure<00:01:23.159> exactly<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.270> that's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
really sure exactly what that for that's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.950 
really sure exactly what that for that's
for<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:26.509> anyway<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:28.470> there<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.960> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
for but anyway and then there is the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.190 
for but anyway and then there is the
scissors<00:01:31.619> which<00:01:32.369> open<00:01:33.180> up<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> back<00:01:33.780> here

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
scissors which open up on the back here

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.580 
scissors which open up on the back here
and<00:01:34.380> are<00:01:35.250> smaller<00:01:35.610> than<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.090> Swiss<00:01:36.869> champ<00:01:37.229> for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and are smaller than the Swiss champ for

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.550 
and are smaller than the Swiss champ for
again<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.520> comparison<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.810> still<00:01:40.110> larger

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
again for a comparison but still larger

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.760 
again for a comparison but still larger
than<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> classic<00:01:41.990> which<00:01:42.990> cut<00:01:43.320> very<00:01:43.530> well

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
than the classic which cut very well

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.219 
than the classic which cut very well
hold<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.280> good<00:01:44.430> edge<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.950> like<00:01:46.950> almost<00:01:47.280> every

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
hold a good edge and like almost every

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.969 
hold a good edge and like almost every
Victorinox<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.549> toothpick

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
Victorinox you have the toothpick

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.450 
Victorinox you have the toothpick
and<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:54.210> tweezer<00:01:54.600> which<00:01:55.289> every<00:01:55.920> tweezer<00:01:56.219> on

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and the tweezer which every tweezer on

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.399 
and the tweezer which every tweezer on
the<00:01:56.640> Victorinox<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:57.570> very<00:01:57.899> good<00:01:58.200> edge

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the Victorinox have is a very good edge

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.859 
the Victorinox have is a very good edge
and<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.549> good<00:01:59.759> for<00:02:00.060> getting<00:02:00.570> rid<00:02:00.750> of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
and it's good for getting rid of

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.100 
and it's good for getting rid of
splinters<00:02:01.409> or<00:02:01.679> slivers<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.960> get<00:02:03.960> on

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
splinters or slivers that you get on

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.669 
splinters or slivers that you get on
your<00:02:04.259> hands<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:07.530> about

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
your hands but and I think that's about

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.169 
your hands but and I think that's about
it

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
it

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.309 
it
it's<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.330> great<00:02:09.619> multipurpose<00:02:10.619> everyday<00:02:12.319> knife

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
it's a great multipurpose everyday knife

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.370 
it's a great multipurpose everyday knife
or<00:02:13.709> whatever<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.190> need
