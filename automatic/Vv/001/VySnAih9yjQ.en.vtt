00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.809

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.809
 say differently I do exactly in the cooking pot 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:01:01.440

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.160

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.460
 the stove plate 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:59.290
 ok so davids meal we freeze at so 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.290
 This is very important for a large crowd 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:28.190
 otherwise it burns and throughout 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:33.260
 shows that here aprica beef it 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:37.040
 forms strange structures must 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.340
 you do not pay attention that it breaks out 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.340
 so 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.890
 you just should not warm it up 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:53.530
 really cooking it is yes 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:58.330
 actually already finished with such a 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.800
 Large amount is also takes to warm up 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:07.390
 bit by licking the spoon 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:10.630

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.350
 still needs a bit so now 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.850
 it should be done slowly 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:23.980
 down with the foot in the game already 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:27.420

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.420

 degree of professionalization always higher 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.190
 even a trowel around the well to do 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:52.489
