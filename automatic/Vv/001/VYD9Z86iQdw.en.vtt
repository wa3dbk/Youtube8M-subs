00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.350
 how about everyone good this time 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.869
 I bring a video class that there was not 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.570
 never done in this case it's about 30 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:14.329
 curiosities of tete and why of tekken 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.790
 a game of fights that curiosities 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.890
 It can be good, you could say 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.750
 that the game itself does not only have 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.760
 a broad plot for each character 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.890
 but also the game has suffered 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.289
 many changes since the 20 years that 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.300
 leads in the market is very likely that 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.400
 there are characters who do not comment 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.620
 no curiosity as there may be 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.899
 others who comment more than one since 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.239
 good the curiosities are more focused 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.510
 to the characters of the game and not to the game 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.359
 in itself but more than talking let's start one 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.960
 the full name of jean should be 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:50.690
 james imagine jin kazama two links already 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.229
 oim still being Chinese feels Japanese 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.239
 3 lille and roquefort fuck has a name 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.359
 that that's the most human character 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.699
 young of the game with 16 years old the 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.120
 youngest character of all is roger 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.220
 junior 4 contrary to what they believe 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.470
 many people yoshimitsu is human 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.290
 the hand he has is a bionic hand 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.510
 implanted by doctor boscovich and his 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.520
 invisibility is due to ninja techniques 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.220
 and the armor that has been made too 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.440
 by doctor boscono beach 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.180
 the only characters that appear in 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.190
 all tekken deliveries are 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.840
 yoshimitsu paul mina anna and so six 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.520
 many of the characters are based 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.280
 in famous martial artists 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.170
 with those who have much similarity 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.750
 in the physical as in the fighting style 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.970
 as for example book is based on 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.010
 Check chan Yoshimitsu is based on 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.560
 predator air and is based on Caesar 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.900
 carneiro raven in wesley snipes in the of 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.330

 sanitizing jong-hun capulla in masaya kato 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.880
 and so many more seven never never left 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.490
 to be present from tekken 3 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.130
 being replaced by kasama sugar in 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.380
 tekken 5 being quite similar its 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.310
 fighting style and its appearance and a 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.709
 return to tekken tag tournament 28 a 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.010
 face has been the only character in all 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.080
 the saga that has not had final 9 one of 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.180
 the hidden characters of tekken 3 is 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.129
 a comic book character humor 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.299
 Japanese 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.980
 officially only two have died 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.900
 characters in the Tekken saga that 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.030
 they would correspond to the first king jr 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.750
 more Kim Hyun has been confirmed not to 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.450
 has died 11 kunimitsu originally was 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.569
 man in fact in tekken one was man 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.640
 12 of jacques and that touch 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.159
 fundamentals is even younger than in 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.730
 tekken 1 and 2 this is because your 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.560
 Bender died 13 11 from Tekken Tag 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.170
 tournament is said to be the sister 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.299
 deceased of jean and daughter of iun without 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.370
 However, this has not been confirmed by 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.040
 so much so that one a tekken 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.650
 tact fundamentals is one possessed by the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.340
 diabolical gene I leave it there and wash myself 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.980
 hands in the case x of 14 is said 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.290
 to cover its sphere this is due to the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.150
 wounds that he has in his eyes besides 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.280
 that through some glitches we can 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.840
 Take off his mask and see him fight with 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.030
 the closed eyes 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.639
 white has not said anything about it 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.230
 what at the moment is a rumor I also 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:26.459
 I believe it 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.650
 x of 15 jin kazama stopped practicing 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.200
 karate style mishima from tekel 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.450
 4 due to hatred towards everything related 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.030
 with mishima thereafter 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.610
 practice kyokushinkai style karate with 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.110
 some aikido techniques learned from 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.830
 iun kasama 16 large is not Japanese is 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.870
 Irish 17 fighting style more 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.129
 practiced by the characters is the 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.290
 karate do 18 in theory and there is the 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.349
 only member of the mishima family that 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.629
 does not possess the diabolic gene however the 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.060
 power that unleashes jinpa feels that the 5 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.660
 it's not the diabolical gene but the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.769
 devil owning his body 19 and a 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.049
 kazama is about 55 years old 20 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.930
 Leo originally did not have a sex 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:19.799
 assigned later it was confirmed that it was 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.070
 woman 21 the tekken movie taken out on 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.990
 2010 still being hard enough it was 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.180
 so bad that even the plows and 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.750
 creator of tekken said it was a 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.050
 trash 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.220
 22 yoshimitsu and weak have been the 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.650
 characters that have evolved the most 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.490
 from its first appearance until the 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.590
 moment 23 alisa boscono beach is the 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.990
 third character along with mitsui 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.890
 yoshimitsu who uses weapons in combat the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.110
 others use the cuffs 24 as they 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.560
 the saga advances and the hole becomes more 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.200
 it would be in the combats and in his character 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.240
 25 the name of jean or comes from 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.500
 name of your mother or 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:05.390
 beijing part of his great-grandfather 26 almost already 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.010
 does not have a demon symbol like jim 27 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.290
 111 was designed as the little sister 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.690
 of funcas loves but during development 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:16.470
 from tekken tag tournament this idea was 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.640
 discarded 28 katsuya has never tried 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.110
 kill jean directly 29 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.030
 theoretically the touch issues a 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.310
 t mind who do not follow the thread 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.370
 main plot but they are stories 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.010
 independent however the finals 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.470
 of steve leo and safina can give clues 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.770
 about the tekken 7 plot that is still 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.080
 It is to reach 30 yoshimitsu and there 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.420
 are present in the blue saga calibur 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.640
 another video game of white the yacht and 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.040
 as a guest character in his caliber 2 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.870
 and I do mitsu as a character and present 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.760
 in all the deliveries of xul calibur 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.280
 parallel to yoshimitsu of tekken 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.410
 sharing however the same style 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.480
 of struggle and the bionic hand among others 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.000
 things as if from an ancestor you 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.360
 I tried to add a last curiosity 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.940
 extra in addition to the tekken movie of 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.280
 2010 there is another tekken movie 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.620
 called tekken blood vengeance or tekken 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.080
 blood revenge that unlike 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.030
 the other one is quite more accomplished 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.010
 with the same graphic engine that is used 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.070
 to do the cinematic since the 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.140
 5 so far and well I recommend it more 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.970
 that nothing to the fans of the series 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.710
 although it does not hurt to say that 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.140
 anyone can see it but not 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.510
 would be able to link the script very well if 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.490
 you do not follow the plot of the game and good 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.919
 up to here all the curiosities of 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.380
 tekken well if you like it 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.550
 communicate it to me and maybe do more part 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.020
 about this 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.860
 until another time my faithful 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.860
 spectators
