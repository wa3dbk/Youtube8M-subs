now but that's just still rough um this
right<00:02:37.750> here<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.070> spring-loaded

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
and there is a simple locking mechanism

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.440 
and there is a simple locking mechanism
right<00:02:47.769> there<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.870> tab<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:51.239> get<00:02:52.239> that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
right there the tab and then get that

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.370 
right there the tab and then get that
right<00:02:52.660> there<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.110> then<00:02:53.170> see<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:55.200> there<00:02:56.200> goes

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
right there and then see that there goes

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.070 
right there and then see that there goes
the<00:02:56.530> stack<00:02:57.330> yeah<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.600> goes<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.930> stack<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.790> I

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
the stack yeah it goes the stack so I

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.449 
the stack yeah it goes the stack so I
will<00:03:02.080> probably<00:03:02.410> make<00:03:02.560> an<00:03:02.860> update<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.220> this

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
will probably make an update on this

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.120 
will probably make an update on this
video<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.360> can<00:03:04.690> show<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.709> stock<00:03:05.950> that

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
video so I can show you the stock that

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.650 
video so I can show you the stock that
isn't<00:03:06.430> broken<00:03:07.560> alone<00:03:08.560> over<00:03:09.340> there<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:10.239> I'm

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
isn't broken alone over there and I'm

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.750 
isn't broken alone over there and I'm
making<00:03:11.049> a<00:03:11.170> dual<00:03:11.410> video<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.070> this<00:03:12.400> video<00:03:12.579> is

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
making a dual video so this video is

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.479 
making a dual video so this video is
gonna<00:03:12.940> show<00:03:13.060> two<00:03:13.420> guns<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:15.790> one<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.269> a<00:03:16.299> scar-h

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
gonna show two guns this one is a scar-h

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.830 
gonna show two guns this one is a scar-h
here<00:03:18.489> I'm<00:03:18.730> going<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:18.970> go<00:03:19.120> into<00:03:19.360> more<00:03:19.510> detail

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
here I'm going to go into more detail

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.300 
here I'm going to go into more detail
about<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.049> there's<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.500> flip<00:03:20.769> up<00:03:20.920> sights<00:03:21.100> like

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
about it there's a flip up sights like

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.440 
about it there's a flip up sights like
that<00:03:21.630> that's<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:22.810> right<00:03:23.290> here<00:03:23.590> flips<00:03:23.890> up<00:03:24.450> and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
that that's a right here flips up and

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.229 
that that's a right here flips up and
then<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.690> got<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.959> red<00:03:26.200> dot<00:03:26.410> sight<00:03:26.680> right<00:03:26.890> there

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.810 

yeah<00:03:31.239> right<00:03:31.269> there<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:33.310> then<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.519> got<00:03:33.730> the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
yeah right there and then I got the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.150 
yeah right there and then I got the
folding<00:03:34.209> stock<00:03:34.480> right<00:03:34.690> here<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.560> then<00:03:37.410> got<00:03:38.410> it

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
folding stock right here and then got it

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.830 
folding stock right here and then got it
as<00:03:39.940> spring-loaded<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.980> mass<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.250> way<00:03:42.400> I

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
as spring-loaded to mass that way I

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.780 
as spring-loaded to mass that way I
could<00:03:43.840> push<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.170> in<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:44.770> out<00:03:45.070> there<00:03:45.460> we<00:03:45.580> go

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
could push it in and out there we go

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.680 
could push it in and out there we go
then<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.980> is<00:03:48.160> adjustable<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.940> didn't<00:03:49.420> get<00:03:49.540> any

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
then this is adjustable I didn't get any

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.570 
then this is adjustable I didn't get any
kind<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:50.050> locking<00:03:50.440> system<00:03:50.830> for<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.070> stock<00:03:51.310> yet

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
kind of locking system for the stock yet

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.230 
kind of locking system for the stock yet
and<00:03:52.330> then<00:03:53.190> part<00:03:54.190> on<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.550> I<00:03:54.670> just<00:03:54.880> spring<00:03:55.120> in

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
and then part on this I just spring in

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.030 
and then part on this I just spring in
there<00:03:55.360> from<00:03:55.510> last<00:03:55.750> time<00:03:55.990> edge<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.800> video

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
there from last time edge of the video

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.520 
there from last time edge of the video
so<00:03:57.940> this<00:03:58.150> part<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.660> can<00:03:58.720> push<00:03:58.990> down<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.410> comes

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
so this part you can push down it comes

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.280 
so this part you can push down it comes
back<00:03:59.740> up<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:01.390> I'll<00:04:01.570> show<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:01.810> it's<00:04:02.020> actually

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
back up and I'll show you it's actually

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:10.620 
back up and I'll show you it's actually
really<00:04:02.410> simple<00:04:08.850> hold<00:04:09.850> in<00:04:10.120> there<00:04:10.300> and<00:04:10.420> stuff

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
really simple hold in there and stuff

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.260 
really simple hold in there and stuff
and<00:04:10.900> then<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:12.220> have<00:04:12.460> to<00:04:12.670> press<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.000> button<00:04:13.240> to

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
and then you have to press the button to

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.580 
and then you have to press the button to
get<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.600> out<00:04:15.780> same<00:04:16.780> at<00:04:16.930> this<00:04:17.020> one<00:04:17.260> I'll<00:04:17.440> make<00:04:17.560> a

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
get it out same at this one I'll make a

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.180 
get it out same at this one I'll make a
tutorial<00:04:17.770> if<00:04:18.400> you<00:04:18.489> want<00:04:18.580> on<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.239> scar-h<00:04:20.190> or
