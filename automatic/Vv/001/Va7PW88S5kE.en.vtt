the cover off the furnace and try to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.639 
the cover off the furnace and try to
look<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> place<00:02:01.049> where<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.320> thermostat

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
look for the place where the thermostat

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.330 
look for the place where the thermostat
wire<00:02:02.040> comes<00:02:02.909> into<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.540> compartment<00:02:04.340> you're

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
wire comes into the compartment you're

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.859 
wire comes into the compartment you're
going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.549> find<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:06.000> little<00:02:06.180> terminal<00:02:06.659> strip

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
going to find a little terminal strip

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.330 
going to find a little terminal strip
that<00:02:07.020> looks<00:02:07.170> kind<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that looks kind of like this in the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.130 
that looks kind of like this in the
picture<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> same

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
picture it's going to have the same

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.869 
picture it's going to have the same
labels<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.580> thermostat

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
labels that you have on the thermostat

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.070 
labels that you have on the thermostat
you've<00:02:12.270> got<00:02:12.390> G

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
you've got G

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.120 
you've got G
why<00:02:14.030> our<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.780> then<00:02:16.020> this<00:02:16.140> blue<00:02:16.350> wire<00:02:16.560> here<00:02:16.860> you

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
why our and then this blue wire here you

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.250 
why our and then this blue wire here you
see<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.000> 24<00:02:18.540> volt<00:02:18.780> common<00:02:19.140> that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
see that is the 24 volt common that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.490 
see that is the 24 volt common that
we're<00:02:19.380> looking<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:20.990> as<00:02:21.990> luck<00:02:22.200> would<00:02:22.230> have<00:02:22.380> it

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
we're looking for as luck would have it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.020 
we're looking for as luck would have it
that's<00:02:22.770> also<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.250> other<00:02:23.400> end<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.790> blue

that's also the other end of that blue

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.580 
that's also the other end of that blue
wire<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.390> found<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.810> bundle<00:02:25.140> down<00:02:25.320> at<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
another furnace same terminals if you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.770 
another furnace same terminals if you
were<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.530> test<00:02:31.800> between<00:02:32.220> our<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.420> common

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
were to test between our and the common

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.870 
were to test between our and the common
you<00:02:34.470> would<00:02:34.590> see<00:02:34.770> 24<00:02:35.250> volts<00:02:35.520> coming<00:02:35.610> from<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
you would see 24 volts coming from the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.180 
you would see 24 volts coming from the
transformer<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.170> let's<00:02:37.350> connect<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.710> new<00:02:37.830> fancy
