00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.599
 as was usually the case in traditions 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.380
 farmers on Sundays in lunches 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.139
 Easter 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.400
 during the holidays but above all 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.940
 in the great festivals of peasant austin 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.890
 it was custom and custom made 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.220
 of these parties the main elements the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.550
 bully because as we all know it was 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.110
 a main element courtyard meat 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.170
 present in peasant families the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.780
 which was the hen was as an element 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.489
 of products as a place from grapes 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.530
 they produced dense there is everything else 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.809
 what can be done by these lovers 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.120
 that remains on our tables 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.390
 today we will teach you how to make a fake 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 turn then we take the chicken that already 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.730
 cooked that remained the day before on 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.159
 ours on our tables and it 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.920
 soak in water in boiling water 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.339
 boiling for about 20 minutes 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.809
 let's increase this with peppercorns 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.760
 rosemary laurel after done 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.380
 I stress for twenty minutes in 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.630
 that well cooked meat 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.229
 we all have pink parts, but let's go 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.720
 to raise we raise the chicken from the water and 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.120
 we will clean it ideas we clean the chicken 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.540
 from the bone and obtaining its own 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.320
 flaps of meat we remove it from the bone 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.500
 a whole piece cooked in this case e 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.710
 chicken but can be done either as a rabbit 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.320
 then once the chicken is well removed 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.720
 here the good lies on the plate you go 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.200
 always dry the part of the water that 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.060
 we find ourselves in this match because 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.910
 water is the element in which it could 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.650
 make sure they keep it could not 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.590
 go to happy ending 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.820
 let it dry well I go to 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.710
 dry very well 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.920
 a blotting paper we pull off pressing 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.860
 well the parts dividing very well i 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.750
 large pieces smaller occasions the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.270
 leather should be removed what is the element 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.270
 of the skin we take our jar 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.470
 We put all the chicken inside 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.240
 in this case we have found in 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.840
 he dispenses olives from oregano 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.010
 of the pepper binds the parsley but in 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.530
 in this case we use the changes of 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.050
 parsley fate of the carrot of the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.970
 them and then let's analyze with 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.560
 these small few elements of the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.840
 our pantry so let's go to 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:45.019
 put it in the olives we will put the oregano 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:53.150
 the pepper the bay leaf the lake 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:55.590
 celery and carrots we put everything inside 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.810
 if you have the first beans very well 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.540
 come if you have a mix, so be it 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.430
 Really well so definitely make less 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.950
 strong point of what you have 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.890
 around you because what you have 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.590
 around you is the secret of a great one 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:15.950
 we succeed in soaking the oil 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.540
 in until the product is filled 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.280
 an important thing in these 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.110
 preserves that we must always filled 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.730
 up to the scream with the oil because it is produced 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.310
 must always stay on the heel so 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.879
 that you can't have problems proves 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.569
 once the invitation to treat well 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.459
 produced stabilized small town capital 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.360
 upside down put in a pot a 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.880
 simmer for 55 minutes in this case 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.860
 the bully because a well-cooked meat 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.720
 that we have already removed all the impurities 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.049
 during boiling 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.970
 let's get up from the waters just reached 55 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.400
 minutes the important thing is the temperature 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.940
 must always remain constant never having 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.440
 jump in temperature 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.110
 we raise we put on the work plan with 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.829
 a cloth we cover ours ours 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.769
 We put jars in the pantry without a fridge 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.230
 in this case the UN could coagulate 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.709
 but in a pantry well out of the 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.579
 light range is a shelf life 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.520
 even this 12 months consumed this 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.590
 pool or other rabbit welcome that 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.470
 that you can also make turkey 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.889
 with croutons in the summer in the entrances 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.630
 your summer but also doing the 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.630
 cold pasta in the summer
