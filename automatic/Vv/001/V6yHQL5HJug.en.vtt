00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:32.110
 We are going to occupy two thirds of flour 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.510

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:41.170

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.160

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.250
 I have my skewers my little sticks for 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.400
 put them and the only thing to do 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.920
 this is an easy recipe let's mix 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.000
 all these ingredients that I finish 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.800
 to name all 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.250
 and here I put a little bit of flour because 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.870
 I am going to and what I want is that they are well 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.590
 dry then I'll go 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:37.430
 sprinkle or I'll put them in flour 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.520
 our sausages and already after that 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.890
 be sprinkled and very wallowed 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.450
 in that we're going to put it in our 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.000
 mix that we're going to have and we're going to 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.479
 put a little bit of good rather well 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.560
 oil in a pot or in a saucepan 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.820
 pan to fry our 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.050
 banderillas or in this case mini 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.660
 banderillas 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.580
 in English the coordinates of knowing by 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.979
 waves then the fire we will have 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.500
 medium that our sausages is cooked 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.910
 well inside and outside we have a 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.310
 golden brown then the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.310
 preparation of mini banderillas 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.790

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.440

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.860
 Y 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.110
 This is the result of how I stayed 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.830
 the mini banderillas that this time 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.050
 accompany them with ketchup and mustard and 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.690
 as they saw then nothing complicated about 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.850
 do and also tell them that if I stay 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.700
 more mix only that I right now says

 there were six of this size but I can 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.730
 to do is to make traditional ones
