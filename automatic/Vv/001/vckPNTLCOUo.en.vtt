 all new nail art tutorial 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.329
 this time a somewhat special denied 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.730
 because it matches a make up that has 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.870
 created another youtube 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.820
 her name is simona nappi hello honey 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.100
 very good she and produce parties then 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.100
 so nice view i find it very in 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.530
 leg and she made a make up on 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.200
 tones of gold and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.430
 blue green and me these colors here 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.290
 together also the trick he has 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.980
 realized that I'll show you right away is 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.550
 this one talk about how nice and know a 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.590
 some of carabi giant and no e 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.180
 then I wanted to make this nail 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.750
 art is a little more particular a little more 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.580
 Arabic and indeed reused le 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.160
 gold flakes that she is used here 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.040
 at the beginning is the color here of the halo 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.500
 anyway I found a nail polish 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.990
 identical to this eye shadow and it would be 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.360
 this one is of the same identical 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.070
 color and therefore here we say that they are 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.979
 satisfied with the result also because 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.509
 It is very rich, however, still is and 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.479
 takes only a little bit of 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.800
 Jungian and therefore not heavy 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.880
 anyway I hope so much that I like it 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.700
 both nail art and this one 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.350
 collaboration with sigona and nothing there 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:48.160
 I leave the tutorial nino have a big kiss 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:50.770
 a big kiss at the top hello 8 itself 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.179
 my bases of woods and bases why 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.970
 same before the whitening also the 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.830
 yellow and above are to put that of 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.869
 smoothing cult in the pink version for 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.690
 make the complexion a little longer 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.110
 uniform then sarkyte number 1 I take the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.200
 pan the enamel scientists of 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:15.400
 joy brush party number 2 tip 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:17.349
 to 10,000 10 bar 0 between a drop thing 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.099
 I'll do one of the dots 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.010
 drive so at least I try to do everyone 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.560
 the same arches trace the first one 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.870
 headband joining two points and then in base 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.520
 to this to trace other dots for 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.170
 adjust me with the height so that 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.890
 besides coming of sixty 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.150
 they will also come of the same height 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.150
 little trick though it helps 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.080
 I repeat this passage on all the 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.490
 nails after what i can do 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.860
 make fun with the brush 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.420
 smaller but if you pay attention 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.150
 I could do it directly with the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.090
 brush of the enamel I'm going to fill 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.670
 the nail bezel I give a first 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.320
 passed and then I go to revise then 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.960
 two passes 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.990
 and at this point what I do I repeat about 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:10.100
 all the vines and I take the kit left 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:14.290
 in number one of pupa daughter e 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:17.870
 fixer from the number one nail art kit 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:22.240
 with the fixer I go to apply a little 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.340
 of enamel that will make a bit of glue 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.100
 at the apex of the tip of those arches 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.620
 that we have realized before and with the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:37.880
 doctor I am going to make adhere to a le 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:40.310
 sequins seen that on the bezel I have 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.160
 spread two coats of enamel per 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.660
 speed up the drying time I go 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.300
 to apply even a drop of 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.240
 pasta and past drives every time 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.790
 however I take the nail polish 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.160
 gilded with a thin tip brush 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.010
 which we used before and go to 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.850
 draw from here along the outline of the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.850
 my bows 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.420
 after which it is time to mark some 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.430
 spirals marked a larger central 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.690
 and then the ones that I get in the TV a 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.860
 mind this will depend a lot on 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.860
 length of your nails 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.540
 at this point I let a couple of pass 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.580
 minutes 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.230
 and speaking apply my fixer 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.780
 reuse with the only one used before 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.880
 from the kit and pupa number two though 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.800
 I also prefer two passes 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.150
 however with this it is everything I hope 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.920
 you both enjoyed it but not voice 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.120
 maximum or a kiss to all of you and us 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.120
 we are made a video bye
