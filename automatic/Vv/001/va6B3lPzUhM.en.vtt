00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
you just do a one step and then your

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.120 
you just do a one step and then your
your<00:02:26.550> backers<00:02:27.090> are<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.300> position<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:28.920> can

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
your backers are in position so you can

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.370 
your backers are in position so you can
use<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.459> as<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.580> do-over<00:02:30.290> whatever<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.410> want<00:02:31.620> um

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
for continued it no one really does this

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.670 
for continued it no one really does this
anymore<00:02:36.209> but<00:02:36.390> everyone<00:02:37.319> has<00:02:37.440> their<00:02:37.560> own<00:02:37.620> style

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
anymore but everyone has their own style

anymore but everyone has their own style
so<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.430> want<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:39.380> for<00:02:40.380> continuous

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
so you can if you want to for continuous

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.830 
so you can if you want to for continuous
um<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:42.330> steps<00:02:44.930> that's<00:02:46.910> harder<00:02:47.910> but<00:02:48.570> it's<00:02:48.690> not

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
um what steps that's harder but it's not

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.820 
um what steps that's harder but it's not
too<00:02:49.019> difficult<00:02:49.110> um<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.940> sweeps<00:02:51.269> under

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
too difficult um this sweeps under

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.410 
too difficult um this sweeps under
what's<00:02:52.830> your<00:02:53.010> here<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:54.060> only<00:02:54.209> thing

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
what's your here the only thing

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.520 
what's your here the only thing
different<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:54.930> you're<00:02:55.170> going<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.350> want

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
different is that you're going to want

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.290 
different is that you're going to want
to<00:02:55.650> learn<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.569> UM<00:02:58.370> have<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.550> go<00:02:59.819> under<00:03:00.150> your

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
to learn to UM have it go under your

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.920 
to learn to UM have it go under your
arms<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.360> moment<00:03:03.569> of

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
arms so you have that moment of

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.650 
arms so you have that moment of
vulnerability<00:03:05.090> when<00:03:06.090> there's<00:03:06.330> nothing

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
vulnerability when there's nothing

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.240 
vulnerability when there's nothing
supporting<00:03:06.840> your<00:03:07.260> body<00:03:07.440> because<00:03:07.950> your<00:03:08.100> hands

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
supporting your body because your hands

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.430 
supporting your body because your hands
are<00:03:08.340> up<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.610> air<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.720> you're<00:03:09.870> here<00:03:10.230> and

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
are up in the air so you're here and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.630 
are up in the air so you're here and
then<00:03:10.880> boom<00:03:12.019> boom<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:14.040> only<00:03:14.190> thing<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.430> part<00:03:14.610> of

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
then boom boom the only thing so part of

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.710 
then boom boom the only thing so part of
your<00:03:14.790> body<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.090> your<00:03:15.120> left<00:03:15.420> leg<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:17.720> sweeps

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
your body is your left leg so sweeps

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.850 
your body is your left leg so sweeps
under<00:03:19.110> boom<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.910> comes<00:03:21.180> back<00:03:21.420> around<00:03:21.860> this

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
under boom this comes back around this

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.069 
under boom this comes back around this
goes<00:03:23.100> up<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.340> air<00:03:23.570> this<00:03:24.570> goes<00:03:24.780> up<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.049> the

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
goes up in the air this goes up in the

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.949 
goes up in the air this goes up in the
air<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.530> you're<00:03:26.370> back<00:03:26.549> here<00:03:29.390> okay<00:03:30.390> there<00:03:30.900> you

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
air and you're back here okay there you
