 warming the market to make a good 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.869
 business and forget the bitter 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.539
 experience you had with max cap

 at the time I paid 23 thousand reais was 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.490
 sell her now the question of a year 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.160
 sold by 17 means was thus to the values 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.989
 the very large devaluation and was the

 our friend there to buy a used car in 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.309
 good state but paid the equivalent of one 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.329
 at the time of resale, 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.390
 loss 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.510
 seems silly but disseminated to used 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.789
 There's a lot of difference left 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.469
 the car zero already starts to 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.309
 it's called seminovo 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.930
 from the fourth year on I had used 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.540
 with 13 years or more 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.159
 the car considered an old man the point 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.590
 starting point for trading is 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.350
 differentiate one from the other with four 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.990
 Basic criteria recalled the age range 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.930
 age Second state 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.320
 We found a place we can consider the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.409
 Fourth place footage we can consider 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.250
 the origin of this chaos he has a gift a 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.490
 state of conservation was it did not fall 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.890

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.810
 With this internal quality is 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.119
 difficult to marry then asking around 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.229
 16 thousand trying to negotiate to reach us 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.100

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.700
 General points out a growth of 3 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.770
 percentage of the month following the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.759
 good times of sales from scratch 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.409

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.140
 use in another state at the time of purchase 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.540
 you win and also at resale time 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.120
 you also get because you already suffered 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.040
 to undergo devaluation used or 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.470
