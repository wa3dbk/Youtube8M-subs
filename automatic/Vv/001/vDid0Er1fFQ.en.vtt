00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.620
 boston to fifa the new edition of virgílio 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.660
 and the virgil will introduce the people 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.200
 get it here is a prize that is 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.570
 hot has no problem to work flame 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.180
 It's a wonder, we'll do it. 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.630
 local little beetle type of sensor 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.900
 intervention 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.390
 This has already left me in the hand already in the marginal 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.640
 I'll tell you who to fire on the call. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.199
 anger of the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.869
 Some fiat have an ignition system 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.489
 that is not magneti marelli's bouche and he is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.579
 different does not have that box of 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.980
 bosch is common that we usually see in the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.050
 most cars of the 80's and 90's 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.890
 he has a different box and he already 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.079
 if that other box in what is a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.000
 man gets the pain of the man 's pit 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.460
 distributor arrested here on his own 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 this box normally 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.770
 greatest source of problems that exist 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.680
 So what are we going to do here as 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.809
 it is also difficult and expensive to locate this 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.500
 little box came to look for is not me 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.780
 I found a parallel I could see né magneti 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.340
 marelli and made no chance 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.080
 So what are we going to do here as 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.119
 I already made an adaptation of this people 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.500
 It was successful in that it was the fiorino 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.360
 my neighbor the one I made a video 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.720
 of the verb 495 I'm going to set up a circuit 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.369
 special for the pro virgilio car 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.430
 so you will disable all 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.890
 magneti marelli ignition system and the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.299
 People are going to play only the sensor. 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.770
 distributor and the original 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.150
 I already removed the dispenser cap then 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.549
 here we see the 1 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.220
 a sensor that actually functions as the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.049
 trainer it generates along the axis of the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.240
 distributor, it generates a scene of 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.670
 which is probably handled by this 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.770
 box that arrives in a module that is 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.560
 hidden there in the car 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.380
 in another way because we are going to 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 Disable this box to get the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.890
 two terminals here that one of them is the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.229
 and we'll call the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.549
 module I build the lookout car 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.910
 so now I'm going to loosen two screws 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.800
 I'm going to rip this box out later 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.569
 to take the box that was on the side in the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.340
 distributor 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.549
 We put the module here by 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.099
 while provisionally black river land 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.349
 may be negative battery can be 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.290
 any part of your carcass 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:30.719
 car is cool 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.280
 Red River is positive where the coil 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.349
 it has to be connected also the positive 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.439
 because ignition key is coming 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.290
 through these orange wires that 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:42.419
 on this negative coil motor you go 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.909
 leave nothing on if you do not 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.049
 has a spout and will turn blue 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.060
 module 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.579
 that way so for now people 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.109
 He linked three children to black and blue and 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.180
 red and if I'm calling here 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.750
 optionally the sprinkler because it 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.909
 has 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.079
 two children were left in this case 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:03.209
 black and green river 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.280
 so we called them that way in the 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.260
 clockwise looking at the distributor 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.180
 first came black that at 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.230
 earth it is nothing but the negative 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:17.280
 battery with the motor block and 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.560
 the green yo-yo is the one who carries the signal 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.889
 for the module the switching signal there 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.720
 the asteroid that this little inductor 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.810
 what he generates then we will ride 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.819
 now the distributor cap and let's 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.329
 see if it works 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.949
 okay what can happen depending on the 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.650
 model of your distributor you need 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.750
 connect this from here inverted if not 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.150
 now run the virgílio it goes 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.009
 to start the noise is not for 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.259
 account of a collector's board of 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:48.030
 What 's the leak? 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:50.599
 need to change can also call 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.599
 virgil 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.019
 well then the module work is so 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.389
 satisfactory here with the 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.669
 virgilio is an alternative to this 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.699
 magneti marelli system is that it has 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.560
 caused so much legal problem is enough 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.930
 simple installation 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.130
 in case you need I have interest in 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.530
 Can you contact me? 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.389
 direct that I can set up a network under 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.280
 measurement for your car 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.169
 I want to thank Virgil one more time. 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.830
 Virgil thank you for your love program 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.520
 sex and saving the crops with me in 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.949
 jewelry 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.090
 so thank you very much for seeing our 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.090
 videos and until the next
