00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
for training the farming skill now what

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.320 
for training the farming skill now what
way<00:00:14.040> you're<00:00:14.190> looking<00:00:14.490> at<00:00:14.610> right<00:00:14.730> now<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
way you're looking at right now is the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.630 
way you're looking at right now is the
farm<00:00:15.540> clock<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.680> will<00:00:16.949> link<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
farm clock and I will link this in the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.609 
farm clock and I will link this in the
description<00:00:18.090> below<00:00:18.210> along<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.260> with

description below along with the with
you<00:00:20.130> being<00:00:20.310> able<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.580> Google<00:00:21.000> farm<00:00:21.300> talk<00:00:21.539> with

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
you being able to Google farm talk with

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.040 
you being able to Google farm talk with
no<00:00:21.869> spaces<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.189> will<00:00:23.369> find<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.119> farm<00:00:24.390> it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
no spaces and you will find the farm it

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.630 
no spaces and you will find the farm it
should<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> first<00:00:25.769> link<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.220> pops<00:00:26.369> up

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
should be the first link that pops up

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.830 
should be the first link that pops up
being<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.539> farm<00:00:27.840> clock<00:00:28.429> so<00:00:29.449> how<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.630> farm

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
being this farm clock so how this farm

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.319 
being this farm clock so how this farm
clock<00:00:31.019> works<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.410> actually<00:00:31.710> very<00:00:31.830> simple<00:00:32.329> but

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
clock works is actually very simple but

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.240 
clock works is actually very simple but
you<00:00:33.510> do<00:00:33.660> need<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.079> few<00:00:34.380> things<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
you do need to know a few things so the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.760 
you do need to know a few things so the
first<00:00:35.489> thing<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.730> want<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> know<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.770> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
first thing you want to know is that the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.430 
first thing you want to know is that the
way<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.040> farming<00:00:38.399> works<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.270> there<00:00:39.930> when<00:00:40.350> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
way that farming works so there when you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.290 
way that farming works so there when you
log<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:40.980> out<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> chance<00:00:42.120> at

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
log in or out you have a chance at

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
log in or out you have a chance at
resetting<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:43.440> farm<00:00:43.770> tick<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.250> won't

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
resetting your farm tick so you won't

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.819 
resetting your farm tick so you won't
actually<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:45.090> your<00:00:45.210> trees<00:00:45.539> grow<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.649> many

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
actually have your trees grow but many

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.410 
actually have your trees grow but many
players<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.520> know<00:00:47.640> how<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.030> works

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
players don't really know how that works

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.779 
players don't really know how that works
exactly<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.230> when<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.590> front<00:00:49.829> occurs<00:00:50.250> now

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
exactly and when this front occurs now

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.000 
exactly and when this front occurs now
there<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.270> very<00:00:51.570> specific<00:00:52.320> set<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.620> five

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
there is this very specific set of five

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.720 
there is this very specific set of five
minutes<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.270> cannot<00:00:54.480> log<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.690> or<00:00:55.140> out<00:00:55.730> if

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
minutes that you cannot log in or out if

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.580 
minutes that you cannot log in or out if
you<00:00:56.969> want<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.480> prevent<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.809> tree<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you want to prevent your tree if you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.200 
you want to prevent your tree if you
want<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.859> make<00:00:58.980> sure<00:00:59.100> your<00:00:59.280> trees<00:00:59.640> go<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> their

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
want to make sure your trees go to their

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.360 
want to make sure your trees go to their
next<00:01:00.329> growth<00:01:00.660> stage<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.129> why

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
next growth stage so that's why

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
next growth stage so that's why
sometimes<00:01:02.910> players<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.989> all

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
sometimes players will see that all

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.620 
sometimes players will see that all
their<00:01:04.619> trees<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.220> not<00:01:05.760> grown<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.450> some

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
their trees have not grown for some

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.810 
their trees have not grown for some
reason<00:01:06.990> even<00:01:07.140> though<00:01:07.260> it's<00:01:07.470> been<00:01:07.590> far<00:01:08.010> past

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
reason even though it's been far past

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.250 
reason even though it's been far past
the<00:01:09.180> amount<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.450> time<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.990> takes<00:01:10.110> for

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the amount of time that it takes for

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.420 
the amount of time that it takes for
trees<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.830> grow<00:01:12.650> what<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.799> farm<00:01:14.010> clock<00:01:14.189> does

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
trees to grow what this farm clock does

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.219 
trees to grow what this farm clock does
is<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.820> tells<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.450> these<00:01:15.600> five<00:01:15.900> minutes

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
is it tells you when these five minutes

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
is it tells you when these five minutes
happen<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.369> look<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> graph<00:01:18.150> on

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
happen now if you look at the graph on

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.340 
happen now if you look at the graph on
top<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.430> says<00:01:21.350> it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
top then you will see that it says it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
top then you will see that it says it
shows<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.799> red<00:01:23.040> line<00:01:23.250> moving<00:01:23.759> along<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
shows this red line moving along the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.690 
shows this red line moving along the
entire<00:01:25.170> graph<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.520> see

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
entire graph and as you can see

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.010 
entire graph and as you can see
throughout<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> video<00:01:27.270> probably<00:01:27.479> budged<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
throughout the video probably budged a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.090 
throughout the video probably budged a
little<00:01:28.229> bit<00:01:28.380> because<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.710> been<00:01:28.829> over<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
little bit because it's been over a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.480 
little bit because it's been over a
minute<00:01:29.659> already<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.860> line<00:01:32.159> moves

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
minute already and as this line moves

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.700 
minute already and as this line moves
closer<00:01:32.820> now<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.960> fruit<00:01:34.470> trees

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
closer now right now I have fruit trees

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.080 
closer now right now I have fruit trees
and<00:01:34.860> Calcott<00:01:35.189> trees<00:01:35.430> highlighted<00:01:35.909> they've

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and Calcott trees highlighted they've

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.340 
and Calcott trees highlighted they've
fallen<00:01:36.360> they're<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> same<00:01:36.869> thing<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.259> only

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
fallen they're the same thing the only

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.280 
fallen they're the same thing the only
difference<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.840> calculi<00:01:39.840> trees<00:01:40.110> have

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
difference is that calculi trees have

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.200 
difference is that calculi trees have
more<00:01:40.650> growth<00:01:40.860> stages<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.610> they<00:01:41.729> take<00:01:41.970> an

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
more growth stages so they take an

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.359 
more growth stages so they take an
additional<00:01:42.450> amount<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.200> time<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.590> grow<00:01:43.770> pretty

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
additional amount of time to grow pretty

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.679 
additional amount of time to grow pretty
much<00:01:44.430> taking<00:01:45.320> an<00:01:46.320> extra<00:01:46.770> five<00:01:47.610> hours<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.240> 20

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
much taking an extra five hours and 20

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.990 
much taking an extra five hours and 20
minutes<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.259> finish<00:01:50.009> growing<00:01:50.340> because<00:01:50.850> they

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
minutes to finish growing because they

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.270 
minutes to finish growing because they
have<00:01:51.180> an<00:01:51.329> additional<00:01:51.689> two<00:01:51.899> stages<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.470> 160
