different styles of play and put on top
of<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.660> removal<00:02:22.440> light<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.730> removal<00:02:24.240> doesn't

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
of that removal light so removal doesn't

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600 
of that removal light so removal doesn't
get<00:02:24.690> better<00:02:25.080> especially<00:02:25.380> particularly<00:02:26.340> mass

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
get better especially particularly mass

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.390 
get better especially particularly mass
removal<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.990> card<00:02:28.290> will<00:02:28.380> be<00:02:28.530> very<00:02:28.920> very<00:02:29.250> good

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
removal this card will be very very good

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.340 
removal this card will be very very good
and<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.390> seems<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:30.930> from<00:02:31.170> m15<00:02:31.920> they<00:02:32.280> are<00:02:33.350> not

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
and it seems like from m15 they are not

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.220 
and it seems like from m15 they are not
the<00:02:35.030> classification<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.240> groups<00:02:36.630> weight<00:02:36.990> or

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
the classification and groups weight or

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.470 
the classification and groups weight or
just<00:02:37.440> way<00:02:37.830> out<00:02:38.130> there<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.550> terms<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.150> how

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
just way out there in terms of how

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.870 
just way out there in terms of how
expensive<00:02:39.780> they<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.830> this<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.460> very

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
expensive they are so this is a very

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.850 
expensive they are so this is a very
interesting<00:02:42.350> speculation<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.500> me<00:02:43.620> and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
interesting speculation to me and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.190 
interesting speculation to me and
something<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.850> would<00:02:45.060> keep<00:02:45.240> my<00:02:45.420> eye<00:02:45.690> on<00:02:45.720> if

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
something that I would keep my eye on if

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.900 
something that I would keep my eye on if
it<00:02:46.320> falls<00:02:46.560> below<00:02:46.860> five<00:02:47.220> bucks<00:02:47.550> it's

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
it falls below five bucks it's

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.940 
it falls below five bucks it's
definitely<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> safe<00:02:48.840> by<00:02:49.050> because<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.680> should

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
definitely a safe by because it should

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.090 
definitely a safe by because it should
pick<00:02:50.640> up<00:02:50.850> after<00:02:51.510> rotation<00:02:52.440> hits<00:02:52.830> and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
pick up after rotation hits and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.699 
pick up after rotation hits and
essentially<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.600> play<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:54.900> any<00:02:55.080> deck<00:02:55.350> so

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
essentially you can play in any deck so

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.710 
essentially you can play in any deck so
there's<00:02:55.890> two<00:02:56.070> points<00:02:56.400> I've<00:02:56.550> kept<00:02:57.360> repeating

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
there's two points I've kept repeating

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.540 
there's two points I've kept repeating
over<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.170> over<00:02:58.260> again<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.680> video<00:02:58.860> that's

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
over and over again this video that's

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.000 
over and over again this video that's
why<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.820> like<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.570> as<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> speculation<00:03:01.320> 10

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
why I like this as a speculation 10

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.640 
why I like this as a speculation 10
seems<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.550> little<00:03:02.700> pricey<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:04.050> 5<00:03:04.380> i'm

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650

seems a little pricey but like 5 i'm
sure<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:05.040> maybe<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.550> snag<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> few<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.180> ebay

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
sure you maybe can snag a few on ebay

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.570 
sure you maybe can snag a few on ebay
for<00:03:06.480> twenty<00:03:07.140> dollars<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> playset<00:03:07.830> seems

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
for twenty dollars a playset seems

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.449 
for twenty dollars a playset seems
pretty<00:03:09.030> good<00:03:09.209> especially<00:03:10.020> since<00:03:10.770> most<00:03:11.040> actual

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
pretty good especially since most actual

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.240 
pretty good especially since most actual
probably<00:03:11.910> wanted<00:03:12.780> either<00:03:12.930> as<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> cyborg<00:03:13.620> card

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250
