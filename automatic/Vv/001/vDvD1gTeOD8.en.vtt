00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
start I guess because of the seniors are

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.800 
start I guess because of the seniors are
leaving<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.940> know<00:02:03.060> she's<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.690> be<00:02:03.780> I

leaving so you know she's going to be I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.060

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
think she's gonna be fine once she gets

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.070 
think she's gonna be fine once she gets
used<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.520> level<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:06.060> play<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> little

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
used to that level of play it's a little

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.600 
used to that level of play it's a little
different<00:02:07.260> now<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.860> once<00:02:08.040> she<00:02:08.160> gets<00:02:08.280> used<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
