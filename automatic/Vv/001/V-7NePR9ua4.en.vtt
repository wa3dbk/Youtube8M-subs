on tonight's game was a strange strange

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.580 
on tonight's game was a strange strange
match<00:00:08.660> we<00:00:09.660> didn't<00:00:09.960> play<00:00:10.139> well<00:00:10.710> but<00:00:12.259> we<00:00:13.259> scored

the<00:00:13.889> first<00:00:14.099> goal<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.549> were<00:00:14.730> one<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.560> and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
the first goal we were one in and and

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.700 
the first goal we were one in and and
they<00:00:16.770> don't<00:00:16.890> know<00:00:17.039> why<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> second<00:00:17.730> half

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
they don't know why in the second half

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.920 
they don't know why in the second half
because<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:19.890> consider<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.400> first<00:00:20.640> goal<00:00:20.930> and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
because we consider the first goal and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.349

deafening second african together too I

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.490 
deafening second african together too I
think<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.500> need<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:26.519> need<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.789> walk<00:00:26.970> more

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
think that we need we need to walk more

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.070 
think that we need we need to walk more
water<00:00:28.500> chocolate<00:00:29.000> and<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.480> say<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.750> take

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
water chocolate and as you say you take

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.510 
water chocolate and as you say you take
the<00:00:31.230> lead<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.529> one<00:00:31.830> now<00:00:31.980> look<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the lead you one now look what do you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.040 
the lead you one now look what do you
think<00:00:32.759> went<00:00:32.969> wrong<00:00:33.180> after<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.730> don't<00:00:35.730> know

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
think went wrong after that I don't know

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.310 
think went wrong after that I don't know
or<00:00:37.559> should<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.890> play<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
or should we play the

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.860 
or should we play the
we<00:00:39.829> didn't<00:00:40.100> play<00:00:40.220> well<00:00:40.250> I<00:00:40.850> think<00:00:41.180> that<00:00:41.540> we<00:00:41.750> have

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
we didn't play well I think that we have

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.680 
we didn't play well I think that we have
we<00:00:42.560> have<00:00:42.620> a<00:00:42.680> lot<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:42.920> chance<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.430> score<00:00:43.730> and

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
we have a lot of chance to score and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.479 
we have a lot of chance to score and
we're<00:00:44.870> missing<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.260> chance<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:45.980> after<00:00:46.340> we

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
we're missing the chance and after we

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.549 
we're missing the chance and after we
could<00:00:46.700> see<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:46.970> width<00:00:47.629> is<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.930> mistake<00:00:48.320> in

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
could see the width is a mistake in

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.240 
could see the width is a mistake in
defensive<00:00:49.040> face<00:00:50.860> everything<00:00:51.860> is<00:00:52.010> washed

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
defensive face everything is washed

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.689 
defensive face everything is washed
range<00:00:53.079> he<00:00:54.079> employed<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.530> few<00:00:55.370> different

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
range he employed a few different

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.060 
range he employed a few different
formations<00:00:56.360> tonight<00:00:56.840> you<00:00:57.080> think<00:00:57.110> maybe<00:00:57.920> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
formations tonight you think maybe the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.770 
formations tonight you think maybe the
players<00:00:58.340> were<00:00:58.580> slightly<00:00:58.940> uncomfortable<00:00:59.360> with

players were slightly uncomfortable with

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.530 
players were slightly uncomfortable with
that<00:01:01.300> if<00:01:02.300> should<00:01:02.930> be<00:01:03.080> an<00:01:03.170> excuse<00:01:03.559> okay<00:01:04.100> but<00:01:04.550> i'm

and its really an uphill battle at this

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.899 
and its really an uphill battle at this
stage<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:35.409> now<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.740> very<00:01:35.950> difficult<00:01:36.159> it's

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
stage there now is very difficult it's

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.120 
stage there now is very difficult it's
very<00:01:37.030> difficult<00:01:37.330> we<00:01:37.750> we<00:01:38.440> can<00:01:38.619> say<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.920> will

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
very difficult we we can say that will
