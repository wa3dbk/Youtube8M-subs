00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
on before ah right so you've got a pass

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.890 
on before ah right so you've got a pass
to<00:01:16.130> being<00:01:16.340> cheated<00:01:16.549> on<00:01:16.790> then<00:01:17.299> she<00:01:17.510> makes<00:01:17.690> his

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
to being cheated on then she makes his

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.359 
to being cheated on then she makes his
submission<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:18.650> think<00:01:19.010> there's<00:01:19.159> got<00:01:19.250> to

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
submission so you think there's got to

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.020

be<00:01:19.400> more<00:01:19.580> she's<00:01:19.790> not<00:01:19.940> telling<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.210> truth<00:01:22.030> and

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
be more she's not telling the truth and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.899 
be more she's not telling the truth and
I<00:01:23.450> guess<00:01:23.659> being<00:01:23.900> in<00:01:24.049> prison<00:01:24.340> doesn't<00:01:25.340> do<00:01:25.610> great

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909
