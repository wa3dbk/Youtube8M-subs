00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:11.190
 who can be the most natural pure 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:19.289
 wax is of course a beekeeper 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:21.650
 And what can be done from wax this of course 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:30.300
 same candles 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:38.000
 here are such candles are obtained if 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.000
 it takes a lot of able-bodied subjects, I 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:54.000
 Well, any other thematic 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:56.180
 figures can be made left with api 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.180
 . 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:09.659
 small for making candles I take 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.619
 such a silicone form and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.860
 Wick Wick I do, that is, such 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.000
 threads 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:28.530
 pure cotton is checked by 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.100
 igniting if well lit and without 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:37.640
 the rest of it is even fire itself 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.190
 goes down means such a thread 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.280
 fit 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.450
 depending on the thickness of the candle need 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.960
 specific diameter 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.450
 wick in this case i use it 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:58.690
 double that is, I fold one thread 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:03.470
 I insert the wire in half and all this 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:09.800
 I fill the form here wire not 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:13.220
 gives the wick to get out wearing a stinging 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.460
 gum I made them from automotive 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.460
 cameras 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.409
 twisting the wick 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.560
 in the easiest way 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:44.200
 across put another wire 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:48.160
 pretty tough and tied knot 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.160
 wick tightened 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:07.150
 exposing it in the center like this inside 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:10.090
 Itil stretched're ready wax straighten 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.849
 on the water bath in the kettle there 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.060
 special hooks and through the spout of the kettle 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.329
 I like to pour do not need wax 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.099
 melt completely when pouring molds and 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:27.370
 it should not be hot so here 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:35.349
 this part of the liquid is already there and what else 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:44.609
 did not melt me ​​does not interfere with the kettle 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:44.609
 just pouring into the mold to full level 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:57.670
 It remains to wait when it hardens it 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:02.680
 50 minutes when the form hardens 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.800
 wire pull a knife clipped 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:11.170
 the grounds 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:18.500
 Candles so she stood wick better 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:22.700
 I bite off today's rezinochki 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:30.080
 removed from here too wireworm 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:32.480
 pulled out all the candle is ready well and 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.250
 Of course, we must see how they burn 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.160
 candles 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.430
 so that the flame was small 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.130
 only to the contrary not wax flooded 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:49.660
 wick 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.660
 for everything to burn for a long time
