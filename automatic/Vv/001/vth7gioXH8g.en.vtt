00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 we will use below the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.140
 concepts seen so far on 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.420
 series and successions to study the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.610
 ccoo curve also known as the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.070
 snowflake with snow fractal 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.809
 as some call this curve it 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.140
 shape starting with a triangle 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.199
 side equilateral l as we are going 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.289
 to divide each side into three parts 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.510
 same we have three segments that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.609
 find in the middle of each of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.769
 these sides on those three segments 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.040
 let's build three triangles 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.860
 equilateral and then we're going to eliminate 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.379
 the segments as such that we get the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 first integration of the ccoo curve 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.090
 then we will do the same with this 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.899
 integration to form the second let's 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.660
 to divide each side into three parts 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.399
 the same and we will build on the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 segment that is in the middle 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.010
 on the side equilateral triangles and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.949
 again we are going to eliminate the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.559
 segments that we get this second 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.659
 operation let's proceed from the same 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.490
 way to get the 3 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.700
 the iteration and we can continue 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.520
 doing this infinitely to get 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.149
 more interactions then we go to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.909
 denote this as n equal 1 n equal 2 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.439
 n equal 3 to say that this is the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.229
 first operation that this is the second 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.539
 and that this is the third one we are interested in 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.380
 know about the curve co if you have 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:33.630
 perimeter and area let's see then how 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.599
 we can find the perimeter 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.700
 let's calculate the perimeter for each of 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:41.909
 these figures in the case of the triangle 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.689
 it's pretty simple l more l more l have 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.149
 three times l in the case of this first 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.700
 integration we need to multiply the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.229
 number of sides by side length 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.129
 how many sides do we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.530
 10 11 and 12 and we're going to multiply by the 

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:04.439
 length of each side us to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.769
 form this first iteration we divide 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.500
 to this side in three equal parts 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.520
 that is, the side measures the third part 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.090
 of him 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.470
 is l - thirds have multiplied 12 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.620
 l thirds 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.200
 let's go with the second integration let's 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.020
 multiply the number of sides by the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.880
 length of each side how many sides 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.680
 we have in this case let's look for a 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.830
 moment the integration side 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.290
 earlier that it would be this and we will see 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.150
 one let us say enlargement to that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.330
 side we live it in three equal parts 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.160
 to get to the second iteration and in 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.260
 this segment we build a triangle 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.430
 equilateral and then we eliminate this we go 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.010
 to have a side 2 3 and 4 we are going to have 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.810
 four sides on each side that has the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.010
 first iteration in the second 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.860
 integration so we're going to 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.650
 multiply to 4 by 12 and we get the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.810
 number of sides of this integration 48 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.570
 is the result now we are going to 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.720
 multiply by the length of each side 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.740
 us to thirds that is the length 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.330
 on this side we divide it between 3 and hard 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.890
 between 3 is the same as multiplying by 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.170
 one third one third per l thirds is l 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.780
 then this is the perimeter of the 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.350
 second iteration let's go to the third 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.140
 iteration we take this side and 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.150
 we divide it by 3 this would also be 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.540
 the same expansion for what we have 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.640
 here we will have four sides for each 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.230
 side that has this second iteration 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.380
 for the third then four times 48 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.810
 is 192 which is the number of sides that 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.090
 has the third iteration we are going to 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.700
 multiply by the length of each 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.310
 from these sides as to the ninth what 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.310
 we divide by 3 to get to the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.489
 third iteration then we have the 27 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.110
 aus as a result for the length of 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.070
 this integration then we are going to 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.530
 multiply to 192 by 27 to 2 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.320
 we have the perimeter for the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.810
 first integration the perimeter for the 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.060
 second the perimeter for the third and 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.940
 we can then think about that 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.040
 we could find a perimeter for the 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.030
 nth integration we will denote what 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.450
 A) Yes 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.370
 sub n we have a succession we are going to 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.880
 find the general term of the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.910
 succession 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.400
 if we calculate the limit when 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.770
 n tends to infinity the general term 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.800
 of the succession in this case would be the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.410
 nth perimeter and the result is a 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.770
 value and we're going to tell you that the curve of 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.320
 ccoo has a perimeter that can be 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.380
 set but if the result is 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.570
 infinite or that the limit does not exist let's 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.330
 to say that the curve that does not have 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.130
 perimeter let's see then what will be the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.220
 result for this we need 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.380
 find weight n what is the law of 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.080
 formation let's see for a moment 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.860
 how can we rewrite these perimeters 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:11.120
 we have 12 which is 4 times 3 that multiply 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.640
 to thirds 48 is the same as having 4 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.490
 squared by 3 this multiplies 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.320
 Novenos 4 squared 16 times 3 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:24.860
 there's the 48 192 is 4 cubed by 3 and 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.600
 this multiplies the envelope 27 4 to the 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.240
 13 64 by 3 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.010
 there is 192 remember that to get to 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.870
 this 48 us then the 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.600
 we multiply by four then 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.870
 we have 4 by 44 squared to get 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.910
 at 192 we multiply this 48 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.890
 by 4 that is, we are multiplying 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.220
 4 squared by 3 by 4 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:49.160
 the result is 4 cubed for 3 see 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.110
 so that is equal to your n that 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.100
 we have fixed for each of these 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:58.100
 terms the 3 and him since we have 3 l 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:02.470
 always no matter how much n later 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.470
 we have the powers of 44 to 1
