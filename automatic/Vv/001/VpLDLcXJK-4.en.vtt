00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.080 

okay<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.680> how<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:01.979> want<00:00:02.429> this<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.760> be<00:00:02.909> on

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay this is how I want this to be on

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.900 
okay this is how I want this to be on
here<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.449> think<00:00:03.810> so<00:00:03.899> now<00:00:04.890> what<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.490> do<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.670> you

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
here I think so now what you do is you

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.720 
here I think so now what you do is you
take<00:00:06.089> you<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.420> these<00:00:06.569> four<00:00:06.990> feet<00:00:07.710> they're<00:00:08.490> just

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
take you to these four feet they're just

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.089 
take you to these four feet they're just
sitting<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.389> there<00:00:09.630> now<00:00:09.840> what<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.740> do<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.980> you

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
sitting on there now what you do is you

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.129 
sitting on there now what you do is you
pop<00:00:11.460> part<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.570> foot<00:00:12.750> through<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
pop part of the foot through the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.629 
pop part of the foot through the
motherboard<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.889> that's<00:00:14.040> what<00:00:14.219> holds<00:00:14.370> it

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
motherboard and that's what holds it

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.060 
motherboard and that's what holds it
down<00:00:15.020> you<00:00:16.020> want<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.289> careful<00:00:16.560> when<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.890> do

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
down you want to be careful when you do

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.510 
down you want to be careful when you do
this<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.880> have<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.090> press<00:00:18.449> these<00:00:18.690> firmly<00:00:19.520> but

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
this you have to press these firmly but

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.490 
this you have to press these firmly but
if<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.880> if<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.300> just<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.869> motherboard

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
if you if you just have the motherboard

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.769 
if you if you just have the motherboard
sitting<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.490> cardboard<00:00:23.850> box<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.600> I

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
sitting on like a cardboard box like I

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.050 
sitting on like a cardboard box like I
do<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.680> don't<00:00:25.949> want<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> push<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.400> too<00:00:26.580> hard

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
do you don't want to push it too hard

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
do you don't want to push it too hard
because<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:28.019> crack<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
because you can actually crack the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.710 
because you can actually crack the
motherboard<00:00:29.340> if<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.970> push<00:00:30.210> down<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.599> these

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
motherboard if you push down on these

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.440 
motherboard if you push down on these
too<00:00:30.929> hard<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.070> want<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> use<00:00:32.730> firm

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
too hard and so you want to use firm

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.080 
too hard and so you want to use firm
enough<00:00:33.719> pressure<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.469> also<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.980> very<00:00:35.340> gentle

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
enough pressure but also be very gentle

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.190 
enough pressure but also be very gentle
and<00:00:37.640> sometimes<00:00:38.640> what<00:00:38.879> I'll<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.540> actually

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and sometimes what I'll do is actually

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.860 
and sometimes what I'll do is actually
put<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.739> put<00:00:41.489> my<00:00:41.550> hand<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> back<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
put my put my hand on the back of the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.020 
put my put my hand on the back of the
board<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.980> support<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:44.969> sure

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
board to support it just to make sure

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.540 
board to support it just to make sure
I'm<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.300> bending<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> board<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.559> cracking

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I'm not bending the board and cracking

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.580 
I'm not bending the board and cracking
it<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.180> when<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.690> push<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.110> first<00:00:49.350> one

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it and so when we push this first one

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.100 
it and so when we push this first one
down<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.039> until<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.399> clicks<00:00:50.899> did<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.989> hear

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
down here until it clicks did you hear

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.490 
down here until it clicks did you hear
that<00:00:52.140> click<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.760> then<00:00:54.000> here's<00:00:54.329> push<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.260> one

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that click and then here's push this one

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.299 
that click and then here's push this one
down<00:00:56.270> all<00:00:57.270> right<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:58.350> snapping<00:00:59.039> that

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
down all right so that's snapping that

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:08.870 
down all right so that's snapping that
down<00:01:02.210> three<00:01:03.210> down<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> now<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.890> heatsink

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
down three down and now that heatsink

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.859 
down three down and now that heatsink
and<00:01:09.030> fan<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.890> securely<00:01:11.060> held<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.720> not

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and fan is securely held on and it's not

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.840 
and fan is securely held on and it's not
going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.200> anywhere<00:01:13.430> now<00:01:14.430> I'm<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> go

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
going to go anywhere now I'm going to go

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.770 
going to go anywhere now I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.450> connect<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.200> power<00:01:17.180> cord<00:01:18.180> it'll

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
ahead and connect this power cord it'll

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
ahead and connect this power cord it'll
let<00:01:18.900> me<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.229> there<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.560> way<00:01:19.770> you'll<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
let me go on there one way you'll on the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
let me go on there one way you'll on the
back<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> power<00:01:21.659> cord<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.259> fan

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
back of the power cord for this fan

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.710 
back of the power cord for this fan
you'll<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> little<00:01:23.189> bump<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> couple

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you'll see a little bump with a couple

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.070 
you'll see a little bump with a couple
of<00:01:24.869> plastic<00:01:25.310> ridges<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.670> those<00:01:27.330> ridges<00:01:27.840> go

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
of plastic ridges on it those ridges go

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.450 
of plastic ridges on it those ridges go
on<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.759> white<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:31.250> don't<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:32.310> what

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
on this little white I don't know what

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.480 
on this little white I don't know what
you<00:01:32.549> call<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.700> piece<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.360> plastic<00:01:33.869> back<00:01:34.049> here

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
you call it piece of plastic back here

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.179 
you call it piece of plastic back here
so<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.670> it'll<00:01:35.850> only<00:01:36.030> go<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:37.020> way<00:01:37.049> now<00:01:37.829> I

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
so that it'll only go on one way now I

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.580 
so that it'll only go on one way now I
think<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> couple<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.210> those<00:01:39.360> four<00:01:39.720> pins<00:01:40.110> are

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
think a couple of those four pins are

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.310 
think a couple of those four pins are
for<00:01:40.619> power<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.640> couple<00:01:41.880> help<00:01:42.780> communicate

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
for power and a couple help communicate

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.800 
for power and a couple help communicate
the<00:01:46.320> span<00:01:46.649> speed<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.720> when<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
the span speed so that when the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.260 
the span speed so that when the
if<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.770> starts<00:01:51.070> getting<00:01:51.190> hotter<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:52.090> can

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
if it starts getting hotter it can

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.330 
if it starts getting hotter it can
actually<00:01:52.690> crank<00:01:53.140> up<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.650> power<00:01:53.680> okay<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:57.159> now

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
actually crank up the power okay so now

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.249 
actually crank up the power okay so now
that<00:01:57.549> power<00:01:57.760> connector<00:01:58.330> for<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:58.630> fan<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:58.900> on

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
that power connector for that fan is on

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.789 
that power connector for that fan is on
there<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.780> guess<00:02:02.049> while<00:02:02.290> I<00:02:02.320> have<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.710> out

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
there now I guess while I have it out

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.230 
there now I guess while I have it out
here<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.190> next<00:02:03.340> thing<00:02:03.580> we'll<00:02:03.759> do<00:02:03.909> is<00:02:03.940> we'll

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
here the next thing we'll do is we'll

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.109
