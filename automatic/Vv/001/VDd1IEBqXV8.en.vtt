00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.130
 hello to all at all and omission not 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.440
 go back today for a new 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.109
 video so today it's going to be 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.320
 what is the best defense for the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.990
 qg 16 so the qg is what there is a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.689
 subject that is very very long to ep to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.480
 up knowing that I ride all 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.460
 maximum buildings for each qg 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 I almost got to the end 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.460
 remains only mortar mounting 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.500
 level of 15 and then I'll be at qg 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 17.2 forage not super g 17 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.770
 he will also stay but barge to climb 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.750
 but I think I'll show a qg 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.489
 following as the place 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.980
 extra does not bring me anything 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.600
 all a lot go fast on this model 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.460
 defense 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.739
 so this is a symmetrical model 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.219
 so you with an axis of symmetry when we 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.620
 can see it 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.140
 the only thing that is not symmetrical 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.160
 c7 machine guns since I have a 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.010
 prototype 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.379
 so so that's how it is 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.970
 pass in master we will put the qg to his 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.240
 children in fairly advanced position here at 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.710
 middle but quite advanced 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.290
 then around we put the flamethrowers 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.119
 for all that is the near damage 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.119
 for everything that is attacked crowd 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.390
 won all that and then we split it up to 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.310
 turn defense areas into 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.049
 spreading in a fairly 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.670
 coordinated ie the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.710
 rocket launcher we loved it back 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 why simply because thanks to 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.450
 their large area we will be able to touch 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.729
 almost half you see there from the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.780
 map and the other will touch the other half 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.250
 but still all the troops that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.060
 attack will always be under a spear 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.610
 rockets at least 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.780
 then before we put two super cannon 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 so that allows you to immediately 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.020
 destroy the big troops if ever 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.390
 there are attacks as long as everything here 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.979
 it will not last long 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.540
 then we have a row of all the fear 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.060
 the snipers hole are more it's 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.280
 that she is doing enough damage 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.469
 important but we do a lot too 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.090
 quickly that is to say that you love me 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.020
 for the finds that it's soldier all 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.130
 that it will be fine mortars are 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.440
 placed on the sides to be able to 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.720
 attack big areas generally 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.310
 people seen that qg is not very 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.200
 far they go to check in a straight line 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.420
 and are not going to attack 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.640
 on the sides so that allows the mortar 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.870
 to attack the troubles that will pass to 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.360
 middle then we can see that everything 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.160
 which is reserved we put them behind to 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.830
 simply avoid someone who 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.080
 attack to fill his gunboat in 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.100
 destroying the buildings was then that 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.350
 are there any other very 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.660
 important there the rest after twenty months 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.400
 fossard that I put my prototype here 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.510
 and we can also master here at the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.430
 place of the other he was working and in 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.970
 this case there the submachine gun at this level 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.300
 there over the mine and then 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.760
 so to finish you have to spread the 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.590
 mines so put a little everywhere 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.590
 between the building more in front of the qg 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.050
 located behind since logically seen 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.720
 this composition there the person to whom 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.640
 attack will not get around the qg being 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.800
 given that he is in a pretty position 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.110
 advanced so here is a 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.200
 I'm going to leave you then the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.940
 plan is so if you are going to achieve 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.110
 so you can it's for the qg 16 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.540
 so it's a very good defense 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.250
 honestly his last advantage is that 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.800
 no any building is collar and 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.510
 so it helps to prevent someone 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.160
 to replace gunboat too easily 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.220
 for a person who will really boost 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.530
 his gunboat so very soon I 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.370
 will propose you a new a new 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.440
 basic plan of qg 16 for then 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.970
 that I can go to qg 17 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.570
 so I tell you hi everyone and 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.570
 see you
