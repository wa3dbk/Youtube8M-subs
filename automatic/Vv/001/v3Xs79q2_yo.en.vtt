00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
play and I've got a orbital care package

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.500 
play and I've got a orbital care package
at<00:01:02.370> two<00:01:02.550> minutes<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.000> will<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> low

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
at two minutes so that will be a low

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
at two minutes so that will be a low
value<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.229> that's<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.589> anything<00:01:04.830> too

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
value this that's not anything too

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
and may actually all the last laugh I've

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.990 
and may actually all the last laugh I've
might<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.799> seen<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> sport<00:01:17.280> plus<00:01:17.670> two<00:01:17.970> for

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
might have you seen a sport plus two for

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.260 
might have you seen a sport plus two for
accuracy<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.840> minus<00:01:19.619> 24<00:01:20.490> fire<00:01:20.759> I'm<00:01:20.970> not<00:01:21.060> even

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
accuracy a minus 24 fire I'm not even

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.330 
accuracy a minus 24 fire I'm not even
sure<00:01:21.299> how<00:01:21.689> fire<00:01:22.049> rate<00:01:22.290> works<00:01:22.619> when<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.100> comes

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
sure how fire rate works when it comes

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.090 
sure how fire rate works when it comes
to<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.509> em1<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> constant<00:01:25.890> laser

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
to the em1 because the constant laser

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.740 
to the em1 because the constant laser
but<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:26.970> pre<00:01:27.180> interesting<00:01:27.450> weapon<00:01:27.540> I've

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
but that's pre interesting weapon I've

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.999 
but that's pre interesting weapon I've
actually<00:01:27.900> seen<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.200> before<00:01:28.259> Scott<00:01:28.619> +<00:01:28.799> tooth

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
actually seen that before Scott + tooth

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.679 
actually seen that before Scott + tooth
accuracy<00:01:29.520> which<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> good<00:01:30.420> thing<00:01:30.479> because

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
accuracy which is a good thing because

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.950 
accuracy which is a good thing because
