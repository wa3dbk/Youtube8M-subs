00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.439
 hello very good to everyone in this tutorial 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 I'm going to show you how to make the 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.910
 boot of your computer be more 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.520
 fast and not so loaded at the start 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.780
 from the oven so you can use it before 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.890
 big 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.830
 see the command that specific for this 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.440
 task we can access in two ways or 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.060
 holding the symbol of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.930
 windows that is next to control and 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.960
 alt and pressing ere and we would appear 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.400
 this window window execute or 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.760
 we can simply access start and 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.900
 run if you have windows 7 view here 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.540
 I would leave to search to search 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.160
 the file and get to execute then 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.370
 we give and write that 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.700
 ok we give the whole and we would leave 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.240
 this window the most important thing of this 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.220
 tool 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.370
 let's say it would be the start tab 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.280
 I explain 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.140
 this tab what it does is disable 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.630
 programs that can be started with 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.610
 windows and you can make the computer go 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.620
 a little bit slower when starting and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.170
 It may take longer before you start 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.020
 work with him then surely 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.200
 you will have all these things 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.820
 activated and you have more programs and such 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.550
 you will have many more things and all 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.100
 activated very many then you 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.050
 you have to look for example skype not what 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.160
 I want to love Chinese this I do not know what 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.160
 qualities then out 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.190
 What is it 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.380
 and you just have to look and deactivate 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.790
 things that are practically useless 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.670
 like the google diet 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.540
 the skyper messenger the yahoo whatever 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.620
 anything and make me cases can you 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.420
 can make the pc much faster 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.550
 this is a tool that is nothing 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.870
 wrong to remember ms config command then to 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.290
 uncheck and check the boxes that 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.680
 you want to apply 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.319
 close 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.269
 then we would get a window that 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.620
 puts out without restarting and restarting what 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.500
 more recommendable clear is to give 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.939
 restart but as I say I have not 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.420
 made no change because it will give 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:38.110
 exit without restarting voucher 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.819
 and good guys this would be this tutorial 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.500
 I hope you liked it, I know that 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.060
 lately it's the short tutorials 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.120
 but it's what I'm good at and 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.870
 so then it's worth to remember to execute 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.110
 more with 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.740
 and it's good if you want that explained 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.900
 also these tabs to see 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.780
 in general here do not touch anything because 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.150
 you will not have by default this is 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.790
 marked tab is worth but I what I have 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.320
 done then it is to select the drip for 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.110
 make me faster when I start 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.110
 It is worth what I have also 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.060
 deactivated because they would be the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.430
 the graphic part when I start the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.140
 computer that does not leave me typical in 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.650
 windows 7 for example that you get the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.980
 balls and well with this you can 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.740
 remove and giving it here again the bot and with 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.240
 this directly happens to start for 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.130
 turn it on they were directly that 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.440
 they started the animation voucher and this you 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.930
 You can save about five seconds 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.510
 then there is the commissioning here 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.980
 I do not recommend that they remove anything because 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.830
 there are some things that are very 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.230
 important are now with these and that 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.790
 update 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.340
 plug-and-play for example if 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.950
 we deactivated this when you put a usb 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.390
 he will not recognize us then there is 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.849
 to be very careful here not 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.760
 I notice that you are a lot here because 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.440
 here you can mess it up bad and 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.100
 let's say that in the tab 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:10.130
 tools because nothing gets you some 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.730
 some other some more commands by 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.730
 example 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.730
 132 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.780
 to see advanced information 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.020
 hardware and software configurations 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.220
 ok this is what it is 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.220
 would be the ms command 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.280
 and good guys this would be all I hope 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.360
 that you liked the ministerial this 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.360
 and remember 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.300
 like at least please all those 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.730
 four children have another doing 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.050
 tutorials for guys and I hope that you 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.940
 I liked it and you have been useful 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.940
 and nothing next
