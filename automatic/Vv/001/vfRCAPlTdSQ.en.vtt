conference for the HPC industry because

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.070 
conference for the HPC industry because
it<00:00:30.590> allows<00:00:30.890> us<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:31.369> show<00:00:31.640> our<00:00:32.000> best<00:00:32.080> products

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
it allows us to show our best products

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.890 
it allows us to show our best products
for<00:00:33.590> supercomputing<00:00:34.489> and<00:00:34.699> the<00:00:35.360> remarkable

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
for supercomputing and the remarkable

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.990 
for supercomputing and the remarkable
thing<00:00:36.020> about<00:00:36.050> supermicro<00:00:36.860> is<00:00:37.100> its<00:00:37.460> breadth<00:00:37.820> of

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
thing about supermicro is its breadth of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.210 
thing about supermicro is its breadth of
product<00:00:38.270> so<00:00:38.870> here<00:00:39.110> is<00:00:39.260> a<00:00:39.290> forum<00:00:39.680> where<00:00:39.949> we<00:00:39.980> get

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
product so here is a forum where we get

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.880 
memory we're able to get 768 gigabytes
in<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.340> single<00:02:13.640> platform<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.650> have<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
in a single platform and have the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.220 
in a single platform and have the
versatility<00:02:16.610> with<00:02:16.790> our<00:02:17.000> UI<00:02:17.239> o<00:02:17.420> based<00:02:17.780> system

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
versatility with our UI o based system

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.360 
versatility with our UI o based system
to<00:02:19.010> allow<00:02:19.690> most<00:02:20.690> many<00:02:20.989> more<00:02:21.230> add-on<00:02:22.010> cards

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
to allow most many more add-on cards

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.830 
to allow most many more add-on cards
that<00:02:22.520> are<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.849> than<00:02:23.269> you<00:02:23.390> would<00:02:23.540> normally

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
that are in it than you would normally

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.530 
that are in it than you would normally
find<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.799> a<00:02:25.340> traditional<00:02:25.489> 2

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
find in a traditional 2

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.020 
find in a traditional 2
so<00:02:27.050> our<00:02:27.230> uio<00:02:27.560> technology<00:02:28.310> allows<00:02:28.610> us<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.909> get

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
so our uio technology allows us to get

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.289 
so our uio technology allows us to get
more<00:02:29.209> add-on<00:02:29.599> cards<00:02:30.129> more<00:02:31.129> memory<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:31.700> again

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
more add-on cards more memory and again
