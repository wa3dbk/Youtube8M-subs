is in this light at least it looks like

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.999 
is in this light at least it looks like
a<00:01:25.650> white<00:01:25.950> lie<00:01:26.280> look<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.750> can't<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.829> see

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
a white lie look so you can't really see

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.980 
a white lie look so you can't really see
that<00:01:29.310> much<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> lilac<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.540> looks<00:01:30.720> very

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that much of the lilac it looks very

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.130 
that much of the lilac it looks very
very<00:01:31.079> white<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:32.009> me<00:01:32.689> it's<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> pretty<00:01:33.900> color

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
very white to me it's a pretty color

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.870 
very white to me it's a pretty color
anyway<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:34.740> assuming<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.400> lighting<00:01:35.759> in

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
anyway I'm assuming it's the lighting in

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.760 
anyway I'm assuming it's the lighting in
here<00:01:35.909> that's<00:01:36.210> making<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> look<00:01:36.780> different

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
here that's making it look different

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.679 
here that's making it look different
color<00:01:38.159> than<00:01:38.220> what<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.850> but

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
color than what it actually is but

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.469 
color than what it actually is but
that's<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:41.090> being<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.150> good<00:01:42.270> girl<00:01:42.450> and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
does it justice because it is a cream

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.509 
does it justice because it is a cream
