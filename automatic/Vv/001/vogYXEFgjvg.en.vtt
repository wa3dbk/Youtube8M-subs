00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
I was supposed to be off the best and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.100

that<00:00:47.550> was<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:47.910> goal<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:48.600> what<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> did<00:00:49.079> I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
that was my goal and that's what I did I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.470

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.779 
enjoyed every minute of it and then I
got<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.020> final<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.610> was

got the final so it was it was

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.670 
got the final so it was it was
surprising<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.480> was<00:00:54.660> no<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.500> more

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.069 
surprising I was no one was more
surprised<00:00:56.070> than<00:00:56.190> me<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:57.120> two<00:00:57.270> best<00:00:57.570> teams<00:00:57.660> in

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
surprised than me the two best teams in

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.010 
surprised than me the two best teams in
world<00:00:58.320> rugby<00:00:58.699> these<00:00:59.699> players<00:01:00.030> facing<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
world rugby these players facing the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.490 
world rugby these players facing the
biggest<00:01:01.410> opportunity<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.399> their<00:01:02.730> lives

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
biggest opportunity of their lives

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
biggest opportunity of their lives
England<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:05.010> had<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:05.430> team<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:06.000> were

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
England really had a good team they were

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.899 
England really had a good team they were
probably<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.680> complete<00:01:08.100> team<00:01:08.310> from<00:01:08.610> number

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
probably the complete team from number

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.910 
probably the complete team from number
one<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.090> number<00:01:09.270> 15<00:01:09.930> plus<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.200> reserves<00:01:10.710> on

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
one to number 15 plus the reserves on

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.609 
one to number 15 plus the reserves on
the<00:01:10.950> bench<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.960> don't<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.140> there<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> flaw

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the bench I don't think there was a flaw

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
the bench I don't think there was a flaw
in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.860> game<00:01:14.040> they<00:01:14.280> were<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.670> were<00:01:14.729> really

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
in the game they were they were really

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.700 
in the game they were they were really
powerful<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> scrums<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.350> were<00:01:16.409> good

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
powerful in the scrums they were good

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.469 
powerful in the scrums they were good
line<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.130> jumpers<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:17.790> could<00:01:17.970> move<00:01:18.180> they

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
line out jumpers they could move they

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.820 
line out jumpers they could move they
could<00:01:18.659> run<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:19.049> could<00:01:19.229> defend<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:19.680> could

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
could run they could defend they could

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.190 
could run they could defend they could
be<00:01:19.920> everything<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.340> Australia<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.450> perhaps

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
be everything and Australia was perhaps

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.929 
be everything and Australia was perhaps
a<00:01:22.439> surprise<00:01:22.740> package<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.340> course<00:01:23.549> no<00:01:23.790> one

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
a surprise package the course no one

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.770 
a surprise package the course no one
expected<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:26.150> did<00:01:27.150> because

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
expected them to get there I did because

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.510 
expected them to get there I did because
you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.170> never<00:01:28.259> write<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> top<00:01:28.829> team<00:01:29.040> off<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you can never write a top team off and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
you can never write a top team off and
they<00:01:30.119> got<00:01:30.270> into<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.630> final<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.650> they

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
they got into the final and and they

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.740 
they got into the final and and they
played<00:01:31.979> they<00:01:32.430> played<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.670> very<00:01:33.000> very<00:01:33.180> good<00:01:33.540> game

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
played they played a very very good game

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.319 
played they played a very very good game
and<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> most<00:01:35.490> people<00:01:35.850> surprised

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and I think to most people surprised

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.789 
and I think to most people surprised
they<00:01:36.630> kept<00:01:37.290> England<00:01:38.360> in<00:01:39.360> check<00:01:39.689> England<00:01:40.650> never

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
they kept England in check England never

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.819 
they kept England in check England never
ran<00:01:41.070> away<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.720> tight<00:01:42.960> all<00:01:43.229> along

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
ran away with it it was tight all along

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
there was an aftermath that then went on

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.140 
there was an aftermath that then went on
from<00:02:44.730> once

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.869 

it's<00:02:48.720> extra<00:02:49.170> time<00:02:50.120> thornado

with a drop goal of Johnny in extra time

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.300 
with a drop goal of Johnny in extra time
I<00:02:56.599> looked<00:02:57.170> at<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.319> clock<00:02:57.469> and<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.829> was<00:02:57.859> 34

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
I looked at the clock and it was 34

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.670 
I looked at the clock and it was 34
seconds<00:02:58.819> left<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.959> remember<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
seconds left and I remember the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.890 
seconds left and I remember the
breakthrough<00:03:01.219> by<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.579> scrum<00:03:02.090> off<00:03:02.329> of<00:03:02.510> England

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
breakthrough by the scrum off of England

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.780 
breakthrough by the scrum off of England
I<00:03:03.019> remember<00:03:03.590> Martin<00:03:03.950> Johnson<00:03:04.219> carried<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
I remember Martin Johnson carried the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.490 
I remember Martin Johnson carried the
ball<00:03:04.969> for<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.239> time<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.659> I<00:03:05.750> thought<00:03:05.989> they<00:03:06.170> could

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
ball for a time and I thought they could

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.369 
ball for a time and I thought they could
come<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:06.920> score<00:03:07.310> because<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.200> scores<00:03:09.200> were

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
come and score because the scores were

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.349 
come and score because the scores were
level<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.890> then<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.549> saw<00:03:10.760> Johnny<00:03:11.060> drop<00:03:11.329> back

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
level and then I saw Johnny drop back

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.210 
level and then I saw Johnny drop back
for<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.870> drop<00:03:12.109> and<00:03:12.290> I<00:03:12.379> thought<00:03:12.560> okay<00:03:12.890> here<00:03:13.099> it

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
for the drop and I thought okay here it

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.630 
for the drop and I thought okay here it
comes

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
comes

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.539 
comes
and<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:15.260> scrum<00:03:15.530> off<00:03:15.709> picked<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.040> ball<00:03:16.189> up<00:03:16.250> and

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
and the scrum off picked the ball up and

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.699 
and the scrum off picked the ball up and
Australia<00:03:17.269> were<00:03:17.420> woefully<00:03:17.720> offside<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.500> back

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
Australia were woefully offside the back

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.839 
Australia were woefully offside the back
just<00:03:19.010> shot<00:03:19.250> up<00:03:19.430> too<00:03:19.579> early<00:03:19.909> and<00:03:20.090> then<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:20.959> was<00:03:21.319> in
