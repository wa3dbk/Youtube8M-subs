00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:16.400
 Hello 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:19.800
 Belyashi wants 500 milliliters of kefir 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.500
 test do kefir option usually 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.830
 either yeast or this is true and black 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.130
 easier 500 milliliters of kefir sour 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.219
 preferably not the freshest 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.329
 well, about 500 grams of flour floor 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:43.820
 a teaspoon of not extinguished soda a couple of spoons 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.820
 sugar teaspoon salt 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.520
 I knead the dough half a kilo of bows 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.170
 with this glass maybe I will 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:02.309
 add more will be visible dough should 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.430
 be soft and not liquid well that is 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.380
 look you see 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.710
 kneaded kneaded add all the flour 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.710
 gradually 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:28.220
 but now I stood on the liquid I add 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.950
 tablespoon of vegetable oil and 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.490
 then in the second one this dough is not 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:42.930
 will become thicker I will add more 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:45.770
 flour gradually pouring flour doedu to 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.770
 desired consistency 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.150
 meat will use lamb 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.060
 as in the original recipe is Tatar 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.300
 the dish and tatars used mostly 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.980
 lamb you can to him some 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.960
 cases 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.490
 Now I do not know for sure I will not climb the wilds and 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.220
 so pour flour 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:18.240
 knead continue to knead well, that's the dough 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:24.120
 already acquired some texture 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.720
 more dense yet and a lot of vegetable 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.620
 oils 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:32.220
 so that this dough was all in butter 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.970
 oil now inside do not need it here 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:43.160

00:02:52.739 --> 00:03:00.060
 pepper 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:02.900
 to taste the salt I will rub this thing 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.900
 add phrase 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.580
 I will use onions amount 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.350
 about half the weight of the meat on 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.350
 grinder take the largest grill 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.210
 about 400 grams injured 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.210

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:33.690
 onions add cooked spices and 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.140
 stir them stand out juice of onions 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.970

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:43.530
 five spices and then the meat went meat 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.530
 pretty fat good 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.330
 how should i stir 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.920
 flash do it for 3 minutes even 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:01.180
 beat off this one I want 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.710
 about 400 grams 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.810
 mutton and about 200 grams 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:11.210
 onions may be even more onions ritter 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.370
 sorry not liter centimeter from 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.530
 vegetable oil should be on 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.049
 pan pouring sunflower there 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.910
 butter start working with dough 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.570
 how to shape for only and there are different 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.430
 options 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.430
 I decided to try this 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.480
 pinch off the dough pieces 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.650
 bending the edges I can get more round 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.200
 more round shape and get and on 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.650
 flatten the dough a little stretching and 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.740
 stretching it on a baking sheet baking sheet 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:52.750
 oiled up 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.750
 minced meat and should not be very much 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.110
 well, or a little more 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.300
 if you are a native cooking 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:07.280
 You can smear belyashi vegetable oil 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:11.770
 and bake in the oven about 180 degrees 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.770
 about 30 minutes will be more dietary 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:22.180
 further wrap the dough folds and 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.180
 connecting them on top of these folds 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.860
 another option is just petals 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:32.290
 group stock by petal laid on 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:40.510
 mince and overlap these petals 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:44.010
 connect further press you take so 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.010
 so that there is no air left 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.810
 Well, you just, I certainly do not get, and 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:01.850
 what a prize at a beauty contest 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.850
 but what was delicious and does 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.250
 it's not that hard either 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:12.570
 do the first time ever before dibil well 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.610
 I continue to continue my operas 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.610
 the first were huge curves 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:23.409
 I will continue to reduce the amount 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:26.590
 nip off his dough now 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:30.719
 Yes, and belyashi became a little smaller check 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:34.449
 oil temperature wet toothpick 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:37.449
 hiss means you can allow the operator 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.930
 frying should be medium to decided 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.680
 the sphere 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.439
 fry well about three 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.699
 minutes on one side 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:48.069
 initially must be ticked 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.810
 then flip about the same 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:53.379
 well, that is, they must be rouge and here 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:57.430
 and so in the end they received from 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:59.860
 i am quite beautiful enough like 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:03.849
 let's say without false modesty and smaller 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:06.610
 size see how well in them on top 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:13.150
 juice which is better not to take it away 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:15.729
 very tasty and cool well this food is not 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:20.740
 call him healthy and dietary 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:22.500
