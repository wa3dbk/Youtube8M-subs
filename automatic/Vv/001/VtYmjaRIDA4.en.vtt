00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:18.539
 this is the seed of the versio so 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.740
 bogaers dinner is the brown bean 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.360
 the brown bean in different 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:28.560
 parts that I will briefly mention 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.140
 the first thing you notice is the seed skin 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.040
 the seed skin in the vliesje what on the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.489
 kidney beans there is protection and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.739
 second thing that stands out is a bitch spot 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.239
 on the side of a mule tree on the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.239
 drawing is the one shown here 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.610
 this is called NATO with NATO 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.000
 the brown tree was attached to the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.000
 mother plant 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.260
 at the bottom of the nail 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.809
 a dark one 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.970
 it meant you on the other hand 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:10.979
 of NATO is a drill with 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:14.159
 the sign makes the brown tree 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.040
 sufficient water and nutrients that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.939
 then discovered as we walk the brown 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.700
 then cut it look like this 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.930
 a brown tree and inside has two 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.980
 mud rooms 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.260
 1 here and 1 here the saw-mill 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.860
 are a very food for the brown 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.630
 tree like this comes to pure despair 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.090
 is in a stem and two leaves 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.050
 those leaves will be the first leaves 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.490
 to make us feel green creeper 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.310
 here you see a brown tree that is in one 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.750
 glass cylinder with earth 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.820
 There are a number of conditions to it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.400
 environment that should be good for that 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.620
 band will germinate as first must 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.720
 there must be enough water for this 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.280
 environment are also sufficiently warm 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.680
 this heat is used up in this 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.360
 inserted by the lamp 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.950
 if such a brown bean is about germs 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.679
 first root comes out through it 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.810
 gate with the root of the tree water 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.000
 record from the environment when the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.099
 root from the tree comes cracks hate 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.769
 open it and leave the beans so he had 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.909
 it fall when plant enough 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.709
 has absorbed water 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.080
 so the stalk also comes out of the tree 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.360
 grow after a few days there will be new ones 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.950
 platelets will grow on the stalk 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.250
 the seed run away as soon as all 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.630
 reserve food has been used up 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.600
 After this we have no function 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.250
 more and fall off the plant 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.870
 there are two processes in this video 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.550
 going at the same time 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.440
 First of all the property gets bigger 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.840
 weight of a pad you increase this 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.430
 is called the growth of the mat 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.020
 In addition , everything is changing 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.120
 the plant this will be the development 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.800
 the plant would be called 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.360
 shrivel the seed run and emerge 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.780
 a new leaves and branches of 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.780
 the carrots
