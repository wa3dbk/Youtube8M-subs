00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.040
 Hi everybody 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.599
 today a new episode like 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.280
 slot where I'm going to show you two 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.599
 little tips the first one will you 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.549
 allow to go on the roof of a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.109
 error while the second or will 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.150
 north go down we see right away 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.500
 how to do that the first thing that 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.199
 we are going to need it's good 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.420
 heard of obsidian to create a portal 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.490
 for my part I will create a portal 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.080
 square but of course you make a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.480
 rectangular portal if you 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.120
 wish for me it's just for 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.100
 respect the pattern of the mother 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.390
 once the portal created game turn it on 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.610
 and I cross it 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.860
 you must know that for my part I 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
 to properly locate my portal but in front of 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.149
 side you will have to find the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.270
 good area to know that you put 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.870
 under the ceiling of the desert the ceiling is 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.270
 find in 126 what makes your eyes 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.809
 must be in 126 and your feet on the ground 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.649
 25 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.309
 if this is not the case found at least 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.199
 124 of that is that there or I 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.549
 in 124 for my feet and for my eyes 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.590
 I am in 65 which means that I have 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.220
 two blocks of bedrock above me 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.979
 so ideally years but we are 125 and we 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 will launch two under allowed it is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.280
 possible from time to time that you 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.630
 glitch and in the block for that you 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 will need a third under 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.140
 pearls so did not neglect this one 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.360
 is proud to have rab in case 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.979
 you would have a problem so I'm going 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.860
 to throw very quickly the two hours pearls 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.990
 and I will find myself on the roof 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.970
 there for example I glitch then jeans 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.250
 mances another and here I am on the roof 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.200
 so we can see that I'm in 128 at 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.079
 know above the roof level 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.610
 Here it is quiet but there's no mob 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.090
 but you can not really 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.659
 you commit suicide so we will take a little 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.969
 oxygen 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.869
 we will make a portal provided 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.990
 always enough to make you a portal 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:02.469
 we come back here 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:04.990
 then we continue the portal up all 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.819
 light up and we can go home 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.459
 so that's of course the first way 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.130
 to enter the most reliable 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.049
 now there is another solution 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.720
 for that I return to the desert I 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.510
 shows you it's going to be going to go on 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.519
 the roof of a technique that do not use 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.549
 not as for it gives benchmarks so 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.959
 we will fix that and this you will have 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.660
 need all its elements 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.739
 the first to piston then a block of 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.829
 quartz what to put there rails a mike 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.170
 hart and leverage so you still have to 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.970
 once you find in 125 to know 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.239
 with a single block above your 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.579
 head 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.680
 on the other hand here it is non-negotiable 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.980
 so the first thing you go 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.269
 to do is to push the piston 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.069
 we will put the lever next to a block to 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.380
 rai 1 mike hart 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.450
 we go below we break the rails 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.510
 we go a little off the mind because you 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.940
 see there and we mount it so my card 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.980
 is good here what are we going to do 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.720
 will enter the mind map 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.250
 once we are in we will do 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.660
 numbers to go out since 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.889
 now to go out we have to do 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.450
 numbers if you have changed in 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.239
 control of course more stylized the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.859
 control that you have not set and 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.440
 once you're out very quickly 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.200
 you jump if you go kitschy and 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:31.389
 you're going to suffocate so where are we going 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.410
 we do numbers and we jump and that's it 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.209
 so you see 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.530
 I could have lost a little more but I 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.569
 have not lost much you have to know 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.280
 also just on crowd track and again a 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.519
 Once we are on the roof of a 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.769
 mistake so here i'm going to show you a 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.019
 small technique 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.970
 on the other hand I will put myself in game 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.739
 fashion for the story of simplicity 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.930
 a technique that will allow you to 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.060
 get out then the first thing to do 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.700
 it is to install four blocks of earth 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.950
 then you will take dark so 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.280
 to call yourself that you are going to put coast to 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.430
 coast to form a square and you go 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.620
 set up one of them goodville 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.819
 you will start again and you will 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.010
 see after a while what will happen 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:17.859
 to continue we hope that it does not 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.769
 do not take too much time here is the tree has 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.539
 pushed to the ground mocking you and then and 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.320
 well this tree has the particularity not 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.960
 not for his leaves 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.140
 but for these trunks to destroy the 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.570
 blocks and there we see that he destroyed the 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.539
 block so we can go back down you 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.750
 have managed to destroy the bay roof 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.500
 of rock 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.480
 and here we are here and here I hope that 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.160
 this little special will have you more than 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.690
 you can use this trick to 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.700
 go on the roof of an error and in 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.590
 go out solo or with your friends 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.090
 I tell you next time for a 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.090
 new episode jean roba lease
