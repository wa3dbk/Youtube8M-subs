00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.300
 hello friends hello youtube my name 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.410
 is thompson and welcome back to 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.649
 another issue of juba the 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.750
 cheers for the many Japanese cars 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.460
 and also some German sports cars 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.460
 have as the first time the little british 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.809
 namely, the lotus elias are with us 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.520
 111 it's my subscribing guitar hero 975 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.750
 he thought well now it will be 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.660
 slow time that you spend a bit here 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.130
 bring in change and as usual 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.020
 just take a look now 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.730
 on the car like he used to be at the dealership 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.640
 stood in funds settled in the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.829
 b category 435 the performance index 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.870
 mid-engine and rear-wheel drive 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.480
 is there at the start acceleration 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.890
 It's really fast-paced performance-wise 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:09.829
 116 kw 175 newton meters the whole on 806 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.909
 kilo sounds relatively harmless because has 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.350
 he goes well again what 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.780
 packed on the motor guest was 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.009
 thanks to rear-wheel drive left 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.540
 start accelerations again 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.470
 neatly won something 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.350
 Performance data 140 kw 211 newton meters 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.450
 the whole on 797 kilograms 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.549
 the engine howls its power 1 8 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.290
 liters of displacement still a few 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.400
 acceleration value from zero to one hundred 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.960
 45 seconds top speed 242 km 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.220
 H 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.580
 still a few small dates to that 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.960
 auto in itself the lotus ellis is added 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:48.440
 lotus since 1996 built this car what 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:53.930
 we here today belongs to the series 2 the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.909
 was built from 2000 to 2010 the engine 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.580
 under the hood so also squats in 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.000
 this case is a shell engine from the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.159
 year 2006 is due to the insolvency of 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.799
 rover toyota then jumped in 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.080
 squat toyota engines underneath 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.790
 a few values 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.190
 at the body because there is me 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.110
 some manager noticed lotus 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.850
 had to let a giant ship his 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.560
 maybe he has one of you too 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.180
 ever seen such things dinger 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.520
 but they are really funny you can see that 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.460
 yes already in the weight and that three 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.300
 meter 78 sounds harmless 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.980
 then a meter 71 wide so I think so 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.480
 if I make my poor wide I am 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.190
 just as wide as you are if you have the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.080
 arms wide makes as wide as high 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.630
 maybe because he did not know that and 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.790
 now comes the really crisp number 1 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:45.130
 14 meters high so the thing I feel up 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.090
 to the belly or so that's right 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.500
 flat flounder at lotus it is like that 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.250
 performance is not everything that must be easy 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.250
 be a car 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.400
 later came a compressor variant 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.959
 in the car to the 2 122 ps supplies 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.440
 But now he will give it to us 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.720
 car to tom stick some say if 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.830
 it gets cold, he wears under his helmet 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.390
 bobcap 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.160
 but as I said he knows the need of 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.790
 poor toms de goya squats he pulls already 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.050
 in it 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.640
 we are also in small here 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.050
 Roll cage because he has tomsic himself 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.510
 make it really small for the boy he is 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.680
 but a lot bigger than me 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.600
 he definitely has his place 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.800
 found here lighter with lighter 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.110
 Slip it forward 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.269
 and with lotus it is like that is one 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.040
 Middle engine the thing can be right 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.350
 Become really toxic now 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.480
 Look how she looks here on wilson 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.769
 cold mature cold hacker bit 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.690
 spongy he is on the way 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.790
 We are also very easily concluded 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.500
 but again fully on the gas on it 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.890
 is the whole of the outside cameras 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.200
 purely in chicago, let's see if here 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.670
 to see it again is luxe 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.770
 nothing is full on the gas again 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.390
 on it we also hear beautiful as the 1.8 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.150
 liter motor systematically upwards 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.790
 screwing performance is not everything 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.340
 the power-weight ratio is decisive 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.320
 so in hammerhead look something 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.120
 whether it is equal to the rwe on the 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.620
 steering there he has to correct now and then 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.000
 the car is not easy to handle 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.060
 I'm full on the gas again 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.550
 schlupp nix he takes the 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.560
 whole line herewith the whole width of the 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.519
 roadway he really uses everyone 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.440
 millimeters through full tour throughout 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.910
 performance gaps from the gas and the right and 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.989
 out no, everything is still in the green area 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.700
 all still good 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.830
 look ma or see quickly from the 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.930
 looks really fast also from the 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.240
 athletes I have to say for medium engine 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.800
 Dare is really really expensive so there 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.100
 we already dare to do it in the 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.820
 had had hands 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.950
 now it goes into gamble that is the 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.480
 last turn again early on the gas 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.430
 uses all the love over the body 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.260
 also over and there we are now 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.650
 over it and let's have a look 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.320
 what you think about times yes one 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.210
 minute would have surprised me now 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.380
 no freak or problem that's one 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.880
 direct competition in quotes 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:01.350
 one minute 23h this is really so 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:05.550
 fast as she looks and a minute 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:08.310
 23 794 and thus place one in the 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.440
 b-category there you have to gottfried yes 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.790
 Almost a second rausgeholt so 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.010
 drove out tom stick 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.090
 the car has tomsic reported in front of him 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.130
 but really as if on rails 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.740
 had been previously with joint with ehec 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.450
 very pleasant to drive as usual 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.340
 still a little overview how to 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.810
 time in the b category looks like i am 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.070
 also on request received from 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.410
 Immediately also the vehicles 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.620
 that in the kita on the one conflict 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.390
 the two and problem on the 3 but here 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.070
 a long time nothing I lost my're 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.790
 still at the beginning or thomas first 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.660
 look out 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.660
 until next time
