00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to hook into it again now not really

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.310 
to hook into it again now not really
ideal<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:06.450> did<00:01:06.600> want<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.930> remove<00:01:07.200> it

way<00:01:45.119> let's<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> ruler<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.399> see<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.729> how

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
way let's get a ruler and see just how

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.969 
way let's get a ruler and see just how
big<00:01:48.000> she<00:01:48.180> was<00:01:49.700> okay<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.729> I've<00:01:51.119> got<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> ruler

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
big she was okay so I've got a ruler

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.370 
big she was okay so I've got a ruler
placed<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.159> under<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.460> malt<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.110> as<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.229> can

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
placed it under the malt and as you can

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.420 
placed it under the malt and as you can
see<00:01:55.670> she<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.299> under<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.500> nine<00:01:59.250> inch

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
see she was just under the nine inch

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.230 
see she was just under the nine inch
mark<00:02:00.649> so<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> reckon<00:02:02.009> she's<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> good<00:02:02.520> 9<00:02:02.909> inches

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
mark so I reckon she's a good 9 inches

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.410 
mark so I reckon she's a good 9 inches
now<00:02:03.890> never<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.310> how<00:02:05.490> far<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:06.119> push

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
now never really know how far to push

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.930 
now never really know how far to push
the<00:02:06.840> legs<00:02:07.020> down<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.580> try<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:08.879> leave

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the legs down I like to try and leave

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.479 
the legs down I like to try and leave
them<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> more<00:02:09.509> natural<00:02:09.840> stance<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.370> get

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
them in a more natural stance so you get

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.440 
them in a more natural stance so you get
a<00:02:11.520> more<00:02:11.730> realistic<00:02:12.000> measurement

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
a more realistic measurement

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.660 
a more realistic measurement
what<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.810> actual<00:02:13.950> leg<00:02:14.950> span<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.400> spider

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
what the actual leg span of the spider

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.660 
what the actual leg span of the spider
is<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.470> guess<00:02:17.739> if<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.980> wanted<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.370> could

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
is so I guess if I wanted to I could

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.390 
is so I guess if I wanted to I could
push<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.569> legs<00:02:19.750> down<00:02:19.930> further<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.560> she<00:02:21.280> would

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
push the legs down further and she would

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.920 
push the legs down further and she would
definitely<00:02:21.519> be<00:02:22.060> able<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.330> reach<00:02:22.480> nine<00:02:22.810> inches

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
definitely be able to reach nine inches

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.229 
definitely be able to reach nine inches
the<00:02:25.930> molt<00:02:26.170> itself<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.860> still<00:02:27.069> very<00:02:27.519> soft<00:02:27.940> and

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
the molt itself is still very soft and

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.589 
the molt itself is still very soft and
if<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.230> wanted<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.920> could<00:02:30.340> try<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.300> glue<00:02:31.480> the

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
if I wanted to I could try and glue the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.229 
if I wanted to I could try and glue the
carapace<00:02:32.019> back<00:02:32.349> on<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:33.670> have<00:02:33.910> done<00:02:34.120> with

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
carapace back on like have done with

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.100 
carapace back on like have done with
previous<00:02:34.690> Mouse<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.200> stuff<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.130> abdomen<00:02:37.110> try

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
previous Mouse and stuff the abdomen try

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.220 
previous Mouse and stuff the abdomen try
and<00:02:38.230> make<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.560> look<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.890> lot<00:02:39.190> more<00:02:39.310> lifelike<00:02:39.549> but

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and make it look a lot more lifelike but

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.140 
and make it look a lot more lifelike but
if<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.349> did<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.980> would<00:02:42.280> get<00:02:42.580> covered<00:02:42.970> in

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
if I did that I would get covered in

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.039 
if I did that I would get covered in
these<00:02:43.510> hairs<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:45.299> when<00:02:46.299> I<00:02:46.360> did<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.540> last<00:02:46.750> time

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
these hairs and when I did it last time

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.890 
these hairs and when I did it last time
my<00:02:48.010> arms<00:02:48.430> were<00:02:48.610> completely<00:02:49.209> itching<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
my arms were completely itching for the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.199 
my arms were completely itching for the
next<00:02:50.140> two<00:02:50.260> or<00:02:50.380> three<00:02:50.410> days<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.880> don't<00:02:52.000> think

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
next two or three days and I don't think

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.080 
next two or three days and I don't think
it's<00:02:52.329> really<00:02:52.599> worth<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.110> suffering<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.970> to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
it's really worth the suffering just to

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.660 
it's really worth the suffering just to
try<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.299> stick<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.630> back<00:02:55.720> together<00:02:56.640> what<00:02:57.640> I
