00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.430 
DLC then it's probably going to take a
little<00:03:59.160> bit<00:03:59.400> longer<00:03:59.670> to<00:04:00.420> reproduce<00:04:01.140> those

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
little bit longer to reproduce those

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.190 
little bit longer to reproduce those
having<00:04:02.370> said<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.730> though<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.600> pole<00:04:03.840> was

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
having said that though the pole was

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.280 
having said that though the pole was
completed<00:04:04.920> back<00:04:05.100> in<00:04:05.400> January<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.209> think<00:04:06.660> and<00:04:06.900> we

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
completed back in January I think and we

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.199 
completed back in January I think and we
are<00:04:07.410> now<00:04:07.590> in<00:04:07.890> June<00:04:08.370> so<00:04:08.700> it's<00:04:08.850> entirely

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
are now in June so it's entirely

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.600 
are now in June so it's entirely
possible<00:04:09.600> that<00:04:10.140> they<00:04:10.590> are<00:04:10.739> well<00:04:11.100> into

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
possible that they are well into

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.280 
possible that they are well into
production<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.330> these<00:04:12.450> maps<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.050> they<00:04:13.110> have

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
production of these maps and they have

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.410 
production of these maps and they have
something<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.769> show<00:04:13.950> off<00:04:14.130> soon<00:04:14.430> it's<00:04:15.000> entirely

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
something to show off soon it's entirely

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.080 
something to show off soon it's entirely
possible<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:16.260> may<00:04:16.410> not<00:04:16.620> be<00:04:16.680> true<00:04:16.979> but<00:04:17.310> I'm<00:04:17.489> just

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
possible it may not be true but I'm just

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.000 
possible it may not be true but I'm just
going<00:04:18.450> on<00:04:18.570> what<00:04:18.630> we've<00:04:19.169> heard<00:04:19.350> before<00:04:19.590> and
