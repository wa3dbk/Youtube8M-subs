number four scowled era now this boss
isn't<00:02:50.069> hard<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.580> actually<00:02:50.970> kind<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.240> easy

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
isn't hard it's actually kind of easy

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.330 
isn't hard it's actually kind of easy
but<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.050> really<00:02:52.380> tricky<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.980> took<00:02:53.130> me

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
but it's really tricky and it took me

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.760 
but it's really tricky and it took me
two<00:02:53.640> tries<00:02:53.970> before<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.420> could<00:02:54.660> beat<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.870> here's

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
two tries before I could beat it here's

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.320 
two tries before I could beat it here's
the<00:02:55.830> trick<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.490> want<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.760> throw<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.970> bomb<00:02:57.150> at

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
the trick you want to throw a bomb at

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.699 
the trick you want to throw a bomb at
him<00:02:57.450> before<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.780> gets<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.050> top<00:02:58.320> that's

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
him before it gets to the top that's

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.020 
him before it gets to the top that's
where<00:02:58.830> people<00:02:58.950> usually<00:02:59.220> make<00:02:59.490> their<00:02:59.640> mistake

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
where people usually make their mistake

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.520 
where people usually make their mistake
they<00:03:00.060> wait<00:03:00.420> till<00:03:00.540> he<00:03:00.630> steps<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.050> bombs<00:03:01.320> at

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
they wait till he steps on the bombs at

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.199 
they wait till he steps on the bombs at
the<00:03:01.560> top<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:02.340> really<00:03:02.520> not<00:03:02.700> efficient

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
the top and it's really not efficient

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.940 
the top and it's really not efficient
and<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.540> can<00:03:03.720> get<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.080> boss<00:03:04.260> battle<00:03:04.770> done<00:03:04.920> a

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
and you can get the boss battle done a

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.410 
and you can get the boss battle done a
lot<00:03:05.190> quicker<00:03:05.370> if<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:05.910> throw<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.209> at<00:03:06.270> him

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
lot quicker if you just throw it at him

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.410 
lot quicker if you just throw it at him
while<00:03:06.570> he's<00:03:06.690> trying<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.020> climb<00:03:07.170> up

number<00:03:39.120> three<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:40.349> imprisoned

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.580 

now<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.360> first<00:03:45.660> time<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.900> fight<00:03:46.200> him<00:03:46.319> he's

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
now the first time you fight him he's

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.949 
now the first time you fight him he's
not<00:03:46.800> that<00:03:46.980> hard<00:03:47.280> but<00:03:48.150> Nintendo<00:03:48.330> thought<00:03:48.840> it

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
not that hard but Nintendo thought it

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.600 
not that hard but Nintendo thought it
was<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.110> good<00:03:49.349> idea<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.860> make<00:03:50.069> you<00:03:50.190> fight<00:03:50.459> him

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
was a good idea to make you fight him

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.210 
was a good idea to make you fight him
four<00:03:50.970> times<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.989> by<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.590> time<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.040> fourth

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
four times and by the time the fourth

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.490 
four times and by the time the fourth
time<00:03:53.489> you're<00:03:53.640> fighting<00:03:54.000> him<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.989> better<00:03:55.290> be

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
time you're fighting him you better be

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:04.309 
time you're fighting him you better be

prepared to run and run and run now at
first<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.739> concept<00:04:05.190> for<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.489> imprison<00:04:05.880> seems

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
first the concept for the imprison seems

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.880 
first the concept for the imprison seems
kind<00:04:06.300> of<00:04:06.360> tedious<00:04:06.569> doesn't<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.260> mean<00:04:07.650> having

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
kind of tedious doesn't it I mean having

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.410 
kind of tedious doesn't it I mean having
to<00:04:08.010> stun<00:04:08.250> him<00:04:08.280> with<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.610> groose<00:04:08.790> inator<00:04:09.150> and

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
to stun him with the groose inator and

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.540 
to stun him with the groose inator and
then<00:04:09.780> having<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.200> walk<00:04:10.500> up<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:10.920> break<00:04:11.280> all

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
then having to walk up and break all
