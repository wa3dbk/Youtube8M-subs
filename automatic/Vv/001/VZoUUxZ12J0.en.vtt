00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.700
 today design is one of the most important things 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.099
 important for a product does not matter 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.480
 if it's a plane drink 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.670
 of a lamp or a car 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.650
 indeed for the car a pretty good line 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.080
 design and the most important quality of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.570
 all think what a shock it was when it came out 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.250
 the citroen ds beh at a distance of tens 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.750
 years of design still manages to amaze 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.399
 just like we were amazed 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.940
 when we saw it for the first time 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.770
 the ds5 without a doubt is also the one where 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.079
 the new stylistic spirit is 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.079
 expressed in the most complete and conspicuous way 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.940
 let's watch it for good from a standstill as before 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.879
 what because the movement many details 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.190
 go more unnoticed is 4 meters long 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.399
 and 53 and just a little higher than the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.989
 usual sedans one meter and 51 also the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.879
 driving position is a little higher than the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.100
 usual just enough for 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.199
 improve visibility and recreate 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.400
 inside a feeling of security 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.560
 and well-being 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.390
 the bodywork is two- volume with 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.970
 tailgate with little shape 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.250
 usual it gives access to a cargo compartment 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.299
 rather profound than according to ours 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.130
 data has a useful volume of 440 liters a 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.229
 discrete capacity for the category 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.890
 the only drawback is to be a little 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.890
 infossato 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.340
 and there is also forgetfulness but where it is 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.210
 finished the cup to open the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.230
 trunk from the outside there is only on 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.820
 TV remote 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.820
 but if you left the keys in the car 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.380
 the rest of the bodywork is a triumph 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.150
 of lines that follow unexpected curves 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.950
 chrome plating that extend from the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.330
 windshield to the front headlights 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.270
 frame the drains that 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.010
 highlight the doors light cuts 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.790
 decided for the headlights in front and 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.530
 behind is a long black crystal that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.650
 extension to the windshield to cover the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.650
 roof 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.490
 well let's say that in the midst of traffic not 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.020
 it can be confused with no other and not 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.020
 certainly goes unnoticed 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.849
 and the streets of Milan with theirs 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.090
 stone slabs bring out 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.859
 just one of the limits of the ds5 le 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.840
 suspensions the rear ones in 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:33.750
 particularly they are allergic to 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.030
 short and dry bumps but hardly 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.159
 out of critical areas as soon as the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.290
 the road back to normal also comes out 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.620
 the best quality typically citroen 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.719
 comfort is a well distributed comfort 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.269
 on various aspects as if the French house 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.510
 had analyzed all of them one by one 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.680
 pampering that you could wish for 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.930
 from the climate control system 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.700
 micrometer to the sound insulation of the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.079
 engine from the brightness of the passenger compartment 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.299
 to the fidelity of this audio system 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.870
 version of the ds5 is the most refined e 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.730
 expensive mounts a 1600 hdi of 163 horses 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.000
 and the automatic gearbox which is an option 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.599
 costs 38 thousand and 800 euros 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.969
 and his numbers are ten and thirteen 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.959
 what are 10 of what miles it is 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:23.299
 they do with a liter of diesel 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.299
 respectively in the city ​​and on the motorway 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.670
 the exchange rate is six-speed 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.040
 it doesn't go wrong even if it certainly doesn't 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.409
 a sporting soul also using the 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.010
 manual shifting gear steps not 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.870
 they are never immediate yet at ds5 not 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.000
 sorry to be guided in joy 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.709
 you have to be a little used to 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.200
 driving position which is slightly 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.069
 Offset it is cut into the steering wheel 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.019
 low part as on sports cars 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.170
 the trim is soft at the right point 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.030
 roll is noticeable but it is never excessive 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.560
 steering that has a slightly absent feeling 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.180
 in the neutral zone 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.370
 improves with increasing angle 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.370
 gaining in readiness and precision 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.449
 in short, we really can't complain 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.770
 precise silence guide on board e 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.960
 welcoming atmosphere 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.470
 you looked as good as they are 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.470
 interior 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.889
 here too the designer's pencil has 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.990
 could have indulged in freedom a 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.030
 Unlike other models 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.659
 two-dimensional the ds5 to a cockpit that 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.099
 takes you and wraps you all around 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:49.080
 in short, the car does not end there on 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.819
 dashboard but continues backwards with 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.979
 this long tunnel the push-button panels 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:56.729
 suspended from the ceiling the storage compartments 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:59.159
 airplane style and there's also a lot of place 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.710
 placed on the back seats especially for 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.590
 legs in four you really travel 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.199
 in a living room a panoramic living room 3 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.240
 all as an option you can have this 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.009
 transparent roof that even one 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.120
 individual curtain for the driver and 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.949
 the passenger 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.949
 to each his own little piece of heaven 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:22.500
 being beautiful having a style you know is not 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.599
 from everyone and some is not even free 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.300
 compromise must always be done in 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.610
 this case with ergonomics this forest 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.820
 of buttons is not the best for pecking 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.530
 one key at first sight 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.630
 the measure is the right one nor too much 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.389
 big and out nor too small inside 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.310
 is traveling makes you feel good for hours 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.960
 she really does not lack style in 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.820
 some points there is even a little 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.949
 too much but also of her 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.180
 right and goddess in the sixties 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.650
 someone had said 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.650
 this car is too far ahead
