00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
everything I could possibly think of and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it to and it was just a nightmare and if

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.670 
it to and it was just a nightmare and if
this<00:01:41.850> thing<00:01:42.060> had<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> tail<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.470> computer

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
this thing had a tail if this computer

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.359 
this thing had a tail if this computer
had<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> tail<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.210> would<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.780> grabbed<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.470> spun

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
had a tail I would have grabbed it spun

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.340 
had a tail I would have grabbed it spun
around<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.939> bunch<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.270> times<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.049> let<00:01:49.320> go

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
around a bunch of times and just let go

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.310 
around a bunch of times and just let go
and<00:01:49.590> shadow<00:01:50.630> into<00:01:51.630> whatever<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.079> was<00:01:52.170> gonna

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
and shadow into whatever it was gonna

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
and shadow into whatever it was gonna
fuckin<00:01:52.680> run<00:01:52.829> into<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.909> close<00:01:54.119> good

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
fuckin run into it was that close good

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.109 
fuckin run into it was that close good
thing<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.750> didn't<00:01:55.229> install<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> tail<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.729> PC

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
thing I didn't install a tail on this PC

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.630 
thing I didn't install a tail on this PC
and<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.380> actually<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.369> thought<00:01:59.490> of

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and it actually I just thought of

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.789 
and it actually I just thought of
something<00:01:59.840> what<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:00.990> took<00:02:01.140> what<00:02:01.649> if<00:02:01.740> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
something what if you took what if you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.200 
something what if you took what if you
took<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.040> computer<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.579> bear<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:02.939> me<00:02:03.030> for<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
took up computer at bear with me for a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.010 
took up computer at bear with me for a
second<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:03.570> what<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.840> took<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
second but if what if you took a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.410 
second but if what if you took a
computer<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:05.250> put<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> little<00:02:05.640> tail<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.060> it

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
computer and you put a little tail on it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.930 
computer and you put a little tail on it
and<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.590> gave<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> ears<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> front

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and then you gave it ears on the front

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.210 
and then you gave it ears on the front
and<00:02:09.119> put<00:02:09.360> whiskers<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.020> front<00:02:10.259> too<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.129> it

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and put whiskers on the front too so it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.820 
and put whiskers on the front too so it
was<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.520> giant<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:12.270> Mouse<00:02:12.620> know

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
was like a giant like Mouse know

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.160 
was like a giant like Mouse know
pretty<00:02:13.950> funny<00:02:14.160> wouldn't<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.630> might<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.810> just

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
pretty funny wouldn't it might is just

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.810 
pretty funny wouldn't it might is just
totally<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.800> inaccurate<00:02:17.340> but<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.580> not

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
totally just inaccurate but that not

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.980 
totally just inaccurate but that not
probably<00:02:18.060> wouldn't<00:02:18.270> be<00:02:18.330> funny<00:02:18.510> at<00:02:18.660> all<00:02:18.750> her<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
probably wouldn't be funny at all her I

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.620 
probably wouldn't be funny at all her I
forget<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.430> but<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.700> computer<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.360> currently

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
forget it but the computer is currently

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.540 
forget it but the computer is currently
being<00:02:22.020> fixed<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.650> gonna<00:02:22.860> be<00:02:23.040> fine<00:02:23.310> and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.590 
place I just got some I don't even money
I<00:04:26.430> might<00:04:26.610> even<00:04:26.700> have<00:04:26.910> gotten<00:04:27.150> one<00:04:27.270> in<00:04:27.360> this

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
I might even have gotten one in this

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.300 
I might even have gotten one in this
you<00:04:27.750> know<00:04:28.170> if<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.380> if<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:28.650> show<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.980> death<00:04:29.130> or<00:04:29.280> not

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
you know if I if I show the death or not

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.030 
you know if I if I show the death or not
and<00:04:29.670> I<00:04:30.150> think<00:04:30.480> they've<00:04:30.690> been<00:04:30.720> dropping<00:04:31.320> for<00:04:31.350> a

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
and I think they've been dropping for a

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.160 
and I think they've been dropping for a
little<00:04:32.310> over<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.520> week<00:04:32.820> I<00:04:33.060> think<00:04:33.330> December<00:04:33.750> 6th

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
little over a week I think December 6th

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.630 
little over a week I think December 6th
is<00:04:34.320> when<00:04:34.470> they<00:04:34.590> were<00:04:34.680> added<00:04:35.010> so<00:04:35.190> like<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.430> week

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
is when they were added so like a week

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.550 
is when they were added so like a week
in<00:04:35.760> a<00:04:35.820> few<00:04:36.000> days<00:04:36.150> since<00:04:36.600> they<00:04:36.960> have<00:04:37.320> been

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
in a few days since they have been

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.850 
in a few days since they have been
dropping<00:04:37.890> but<00:04:38.760> what<00:04:38.940> this<00:04:39.090> means<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:40.650> initial

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
dropping but what this means the initial

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.530 
dropping but what this means the initial
hypothesis<00:04:41.670> that<00:04:41.910> we<00:04:42.030> are<00:04:42.150> gonna<00:04:42.240> be<00:04:42.420> getting

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
hypothesis that we are gonna be getting

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.750 
hypothesis that we are gonna be getting
three<00:04:43.050> updates<00:04:43.320> in<00:04:43.770> three<00:04:44.220> months<00:04:44.580> is

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
three updates in three months is

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.970 
three updates in three months is
actually<00:04:45.720> potentially<00:04:46.020> going<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.560> come<00:04:46.740> true

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
actually potentially going to come true

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.340 
actually potentially going to come true
so<00:04:47.460> we<00:04:47.820> are<00:04:48.000> probably<00:04:48.330> going<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.990> see<00:04:49.200> the

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
so we are probably going to see the

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.710 
so we are probably going to see the
holiday<00:04:49.860> Christmas<00:04:50.850> miss<00:04:51.120> miss<00:04:51.360> whatever<00:04:51.630> you
