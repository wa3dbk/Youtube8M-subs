00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.430
 This is the question the Belorizonts have been asking since last week when 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.980
 the former chief minister of the civil house dilma rousseff 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.880
 he lived in an interview that the daily average 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.640
 it was clear in saying that there is no known project at the federal level 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.069
 to the Belo Horizonte subway 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.060
 the mayor is telling me precisely 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.200
 of this project now the country is at their discretion because we are 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.170
 now opening in april 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.590
 will last from April to June the process of selection to and present project 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.210
 why these investments and we think it is fundamental because 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.670
 We are prioritizing the metropolitan region. 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.539
 because 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.990
 was in the metropolitan regions 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.520
 investments in Brazil created the biggest problems on this 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.620
 subject nobody better than josé lucio group 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.229
 already the superintendent of the myth of cbtu time 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.870
 to give us an answer 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.100
 after imbroglio 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.840
 the people want to know I will not not projects for subway expansion 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.750
 since we are talking about the last World Cup in 2014 and this should be a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.990
 the priorities is certainly the former Minister Dilma 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.130
 referred to the definitive project of line 2 that three is complete 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.220
 the truck and has already been defined 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.280
 this line from the west and the barreiro to the hospitals of creek 3 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.670
 Pampulha Wallista was dancing to the local while the minister fourteen million 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.869
 for the conclusion of this skolkovo project the contract with the designer company was 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.680
 resumed 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.740
 and an observation must be made 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.100
 here in the barrier section until the caulk is the same as the barrier there is one hundred 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 project 30 years ago by the original subway project 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.670
 this slice is already segregated, several appropriations were then made 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 for the World Cup would be possible to allocate resources needed to 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.549
 fit within 30 years ago do not make any some budget 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.129
 but I believe that for the world cup I would give you adjusted project including 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.430
 do the works I give of this stretch of surface that the other prisoners 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.729
 underground trains that are the subject of the contract that I 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.110
 would take longer and maybe this is 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.769
 but what is the timeline? 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.510
 what we talk a lot the project can do is possible 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.580
 It will work out better 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.580
 at the time of kicking the goal does not appear the attacker 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:47.169
 in fact the federal government occurs in the pac 2 of mobility 18 billion and even 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:52.399
 which was not opened in the account but we do not know about the 18 billion 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.410
 with this question 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.009
 if we stop, but for beautiful horizon 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.159
 so we can not say the cut or they will have to give the goal 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.629
 that I can say that technically if there are resources of the order of less than 1 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.909
 billion of 700 million can make line 2 of the 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.939
 with there are also substations up to the world cup plus time urges 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.169
 said if there is a vote on the refusals for just this year's entry 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:23.679
 project start the immediate works and quotes what is the deadline to finalize 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.669
 sound of the projects of presentation of the disc 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.479
 so that we can have at least an idea of ​​when this project work 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:35.359
 completed and the fault the term has taken shape the contract of 20 three more months 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.699
 we play in practice but let's try 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.930
 the press the track designer in a maximum of 12 months of experience 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:42.519
 course 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.929
 at - designed finished 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:49.769
 he would say team back to the barreiros stretch would be easier than it is a 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.899
 project is not part of this disagreement of this agreement and may be 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:59.209
 adjusted if there is political will and the gas pipeline thanks to the 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.789
 at the age of 12 he is the superintendent of cbtu 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.520
 here are less days reporter carla rodeiro 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:09.079
 more than 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.959
 two years, itatiaia organized several meetings for the sole purpose of 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:14.809
 to discover 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:16.529
 exactly 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.099
 How many steps are there? 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.300
 expansion of our natal 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.300
 representatives of Bega attended the meetings 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.270
 secretary of state for transportation 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.080
 be yourself or the mayor 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.930
 of the community of federal deputies 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.469
 state councilors 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:44.279
 from the first moment it became clear that the purpose was only to discover 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:49.450
 where was the expansion of our subway 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.300
 that's what they needed to come 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.409
 the allocations of funds the projects the biddings of works it 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:04.599
 works illustrating this uncomfortable situation 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.270
 several years ago 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.300
 of a subway that is just a subway subway that does not grow 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.020
 meets the needs of the city and much less the metropolitan region 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.879
 how it should be 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.309
 Very well. 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.309
 we got nowhere 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.759
 only projections own pretensions 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:29.800
 opponents 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.340
 promises dreams dreams 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.080
 speeches 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.029
 and nothing else 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:40.629
 came the reality of which has with her 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.110
 the realization that a beautiful horizon would have to run with his mentor to 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.259
 be one of the headquarters 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.749
 from the 2014 World Cup 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:50.849
 that 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.479
 Leveraging our subway 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:54.770
 finally 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.330
 at least they were 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.300
 what was thought 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.220
 why until the last of the meetings that we did the only thing that 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.660
 we can even discover here the expansion of our mentor walks 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:14.020
 immersed in immense doubts in several controversies and to complete is 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.360
 that's what we just heard 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.389
 the subway may 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:27.440
 could it be who quit maybe we'll see let's cheer let's wait with a little 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.719
 of political will can be 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:35.129
 most probably undoubtedly we should have 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.689
 who knows 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.069
 There is only one definite thing 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.620
 combined I decided to resort to 0 only one concrete thing 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.860
 rest assured that 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.900
 the expansion of the breathalyzer 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.770
 it's a lot of 1,700 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.160
 just like the ones with the meetings we did 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.850
 full of hope for a referral a 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.559
 something that has dragged on for decades 

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:06.559
 and does not leave the plane of the assumptions 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.059
 in between 

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:11.529
 Have a good day, everyone.
