there<00:01:21.600> underneath<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> blue<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> be

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
there underneath the blue one to be

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.609 
there underneath the blue one to be
specific<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.790> let's<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.259> there's<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
specific there is a let's that there's a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.230 
specific there is a let's that there's a
there's<00:01:25.830> four<00:01:26.040> chests<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.820> pressure<00:01:27.090> plate

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
there's four chests and a pressure plate

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
there's four chests and a pressure plate
and<00:01:27.540> underneath<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.530> fresh<00:01:28.799> plate<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.280> I

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and underneath that fresh plate and I

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.859 
and underneath that fresh plate and I
think<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.939> might<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.119> able<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> guess<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.780> if

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
think you might be able to guess and if

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.149 
think you might be able to guess and if
you<00:01:30.960> can't<00:01:31.170> guess<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.590> you'll<00:01:31.740> find<00:01:32.009> out

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
you can't guess then you'll find out

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.460 
you can't guess then you'll find out
very<00:01:32.189> shortly<00:01:32.509> as<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.869> logzilla<00:01:34.049> when

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
very shortly as you see it logzilla when

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.190 
very shortly as you see it logzilla when
I<00:01:34.530> destroy<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> blue<00:01:35.070> block<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.430> no<00:01:35.520> reason<00:01:36.200> p

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
I destroy the blue block for no reason p

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.149 
I destroy the blue block for no reason p
as<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.470> see<00:01:37.590> down<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:37.950> there's<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
as you can see down there there's a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.210 
as you can see down there there's a
pressure<00:01:38.310> plate<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.640> fort<00:01:39.049> chests<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.229> as<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
pressure plate in fort chests and as you

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
pressure plate in fort chests and as you
can<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.579> bore<00:01:41.759> chests<00:01:42.150> contain<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:43.170> very

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
can see the bore chests contain not very

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.450 
can see the bore chests contain not very
interesting<00:01:43.710> things<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.159> they're<00:01:44.280> different

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
interesting things but they're different

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.249 
interesting things but they're different
to<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> man<00:01:45.240> my<00:01:45.390> job<00:01:45.600> chest<00:01:45.869> they<00:01:45.990> usually

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
to like a man my job chest they usually

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.289 
to like a man my job chest they usually
have<00:01:46.380> mob<00:01:46.710> drops<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.460> well<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.700> potential<00:01:48.149> for

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
have mob drops as well as potential for

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.749 
have mob drops as well as potential for
iron<00:01:48.509> bars<00:01:48.720> gold<00:01:49.110> bars<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.890> sometimes<00:01:50.610> in

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
iron bars gold bars and sometimes in

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.880 
iron bars gold bars and sometimes in
diamonds<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.390> they<00:01:51.540> they're<00:01:51.930> quite<00:01:52.170> cool<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
diamonds so they they're quite cool and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.050 
diamonds so they they're quite cool and
as<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.790> well<00:01:53.939> as

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
as you can see this is well as

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.550 
as you can see this is well as
underneath<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> pressure<00:01:54.780> plate<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.409> did

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
underneath the pressure plate if you did

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.649 
underneath the pressure plate if you did
not<00:01:55.590> guess<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.969> you're<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> don't

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
not guess and if you're if you don't

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.609 
not guess and if you're if you don't
know<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:57.810> you're<00:01:57.899> doing<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> land<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
know what you're doing and you land it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.630 
know what you're doing and you land it
wrong<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:58.979> has<00:01:59.130> happened<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.460> me<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.610> my

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
let's head back to the surface and try

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.650 
let's head back to the surface and try
and<00:02:26.730> find<00:02:26.880> ourselves<00:02:27.060> from<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.540> other

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
and find ourselves from the other

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.060 
and find ourselves from the other
structures<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.260> one's<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.710> little<00:02:28.830> less

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
structures this one's a little less

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.640 
structures this one's a little less
relevant<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:30.000> one<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:31.170> desert<00:02:31.380> well

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
relevant and this one is the desert well

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.070 
relevant and this one is the desert well
and<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.730> little<00:02:33.210> bit<00:02:33.300> rare<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.780> 1<00:02:33.960> in

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
and it's a little bit rare it's a 1 in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.350 
and it's a little bit rare it's a 1 in
1,000<00:02:34.740> chance<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.340> spawn<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> chunk<00:02:36.120> which

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
1,000 chance to spawn on a chunk which

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.330 
1,000 chance to spawn on a chunk which
means<00:02:36.660> they're<00:02:37.440> at<00:02:37.560> their<00:02:37.680> incredibly<00:02:38.100> rare

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
means they're at their incredibly rare

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.430 
means they're at their incredibly rare
basically<00:02:38.670> 100,000<00:02:39.420> chance<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.810> chunk<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.140> 16

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
basically 100,000 chance the chunk is 16

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.800 
basically 100,000 chance the chunk is 16
by<00:02:40.560> 16<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:41.190> can<00:02:41.220> do<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.820> basic<00:02:42.270> math<00:02:42.510> there

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
by 16 you can do the basic math there

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.980 
by 16 you can do the basic math there
and<00:02:43.680> basically<00:02:44.490> they're<00:02:44.990> somewhat

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
and basically they're somewhat

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.140 
and basically they're somewhat
interesting<00:02:46.500> there<00:02:46.830> we're<00:02:47.580> not<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:47.910> some

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
interesting there we're not really some

interesting they're just they're just a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.140 
interesting they're just they're just a
site<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.860> see<00:02:50.070> them<00:02:50.250> you're<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.790> oh<00:02:50.940> that's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
site you see them you're like oh that's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.080 
site you see them you're like oh that's
rare<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.660> then<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.840> sort<00:02:52.020> move<00:02:52.230> on<00:02:52.380> um

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
rare and then you sort move on um

rare and then you sort move on um
they're<00:02:54.090> at<00:02:54.180> their<00:02:54.300> breakaway<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.810> get<00:02:54.990> water

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
they're at their breakaway to get water

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.080 
they're at their breakaway to get water
in<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.470> desert<00:02:55.620> if<00:02:55.980> although<00:02:56.640> water<00:02:56.880> does

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
in the desert if although water does

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.520 
in the desert if although water does
spawn<00:02:57.390> naturally<00:02:57.630> anyway<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.320> if<00:02:58.380> you're

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
spawn naturally anyway but if you're

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.020 
spawn naturally anyway but if you're
just<00:02:58.650> going<00:02:58.890> really<00:02:59.190> long<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.850> need

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
just going really long and you need

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.300 
just going really long and you need
water<00:03:00.210> web<00:03:00.510> reason<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.800> obviously<00:03:02.160> don't

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
water web reason you obviously don't

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.740 
water web reason you obviously don't
need<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.550> hydrate<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.030> ruin<00:03:03.210> crop<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.420> badly

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
need to hydrate and ruin crop that badly

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.810 
need to hydrate and ruin crop that badly
then<00:03:03.930> there's<00:03:04.290> an<00:03:04.470> infinite<00:03:04.680> source<00:03:05.040> he's<00:03:05.400> 11

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
then there's an infinite source he's 11

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.640 
then there's an infinite source he's 11
teresting<00:03:06.090> infinite<00:03:06.450> source<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.840> designs

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
teresting infinite source that designs

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.410 
teresting infinite source that designs
as<00:03:07.830> well<00:03:07.860> which<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.190> quite<00:03:08.760> Quinn<00:03:08.970> my<00:03:09.120> opinion

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
as well which is quite Quinn my opinion

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.240 
as well which is quite Quinn my opinion
the<00:03:09.570> well<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.200> villages<00:03:10.530> don't<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.070> they

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
the well in the villages don't and they

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.400 
the well in the villages don't and they
do<00:03:11.310> but<00:03:12.150> if<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.270> just<00:03:12.480> take<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.080> outside

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
do but if you just take the outside

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.930 
do but if you just take the outside
blocks<00:03:13.680> then<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.040> middle<00:03:14.250> one<00:03:14.400> then<00:03:14.670> they

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
blocks then the middle one then they

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.030 
blocks then the middle one then they
just<00:03:15.240> disappear<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.900> that's<00:03:16.080> fun<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.500> guess<00:03:16.830> oh

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
just disappear and that's fun I guess oh

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.949 
just disappear and that's fun I guess oh
yeah<00:03:17.490> that's<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.790> desert<00:03:18.090> world<00:03:18.240> not<00:03:18.630> too

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
yeah that's the desert world not too

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.229 
yeah that's the desert world not too
much<00:03:19.050> going<00:03:19.380> on<00:03:19.470> for<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.800> but<00:03:20.040> it's<00:03:20.400> it's<00:03:20.910> it's

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
much going on for it but it's it's it's

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.430 
much going on for it but it's it's it's
a<00:03:21.300> sight<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.690> see<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.989> see<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.350> you're

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
a sight to see you see it and you're

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.810 
a sight to see you see it and you're
like<00:03:22.470> oh<00:03:22.739> that's<00:03:23.010> cool<00:03:23.310> when<00:03:23.459> they<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.670> move

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
like oh that's cool when they you move

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.449 
like oh that's cool when they you move
on<00:03:23.970> also<00:03:24.780> coming<00:03:24.989> on<00:03:25.140> 1.2<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:25.920> next<00:03:26.190> we<00:03:26.340> have

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
on also coming on 1.2 so next we have

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.910 
on also coming on 1.2 so next we have
the<00:03:26.520> jungle<00:03:27.090> temple<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:28.110> jungle<00:03:28.410> temple<00:03:28.560> is

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
the jungle temple the jungle temple is

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.920 
the jungle temple the jungle temple is
bound<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.610> jungle<00:03:30.030> biomes<00:03:30.330> obviously<00:03:30.780> that's

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
bound in jungle biomes obviously that's

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.090 
bound in jungle biomes obviously that's
where<00:03:31.050> it's<00:03:31.140> called<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> jungle<00:03:31.620> temple<00:03:31.770> and

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
where it's called a jungle temple and

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.880 
where it's called a jungle temple and
it's<00:03:32.670> basically<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.150> similar<00:03:33.720> concept<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
it's basically a similar concept to the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.160 
it's basically a similar concept to the
desert<00:03:35.850> temple<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:36.420> instead<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.750> being<00:03:37.050> like

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
desert temple but instead of being like

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.680 
desert temple but instead of being like
a<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:38.070> know<00:03:38.100> copy<00:03:38.430> paste<00:03:38.730> or<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.480> in<00:03:39.600> a

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
a you know copy paste or just in a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.030 
a you know copy paste or just in a
different<00:03:39.780> biome<00:03:40.200> like<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.650> embassy

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
different biome like the embassy

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.949 
different biome like the embassy
villagers<00:03:41.370> doing<00:03:41.640> different<00:03:41.880> biomes<00:03:42.090> ashley

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
villagers doing different biomes ashley

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.750 
villagers doing different biomes ashley
is<00:03:43.020> a<00:03:43.080> full-on<00:03:43.320> different<00:03:43.709> design<00:03:44.310> different

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
is a full-on different design different

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.400 
is a full-on different design different
everything<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.450> especially<00:03:45.900> one<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.230> first

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
everything and especially one the first

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.560 
everything and especially one the first
generated<00:03:47.400> structures<00:03:47.580> that<00:03:47.880> uses<00:03:48.150> redstone

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
generated structures that uses redstone

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.780 
generated structures that uses redstone
it's<00:03:48.780> actually<00:03:49.050> quite<00:03:49.200> interesting<00:03:49.790> so

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
it's actually quite interesting so

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.190 
it's actually quite interesting so
they're<00:03:51.150> low<00:03:51.270> hard<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.600> see<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.900> jungle

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
they're low hard to see in the jungle

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.720 
they're low hard to see in the jungle
though<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.440> can<00:03:52.680> obviously<00:03:53.100> when<00:03:53.520> you<00:03:53.610> see

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
though you can obviously when you see

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.490 
though you can obviously when you see
the<00:03:53.850> cobblestone<00:03:54.270> you'll<00:03:54.870> be<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.110> oh<00:03:55.230> there

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
the cobblestone you'll be that oh there

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.140 
the cobblestone you'll be that oh there
is<00:03:55.709> there<00:03:56.459> actually<00:03:56.700> another<00:03:56.880> way<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.030> get

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
is there actually another way to get

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.610 
is there actually another way to get
more<00:03:57.330> stone<00:03:57.630> over<00:03:57.840> than<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.140> mob<00:03:58.350> spawners

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
more stone over than the mob spawners

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.410 
more stone over than the mob spawners
which<00:03:58.890> is<00:03:59.070> nice<00:03:59.340> because<00:03:59.940> as<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.270> can<00:04:00.300> see

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
which is nice because as you can see

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.449 
which is nice because as you can see
every<00:04:00.870> now<00:04:00.989> very<00:04:01.350> few<00:04:01.500> blocks<00:04:01.770> is<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.010> mossy

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
every now very few blocks is a mossy

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.580 
every now very few blocks is a mossy
cobblestone<00:04:02.880> oh<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.959> if<00:04:04.050> you're<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.260> sort<00:04:04.500> of

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
cobblestone oh so if you're the sort of

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.800 
cobblestone oh so if you're the sort of
person<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:05.010> collects<00:04:05.520> that<00:04:05.730> then<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.360> guess

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
person that collects that then I guess

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.340 
person that collects that then I guess
well<00:04:07.590> that's<00:04:08.400> cool<00:04:08.910> guys<00:04:09.810> no<00:04:09.959> no<00:04:10.140> I've<00:04:10.260> never

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
well that's cool guys no no I've never

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.900 
well that's cool guys no no I've never
seen<00:04:10.530> any<00:04:10.650> purpose<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.190> using<00:04:11.370> milestone<00:04:11.790> but

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
seen any purpose of using milestone but

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.550 
seen any purpose of using milestone but
yeah<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.150> jungle<00:04:12.930> temple<00:04:13.049> was<00:04:13.290> there<00:04:13.380> coming

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
yeah the jungle temple was there coming

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.729 
yeah the jungle temple was there coming
one<00:04:13.680> point<00:04:13.859> along<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.280> desert<00:04:14.519> temples<00:04:15.739> they

really<00:04:17.280> different<00:04:17.580> stairs<00:04:17.760> temples<00:04:18.150> as<00:04:18.240> you

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
really different stairs temples as you

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.730 
really different stairs temples as you
can<00:04:18.420> see<00:04:18.630> they<00:04:18.840> do<00:04:18.900> obviously<00:04:19.260> they<00:04:19.560> won't

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:19.740 
can see they do obviously they won't

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.220 
can see they do obviously they won't
when<00:04:20.010> it's<00:04:20.160> go<00:04:20.280> for<00:04:20.460> a<00:04:20.490> different<00:04:20.880> idea<00:04:21.840> and

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
when it's go for a different idea and

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.620 
when it's go for a different idea and
then<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.560> inside<00:04:22.920> I'm<00:04:23.700> just<00:04:23.850> waited<00:04:24.240> me<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.510> go

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
then the inside I'm just waited me to go

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.600 
then the inside I'm just waited me to go
inside<00:04:24.990> because<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.350> lived<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.070> outsides<00:04:26.400> it

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
inside because I lived the outsides it

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.650 
inside because I lived the outsides it
is<00:04:26.700> actually<00:04:26.850> really<00:04:27.060> interesting<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.570> look

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
is actually really interesting to look

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.890 
is actually really interesting to look
at<00:04:27.780> structure<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:30.300> I'd<00:04:30.390> fill<00:04:30.540> out<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.630> gold

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
at structure so I'd fill out a gold

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.320 
at structure so I'd fill out a gold
sword<00:04:31.260> so<00:04:31.500> we<00:04:31.590> can<00:04:31.710> go<00:04:31.860> in<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:32.490> be<00:04:32.880> prepared

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
sword so we can go in and be prepared

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.300 
sword so we can go in and be prepared
diamond<00:04:33.900> swords<00:04:34.200> better<00:04:34.410> but<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.770> gold<00:04:35.010> sword

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
diamond swords better but the gold sword

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.190 
diamond swords better but the gold sword
it's<00:04:35.910> just<00:04:36.830> better<00:04:37.830> and<00:04:38.480> looks<00:04:39.480> I<00:04:39.840> don't<00:04:40.140> know

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
it's just better and looks I don't know

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.870 
it's just better and looks I don't know
everyone<00:04:40.590> cause<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:40.830> but<00:04:40.980> a<00:04:41.010> sword<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:41.490> I

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
everyone cause that but a sword and I

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.010 
everyone cause that but a sword and I
think<00:04:42.090> that's<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.390> little<00:04:42.510> silly<00:04:42.810> in<00:04:42.900> my

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
think that's a little silly in my

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.500 
think that's a little silly in my
opinion<00:04:43.230> because<00:04:43.470> it's<00:04:44.040> not<00:04:44.610> really<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> butter

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
opinion because it's not really a butter

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.620 
opinion because it's not really a butter
sort<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.400> know<00:04:47.400> understood<00:04:47.820> who<00:04:48.030> just<00:04:48.270> saw

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
some pigs just nearby I don't know

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.900 
some pigs just nearby I don't know
that's<00:06:04.950> coincidental<00:06:05.310> or<00:06:05.460> not<00:06:05.610> but<00:06:05.730> basically

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
that's coincidental or not but basically

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.880 
that's coincidental or not but basically
the<00:06:06.060> witch<00:06:06.180> hut<00:06:06.390> is<00:06:06.540> one<00:06:06.780> of<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:06.930> only<00:06:07.350> ways<00:06:07.620> to

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
the witch hut is one of the only ways to

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.350 
the witch hut is one of the only ways to
come<00:06:08.100> across<00:06:08.250> the<00:06:08.430> witch<00:06:08.580> I<00:06:08.760> think<00:06:09.090> it's<00:06:09.210> the

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
come across the witch I think it's the

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
come across the witch I think it's the
only<00:06:09.390> way<00:06:09.720> to<00:06:09.780> come<00:06:09.930> across<00:06:10.080> the<00:06:10.230> witch<00:06:10.350> from

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
only way to come across the witch from

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.850 
only way to come across the witch from
our<00:06:10.560> spawn<00:06:10.800> eggs<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:12.140> there<00:06:13.140> once<00:06:13.620> again<00:06:13.830> a

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
our spawn eggs and there once again a

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.290 
our spawn eggs and there once again a
rare<00:06:14.250> structure<00:06:14.640> that<00:06:14.730> only<00:06:14.880> generated

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
rare structure that only generated

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.270 
rare structure that only generated
swamps<00:06:15.780> so<00:06:15.960> every<00:06:16.230> little<00:06:16.500> you<00:06:16.770> know<00:06:16.890> by<00:06:17.100> his

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
swamps so every little you know by his

swamps so every little you know by his
gang<00:06:17.460> sewn<00:06:17.730> unique<00:06:18.060> structure<00:06:18.360> here<00:06:18.600> as<00:06:19.290> you

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
gang sewn unique structure here as you

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.940 
gang sewn unique structure here as you
can<00:06:19.470> slowly<00:06:19.830> see<00:06:20.070> these<00:06:20.280> come<00:06:20.460> in<00:06:20.490> 1.4<00:06:21.150> and

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
can slowly see these come in 1.4 and

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.500 
can slowly see these come in 1.4 and
basically<00:06:22.950> inside<00:06:23.340> their<00:06:23.820> bond<00:06:24.030> places<00:06:24.390> where

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
basically inside their bond places where

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.270 
basically inside their bond places where
which<00:06:24.660> consumed<00:06:25.050> as<00:06:25.200> i<00:06:25.290> said<00:06:25.500> but<00:06:25.710> mine<00:06:25.980> didn't

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
which consumed as i said but mine didn't

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.650 
which consumed as i said but mine didn't
come<00:06:26.310> over<00:06:26.610> which<00:06:26.760> so<00:06:27.090> you're<00:06:27.330> just<00:06:27.420> going<00:06:27.570> to

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
come over which so you're just going to

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.420 
come over which so you're just going to
see<00:06:27.810> the<00:06:27.900> basic<00:06:28.140> idea<00:06:28.410> this<00:06:29.100> is<00:06:29.220> what<00:06:29.340> they

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
see the basic idea this is what they

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.710 
see the basic idea this is what they
look<00:06:29.550> like<00:06:29.610> when<00:06:29.760> they<00:06:29.940> spawn<00:06:30.120> and<00:06:30.270> graham

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
look like when they spawn and graham

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.090 
look like when they spawn and graham
spoon<00:06:30.900> but<00:06:31.080> water<00:06:31.350> they<00:06:31.560> look<00:06:31.680> a<00:06:31.770> little<00:06:31.920> bit

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
spoon but water they look a little bit

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.880 
spoon but water they look a little bit
different<00:06:32.460> and<00:06:33.260> inside<00:06:34.260> you'll<00:06:34.440> see<00:06:34.560> is<00:06:34.680> a

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
different and inside you'll see is a

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.100 
different and inside you'll see is a
cauldron<00:06:35.460> a<00:06:35.640> crafting<00:06:36.330> table<00:06:36.360> and<00:06:36.750> sometimes

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
cauldron a crafting table and sometimes

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.680 
cauldron a crafting table and sometimes
a<00:06:37.230> mushroom<00:06:37.560> in<00:06:37.620> a<00:06:37.680> pot<00:06:37.920> which<00:06:38.690> it's

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
a mushroom in a pot which it's

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.450 
a mushroom in a pot which it's
interesting<00:06:39.840> to<00:06:40.230> me<00:06:40.260> it's<00:06:40.770> very<00:06:40.950> interesting

to me oh yeah this is what they are
they're<00:06:43.440> just<00:06:43.560> calling<00:06:43.860> table<00:06:44.220> thingy<00:06:44.790> and

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
they're just calling table thingy and
