can see what my toe pattern looks like

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
can see what my toe pattern looks like
but<00:01:28.740> um<00:01:29.210> if<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.360> take<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.720> down<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.670> but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
but um if I take it down and you see but

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.499 
but um if I take it down and you see but
it<00:01:33.240> has<00:01:33.479> loosens<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.320> lot<00:01:35.630> since<00:01:38.180> before<00:01:39.180> I

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
it has loosens a lot since before I

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.609 
it has loosens a lot since before I
started<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:41.280> keep<00:01:41.490> training<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.439> this<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
started the keep training and this is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.130 
started the keep training and this is
stretched<00:01:44.009> straight<00:01:44.369> now<00:01:44.960> but<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.079> is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
stretched straight now but this is

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.230 
stretched straight now but this is
pretty<00:01:46.649> similar<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:47.549> my<00:01:47.820> hair<00:01:48.030> looks

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
pretty similar to what my hair looks

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.889 
pretty similar to what my hair looks
like<00:01:48.329> wet<00:01:48.689> now<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.240> hair<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.509> never<00:01:51.630> like

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
like wet now and my hair was never like

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.209 
like wet now and my hair was never like
that<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.409> was<00:01:52.560> much<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:53.750> tight<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:55.770> wasn't<00:01:56.159> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
that it was much more tight it wasn't a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.730 
that it was much more tight it wasn't a
stretched<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.960> mean<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.530> makes

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
stretched out so I mean it just makes

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.060 
stretched out so I mean it just makes
styling<00:01:59.640> my<00:01:59.790> hair<00:02:00.290> for<00:02:01.290> straight<00:02:01.560> styles<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
styling my hair for straight styles a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.709 
styling my hair for straight styles a
lot<00:02:02.219> easier<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.979> because<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:06.390> hard<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
lot easier and because I do so hard to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.350 
lot easier and because I do so hard to
keep<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:06.960> hair<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.860> those<00:02:08.190> straight<00:02:08.550> styles

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
keep this hair in those straight styles

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.050 
keep this hair in those straight styles
for<00:02:09.869> long<00:02:10.020> periods<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.560> time<00:02:10.619> which<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.610> easier

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
for long periods of time which is easier

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.590 
for long periods of time which is easier
for<00:02:12.120> me<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:13.460> what<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.490> wanted<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.850> mention<00:02:15.090> also

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
for me and what I wanted to mention also

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.900 
for me and what I wanted to mention also
is<00:02:16.020> because<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.530> have<00:02:16.680> up<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.310> flat<00:02:17.550> ironing

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
is because I do have up a flat ironing

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.370 
is because I do have up a flat ironing
hair<00:02:18.210> tutorial<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:21.090> flat<00:02:21.690> iron<00:02:21.900> my<00:02:21.960> hair<00:02:22.140> a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
hair tutorial and I flat iron my hair a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.160 
hair tutorial and I flat iron my hair a
very<00:02:22.770> specific<00:02:23.070> way<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.910> part<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.050> is

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
very specific way and part of that is

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.710 
very specific way and part of that is
because<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.470> get<00:02:25.680> training<00:02:25.950> over<00:02:26.130> here<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.030> if

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
because I get training over here so if

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.210 
because I get training over here so if
you<00:02:27.900> watch<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.260> video<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.560> mentioned<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.160> I

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
you watch that video I mentioned that I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.370 
you watch that video I mentioned that I
cut<00:02:29.490> under<00:02:29.670> my<00:02:29.820> hair<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.150> 450<00:02:30.780> degrees<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
cut under my hair on 450 degrees and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.830 
cut under my hair on 450 degrees and
when<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.410> do<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.340> pay<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> lot<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.360> attention<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
when I do it I pay a lot of attention to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.070 
when I do it I pay a lot of attention to
the<00:02:37.020> roots<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.220> don't<00:02:38.610> pass<00:02:38.910> over<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.840> very

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
the roots but I don't pass over the very

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.160 
the roots but I don't pass over the very
ends<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.590> my<00:02:40.800> hair<00:02:40.880> more<00:02:41.880> than<00:02:42.120> once<00:02:42.360> sometimes

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
ends of my hair more than once sometimes

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.110 
ends of my hair more than once sometimes
twice<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.890> usually<00:02:44.160> only<00:02:44.280> press<00:02:44.550> over<00:02:44.760> you

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
twice it usually only press over you

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.000 
twice it usually only press over you
entered<00:02:45.510> my<00:02:45.630> hair<00:02:45.810> once<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.560> I'll<00:02:46.800> go<00:02:46.950> over

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
entered my hair once and I'll go over

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.640 
entered my hair once and I'll go over
this<00:02:47.190> part<00:02:47.250> twice<00:02:47.730> but<00:02:48.510> then<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.780> part<00:02:49.140> at

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
this part twice but then this part at

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.480 
this part twice but then this part at
the<00:02:49.800> roots<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.459> go<00:02:50.970> over<00:02:51.330> many<00:02:52.320> many<00:02:52.560> times<00:02:52.920> just

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
the roots I go over many many times just

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.960 
the roots I go over many many times just
happy<00:02:53.790> tapping<00:02:54.300> tapping<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.920> that's<00:02:56.580> because

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
happy tapping tapping and that's because

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.820 
happy tapping tapping and that's because
this<00:02:57.900> hair<00:02:58.140> has<00:02:59.330> been<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:01.320> like<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.470> flat<00:03:01.680> iron

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
this hair has been just like a flat iron

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.270 
this hair has been just like a flat iron
many<00:03:02.130> times<00:03:02.540> this<00:03:03.540> meant<00:03:03.930> as<00:03:04.110> many<00:03:04.500> times<00:03:04.830> but

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
many times this meant as many times but

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.720 
many times this meant as many times but
still<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:06.209> lot<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.920> hasn't<00:03:08.190> really<00:03:08.550> seen

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
still a lot and this hasn't really seen

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.070 
still a lot and this hasn't really seen
fire<00:03:09.030> at<00:03:09.360> all<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.470> that's<00:03:10.980> why<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.310> in<00:03:12.300> my

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
fire at all so that's why I in my

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.949 
fire at all so that's why I in my
original<00:03:13.830> video<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.700> studio--<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.660> doing

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
original video the studio-- is doing

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.990 
original video the studio-- is doing
that<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.769> wanted<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.190> mention<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.640> just

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
that and I wanted to mention that just

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.410 
that and I wanted to mention that just
in<00:03:18.150> case<00:03:18.180> anybody<00:03:18.630> was<00:03:18.900> trying<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.290> emulate<00:03:19.530> me

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
in case anybody was trying to emulate me

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.740 
in case anybody was trying to emulate me
unless<00:03:21.420> you're<00:03:21.720> looking<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.380> change<00:03:22.410> your<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
unless you're looking to change your the

unless you're looking to change your the

pattern of your challenge permanently
your<00:03:28.140> heat<00:03:28.380> training<00:03:28.830> then<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.610> don't<00:03:29.760> want

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
your heat training then you don't want

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.250 
your heat training then you don't want
to<00:03:29.970> use<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.150> high<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.690> sheet<00:03:31.370> consistently

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
to use that high of a sheet consistently

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.479 
to use that high of a sheet consistently
and<00:03:34.260> what's<00:03:34.500> different<00:03:34.650> from<00:03:34.980> keep<00:03:35.190> training

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
and what's different from keep training

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.300 
and what's different from keep training
as<00:03:35.730> opposed<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.180> going<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.840> salon<00:03:37.310> every

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
as opposed to going to the salon every

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.360 
as opposed to going to the salon every

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
couple of weeks and letting them fly on

couple of weeks and letting them fly on
your<00:03:41.519> hair<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.030> they're<00:03:42.630> going<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.930> be

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
your hair is that they're going to be

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.440 
your hair is that they're going to be
using<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.500> same<00:03:43.709> high<00:03:44.160> heat<00:03:44.550> on<00:03:44.700> every<00:03:45.180> part

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
using the same high heat on every part

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.640 
using the same high heat on every part
of<00:03:45.570> your<00:03:45.750> hair<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:48.209> know<00:03:48.330> without<00:03:48.540> question

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
of your hair you know without question

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.780 
of your hair you know without question
it's<00:03:49.650> sort<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.070> like<00:03:52.190> teaching<00:03:53.190> your<00:03:53.550> hair<00:03:53.700> is

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
it's sort of like teaching your hair is

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.880 
it's sort of like teaching your hair is
a<00:03:53.820> lot<00:03:53.970> like<00:03:54.209> turning<00:03:54.690> your<00:03:54.720> hair<00:03:54.930> you're

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
a lot like turning your hair you're

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.240 
a lot like turning your hair you're
really<00:03:56.400> only<00:03:56.489> putting<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:58.230> harsh<00:03:58.650> chemicals

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
really only putting the harsh chemicals

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.330 
really only putting the harsh chemicals
at<00:03:59.459> the<00:04:00.150> roots<00:04:00.390> where<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.470> first<00:04:01.769> where<00:04:02.190> it's

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
at the roots where it's first where it's

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.539 
at the roots where it's first where it's
a<00:04:02.459> newly<00:04:03.090> coming<00:04:03.300> in<00:04:03.600> as<00:04:04.050> opposed<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:05.160> putting

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
a newly coming in as opposed to putting

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.940 
a newly coming in as opposed to putting
it<00:04:05.760> all<00:04:06.000> over<00:04:06.060> your<00:04:06.600> hair<00:04:06.750> because<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.739> rest

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
it all over your hair because the rest

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.820 
it all over your hair because the rest
of<00:04:08.040> your<00:04:08.190> hair<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.430> already<00:04:08.670> experienced<00:04:09.510> that

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
of your hair is already experienced that

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.380 
of your hair is already experienced that
so<00:04:10.830> it's<00:04:11.040> similar<00:04:11.280> with<00:04:11.459> heat<00:04:11.880> rating<00:04:12.269> you're

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
so it's similar with heat rating you're

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.089 
so it's similar with heat rating you're
not<00:04:12.540> going<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.750> put<00:04:12.870> as<00:04:12.989> much<00:04:13.200> heat

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
not going to put as much heat

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.099 
not going to put as much heat
on<00:04:14.189> the<00:04:14.849> bottom<00:04:15.180> half<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.540> your<00:04:15.659> hair<00:04:15.840> as<00:04:15.959> you

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
on the bottom half of your hair as you

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.960 
on the bottom half of your hair as you
put<00:04:16.289> at<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.440> roots<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:18.109> that's<00:04:19.109> why<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.350> can't

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
put at the roots so that's why I can't

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.360 
put at the roots so that's why I can't
flatten<00:04:20.970> my<00:04:21.120> hair<00:04:21.389> at<00:04:21.449> 450<00:04:22.169> degrees<00:04:22.199> and<00:04:22.800> not

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
flatten my hair at 450 degrees and not

flatten my hair at 450 degrees and not

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
to extreme heat damage from it

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.279 
to extreme heat damage from it
I<00:04:28.139> am<00:04:28.650> shape<00:04:29.070> affecting<00:04:29.699> my<00:04:29.850> hair<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:31.110> is<00:04:31.139> a

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
I am shape affecting my hair and it is a

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.170 
I am shape affecting my hair and it is a
permanent<00:04:31.560> change<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:32.340> belong<00:04:32.669> gave<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.030> my

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
permanent change I belong gave it my

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.830 
permanent change I belong gave it my
call<00:04:33.479> but<00:04:34.410> once<00:04:34.889> I<00:04:35.039> have<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.430> at<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.509> curl

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
call but once I have it at a curl

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.080 
call but once I have it at a curl
pattern<00:04:37.169> that<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:37.380> want<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:37.919> will<00:04:38.310> be<00:04:38.610> changing

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
pattern that I want I will be changing

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.990 
pattern that I want I will be changing
my<00:04:39.600> flat<00:04:40.050> iron<00:04:40.229> regimen<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:41.340> accommodate<00:04:41.820> that

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
my flat iron regimen to accommodate that

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.300 
my flat iron regimen to accommodate that
so<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.270> don't<00:04:42.389> continue<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.470> change<00:04:44.070> their

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
so I don't continue to change their

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.740 
so I don't continue to change their
curls<00:04:44.580> any<00:04:45.270> further<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:47.599> hopefully<00:04:48.599> at<00:04:48.720> that

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
curls any further and hopefully at that

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.120 
curls any further and hopefully at that
point<00:04:49.080> also<00:04:49.349> it<00:04:49.560> needs<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.830> be<00:04:49.919> flat

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
point also it needs to be flat

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.730 
point also it needs to be flat
everything<00:04:50.550> as<00:04:50.699> often<00:04:51.210> because<00:04:52.110> I'll<00:04:52.410> have<00:04:52.590> my

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
everything as often because I'll have my

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.379 
everything as often because I'll have my
hair<00:04:54.500> come<00:04:55.500> into<00:04:56.039> a<00:04:56.070> state<00:04:56.400> where<00:04:56.430> it's<00:04:56.849> easier

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
hair come into a state where it's easier

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.960 
hair come into a state where it's easier
to<00:04:57.780> style<00:04:58.289> it<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.740> do<00:04:58.889> things<00:04:59.099> that<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.400> like

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.270 
to style it and do things that I like
I<00:05:00.000> keep<00:05:00.599> it<00:05:00.780> flat<00:05:00.960> iron<00:05:01.229> for<00:05:01.560> longer<00:05:01.889> periods

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
I keep it flat iron for longer periods

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.270 
I keep it flat iron for longer periods
of<00:05:02.370> time<00:05:02.580> without<00:05:02.729> having<00:05:03.000> to<00:05:03.210> wash<00:05:03.479> it<00:05:03.690> out<00:05:04.280> so
