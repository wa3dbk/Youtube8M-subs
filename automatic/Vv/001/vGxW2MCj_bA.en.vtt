00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
cool all right so there's probably

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.149 
cool all right so there's probably
probably<00:06:34.789> a<00:06:34.939> few<00:06:35.180> people<00:06:35.539> out<00:06:35.599> there<00:06:35.839> watching

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:36.159 
probably a few people out there watching

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.980 
probably a few people out there watching
wondering<00:06:37.159> what<00:06:37.339> I<00:06:37.370> did<00:06:37.490> with<00:06:37.909> my<00:06:38.180> uh<00:06:38.210> my

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
wondering what I did with my uh my

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.980 
wondering what I did with my uh my
broken<00:06:39.499> ocarina<00:06:40.099> and<00:06:40.370> I'll<00:06:41.330> actually<00:06:41.509> show

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
broken ocarina and I'll actually show

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.249 
broken ocarina and I'll actually show
you<00:06:42.229> right<00:06:42.499> now<00:06:43.330> here<00:06:44.330> you<00:06:44.419> can<00:06:44.599> see<00:06:44.809> it<00:06:45.139> was

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259 
you right now here you can see it was

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.010 
you right now here you can see it was
broken<00:06:45.589> into<00:06:45.949> quite<00:06:46.189> a<00:06:46.249> few<00:06:46.520> pieces<00:06:46.789> I<00:06:47.270> used<00:06:47.839> to

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
broken into quite a few pieces I used to

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.799 
broken into quite a few pieces I used to
glue<00:06:48.169> called<00:06:48.669> 527<00:06:49.669> to<00:06:49.969> glue<00:06:50.330> it<00:06:50.449> back<00:06:50.479> together

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:50.809 
glue called 527 to glue it back together

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:53.529 
glue called 527 to glue it back together
and<00:06:51.439> it<00:06:51.919> ended<00:06:52.159> up<00:06:52.309> sounding<00:06:52.639> and<00:06:53.150> looking

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
and it ended up sounding and looking

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:56.230 
and it ended up sounding and looking
just<00:06:53.870> fine<00:06:54.080> I<00:06:54.610> filled<00:06:55.610> in<00:06:55.789> the<00:06:55.909> remaining

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 
just fine I filled in the remaining

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.209 
just fine I filled in the remaining
cracks<00:06:56.659> with<00:06:56.930> a<00:06:56.960> product<00:06:57.439> called<00:06:57.499> polymer

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:58.219 
cracks with a product called polymer

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:59.950 
cracks with a product called polymer
clay<00:06:58.430> mixing<00:06:59.059> the<00:06:59.180> white<00:06:59.360> and<00:06:59.599> brown<00:06:59.749> together

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
clay mixing the white and brown together

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.320 
clay mixing the white and brown together
to<00:07:00.770> fill<00:07:00.979> in<00:07:01.069> the<00:07:01.189> cracks<00:07:01.219> here<00:07:01.849> on<00:07:01.939> the<00:07:02.059> cheek

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
to fill in the cracks here on the cheek

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.799 
to fill in the cracks here on the cheek
and<00:07:02.629> on<00:07:03.169> the<00:07:03.319> top<00:07:03.529> of<00:07:03.710> the<00:07:03.800> head<00:07:04.629> because<00:07:05.629> this

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:05.809 
and on the top of the head because this

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:07.450 
and on the top of the head because this
pretty<00:07:06.080> much<00:07:06.289> became<00:07:06.710> just<00:07:07.009> a<00:07:07.159> display

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
pretty much became just a display

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.939 
pretty much became just a display
ocarina<00:07:08.180> I<00:07:08.539> added<00:07:09.199> a<00:07:09.289> little<00:07:09.409> something

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:09.949 
ocarina I added a little something

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:12.969 
ocarina I added a little something
called<00:07:09.979> Swarovski<00:07:10.939> crystals<00:07:11.509> these<00:07:12.259> crystals

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:12.979 
called Swarovski crystals these crystals

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:15.399 
called Swarovski crystals these crystals
come<00:07:13.189> from<00:07:13.370> Austria<00:07:13.909> and<00:07:14.659> when<00:07:14.870> held<00:07:15.080> under

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:15.409 
come from Austria and when held under

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:17.110 
come from Austria and when held under
the<00:07:15.439> light<00:07:15.710> they<00:07:16.009> seemed<00:07:16.279> a<00:07:16.399> sparkle<00:07:16.969> which

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 
the light they seemed a sparkle which

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.379 
the light they seemed a sparkle which
adds<00:07:17.389> a<00:07:17.539> really<00:07:17.809> cool<00:07:18.020> effect<00:07:19.089> if<00:07:20.089> you<00:07:20.270> guys

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:20.389 
adds a really cool effect if you guys

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:21.939 
adds a really cool effect if you guys
were<00:07:20.629> paying<00:07:20.870> close<00:07:21.169> attention<00:07:21.379> you'd

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:21.949 
were paying close attention you'd

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:23.920 
were paying close attention you'd
probably<00:07:22.610> remember<00:07:23.089> me<00:07:23.120> saying<00:07:23.599> something

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930
