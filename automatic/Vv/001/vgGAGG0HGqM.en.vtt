yeah so he said it's not gonna catch on
and<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.320> not<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.710> good<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.279> it's

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and it's not going to be good and it's

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.889 
and it's not going to be good and it's
not<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.969> not<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.750> good

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
not it's not that much of a good

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
not it's not that much of a good
strategy<00:00:34.110> especially<00:00:34.590> if<00:00:35.160> you're<00:00:35.340> farming

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
strategy especially if you're farming

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.459 
strategy especially if you're farming
for<00:00:35.910> dark<00:00:36.149> elixir<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.960> shouldn't<00:00:37.230> be

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
for dark elixir then it shouldn't be

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.680 
for dark elixir then it shouldn't be
that<00:00:37.500> good<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.489> again<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.239> are<00:00:39.270> found

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that good but again if you are found

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.840 
that good but again if you are found
with<00:00:39.930> all<00:00:40.050> click<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.469> then<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:41.219> quite<00:00:41.579> good

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
with all click so then it's quite good

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.100 
with all click so then it's quite good
just<00:00:42.120> because<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.600> know<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.989> actually

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
just because you know you can actually

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.479 
just because you know you can actually
get<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> center<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.370> can

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
get to the center because you can

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.979 
get to the center because you can
destroy<00:00:44.789> all<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> outside<00:00:45.539> walls<00:00:45.809> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
destroy all the outside walls and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
destroy all the outside walls and
everything<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.680> yeah<00:00:46.860> since<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.219> don't<00:00:47.340> have

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
everything but yeah since we don't have

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.330 
everything but yeah since we don't have
jumps<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.629> anything<00:00:48.899> at<00:00:49.110> town<00:00:49.260> hall<00:00:49.289> 8<00:00:49.620> we

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
jumps for anything at town hall 8 we

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.040 
jumps for anything at town hall 8 we
could<00:00:50.610> basically<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> makeshift

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
could basically use it as a makeshift

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.630 
could basically use it as a makeshift
jump<00:00:52.350> spell<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> should<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.280> fun<00:00:53.489> it

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
jump spell and it should be fun it

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520 
jump spell and it should be fun it
should<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.910> good<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.510> basically<00:00:54.780> like

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
should be good and it can basically like

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.930 
should be good and it can basically like
I<00:00:55.649> could<00:00:55.829> drop<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.219> all<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> way<00:00:56.579> over<00:00:56.910> here

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
I could drop them all the way over here

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.360 
I could drop them all the way over here
and<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> opens<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.960> huge<00:00:58.230> section<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.129> my

all four of them boom and it should take

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.590 
all four of them boom and it should take
out<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.159> huge<00:01:47.549> section<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.030> we'll<00:01:48.210> look<00:01:48.390> at

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
out that huge section of we'll look at

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.539 
out that huge section of we'll look at
that<00:01:48.810> opening<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:49.829> all<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.430> is

completely failed I mean okay they got
wiped<00:02:04.750> out<00:02:04.930> but<00:02:05.050> they<00:02:05.140> walked<00:02:05.350> all<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.800> most

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
wiped out but they walked all the most

all<00:02:06.130> walked<00:02:06.430> out<00:02:06.580> of<00:02:06.730> it<00:02:06.850> but<00:02:06.940> look<00:02:07.120> at<00:02:07.180> that

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
all walked out of it but look at that

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.570 
all walked out of it but look at that
opening<00:02:07.720> me<00:02:07.810> right<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.500> gold<00:02:08.770> instead<00:02:09.460> of

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
opening me right to the gold instead of

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.920 
opening me right to the gold instead of
having<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.880> break<00:02:10.119> through<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.390> ton<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.630> walls

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
having to break through a ton of walls

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.300 
having to break through a ton of walls
and<00:02:11.170> stuff<00:02:11.320> so<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.560> know<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.100> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
and stuff so you know that is the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.040 
and stuff so you know that is the
benefit<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.790> having<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.270> earthquake<00:02:13.720> spells

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
benefit of having the earthquake spells

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.050 
benefit of having the earthquake spells
especially<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.130> have<00:02:15.160> loads<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.790> elixir

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
especially if you have loads of elixir

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.360 
especially if you have loads of elixir
or<00:02:16.510> dark<00:02:16.810> elixir<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.380> if<00:02:18.010> there<00:02:18.190> was<00:02:18.310> a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
or dark elixir and if there was a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.430 
or dark elixir and if there was a
Darkling<00:02:18.970> storage<00:02:19.450> day<00:02:19.660> like<00:02:19.930> there<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.230> over

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
Darkling storage day like there is over

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440 
Darkling storage day like there is over
there<00:02:20.650> then<00:02:21.190> we<00:02:21.400> can<00:02:21.580> get<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:21.940> much<00:02:22.210> easier

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
there then we can get to it much easier

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.110 
there then we can get to it much easier
than<00:02:22.720> before<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.380> that's<00:02:23.620> really<00:02:23.770> cool<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.310> I

that will send about being King as well
and<00:02:39.100> here<00:02:39.940> we<00:02:40.030> go<00:02:40.060> we've<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:40.570> gonna<00:02:40.690> get

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
and here we go we've just gonna get

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.110 
and here we go we've just gonna get
those<00:02:41.050> two<00:02:41.320> gold<00:02:41.590> storages<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.310> leave<00:02:42.910> I

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
those two gold storages and leave I

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.600 
those two gold storages and leave I
think<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.750> yeah<00:02:44.260> let's<00:02:44.470> see<00:02:44.710> if<00:02:45.010> we<00:02:45.220> can<00:02:45.400> do

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
think so yeah let's see if we can do

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.210 
think so yeah let's see if we can do
this<00:02:45.790> efficiently<00:02:46.390> here<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:47.230> go<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.740> if<00:02:47.920> that

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
this efficiently here we go and if that

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.280 
this efficiently here we go and if that
wasn't<00:02:48.700> open<00:02:49.240> then<00:02:49.360> we'd<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.630> spend<00:02:50.050> time

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
wasn't open then we'd have to spend time

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.620 
wasn't open then we'd have to spend time
opening<00:02:50.800> them<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.370> that's<00:02:52.000> one<00:02:52.330> of<00:02:52.360> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
opening them so that's one of the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.810 
opening them so that's one of the
benefits<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.290> let's<00:02:53.440> send<00:02:53.710> this<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.490> let's

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
benefits so let's send this in and let's

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.570 
benefits so let's send this in and let's
go<00:02:55.060> with<00:02:55.270> these<00:02:55.590> arches<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.770> stuff<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.310> my

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
go with these arches and stuff and my

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.250 
go with these arches and stuff and my
barbarian<00:02:58.090> Kings<00:02:58.330> almost<00:02:58.660> dead<00:02:58.840> already

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
and already on that Town Hall let's see

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.870 
and already on that Town Hall let's see
if<00:03:16.900> we<00:03:17.140> can<00:03:17.350> get<00:03:17.530> anything<00:03:17.800> else<00:03:18.130> from<00:03:18.340> here<00:03:18.730> if

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
if we can get anything else from here if

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.970 
if we can get anything else from here if
we<00:03:19.360> could<00:03:19.540> get<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.810> last<00:03:20.110> goal<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.860> we

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
we could get that last goal so that we

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.740 
we could get that last goal so that we
seek<00:03:21.400> about<00:03:21.670> get<00:03:21.820> my<00:03:21.910> arches<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.330> go<00:03:22.450> there<00:03:22.660> but

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
seek about get my arches to go there but

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.810 
seek about get my arches to go there but
I<00:03:22.810> can't<00:03:23.290> because<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.770> target<00:03:24.160> isn't<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.580> so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
I can't because the target isn't this so

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.900 
I can't because the target isn't this so
we<00:03:24.940> currently<00:03:25.300> do<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.250> yeah<00:03:27.250> that's<00:03:27.580> it

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
we currently do that and yeah that's it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.670 
we currently do that and yeah that's it
looks<00:03:28.390> like<00:03:28.570> we<00:03:28.720> got<00:03:28.870> as<00:03:28.989> much<00:03:29.140> as<00:03:29.350> we<00:03:29.470> could

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
looks like we got as much as we could

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.660 
looks like we got as much as we could
and<00:03:30.450> yeah<00:03:31.450> no<00:03:31.720> one<00:03:31.840> went<00:03:32.020> for<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.200> lost<00:03:32.670> gold

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
smells and yeah we didn't get much of a

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.920 
smells and yeah we didn't get much of a
loot<00:03:51.550> just<00:03:51.790> because<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.090> wasn't<00:03:52.330> much<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:52.780> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
loot just because it wasn't much in the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.030 
loot just because it wasn't much in the
village<00:03:53.260> but<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:53.530> know<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.769> find<00:03:53.980> a

village with higher Luke bonus or Lou in
the<00:03:56.860> village<00:03:57.160> then<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.489> can<00:03:57.640> obviously<00:03:57.880> get<00:03:58.090> a

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
the village then you can obviously get a

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.880 
the village then you can obviously get a
lot<00:03:58.360> more<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:58.780> it<00:03:58.870> just<00:03:58.930> costs<00:03:59.260> just<00:03:59.560> around

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
lot more so it just costs just around

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.610 
lot more so it just costs just around

having a jump spell at Town Hall a but
even<00:04:52.880> better<00:04:53.090> because<00:04:53.419> it<00:04:53.660> opens<00:04:53.990> so<00:04:54.169> many

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
even better because it opens so many

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.629 
even better because it opens so many
walls<00:04:54.530> well<00:04:54.950> I<00:04:55.010> don't<00:04:55.190> know<00:04:55.250> if<00:04:55.310> it's<00:04:55.430> bad<00:04:55.610> I

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
walls well I don't know if it's bad I

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.879 
walls well I don't know if it's bad I
mean<00:04:55.910> it<00:04:56.150> takes<00:04:56.330> loads<00:04:56.600> of<00:04:56.690> dark<00:04:56.900> elixir<00:04:57.020> so

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
mean it takes loads of dark elixir so

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.710 
mean it takes loads of dark elixir so
you<00:04:58.340> know<00:04:58.460> it's<00:04:58.610> up<00:04:58.790> to<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.060> guy<00:04:59.240> playing<00:04:59.540> I

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
you know it's up to the guy playing I

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.360 
you know it's up to the guy playing I
guess<00:04:59.960> look<00:05:00.410> how<00:05:00.530> many<00:05:00.680> walls<00:05:00.889> open<00:05:01.280> is

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
guess look how many walls open is

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.010 
guess look how many walls open is
basically<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.330> could<00:05:02.510> go<00:05:02.690> through<00:05:02.900> this

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
basically you could go through this

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.350 
basically you could go through this
entire<00:05:03.470> bottom<00:05:03.979> side<00:05:04.250> with<00:05:04.520> no<00:05:04.700> problem<00:05:05.210> and

entire bottom side with no problem and

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.690 
entire bottom side with no problem and
then<00:05:05.479> move<00:05:05.660> on<00:05:05.810> to<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:06.020> top<00:05:06.229> so<00:05:06.620> that's<00:05:07.340> pretty

me<00:05:30.770> lest<00:05:31.130> your<00:05:31.430> you're<00:05:31.700> watching<00:05:32.479> troops<00:05:33.050> can

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
me lest your you're watching troops can

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.020 
me lest your you're watching troops can
actually<00:05:33.500> move<00:05:33.680> inside<00:05:34.250> instead<00:05:34.669> of<00:05:34.789> just

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
actually move inside instead of just

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.610 
actually move inside instead of just
spending<00:05:35.150> time<00:05:35.450> on<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.840> outside<00:05:36.260> which<00:05:36.470> it

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
spending time on the outside which it

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.659 
spending time on the outside which it
normally<00:05:36.919> does<00:05:37.130> because<00:05:37.460> when<00:05:37.550> you're

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
normally does because when you're

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:38.950 
normally does because when you're
watching<00:05:37.820> you're<00:05:38.150> basically<00:05:38.539> attack<00:05:38.810> from

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
watching you're basically attack from

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.540 
watching you're basically attack from
the<00:05:39.020> outside<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:39.650> do<00:05:39.740> your<00:05:39.919> best<00:05:40.100> to<00:05:40.340> go<00:05:40.460> on

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
the outside and do your best to go on

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.640 
the outside and do your best to go on
the<00:05:40.610> inside<00:05:40.970> for<00:05:41.539> this<00:05:41.720> you<00:05:42.110> have<00:05:42.289> an<00:05:42.470> almost

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
the inside for this you have an almost

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.890 
the inside for this you have an almost
guaranteed<00:05:43.460> chance<00:05:44.240> of<00:05:44.479> getting<00:05:44.720> on<00:05:44.810> the

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
guaranteed chance of getting on the

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.840 
guaranteed chance of getting on the
inside<00:05:45.289> and<00:05:45.500> getting<00:05:45.979> most<00:05:46.220> of<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.460> loop<00:05:46.610> in

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
inside and getting most of the loop in

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.360 
inside and getting most of the loop in
the<00:05:47.000> storages<00:05:47.539> so<00:05:47.870> yeah<00:05:48.289> because<00:05:48.500> if<00:05:48.680> it's<00:05:49.130> if

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
the storages so yeah because if it's if

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.760 
the storages so yeah because if it's if
you<00:05:49.490> don't<00:05:49.760> have<00:05:49.940> the<00:05:50.180> UM<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.990> earthquakes

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
you don't have the UM the earthquakes

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.409 
you don't have the UM the earthquakes
let<00:05:52.010> them<00:05:52.250> you're<00:05:52.430> basically<00:05:52.910> looking<00:05:52.970> for

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
let them you're basically looking for

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.050 
let them you're basically looking for
dead<00:05:53.690> villages<00:05:54.289> to<00:05:54.650> Lou<00:05:55.039> and<00:05:55.310> stuff<00:05:55.580> so<00:05:55.729> I<00:05:55.850> hope

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
dead villages to Lou and stuff so I hope

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.469 
dead villages to Lou and stuff so I hope
we<00:05:56.210> can<00:05:56.360> actually<00:05:56.900> get<00:05:57.110> to<00:05:57.169> this<00:05:57.500> second<00:05:58.479> duck

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
we can actually get to this second duck

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.480
