00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.309
 next product review today is about 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:12.929
 the glj 88 over ear headphones with 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.780
 integrated microphone and mobile phone companies 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.910
 It's like 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:24.150
 said without headphones the optics 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.300
 look relatively large look great 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.859
 if then put over the ears and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.530
 still carry a lot to the size 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.660
 Width of the head at in public 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.980
 I would not wear it at all times 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.379
 It actually looks like mickey 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.500
 mouse, the headphones do not sit 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.940
 Well, they do not press but the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.230
 ovi your headphones are not that good 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.030
 completed that for example 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.390
 would filter passing cars 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.300
 It's actually like the headphones 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.550
 then when cars pass by 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.739
 For example, the cars are loud 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.480
 let appear as how to 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.790
 normally would suspect 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.020
 the ambient noise like for example 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.939
 passing cars just quiet 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.000
 it would appear at the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.500
 headphones do not like the outside noise 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 are somehow by that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.470
 strangely reinforced and you feel 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.750
 It's like a truck, for example 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.150
 drive past instead of a car and when 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.979
 A truck drives past you think oh 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.530
 my god drives a jumbo jet over there 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.380
 it's actually kind of funny I 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.930
 do not know how they did that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.220
 it is actually another one 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.680
 Function of the headphones you can 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.680
 not so nice to work out if you dj 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.979
 but the jazz are buying themselves 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.420
 headphones are not very positive too 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.770
 You can notice with the headphones 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.140
 remove the audio cable 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.899
 it will plug you in there audio cable 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.780
 is also super that displacement free 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.240
 because that's a long and a short one 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.219
 then one has here still in 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.990
 the integrated microphone with the 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.369
 handsfree why just yet 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.920
 Press the call from the mobile phone 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.049
 for example, assume 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.360
 the headphones currently cost 40 euros 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.250
 miserly de have the shortest time 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.660
 still 100 or 140, so if you have 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.310
 the price decline looks it is already 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.770
 somehow funny, maybe 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.989
 now bad hardware components 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.790
 installed or there is only one newer 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.709
 model in any case it is somehow 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.250
 strange that in the shortest time to 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.190
 open price drop still have to 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.350
 sound quality of the headphones was yes 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.239
 in my opinion that the main thing 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.870
 headphones are headphones 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.150
 from gbl the 88 years have one 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.250
 medium weight problem-and indeed are the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.239
 the basses will be the headphones though 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.100
 with that advertised that the sound purity 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.739
 However, this is not the case here 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.180
 But a call is not the case 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.810
 which are better with the headphones 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.500
 extremely strong and the heights and 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.910
 in the middle are totally in the background 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.860
 remained the bass are so strong 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.120
 available that you are classical 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.519
 For example, no longer songs 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.290
 because the heights can be heard that way 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.700
 far turned back that is easy 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.440
 no joy is synonymous with others 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.560
 music genres it's just so much the better 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.190
 are extremely dominant and the headphones 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.090
 are of the variety of sound ever 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.540
 not balanced 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.090
 These are extremely bass-heavy headphones 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.040
 even with songs the bass-heavy ones 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.540
 should appear 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.209
 These headphones are easy on 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.079
 bass-heavy it just does not make fun 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.239
 to hear music with it 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.260
 even if you look for example one 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.780
 podcast sounds are the headphones extreme 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.980
 basslastig and also here is the 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.790
 human voice is not good either 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.880
 reproduced 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.850
 It's just that the headphones 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.500
 sound in my opinion at the most 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.299
 the note have earned poorly 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.530
 the note enough I would 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.230
 no longer award a case 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.410
 Compared to other headphones are 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.209
 the glj 88 a headphones from the optics 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.370
 among all the quality of the music 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.579
 and the bass appeal also among all 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.310
 sow 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:17.880
 I still have that in comparison 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.130
 this five euro philips sap 1900 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.510
 headphones compared 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.640
 they have 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.440
 from the accuracy of fit are indeed 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.000
 shit because the top actually no 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.040
 but only to endorse 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.040
 plastic hanger where you always under one 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.330
 Nevertheless, the kÃ¤ppi have to be raised 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.150
 sound better so therefore it gives like 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.580
 said there is no no comparison 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.360
 the worlds are better though the only 5 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.060
 cost euro 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.420
 as dj the recently still for 80 euros 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.890
 were offered and compared to 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:55.590
 my reference headphones the bose qc 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:59.670
 15 the quiet comfort 15 is natural 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:03.150
 so the gbl headphones are absolutely 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.290
 are inferior in each point alone 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.360
 already from the optics 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.430
 if you look at the gbl 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.860
 headphones are extremely important in the 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.540
 compared to the bose headphones the 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.770
 You can still get angry headphones 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.760
 wear in public 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:22.530
 that just looks so ok 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:28.380
 I would never wear gpl outside 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:30.570
 it just looks too stupid so how 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.130
 I absolutely said the recommendation 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:37.110
 Do not buy and it does not lead any way 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.970
 that you even if the only 5 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.470
 would cost EUR I would others 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.800
 philips headphones take because the better 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.780
 are 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.390
 that 's it from my head 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.530
 review thanks for watching and we 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.530
 See you in the next video
