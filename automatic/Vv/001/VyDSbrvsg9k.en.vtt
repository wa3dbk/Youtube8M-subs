00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.490 
six ounces and where the red line
crosses<00:01:01.020> shows<00:01:01.920> us<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:03.290> 57<00:01:04.290> 64<00:01:05.100> so

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
crosses shows us that that is 57 64 so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.980 
crosses shows us that that is 57 64 so
this<00:01:07.500> would<00:01:07.740> show<00:01:07.920> 57<00:01:08.490> 64<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.299> five<00:01:09.570> point

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
this would show 57 64 so it's five point

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.609 
this would show 57 64 so it's five point

has to match or has to be within spec
where<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.100> pin<00:02:34.280> will<00:02:34.460> fail<00:02:34.640> our<00:02:35.230> testing

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:59.880 

Oh

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.890 

after<00:03:00.610> we<00:03:00.700> check<00:03:00.910> diameters<00:03:01.450> we<00:03:01.630> have<00:03:01.750> to

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
after we check diameters we have to

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.630 
after we check diameters we have to
check<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.320> diameter<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.190> hole<00:03:03.370> in<00:03:03.520> the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
check the diameter of the hole in the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.520 
check the diameter of the hole in the
bottom<00:03:07.740> this<00:03:08.740> measurement<00:03:09.340> would<00:03:09.520> be<00:03:09.870> 0.45<00:03:10.870> 0

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
bottom this measurement would be 0.45 0

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.460 
bottom this measurement would be 0.45 0
because<00:03:12.250> our<00:03:12.400> caliper<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.120> 0.4<00:03:13.990> inches<00:03:14.140> wide

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
because our caliper is 0.4 inches wide
