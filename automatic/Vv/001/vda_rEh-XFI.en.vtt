just<00:04:14.790> expressing<00:04:15.540> something<00:04:16.290> unspoken<00:04:19.880> I'm

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:21.740 
just expressing something unspoken I'm

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.969 
just expressing something unspoken I'm
as<00:04:22.740> far<00:04:22.979> as<00:04:23.130> like<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.910> know<00:04:23.970> I<00:04:24.090> loved<00:04:24.979> so

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
everything has a purpose so I think it's

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.090 
everything has a purpose so I think it's
just<00:04:30.210> expressing<00:04:30.840> what<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.530> song<00:04:31.740> is<00:04:31.770> saying

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
just expressing what the song is saying

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.680 
just expressing what the song is saying
and<00:04:32.250> then<00:04:32.340> if<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.669> was<00:04:32.850> only<00:04:33.030> happens<00:04:33.479> to<00:04:33.600> be

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
and then if it was only happens to be

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:41.590 
and then if it was only happens to be
something<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.050> I've<00:04:34.200> going<00:04:38.630> if<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.990> could
