there's<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.170> lot<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.350> imagination<00:01:13.650> both

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
there's a lot of imagination both

these huge ideas happen and the first

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.310 
these huge ideas happen and the first

take these giant ideas and chisel them

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.300 
take these giant ideas and chisel them
down<00:01:28.680> into<00:01:29.549> something<00:01:30.180> still<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:31.200> huge<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
down into something still like huge and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
down into something still like huge and
overwhelming<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> surprising<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
overwhelming and surprising for the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.030 
overwhelming and surprising for the
community<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:36.090> something<00:01:36.829> achievable<00:01:37.829> in

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
community but something achievable in

community but something achievable in
the<00:01:38.369> time<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.450> allotted<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.600> us

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.090 

there's<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.079> lot<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.259> factors<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.890> take<00:01:47.920> into

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
there's a lot of factors to take into

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.609 
there's a lot of factors to take into
consideration<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.240> it's<00:01:50.170> not<00:01:50.350> even<00:01:50.380> about

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
consideration and it's not even about

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.670 
consideration and it's not even about
like<00:01:51.520> prep<00:01:51.850> time<00:01:52.090> cuz<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.899> know<00:01:53.020> I'm<00:01:53.110> sure<00:01:53.380> if

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
like prep time cuz you know I'm sure if

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.289 
like prep time cuz you know I'm sure if
we<00:01:53.799> want<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.189> could<00:01:54.340> have<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.520> year<00:01:54.970> prep

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
we want it we could have a year prep

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.569 
we want it we could have a year prep
time<00:01:55.509> but<00:01:56.049> there's<00:01:56.200> all<00:01:56.320> kinds<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:56.710> logistics

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
time but there's all kinds of logistics

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.669 
time but there's all kinds of logistics
and<00:01:57.759> rules<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.539> boring<00:01:58.960> stuff<00:01:59.289> that<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.619> don't

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
and rules and boring stuff that I don't

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.899 
and rules and boring stuff that I don't
want<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:00.369> know<00:02:00.490> bother<00:02:01.000> with<00:02:01.509> but<00:02:02.789> one<00:02:03.789> of

the things that really can't be avoided

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.389 
the things that really can't be avoided
is<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:08.019> fact<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.349> there's<00:02:08.739> usually<00:02:08.920> only<00:02:09.160> a

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
is the fact that there's usually only a

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.910 
is the fact that there's usually only a
few<00:02:09.700> days<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.780> set<00:02:11.140> up<00:02:11.349> when<00:02:11.620> we're<00:02:11.769> actually

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
few days to set up when we're actually

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.070 
few days to set up when we're actually
