the new Lumia at nine to five minutes in

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.299 
the new Lumia at nine to five minutes in
abilities<00:00:12.080> so<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.410> limited

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
abilities so we have limited

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.939 
abilities so we have limited
capabilities<00:00:14.660> quite<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> lot<00:00:15.929> for<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.440> yeah

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
capabilities quite a lot for you yeah

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.630 
capabilities quite a lot for you yeah
Takia<00:00:17.880> nine<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.660> five<00:00:18.900> but<00:00:19.460> what<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
Takia nine to five but what are the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.790 
Takia nine to five but what are the
hardware<00:00:20.970> differences<00:00:21.300> from<00:00:22.020> previous<00:00:22.590> is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
hardware differences from previous is

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.080 
hardware differences from previous is
that<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.130> have<00:00:23.310> actually<00:00:23.490> introduced

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that we have actually introduced

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.019 
that we have actually introduced
completely<00:00:24.750> new<00:00:24.930> optical<00:00:25.800> design<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.880> new

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
completely new optical design the new

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.509 
completely new optical design the new
optical<00:00:27.420> design<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.410> really<00:00:28.800> impressive<00:00:29.310> its

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
optical design is really impressive its

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.659 
optical design is really impressive its
consists<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.150> six<00:00:30.539> lenses<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.980> improve<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
consists of six lenses to improve the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.750 
consists of six lenses to improve the
sharpness<00:00:33.090> daylight<00:00:33.989> hand<00:00:34.290> flow<00:00:34.739> lines<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
sharpness daylight hand flow lines and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.459 
sharpness daylight hand flow lines and
even<00:00:35.969> more<00:00:36.120> impressive<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
even more impressive it is because the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.740 
even more impressive it is because the
whole<00:00:37.500> new<00:00:38.129> six<00:00:38.430> lens<00:00:38.670> design<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.360> completely

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
whole new six lens design is completely

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.170 
whole new six lens design is completely
suspended<00:00:40.399> white<00:00:41.399> optical<00:00:41.969> image

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
suspended white optical image

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.959 
suspended white optical image
stabilization<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.800> are<00:00:43.890> actually<00:00:44.010> again

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
stabilization so we are actually again

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.940 
stabilization so we are actually again
moving<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.570> whole<00:00:45.780> length<00:00:46.050> stack<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
moving the whole length stack to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
moving the whole length stack to
compensate<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.850> their<00:00:48.059> any<00:00:48.390> hand<00:00:48.629> shaking

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
compensate for their any hand shaking

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.819 
compensate for their any hand shaking
damage<00:00:49.969> on<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> software<00:00:51.390> side<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.620> big

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
damage on the software side the big

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.939 
damage on the software side the big
improvement<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> low-light<00:00:54.960> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
improvement is for the low-light so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.369 
improvement is for the low-light so
maybe<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> most<00:00:56.640> visible<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.199> obvious

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
maybe the most visible and obvious

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.439 
maybe the most visible and obvious
improvement<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.910> pumped<00:01:00.270> up

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
improvement is that we have pumped up

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.709 
improvement is that we have pumped up
the<00:01:00.480> ISO<00:01:01.199> range<00:01:01.469> quite<00:01:02.039> significantly<00:01:02.789> so

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the ISO range quite significantly so

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.100 
the ISO range quite significantly so
previously<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> ISO<00:01:04.769> went<00:01:05.010> from<00:01:05.339> 100<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.180> 800

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
previously the ISO went from 100 to 800

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.710 
previously the ISO went from 100 to 800
but<00:01:07.619> now<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.920> goes<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> way<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.909> 3200

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
but now it goes all the way up to 3200

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480 
but now it goes all the way up to 3200
that<00:01:10.530> keeps<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.010> course

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that keeps of course

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.180 
that keeps of course
four<00:01:11.909> times<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.540> lights

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
four times for lights

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.510 
four times for lights
a<00:01:14.420> situations<00:01:15.420> giving<00:01:15.920> me<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.980> brightness

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
a situations giving me the brightness

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.090 
a situations giving me the brightness
also<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.420> software<00:01:19.810> side<00:01:19.990> we<00:01:20.710> have<00:01:20.920> been

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
also the software side we have been

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.270 
also the software side we have been
really<00:01:21.790> busy<00:01:21.939> so<00:01:22.750> we<00:01:22.899> have<00:01:23.079> improved<00:01:23.560> the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
really busy so we have improved the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.480 
really busy so we have improved the
noise<00:01:24.579> filtering<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.540> photo<00:01:25.990> rendering<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
noise filtering a photo rendering the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.230 
noise filtering a photo rendering the
sharpening<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.659> whole<00:01:28.810> software<00:01:29.080> stack<00:01:33.240> also

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
sharpening the whole software stack also

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.660 
sharpening the whole software stack also
really<00:01:34.630> nice<00:01:34.780> cool<00:01:35.080> new<00:01:35.380> feature<00:01:35.649> is<00:01:36.340> what<00:01:36.549> we

camera so in a smart camera we can now
edit<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.750> 10<00:02:10.080> image<00:02:10.649> friend<00:02:10.979> stack<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:12.330> we

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
edit that 10 image friend stack as we

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.589 
edit that 10 image friend stack as we
wish<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.860> what<00:02:14.069> at<00:02:14.190> first<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.730> Justice<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
wish so what at first of Justice is the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.680 
wish so what at first of Justice is the
best<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.560> automatically<00:02:17.280> calculates<00:02:17.690> and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
best so it automatically calculates and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.259 
best so it automatically calculates and
tries<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> estimate<00:02:19.230> what<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.129> best<00:02:20.940> shot

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
tries to estimate what is the best shot

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
guys nicely in the center and we have a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.400 
guys nicely in the center and we have a
motion<00:03:02.900> blur<00:03:03.020> there<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.120> cool<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:05.990> this

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410

type<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.709> pictures<00:03:07.160> are<00:03:07.340> really<00:03:07.700> difficult<00:03:07.910> to

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
type of pictures are really difficult to

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.510 
type of pictures are really difficult to
create<00:03:08.540> if<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.320> don't<00:03:09.530> have<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.950> get<00:03:10.220> help

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.400 
create if you don't have the get help
from<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.880> software<00:03:11.270> but<00:03:11.750> otherwise<00:03:12.020> you<00:03:12.230> have

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
from the software but otherwise you have

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.740 
from the software but otherwise you have
to<00:03:12.560> follow<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.250> movement<00:03:13.730> very<00:03:14.060> closely<00:03:14.480> very

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
to follow the movement very closely very

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:23.530 
to follow the movement very closely very
carefully<00:03:15.440> at<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.070> background<00:03:22.209> they<00:03:23.209> haven't

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
carefully at the background they haven't

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:36.940 
carefully at the background they haven't
changed<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.900> same<00:03:24.110> ever<00:03:24.709> chase<00:03:24.890> 2.0<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:35.830> it<00:03:36.830> is

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
changed the same ever chase 2.0 so it is

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.650 
changed the same ever chase 2.0 so it is
2.0<00:03:37.850> lens<00:03:38.269> with<00:03:39.170> very<00:03:39.440> wide
