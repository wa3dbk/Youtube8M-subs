00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.450
 a and córdoba the academic vanguard 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.580
 the university of córdoba is the 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.340
 academic structure of the department of 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.809
 Córdoba and its correct functioning 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.610
 depends on the quality of education that 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.650
 It is taught to more than 12,000 students 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.920
 of the lowest strata of 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.050
 department this video collects 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.269
 evidences of obsolescence that 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.609
 present some immovable property of 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.470
 the university as well as the lack of 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.519
 maintenance and oblivion in which 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.239
 others are mired 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:38.219
 adjustments and furniture 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.769
 there are supposedly adequate spaces 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.140
 but not working is the case of 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.180
 block 3 toilets that were 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.760
 restored and inaugurated ago around 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.309
 of one year the furniture in some 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.350
 spaces is deteriorated without renewing or 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.140
 it is stored in classrooms as 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.140
 the classroom 2002 or drawing room 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.059
 paradoxically in other classrooms such as 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:06.310
 called 12 14 and 12 16 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.149
 There are no chairs and the air never have 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.149
 worked correctly 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.720
 there are classrooms where the windows have 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.970
 the broken glass and the vectors are the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.880
 permanent companions of the day 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.670
 academic is not strange to find 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.860
 doors with damaged broken locks or 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.810
 no locks and installations 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.610
 health in laboratories alone 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.520
 they talk about forgetfulness and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.290
 administrative inefficiency in which 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.290
 currently finds the alma mater 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.560
 machinery with cutting-edge technology 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.080
 the machinery in addition to obsolete 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.390
 lack of continuous maintenance 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.730
 although it is intended to make up the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.970
 layers of bright paint the equipments 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.560
 require change and state-of-the-art technology 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.540
 as part of the implements of 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.520
 teaching for students of 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.640
 agronomic engineering program 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.470
 we found punctured machines 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.570
 useless plows 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:17.070
 old and obsolete harvester 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.070
 seeders empowered by rust 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.370
 in the automotive park we find buses 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.879
 old ones which have already finished their 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.799
 life find images like this 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.719
 in which it is difficult for us to describe if 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.599
 this space is a warehouse a 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.489
 parking or a dump this disaster 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.769
 is located less than 100 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.400
 meters of the logistics office of the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.400
 college 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.250
 modern laboratories despite the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.430
 investment that rector emiro says 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.950
 wood kings have made the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.410
 infrastructure in laboratories called the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.930
 attention this space next to one of 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.960
 the laboratories described as achievement of 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.450
 his administration is incomprehensible how 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.400
 you see spaces that work like 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.280
 laboratories without counting the most 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.530
 meager conditions in the case that 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.780
 observe there is storage 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.450
 disposition and management of reagents 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.030
 some of toxic characteristics or 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.160
 flammable products handled outdoors in 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.470
 this space does not exist management of 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.450
 liquid and solid waste received under 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.180
 current regulations rather than a 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.100
 laboratory technology this 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.220
 site looks like a dangerous tent 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.650
 circus for administration is not 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.870
 important to invest in laboratories that 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.110
 they provide services to the community and 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.460
 department companies 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.950
 specifically we refer to the case 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.290
 of the soil and water laboratory 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.269
 the image perfectly describes the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.730
 situation that lives in these laboratories 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.670
 product of abandonment which is 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.260
 evident for months as a sample 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.840
 we have a tank valve 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.300
 elevated was damaged months ago and until 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.950
 today has not been repaired the 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.440
 humidity in addition to causing 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.080
 destruction of the ceiling and ceiling is a 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.480
 focus for the propagation of vectors the 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.640
 Termites are destroying the roof and 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.110
 the materials can be affected and 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.110
 laboratory implements 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.390
 industrial Security 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.930
 we can find boxes of fire extinguishers 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.580
 empty we also find only the 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.590
 boxes for hoses against 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.320
 fires because the hoses are not 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.050
 If a fire should occur in the 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.030
 university the student community is 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.550
 would be at serious risk because there is no way 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.390
 defend against fire 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.390
 and electrical networks 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.200
 despite millionaire contracts 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.330
 made for maintenance and 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.280
 repair of electrical networks of the 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.560
 university is common to find 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.950
 connections and switches that should 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.260
 be protected exposed which 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.630
 represent a high danger to 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.910
 the entire university community in addition 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.629
 of this we find from luminaries to 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.889
 point of falling 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:14.259
 connections in inappropriate places 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.259
 indescribable spiders of cables 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.639
 the palm trees and trees about to break 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.039
 the conductor cables 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.720
 and lights of parks and broken trails 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.060
 and they do not work 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.320
 in the corridors of the offices not 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.320
 there are fluorescent lamps 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.910
 and even worse in our cultural auditorium 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.680
 there are not enough luminaires 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.590
 for the correct lighting of the 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.450
 events that take place here in addition to 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.620
 this on the outside the roof is 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.620
 is falling apart 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.800
 despite all this problem to the 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.830
 inside the university campus for 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.300
 some media outlets are 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.040
 inconsistencies are not enough 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.110
 argument for the discontent of the 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.120
 university community who 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.890
 We claim by right conditions 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.890
 minimum for a quality education
