I<00:00:49.260> started<00:00:50.070> developing<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:51.210> method<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
I started developing this method out of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.080 
I started developing this method out of
frustration<00:00:52.340> because<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.520> British<00:00:53.850> grown

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
frustration because my British grown

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.850 
frustration because my British grown
children<00:00:54.390> couldn't<00:00:55.020> read<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.320> write<00:00:55.469> Chinese

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
children couldn't read or write Chinese

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.920 
children couldn't read or write Chinese
and<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.550> tried<00:00:56.789> many<00:00:57.059> other<00:00:57.180> ways<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and I tried many other ways and I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.900 
and I tried many other ways and I
couldn't<00:00:58.230> find<00:00:58.469> anything<00:00:58.890> effective<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.879> I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
couldn't find anything effective so I

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.720 
couldn't find anything effective so I
decided<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.570> myself<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:02.219> started<00:01:02.609> by

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
decided to do myself and I started by

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.429 
decided to do myself and I started by
breaking<00:01:02.969> down<00:01:03.210> thousands<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> characters

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
breaking down thousands of characters

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.620 
breaking down thousands of characters
and<00:01:04.949> analyze<00:01:05.549> them<00:01:05.790> prioritize<00:01:06.240> them<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
and analyze them prioritize them and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.300 
and analyze them prioritize them and
then<00:01:07.140> eventually<00:01:07.350> come<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
then eventually come up with the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.730 
then eventually come up with the
beautiful<00:01:08.760> illustration<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.780> introduce<00:01:10.290> well

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
we can bring on a graphic that shows our

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.130 
we can bring on a graphic that shows our
audience<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:32.850> much<00:01:33.210> more<00:01:33.450> clearly<00:01:33.689> okay

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

audience just much more clearly okay
we've<00:01:34.799> got<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:34.979> trees<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.259> there

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we've got some trees and I think there

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
we've got some trees and I think there
we<00:01:37.320> go<00:01:37.500> explain<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.369> us<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> tree

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
we go explain this to us that is a tree

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.660 
we go explain this to us that is a tree
it<00:01:39.930> originally<00:01:40.530> from<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> shape<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.369> tree

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it originally from the shape of a tree

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.450 
it originally from the shape of a tree
and<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> put<00:01:42.750> two<00:01:42.990> trees<00:01:43.350> together<00:01:43.710> then

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
and if you put two trees together then

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.730 
and if you put two trees together then
you<00:01:44.700> built<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.180> character<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.110> woods<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you built the character the woods and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.520 
you built the character the woods and
when<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.670> put<00:01:47.880> three<00:01:48.119> together<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:49.229> built

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
when you put three together you built

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.240 
when you put three together you built
the<00:01:49.710> forest<00:01:50.810> as<00:01:51.810> other<00:01:52.049> characters<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:52.979> can

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the forest as other characters you can

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.740 
the forest as other characters you can
carry<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.520> booting<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> ask<00:01:54.540> both<00:01:54.689> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
carry on booting I have to ask both of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.330 
carry on booting I have to ask both of
you<00:01:54.869> how<00:01:55.079> does<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.350> look<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.250> have

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you how does that look to you that have

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.450 
you how does that look to you that have
helped<00:01:56.750> effort<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.259> think<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.710> probably<00:01:58.950> might

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
helped effort I think it probably might

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.039 
helped effort I think it probably might
have<00:01:59.670> felt<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.000> mean<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
have felt I mean I think you know the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.719 
have felt I mean I think you know the
colors<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.710> being<00:02:01.860> sort<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.100> looking<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.610> bit

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
colors and being sort of looking a bit

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.340 
colors and being sort of looking a bit
funny<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.210> might<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.810> helped<00:02:03.990> even<00:02:04.200> though<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
funny it might have helped even though I

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.609 
funny it might have helped even though I
have<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.799> confess<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.250> my<00:02:06.170> Chinese<00:02:07.170> learning

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
have to confess that my Chinese learning

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.520 
have to confess that my Chinese learning
skills<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.310> far<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.759> more<00:02:09.450> emphasized<00:02:10.289> on

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
skills so far have more emphasized on

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.619 
skills so far have more emphasized on
speaking<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.610> think<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.180> gave<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.480> on

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
speaking and I think I have gave up on

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.850 
speaking and I think I have gave up on
reading<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.989> writing<00:02:13.170> because<00:02:13.440> with<00:02:13.590> just

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
reading on writing because with just

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
reading on writing because with just
complicated<00:02:14.520> what<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:14.940> think<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.390> mean<00:02:15.540> I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
complicated what do you think I mean I

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.210 
complicated what do you think I mean I
would<00:02:15.840> have<00:02:15.870> thought<00:02:16.170> because<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.770> tonal

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
would have thought because of the tonal

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.650 
would have thought because of the tonal
nature<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.550> Chinese<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> speaking

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
nature of Chinese that it's the speaking

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.690 
nature of Chinese that it's the speaking
that<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.020> harder<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.740> what<00:02:20.520> your

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
that is harder is that what your

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.310 
that is harder is that what your
experience<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.240> not<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.480> for<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.870> Vietnamese

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
experience is not in for a Vietnamese

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.100 
experience is not in for a Vietnamese
many<00:02:22.710> Chinese<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.370> see<00:02:23.700> because<00:02:24.060> we<00:02:24.780> have<00:02:24.930> even

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
many Chinese I see because we have even

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.270 
many Chinese I see because we have even
more<00:02:25.260> accents<00:02:26.630> more<00:02:27.630> tones<00:02:27.930> compared<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.890> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
more accents more tones compared to a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.390 
more accents more tones compared to a
Chinese<00:02:29.730> system<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.660> speaking<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.710> easier<00:02:32.070> for

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
Chinese system so speaking is easier for

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.340 
Chinese system so speaking is easier for
Vietnamese<00:02:33.000> learning<00:02:33.510> Chinese<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:34.080> reading

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
Vietnamese learning Chinese but reading

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.590 
Vietnamese learning Chinese but reading
and<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.730> writing

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
and and writing

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.680 
and and writing
I<00:02:36.630> find<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.680> most<00:02:37.800> challenging<00:02:38.510> what<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.600> you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
I find the most challenging what do you

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.210 
I find the most challenging what do you
think<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:39.990> most<00:02:40.170> important<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> early

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
think is most important in the early

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.340 
think is most important in the early
stages<00:02:41.490> is<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.150> learning<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.990> read<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.170> write

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
stages is it learning to read and write

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.320 
stages is it learning to read and write
or<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.040> working<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.640> speech<00:02:44.940> because

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
or is it working on speech because

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.060 
or is it working on speech because
normally<00:02:45.840> when<00:02:45.990> you<00:02:46.080> learn<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> language<00:02:46.470> it's

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
normally when you learn a language it's

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.710 
normally when you learn a language it's
the<00:02:47.250> speech<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.030> most<00:02:48.209> important<00:02:48.690> I

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the speech that is the most important I

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.449 
the speech that is the most important I
almost<00:02:49.170> argue<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.800> both<00:02:50.010> are<00:02:50.160> equally

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
almost argue that both are equally

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.880 
almost argue that both are equally
important<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.209> learning<00:02:51.959> how<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.320> read<00:02:52.680> is

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
important but learning how to read is

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
important but learning how to read is
actually<00:02:53.370> much<00:02:53.610> easier<00:02:54.060> than<00:02:54.180> most<00:02:54.300> people

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
actually much easier than most people

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.840 
actually much easier than most people
think<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.110> also<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.920> understanding<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
think and also the understanding the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.600 
think and also the understanding the
degree<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.239> understanding<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.230> a

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
degree of understanding of it a

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.160 
degree of understanding of it a
country's<00:02:59.610> real<00:02:59.910> culture<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.570> history<00:03:00.930> is

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
country's real culture and history is

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.650 
country's real culture and history is
actually<00:03:01.620> more<00:03:02.310> fascinating<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:03.540> you

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
actually more fascinating and if you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.810 
actually more fascinating and if you
learn<00:03:03.870> how<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.050> speak<00:03:04.470> very<00:03:04.920> often<00:03:05.310> when

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
learn how to speak very often when

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.460 
learn how to speak very often when
you're<00:03:05.970> beginner<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.810> will<00:03:06.959> try<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.170> learn

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
you're beginner you will try to learn

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.280 
you're beginner you will try to learn
how<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.709> repeat<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:09.030> sound<00:03:09.330> pronunciation

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
how to repeat the sound pronunciation

how to repeat the sound pronunciation
the<00:03:10.650> intonation<00:03:10.950> but<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.940> terms<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.300> how<00:03:12.450> to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
the intonation but in terms of how to

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.430 
the intonation but in terms of how to
read<00:03:13.560> by<00:03:14.550> using<00:03:14.910> my<00:03:15.060> method<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.930> can<00:03:16.140> probably

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
read by using my method you can probably

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.949 
read by using my method you can probably
pick<00:03:16.770> up<00:03:16.800> 20<00:03:17.370> 30<00:03:17.400> characters<00:03:17.970> within<00:03:18.570> five<00:03:18.780> or

of the methodology you can start

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.670 
of the methodology you can start

time that I was in in China do they they
found<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.980> interesting<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.299> know

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.640 
found it interesting that you know
people<00:04:00.570> from<00:04:00.750> foreign<00:04:01.049> countries<00:04:01.110> would<00:04:01.500> come

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
people from foreign countries would come

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.440 
people from foreign countries would come
over<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.040> learn<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.400> make<00:04:02.850> an<00:04:02.970> effort<00:04:03.120> to

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
over and learn and make an effort to

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.310 
over and learn and make an effort to
learn<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.720> language<00:04:03.989> we<00:04:04.110> were<00:04:04.200> very

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
learn the language we were very

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.630 
learn the language we were very
optimistic<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:05.070> they<00:04:05.130> were<00:04:05.250> very<00:04:05.310> happy

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
optimistic and they were very happy

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.490 
optimistic and they were very happy
about<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.150> therefore<00:04:06.450> they<00:04:06.690> helped<00:04:07.350> me

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
about it and therefore they helped me

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.720 
about it and therefore they helped me
even<00:04:07.680> though<00:04:07.830> I<00:04:07.860> think<00:04:08.010> sometimes<00:04:08.489> they<00:04:08.610> would

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
even though I think sometimes they would

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.009 
even though I think sometimes they would
just<00:04:08.850> say<00:04:08.940> all<00:04:09.060> your<00:04:09.209> Chinese<00:04:09.480> is<00:04:09.510> excellent

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
even though I think it wasn't that

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.620 
even though I think it wasn't that
excellent<00:04:11.400> at<00:04:11.489> all<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.360> what<00:04:12.480> about
