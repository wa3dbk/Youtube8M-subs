I have some crickets up in there

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.469 
I have some crickets up in there
although<00:01:16.310> he<00:01:17.310> knows<00:01:17.520> our<00:01:17.759> tiny<00:01:18.060> tiny<00:01:18.390> tiny

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
he doesn't seem to hunt for them so it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
he doesn't seem to hunt for them so it
might<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.900> because<00:01:25.140> I've<00:01:25.710> only<00:01:25.950> had<00:01:26.130> him

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
might just be because I've only had him

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.550 
might just be because I've only had him
for<00:01:26.310> two<00:01:26.549> weeks<00:01:26.820> give<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> some<00:01:28.080> time<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.320> see

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.640 
in the background I got from Petsmart
and<00:02:13.099> they<00:02:13.489> cut<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.730> down<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.209> size<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.290> added

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
and they cut it down to size and added

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.339 
and they cut it down to size and added
some<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.519> bottom<00:02:16.819> they<00:02:17.450> came<00:02:17.630> as<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.810> 12<00:02:18.140> by

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
some to the bottom they came as a 12 by

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.290 
some to the bottom they came as a 12 by
18<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.130> needed<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:20.410> 10<00:02:21.410> by<00:02:21.709> 20<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.910> cut<00:02:23.150> some

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
18 but I needed a 10 by 20 so I cut some

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.699 
18 but I needed a 10 by 20 so I cut some
off<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.480> side<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.019> I<00:02:24.080> added<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.530> the

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
off the side and I added it to the

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.680 
off the side and I added it to the
bottom<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.099> hot-glued<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.000> back<00:02:26.209> the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
bottom I hot-glued it in the back the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.110 
bottom I hot-glued it in the back the
only<00:02:26.810> problem<00:02:27.349> is<00:02:27.470> now<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:28.130> about<00:02:28.510> maybe

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
only problem is now it's about maybe

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.420 
only problem is now it's about maybe
fourths<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.209> an<00:02:32.360> inch<00:02:32.480> half<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.380> an<00:02:33.500> inch<00:02:33.620> too

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
fourths of an inch half of an inch too

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.720 
fourths of an inch half of an inch too
short<00:02:34.700> on<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:34.970> side<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.799> he<00:02:36.799> can<00:02:37.010> climb<00:02:37.280> along

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
short on the side so he can climb along

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.170 
short on the side so he can climb along
the<00:02:38.030> sides<00:02:38.269> now<00:02:38.650> let's<00:02:39.650> see<00:02:39.769> if<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:39.920> can<00:02:40.150> get<00:02:41.150> a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
the sides now let's see if I can get a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.930 
the sides now let's see if I can get a
good<00:02:41.390> view<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:46.190> kind<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.489> bows<00:02:46.700> out

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
good view and it kind of bows out

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.880 
good view and it kind of bows out
towards<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.660> front<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.200> there's<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.769> little

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
towards the front so there's a little

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.589 
towards the front so there's a little
bit<00:02:49.069> of<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.220> gap<00:02:49.430> behind<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.209> have<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.480> figure

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
bit of a gap behind it I have to figure

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.229 
bit of a gap behind it I have to figure
out<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.840> way<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:52.040> tried<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.579> use<00:02:52.670> some<00:02:52.700> tape<00:02:53.030> and

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
out a way I tried to use some tape and

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.670 
out a way I tried to use some tape and
it<00:02:53.360> didn't<00:02:53.569> work<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.989> think<00:02:54.290> I'm<00:02:54.380> gonna<00:02:54.500> use

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
it didn't work so I think I'm gonna use

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.630 
it didn't work so I think I'm gonna use
some<00:02:54.709> velcro<00:02:56.709> should<00:02:57.709> have<00:02:57.890> some<00:02:58.130> around<00:02:58.370> here

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
some velcro should have some around here

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.400 
some velcro should have some around here
and<00:02:58.790> hopefully<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.569> velcro<00:02:59.750> will<00:03:00.110> be<00:03:00.200> strong

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
and hopefully the velcro will be strong

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.960 
and hopefully the velcro will be strong
enough<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.680> hold<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.069> back<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:01.489> he<00:03:01.579> can't<00:03:01.790> climb

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
enough to hold it back so he can't climb

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.490 
enough to hold it back so he can't climb
behind<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.510> cuz<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.750> did<00:03:02.930> find<00:03:03.170> him<00:03:03.319> today

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
behind it cuz I did find him today

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.740 
behind it cuz I did find him today
behind<00:03:03.950> there<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:06.790> have<00:03:07.790> my<00:03:08.060> temperature<00:03:08.690> gauge

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
behind there I have my temperature gauge

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.849 
behind there I have my temperature gauge
right<00:03:09.620> up<00:03:09.769> here<00:03:09.950> in<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.130> front<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:11.859> the

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
right up here in the front and the

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.199 
right up here in the front and the
humidity<00:03:13.400> gauge<00:03:13.549> right<00:03:13.970> there<00:03:14.239> as<00:03:14.450> well<00:03:16.209> and

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
humidity gauge right there as well and

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.900 
humidity gauge right there as well and
yeah<00:03:17.569> I<00:03:17.870> think<00:03:18.380> that<00:03:18.560> turned<00:03:19.190> out<00:03:19.400> great<00:03:19.430> I

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
yeah I think that turned out great I

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.120 
yeah I think that turned out great I
have<00:03:20.180> two<00:03:20.389> food<00:03:20.870> dishes<00:03:21.079> at<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.500> moment<00:03:21.829> since

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
have two food dishes at the moment since

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.949 
have two food dishes at the moment since
I<00:03:22.310> just<00:03:22.370> moved<00:03:22.790> habitats<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:23.630> want<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.840> make

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
I just moved habitats and I want to make

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.210 
I just moved habitats and I want to make
sure<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.319> he<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:25.430> find<00:03:25.670> his<00:03:25.850> food<00:03:26.060> easily

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
sure that he can find his food easily

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.599 
sure that he can find his food easily
and<00:03:29.109> it<00:03:30.109> was<00:03:30.230> pretty<00:03:30.470> easy<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.980> make<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.400> have
