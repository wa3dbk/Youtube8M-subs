00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
Sun so taking a look over all these

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.420 
Sun so taking a look over all these
colors<00:01:11.300> we<00:01:11.780> can<00:01:11.810> see<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.830> front<00:01:13.130> looks

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
the same on all these variants which is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.680 
the same on all these variants which is
the<00:01:16.430> white<00:01:16.610> plug<00:01:16.850> variant<00:01:17.119> which<00:01:17.210> we<00:01:17.360> have<00:01:17.509> the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
the white plug variant which we have the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.690 
the white plug variant which we have the
black<00:01:17.899> color<00:01:18.110> variant<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.649> the<00:01:19.010> purple<00:01:19.520> color
