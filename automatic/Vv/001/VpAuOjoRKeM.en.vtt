cheap<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.890> classic<00:00:50.399> ii<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.820> had<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.030> idea

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
cheap and classic ii so we had this idea

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.330 
cheap and classic ii so we had this idea
why<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.079> make<00:00:52.379> an<00:00:52.530> anime<00:00:52.920> where<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340

characters are all cheap and plasticky

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.709 
characters are all cheap and plasticky
so<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.829> story<00:00:56.190> about<00:00:56.420> android<00:00:57.420> sex

Jeep the visuals are often very dark a
lot<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.179> times<00:02:09.330> there's<00:02:09.509> action

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
lot of times there's action

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.990 
lot of times there's action
is<00:02:10.020> very<00:02:10.260> muddle<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.770> very<00:02:11.430> hard<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.790> see

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
is very muddle it very hard to see

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.280 
is very muddle it very hard to see
what's<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.690> some<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.930> action

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
what's going on and some of the action

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.620 
what's going on and some of the action
shots<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.910> think<00:02:15.060> some<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.210> this<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.480> just

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
shots and I think some of this is just

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.070 
shots and I think some of this is just
an<00:02:15.720> experience<00:02:16.080> with<00:02:16.410> CGI<00:02:16.710> some<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.850> is

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
an experience with CGI some of it is

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.540 
an experience with CGI some of it is
maybe<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.170> bad<00:02:19.320> transfer<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.520> general

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
maybe a bad transfer but just in general

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.330 
maybe a bad transfer but just in general
you<00:02:20.940> know<00:02:21.530> don't<00:02:22.530> watch<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
you know don't watch this for the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.880 
you know don't watch this for the
graphics<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.820> put<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.150> way<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.440> set<00:02:25.770> in

a<00:02:25.950> very<00:02:26.130> striking<00:02:26.520> world<00:02:27.060> visually<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.080> think

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
a very striking world visually I think

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.680 
a very striking world visually I think
technol<00:02:28.620> eyes<00:02:28.770> owes<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> lot<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.390> visual

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
like that which is awfully nice speaking

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.060 
like that which is awfully nice speaking
of<00:03:03.120> characters<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.620> where<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:04.770> things<00:03:04.920> get

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
of characters this is where I things get

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.740 
of characters this is where I things get
interesting<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:05.670> again<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.600> part

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
interesting because again this is part

does it mean to be biological what are
the<00:04:39.599> the<00:04:40.080> consequences<00:04:40.710> of<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:41.150> it's<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.210> very

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
the the consequences of that it's a very

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.029 
the the consequences of that it's a very
different<00:04:42.990> mode<00:04:43.409> of<00:04:43.440> being<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:46.039> that's

interesting that's really interesting to
see<00:04:48.870> how<00:04:49.020> how<00:04:49.470> these<00:04:49.650> robots<00:04:49.919> react<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.370> this

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.290 
see how how these robots react to this
especially<00:04:51.930> because<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.199> voices<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:54.000> the

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
especially because the voices the the

actors do a very good job of having the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.990 
actors do a very good job of having the
robots<00:04:57.690> have<00:04:58.050> relatively<00:04:58.860> minimal<00:04:59.130> emotion

robots have relatively minimal emotion

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.999 
robots have relatively minimal emotion
