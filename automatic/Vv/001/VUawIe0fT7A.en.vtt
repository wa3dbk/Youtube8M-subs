00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:12.840
 so I show you my beautiful 280 s 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.190
 mercedes w 108 year 71 so already 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.780
 some years on the hump 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.220
 I have had him for six years now 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.369
 but last year I have him at all 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.930
 not driving and for this they then but 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.300
 too expensive and too bad so would 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.510
 now sold in recent years 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.660
 made a lot of mistakes he is technical 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.010
 and from the engine I would say one 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:42.230
 good 2 from the sheet metal and from the sheet metal he two 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.950
 to three and from the country three not so 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.379
 intoxicating but wonderful to drive 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.559
 So the new one from november last 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.559
 year 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.660
 yes, what has been done last 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.129
 years of getting new shock absorbers 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.899
 new tires also have one now 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.270
 today's maturity format registered 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.980
 but enter 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.810
 from the tüv that you are allowed to drive 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.990
 so new all-season tires 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.820
 he has the coveted one-piece 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.300
 headlights I have exchanged 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.780
 Has 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.570
 the two-piece headlights that's there 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.600
 if someone had bock then then 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.590
 the carburetor was overhauled by the carburettor 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.110
 professional from the vdh since then the mercedes 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.720
 club par excellence and manfred has 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:41.670
 Schumacher had overtaken so are too 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:43.530
 optimally adjusted he also sees them 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.220
 still very nice, so he has the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.040
 mp-tec seats which are relatively harmless 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.470
 so there's nothing there 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:59.220
 which would have been possible somehow 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.119
 also the complete floor mats set the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.119
 are still very good 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:12.980
 his driver was still very good 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:20.160
 Doormats underneath the 0 already and run 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:23.870
 yes what else in naturally friendly 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.840
 Baroque in wood he has a full 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.730
 functional becker comes along as well 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.540
 mechanical tuning of the well 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.320
 is working 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:42.180
 the antenna also works over the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:44.280
 band automatically gives it antenna does it 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.060
 on the rare seen that 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.060
 she works 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.860
 and as I said 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.650
 also send so also does so 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.650
 that a very nice part so naumann 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:24.499
 So the engine is running wonderfully 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:26.989
 Switches free farm is a round 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:30.620
 of course a stately star 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.280
 followed up and had with 140 ps 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.280
 also good bums 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.250
 So he's in a mood 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.489
 with more and more had gone on vacation 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.670
 so completely unproblematic of course 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.659
 had a thirst of something about today 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:56.560
 wisely 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.129
 it is clear but such a car drives more 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.310
 neither 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.310
 to save the motto 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.780
 I would always have nice with the vehicle 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.880
 has the most fun the green too 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.620
 throw 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.620
 because the numbers are no longer dedicated today 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.980
 he has the 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.700
 a six-cylinder engine with carburetor 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.230
 for gas 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.880
 it reports to one 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.110
 electronic ignition so here is the 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.720
 Chronic are in it 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.420
 and also complete wiring 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.070
 New 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.840
 There was a lot of new battery 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.840
 Of course it will be re-sealed 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 Yes 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.650
 on the red sea ​​flowed 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.460
 announce jobs 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.640
 there 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.540
 everything as it should be oh so important 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.460
 nor does he have an electric sunroof 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.460
 which also works perfectly 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.340
 that was sometime with a lot of effort 2 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.910
 days some spare parts work 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:32.030
 completely overhauled and revised on that 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.240
 he again nice closes but what 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.240
 still 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:44.689
 the chrome is relatively okay 

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:46.759
 has a fine tip but it is 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:49.089
 relatively good so she just occurs 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:54.349
 neat in the chrome 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:06:00.709
 Of course there is no delay closed 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:02.419
 is not there a shocker case with it 

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:03.949
 there are still some spare parts 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.679
 old headlight a few old 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:14.469
 carburetors from which we served for 

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:19.129
 the parts that are there to yes to the tin 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:20.809
 as I said, paint is okay but definitely 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.189
 does not satisfy the highest demands that 

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.739
 there are so few places just around 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:26.929
 was tinkered 

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:28.429
 but in principle there is no 

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:31.069
 rust through a little rust 

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:33.139
 As I said, it is relatively new 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:34.099
 therefore systems is also systemic 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:38.299
 nothing bad 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:42.619
 the only thing that needs to be done 

00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:44.749
 is completely he has here at the fender there 

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:46.429
 it's definitely likely 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:49.729
 rusty from below I think 

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:52.879
 it has to be done so it needs 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:54.889
 just balls new fender respectively 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.809
 the tin must be ran 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.219
 That must be done in any case 

00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:00.219
 I did not start that anymore 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:07.969
 otherwise fine car makes you mood 

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:10.440
 but I drive perfectly in everyday life 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:14.110
 I'm two years again 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:17.290
 driven as an everyday vehicle and 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.520
 Of course you drive with the stern in front 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.690
 It is always the good one 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.610
 optimal oldtimer to expect for yourself 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:28.230
 at the mercedes has just cleaned up 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:30.460
 constructively mature clearly and 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:33.160
 constructed so that you can keep it there 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.740
 good at tinkering and you get 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.919
 he all share it gives the vdh the 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.540
 a club that provides everything 

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:45.030
 and not much of what mercedes not 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.030
 more has gotten along well from there 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.880
 then I hope you like it and who 

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.460
 has interest 

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.460
 please just say thank you
