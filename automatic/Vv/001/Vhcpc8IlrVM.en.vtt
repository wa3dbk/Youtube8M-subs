material<00:02:14.310> wet<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:16.080> use<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.890> spoon<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.420> can

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
material wet you can use a spoon you can

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.920 
material wet you can use a spoon you can
use<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.440> paint<00:02:19.739> stick<00:02:20.069> whatever<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.120> want<00:02:21.360> just

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
get the material a little bit wet and

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.130 
get the material a little bit wet and
then<00:02:26.730> we<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:26.940> start<00:02:27.180> mixing<00:02:27.390> we're<00:02:27.870> going<00:02:28.019> to

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
then we can start mixing we're going to

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:40.140 
then we can start mixing we're going to
start<00:02:28.410> mixing<00:02:28.590> at<00:02:28.890> low<00:02:29.040> speed

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.559 

mix<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.299> up<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.510> little<00:02:41.599> bit<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.709> then<00:02:43.540> add<00:02:44.540> a

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
mix it up a little bit and then add a

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.990 
mix it up a little bit and then add a
little<00:02:44.659> bit<00:02:44.870> more<00:02:45.019> water<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:49.010> again<00:02:49.219> a<00:02:49.730> little

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
little bit more water and again a little

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.250 
little bit more water and again a little
more<00:02:50.299> power<00:02:55.359> go<00:02:56.359> ahead<00:02:56.629> and<00:02:56.750> use<00:02:56.870> your<00:02:56.900> spatula

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
more power go ahead and use your spatula

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:15.680 
more power go ahead and use your spatula
again

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:26.730 

mixer

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:35.199 

okay<00:03:28.180> now<00:03:29.180> for<00:03:29.240> the<00:03:29.450> rest<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.959> water<00:03:34.209> and

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
okay now for the rest of the water and

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:56.150 
okay now for the rest of the water and
the<00:03:35.540> rest<00:03:35.720> of<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.900> powder

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.700 

just<00:03:56.820> like<00:03:57.000> making<00:03:57.210> a<00:03:57.420> cake<00:03:57.660> you're<00:03:58.500> stirring

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
just like making a cake you're stirring

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:07.250 
just like making a cake you're stirring
up<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.010> batter<00:03:59.220> mix<00:04:03.950> up<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.510> slowly<00:04:06.510> first

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
up the batter mix up and slowly first

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.220 
up the batter mix up and slowly first
and<00:04:08.420> then<00:04:09.420> we're<00:04:09.510> going<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.780> increase<00:04:10.080> the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
and then we're going to increase the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:19.539 
and then we're going to increase the
speed

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.900 

it's<00:04:20.549> going<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.789> scrape<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.329> edges<00:04:21.449> again

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
it's going to scrape the edges again

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.590 
it's going to scrape the edges again
just<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:24.060> little<00:04:24.360> bit<00:04:24.570> here<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:26.180> my<00:04:27.180> powder

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
just a little bit here just my powder

00:04:27.600 --> 00:05:09.409 
just a little bit here just my powder
off<00:04:28.020> or<00:04:28.199> the<00:04:28.289> spatula

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.389 

now<00:05:10.419> this<00:05:10.899> amount<00:05:11.259> of<00:05:11.379> water<00:05:11.649> is<00:05:11.889> really<00:05:12.099> just

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:12.399 
now this amount of water is really just

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:15.059 
now this amount of water is really just
a<00:05:12.489> jumping-off<00:05:12.999> point<00:05:13.389> this<00:05:14.289> pain<00:05:14.589> tends<00:05:14.889> to

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
a jumping-off point this pain tends to

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.939 
a jumping-off point this pain tends to
thicken<00:05:15.489> a<00:05:15.909> bit<00:05:16.449> as<00:05:16.719> it<00:05:16.899> stands<00:05:17.229> especially<00:05:17.859> in

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
thicken a bit as it stands especially in

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.619 
thicken a bit as it stands especially in
the<00:05:18.009> first<00:05:18.279> half<00:05:18.519> hour<00:05:18.699> or<00:05:18.999> so<00:05:19.059> after<00:05:19.419> you've

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:19.629 
the first half hour or so after you've

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.349 
the first half hour or so after you've
mixed<00:05:19.839> it<00:05:20.139> so<00:05:20.859> it's<00:05:21.369> okay<00:05:21.699> to<00:05:21.759> go<00:05:21.969> ahead<00:05:22.089> and

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:22.359 
mixed it so it's okay to go ahead and

00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:24.179 
mixed it so it's okay to go ahead and
add<00:05:22.479> just<00:05:22.749> a<00:05:22.899> little<00:05:22.929> bit<00:05:23.379> more<00:05:23.589> water<00:05:23.799> if<00:05:24.039> you

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:24.189 
add just a little bit more water if you

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.629 
add just a little bit more water if you
need<00:05:24.399> to<00:05:24.989> you<00:05:25.989> don't<00:05:26.079> want<00:05:26.349> too<00:05:26.619> thin<00:05:26.949> because

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
need to you don't want too thin because

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.209 
need to you don't want too thin because
then<00:05:27.999> you<00:05:28.119> won't<00:05:28.299> get<00:05:28.449> as<00:05:28.659> good<00:05:28.869> coverage<00:05:29.379> but

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:30.219 
then you won't get as good coverage but

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:32.689 
then you won't get as good coverage but
you<00:05:30.369> wanted<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:30.729> be<00:05:30.879> on<00:05:31.329> the<00:05:31.449> consistency<00:05:31.809> of

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
you wanted to be on the consistency of

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.879 
you wanted to be on the consistency of
any<00:05:33.699> regular<00:05:33.999> pain<00:05:34.479> they're<00:05:34.689> used<00:05:34.899> to<00:05:35.019> using

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
any regular pain they're used to using

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.189 
any regular pain they're used to using
so<00:05:36.339> feel<00:05:37.119> free<00:05:37.329> to<00:05:37.359> add<00:05:37.599> just<00:05:37.749> a<00:05:37.899> little<00:05:37.929> bit

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
so feel free to add just a little bit

00:05:38.199 --> 00:06:11.060 
so feel free to add just a little bit
more<00:05:38.409> water<00:05:38.679> if<00:05:38.889> you

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.980 

again<00:06:12.070> you<00:06:12.430> really<00:06:12.730> can't<00:06:12.970> mix<00:06:13.210> it<00:06:13.389> up<00:06:13.510> too

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
again you really can't mix it up too

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.530 
again you really can't mix it up too
long<00:06:14.260> four<00:06:14.770> or<00:06:14.889> five<00:06:15.070> minutes<00:06:15.430> on<00:06:15.580> my<00:06:15.760> speed<00:06:16.150> at

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
long four or five minutes on my speed at

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.990 
long four or five minutes on my speed at
least<00:06:17.230> when<00:06:18.010> you're<00:06:18.130> done<00:06:18.340> it<00:06:18.639> should<00:06:18.820> really

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
least when you're done it should really

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:29.600 
least when you're done it should really
just<00:06:19.120> be<00:06:19.419> nice<00:06:19.840> and<00:06:20.200> creamy<00:06:20.980> and<00:06:21.460> smooth

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.040 

she'll<00:06:30.610> just<00:06:30.880> look<00:06:31.090> like<00:06:31.240> ordinary<00:06:31.690> paint

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050
