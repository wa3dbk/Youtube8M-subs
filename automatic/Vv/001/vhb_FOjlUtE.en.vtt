00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.059
 we will talk about the urban legends series 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.980
 today of a very particular myth of the 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.080
 online poker the one according to which you do 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.969
 cash out would stop winning at 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.920
 try to debunk this poker myth 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.000
 is flavio ferrari zumbini of the pro team 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.720
 digital game 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.720
 we hear talk 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.250
 another false myth to discuss 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.860
 naturally to dispel 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.970
 if I make cash out then after poker 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.610
 room and makes you lose 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.220
 now it seems that they naturally shelter at a 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.580
 impoverishment of the poker room for which 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.410
 there may be something rational about it 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.239
 behind in the sense it is a customer who does 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.559
 go but you realize that naturally 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.780
 it is impossible to insert inside a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.090
 game algorithm a parameter that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.340
 nothing to see you play what you are 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 theorizing that you lose because you have 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.640
 fact that is recently dissolved while the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.540
 player in front of you won for 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.940
 what 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.199
 who did that shout of how much between two 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.000
 players who did that shot 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.860
 in the last month who should win 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.540
 among one who made 5 grown up 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.250
 in the last month compared to the player 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.990
 who made one but much more 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.700
 voluminous as quantity who owes 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.560
 win what must happen 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.080
 they are of course absurd parameters 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.390
 it is not true that its own Rome 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.250
 wants to share money in the best 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.960
 possible way this tries to do it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.260
 through promotions and incentives 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.930
 to play through an eco system 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.759
 sustainable search for players and 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.979
 naturally amateur of players who 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.740
 instead they are so many hours on the platform 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.869
 it is clear that poker rooms have instead 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.939
 absolutely no need to advertise 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.159
 of the winners then of the people who 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.869
 they grow constantly and that 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.820
 continue to win over time 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.039
 this is the message that has passed 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.780
 if indeed after the cash out yes 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.520
 began losing the winning players 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.649
 they would always and only for a moment 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.170
 very short time and sooner or later 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.520
 they make ten cars 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.070
 therefore necessarily begin a 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.150
 lose if you really want to believe one 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.430
 legend of this type 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.049
 not to mention last naturally 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.580
 of the fact that it is a parameter that this 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.200
 surreptitiously inserted type 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.849
 within a game win 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.709
 it would be a nice and good scam 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.150
 which of course is not acceptable by the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.530
 legal point of view that is the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.150
 control by the monopolies of the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.720
 that is, control by the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.720
 pure common sense
