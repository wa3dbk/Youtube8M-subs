00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
around and you're going to keep

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.590 
around and you're going to keep
spiraling<00:04:27.190> until<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:27.789> get<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.360> middle

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.240 
on top because you don't want those
stitches<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.229> show<00:04:44.410> so<00:04:44.650> you<00:04:44.710> can<00:04:44.919> do<00:04:45.010> that<00:04:45.130> with

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
stitches to show so you can do that with

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.620 
stitches to show so you can do that with
regular<00:04:45.639> fabric<00:04:45.820> if<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.210> want<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.600> or

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
contrasting piece of felt and then you

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.600 
contrasting piece of felt and then you
would<00:04:49.360> just<00:04:49.389> tie<00:04:49.780> you<00:04:50.770> were<00:04:50.860> just<00:04:51.039> so<00:04:51.190> on<00:04:51.400> your

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
would just tie you were just so on your

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.520 
would just tie you were just so on your
little<00:04:51.910> pin<00:04:52.180> backing<00:04:52.630> I<00:04:52.840> couldn't<00:04:53.080> find<00:04:53.289> one

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
little pin backing I couldn't find one

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.290 
little pin backing I couldn't find one
so<00:04:53.560> I<00:04:53.800> just<00:04:54.010> used<00:04:54.160> to<00:04:54.310> safety<00:04:54.639> pin<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:55.060> that

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
so I just used to safety pin and that

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.060 
so I just used to safety pin and that
will<00:04:55.389> work<00:04:55.510> too<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:56.080> then<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:56.770> can<00:04:56.919> just

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
the craft paper which comes in the kit

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.400 
the craft paper which comes in the kit
and<00:05:32.190> decorating<00:05:32.790> it<00:05:32.940> for<00:05:33.330> some<00:05:33.660> fun<00:05:33.960> wrapping

paper<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:36.060> first<00:05:36.710> weighted<00:05:37.710> that<00:05:38.430> I

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
paper the first weighted that I

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.550 
paper the first weighted that I
decorated<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.300> paper<00:05:39.570> was<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:40.050> take<00:05:40.260> some

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
decorated the paper was to take some

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.840 
decorated the paper was to take some
just<00:05:40.800> some<00:05:40.980> basic<00:05:41.400> acrylic<00:05:41.880> paint<00:05:46.070> and<00:05:47.070> a

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
just some basic acrylic paint and a

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.300 
just some basic acrylic paint and a
couple<00:05:48.420> of<00:05:48.570> brushes<00:05:48.840> one<00:05:49.380> for<00:05:49.560> each<00:05:49.680> color<00:05:50.010> so

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
couple of brushes one for each color so

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.730 
couple of brushes one for each color so
that's<00:05:50.490> four<00:05:50.730> more<00:05:50.910> quickly<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.750> I<00:05:52.440> believe

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
that's four more quickly and I believe

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.280 
that's four more quickly and I believe
it<00:05:52.860> or<00:05:52.920> not<00:05:53.040> I<00:05:53.280> went<00:05:53.490> outside<00:05:53.640> and<00:05:54.290> trimmed
