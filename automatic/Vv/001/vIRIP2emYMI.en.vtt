00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:09.190
 Well, we continue to review our 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:12.580
 kia rio here's the phone does not really give me 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.660
 ok to record a video then damn someone 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:21.250
 call that memory is not enough phone 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:24.300
 then some more damn incidents but 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:30.189
 we are going to move on now 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.869
 rough road more precisely so now 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:38.079
 just a moment to overcome this experience 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:40.660
 turn rather to the ground and I hope 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.739
 what's the sound you hear will 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.539
 not good enough than because 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.860
 I would like to when buying a car 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:54.070
 hear in general how it sounds like 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.250
 how do you see science i steer with one hand 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.180
 I switch here to us 2 act now 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.309
 let us have a little bit 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 speed, add bye listen to the sound 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.610
 so some helicopters started right away 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.610
 fly over us 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.350
 frankly nothing anywhere 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.049
 approximations of which are collected in principle 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:28.299
 we in St. Petersburg collect them soundly here 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.299
 cones helicopter here we open the window 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.600
 almost the same was heard in 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.960
 car that is external noise and heard 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.810
 well quite clearly here that is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.570
 insulation here to put it mildly yes well not 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.049
 to say the least and you know well, such tolerant 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.119
 i would say so i honestly i would 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.640
 did probably here nevertheless 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:03.630
 soundproofing soundproofing arches here 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:06.750
 wheeled I do not lead and all that well 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.549
 what now let me go on show it 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.549
 outside all the same car tear off 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.549
 great 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.190
 Well, so he looks here with us this 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.830
 always numbers do not want to show 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.910
 is show numbers 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:33.310
 Well, here we have sedanchik 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.450
 Dunchik here such a park, they are bad 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.950
 only one would say not enough 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.010
 probably headlight washers 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.350
 I would gladly put it all 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.580
 we have wheels 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.730
 by the way in this configuration go low 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.660
 Do we have all the disks at dac ? 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.160
 diameter of 15 including the spare here 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.750
 I guess I think that they have fallen to the floor 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.520
 In general, there is a difference you probably yourself 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.130
 look at the reviews I think someone will 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.160
 do attacked solaris and you probably 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.930
 see for yourself 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.090
 that he can still show the trunk 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.880
 roomy enough that's my dear 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.890
 us luggage handle go jar 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.380
 I hope I'm a fool not an example of that, 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.430
 phone talk about for what 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:27.109
 way than the trunk are you here with us 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.939
 5 a bunch of all sorts of garbage 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.750
 big enough trunk i will tell you 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:38.280
 I have 2 liters of special you here 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:45.359
 you will push nothing big but here 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:47.939
 they are such nonsense little pen is so very 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.099
 convenient what else to say if 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.959
 buy a regular car please 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.310
 check he fought the lines like 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.760
 checked the car or did not fight already 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.250
 the review comes in the form of a beaten car type 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.169
 since he was fighting me, I already had enough 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.430
 I know a lot about it mean look 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.810
 the first thing you notice in B 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.080
 car fought 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.810
 it means the sled on which the seats go 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.140
 mean if much with a strong blow 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.430
 it turns out that they also bend and 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.980
 the chair has to be not so easy to walk 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.630
 now I see it with one hand 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.880
 regulates ie it means a strong blow 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.860
 there was no blow accounted for this side 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.560
 experience we even have a crack well this 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.810
 obviously we have such odorous to not pay 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.420
 attention what here so means like 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.350
 check the details on the shower example at the very 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.870
 See business turn the steering wheel look 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:53.560
 here that is, under the steering wheel 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:56.450
 if here the gap is wide then you see 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.260
 wide the gap actually i'm here 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.210
 see even in the face 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:05.190
 it means something is not what you need 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:07.050
 be sure to check the natural 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.270
 authorized dealer but you buy something 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.580
 accordingly, I think there they should 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.170
 be these pillows then check 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:21.750
 passenger's pillow we put our hand in 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:24.720
 glove up here as far as possible 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.240
 and and slips my hand and I practically 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.640
 I know you know where to here here 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:36.150
 I mean, here are the pads, no damn 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:40.260
 to the opinion that is i made a car 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.840
 pillows did not put here side pillows 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:47.430
 I honestly do not know how to check the 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.560
 me they did not fire on this yet that well 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.080
 Look at the example if I run 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.640
 sell a car 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.240
 if anyone knows anyway see what 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.090
 she is cute 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.800
 firstly this is a crack yes i can 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.410
 tell that kutasov puts om 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.550
 speaker or something else but this 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:08.270
 here is an example he is a rivet or bolt 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.160
 and here, too, you see damn them not 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.440
 By the way , but I thought who did not 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.680
 will get to the one who sold me will not know 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:23.480
 about it and when we hope after 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:25.780
 what you see are slick, that is, it turns out 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.840
 little paint with us 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.200
 erased disconnected why disabled for 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.720
 what 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.090
 studied I thought you understand because 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.930
 hit minin's door and shelter 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.330
 Minina and then if the video is seen 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:44.080
 something else to check how to close 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.960
 the doors here are the gaps from the back door with us 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.830
 not filmed see everything here and 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:58.710
 stays little paint it just glistens on 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:07:01.990
 Actually clearance and also can be checked 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:06.610
 here there is a gap blow woman to the creator 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.500
 at home there is a blow gap which is not 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:13.510
 there should be no such that there are 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:15.640
 all the gaps need to be checked 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.350
 was i think enough because something 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:22.900
 I was tired of talking already it was a review 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:25.810
 on kia rio 2012 release you saw 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.440
 16 grade prestige 123 horse 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.720
 strength 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.919
 see my reviews see my video 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.130
 my name is denis 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:39.100
 I will probably write myself under a nickname 

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:43.120
 denis 161 like that from Rostov 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.570
 Good luck choosing a car to 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.570
 dating
