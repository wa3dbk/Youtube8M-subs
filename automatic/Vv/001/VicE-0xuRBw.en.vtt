can't really do that if you hold X click
right<00:00:33.600> there<00:00:33.630> again<00:00:34.140> you're<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
right there again you're not going to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340 
right there again you're not going to
make<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:36.329> shows<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.570> even<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.079> tops

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
words can't do every animation and then

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.080 
words can't do every animation and then
get<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.620> 15<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.070> right<00:00:41.670> there<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.940> guys
