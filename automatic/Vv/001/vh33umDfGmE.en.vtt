we've<00:00:29.130> been<00:00:29.310> lucky<00:00:29.460> enough<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.000> find<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
we've been lucky enough to find a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.790 
we've been lucky enough to find a
version<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.960> has<00:00:31.050> an<00:00:31.320> internet<00:00:31.650> connection

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
version that has an internet connection

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
version that has an internet connection
and<00:00:32.250> I've<00:00:32.369> run<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> SunSpider<00:00:33.360> benchmark

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
and I've run in the SunSpider benchmark

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.610 
and I've run in the SunSpider benchmark
right<00:00:34.530> now<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.100> comes<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:36.620> 1789

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
right now and it comes out with 1789

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.959 
right now and it comes out with 1789
milliseconds<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.989> compare<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.969> tackle

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
milliseconds I compare this to tackle

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.110 
milliseconds I compare this to tackle
three<00:00:42.210> device<00:00:42.600> or<00:00:43.530> attempt<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.399> divide<00:00:44.700> this

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
three device or attempt to divide this

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.670 
three device or attempt to divide this
is<00:00:45.300> slightly<00:00:45.600> faster<00:00:46.050> definitely<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.070> think<00:00:47.250> my

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
is slightly faster definitely I think my

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.729 
is slightly faster definitely I think my
my<00:00:49.680> prime<00:00:50.309> would<00:00:50.879> honey<00:00:51.149> come<00:00:51.480> did<00:00:52.410> around

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
my prime would honey come did around

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.500 
my prime would honey come did around
1800<00:00:53.610> or<00:00:53.640> nineteen<00:00:54.000> hundred<00:00:54.270> milliseconds

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
1800 or nineteen hundred milliseconds

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.880 
1800 or nineteen hundred milliseconds
and<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.559> ice<00:00:55.739> cream<00:00:56.010> sandwich<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.000> at

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
and with ice cream sandwich it's like at

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.729 
and with ice cream sandwich it's like at
2,400<00:00:58.890> seconds<00:00:59.449> just<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.600> make<00:01:00.780> sure<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
2,400 seconds just to make sure that you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.110 
2,400 seconds just to make sure that you
really<00:01:01.890> believe<00:01:02.280> me<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:02.760> not<00:01:02.850> faking

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
really believe me that I'm not faking

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.050 
really believe me that I'm not faking
this

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.630 

you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.340> merely

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
you can see it's just this is merely

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.719 
you can see it's just this is merely
crunching<00:01:09.390> its<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:10.549> through<00:01:11.549> these

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
crunching its way through these

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.429 
crunching its way through these
benchmarks<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.509> that's<00:01:12.689> quite<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> present

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
benchmarks and that's quite a present

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.139 
benchmarks and that's quite a present
quite<00:01:13.680> still<00:01:13.920> running<00:01:14.250> let's<00:01:14.789> take<00:01:15.000> another

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
quite still running let's take another

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.440 
quite still running let's take another
quick<00:01:15.600> look<00:01:15.659> around<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.350> system<00:01:17.210> it's<00:01:18.210> not

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
quick look around the system it's not

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420 
quick look around the system it's not
the<00:01:18.630> finished<00:01:18.810> smart<00:01:19.259> phone<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> world<00:01:20.100> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the finished smart phone in the world of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.510 
the finished smart phone in the world of
course<00:01:20.729> not<00:01:20.939> really<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
course not really but I think it's a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.370 
course not really but I think it's a
looks<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.820> Batman<00:01:24.299> car<00:01:24.570> providing

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
looks like this Batman car providing

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.760 
looks like this Batman car providing
this<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.850> last<00:01:27.090> Batman<00:01:27.390> movie<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.590> it's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
this the last Batman movie like it's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.169 
this the last Batman movie like it's
kind<00:01:29.039> of<00:01:29.130> stealth<00:01:29.850> design<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.149> should<00:01:33.149> be

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
kind of stealth design so this should be

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.440 
kind of stealth design so this should be
available<00:01:33.539> in<00:01:34.049> China<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.590> q2<00:01:35.179> can't<00:01:36.179> tell<00:01:36.360> you

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
available in China in q2 can't tell you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.270 
available in China in q2 can't tell you
anything<00:01:36.720> about<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.170> pricing<00:01:37.590> right<00:01:37.740> now<00:01:37.950> but

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
anything about the pricing right now but

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.529 
anything about the pricing right now but
I'm<00:01:38.369> pretty<00:01:38.520> sure<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.000> heading<00:01:39.240> over<00:01:39.330> to

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
I'm pretty sure that I'm heading over to

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.639 
I'm pretty sure that I'm heading over to
China<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> get<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.490> sounds<00:01:41.490> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.789> weird

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
China to get one sounds kind of weird

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.109 
China to get one sounds kind of weird
it's<00:01:43.649> only<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.950> 60<00:01:44.310> minutes<00:01:44.580> flight<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:45.000> us

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it's only a 60 minutes flight for us

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.620 
it's only a 60 minutes flight for us
from<00:01:45.330> Taipei<00:01:46.880> but<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.090> definitely<00:01:48.270> going

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
from Taipei but this is definitely going

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.539 
from Taipei but this is definitely going
to<00:01:48.720> steer<00:01:48.959> up<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.289> market<00:01:49.709> right<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.490> the
