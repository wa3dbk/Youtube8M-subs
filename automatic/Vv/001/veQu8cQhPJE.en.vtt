00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 beautiful guys here today are here with 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.640
 a new video 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.990
 then guys today I'm here with 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.450
 a video very different from the usual 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.639
 in fact as you will have read from the title ho 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.040
 decided to call it earn in er 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.170
 dams clash schlans right in the form 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.820
 of question because what I discovered 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.460
 and truly incredible 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.100
 the player we say has arrived 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.689
 a few days ago to 5 thousand Europeans has a 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.970
 Instagram account that I will put you 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.769
 certainly in the description I will put you at 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.500
 name so that you can go to 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.989
 to ascertain what I am telling you 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.010
 it's pretty much discovered this 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.410
 person owns something like 9 ipad e 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.950
 plus you can have some computers on which it is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.200
 falcon bluestacks but let's say 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.719
 incredible is that he plays with conquests 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.379
 ipad simultaneously in each of 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.680
 these pads 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.770
 there is an account we say in the top now 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.260
 I'm not sure if top 10 is top 15 but for 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.649
 for example, to name you a few 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.809
 a lex sed lex sed due are his accounts 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.330
 But what I have discovered and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.090
 a lot of top players are 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.520
 managed by him are not his accounts but 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.850
 they are still managed by him for a fee 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.119
 that is, players who may have been in were 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.280
 in top 100 they give it for example now 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.070
 I don't know the numbers I read 100 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.170
 200 300 dollars per season 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.659
 I don't know the figures well now 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.939
 it is practically for climbing trophies 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.040
 as you can see from the images a background 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.020
 I don't know how to register now 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 I make the commentaries and then there is much below 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.369
 the images how to settle in the background 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.100
 he plays them with lots of accounts 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.470
 simultaneously with lots of ipads 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.570
 how do you do this when you do 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.009
 arrives at a tot of so many trophies 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.290
 or 4500 4600 4007 and even 4800 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.979
 now almost all are in 4900 those in 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.810
 top let's say too much 20 practically in 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.200
 those in those trophies are found 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.210
 attack 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.579
 forty minutes then what it does 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.350
 when he has to do a session turn on 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.780
 all ipads at the same time approx 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.599
 with my part the attack and wait 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.480
 we say to find an attack just there 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:17.050
 however, it does it by trying anyway 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.910
 not to not make mistakes and we say 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.510
 this continues until the end 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.640
 session 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.290
 this is really an incredible thing 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.349
 because he can manage 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.769
 at the same time something like 89 ipad 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:33.220
 with together therefore 89 accounts that you 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.959
 I repeat they are not his accounts or at least me 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.510
 from what I understand he has three or 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.910
 four of his accounts but the others 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.540
 they are accounts of other people that 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.120
 they pay each season for salieri cups 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.640
 I repeat the figures I don't know well I have 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.319
 bed 200 bed 300 per season le 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.260
 seasons I think they are 12 days 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.140
 so really either symptoms or read that 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.720
 can really give a lot of money 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.190
 and hence the title that is image 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.410
 absurd enough that right now 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.329
 surely I will put them and it is he who 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.220
 play right or a game for the 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.750
 playstation that surely many you 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.569
 they will know playstation xbox 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.639
 meanwhile he waits for his ipads to succeed 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.889
 let's say an attack and that's enough 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.840
 absurd, because he does it anyway 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.810
 other waits than in one of the ipads 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.790
 succeed the attack and then start doing it ho 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.579
 seen so many girls pictures too 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.859
 in the car for example that while you are 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.329
 driving looks for attacks 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.760
 so that's why I decided 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.769
 called its gain in giving er 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.260
 a clash france because the figures anyway 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.299
 I read that I have really high 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.220
 read also for $ 34,000 a month 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.769
 he can make himself 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.049
 I do not know how much it actually suits me 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.180
 really I say positively agrees 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.549
 very much because anyway will succeed in 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.680
 make all this money even if it's true 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.040
 nerd andos cannes 12 behind but anyway 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.620
 with a game it's really a lot of stuff 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.000
 it must be said then guys I would like 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.160
 know you what you think 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.049
 let's say this person is new 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.120
 reached 5,000 trophies 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.800
 discovery we say all these things I have 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.720
 discoveries now 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.460
 so guys I want you right 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.660
 tell me what you think if you think that 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.030
 is normal 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.660
 if you use who is inhumane or things 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.950

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.230
