 to your homemade tools like pre amp I 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.680
 will ask these three tracks of 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.309
 come record what goes through my 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.930
 pre amp art tps 2 and the entry one of the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:11.140
 art and ps2 so normally every 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.119
 three will record the hart and ps2 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.990

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.440
 the send I send them to group 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.650
 folk guitar but no we will place our 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.180
 microphone 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.920
 and to do that we will need a 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.840
 guitarist and I would really like 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.930
 thank luis nadal thanks to whom we 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.400
 can realize this tutorial loÃ¯s I 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.380
 you present it so it's a 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.850
 professional guitarist and the person 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.580
 which records absolutely all 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.370
 guitar parts associated with production 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.100
 I love his game I love his visa on 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.450
 electric guitar acoustic guitar 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.190
 be it now let's move the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.680
 microphone for you understand the little bit 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.680
 how to record the guitar 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.450
 m 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.910
 so I passed my microphone to the headphones 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.170
 risk of having a little bit of 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.790
 differences with my listening system 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.950
 but it does not matter I come back after that 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.450
 go ku and now we are caught 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.220
 to record the nylon guitar that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.970
 will be in the center louis is what you are 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.970

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.989
 4 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.830
 I find that a little too much nature 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.270
 the sims has there too 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.270
 1 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.160
 and a little too much reverb on that 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.160
 this
