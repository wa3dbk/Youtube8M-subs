 their guests and they also come in 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:34.290
 economically difficult times continue 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:34.860
 participated in masses and formal 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:44.520
 like 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:49.410

 It has 16 German amusement parks 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.440
 German institute for service quality 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.040
 tested by order of n-tv and the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.000
 Experts were quite satisfied 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.680
 Altogether one must say that the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.940
 amusement parks in germany very much 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.129
 well equipped 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.659
 bob of service quality we have the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.939
 Half of the parks are a good one 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.680
 We can issue a quality assessment 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.940
 want to know it again and exactly 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.980
 have family partners from hamburg 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.110
 Katharina sent father and mother 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.909
 Elke do the Heidepark for us 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.659
 sure you will do many things altogether 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.060
 look closely 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.100
 gastronomy the wait times 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.630
 family friendly attractions and 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.870
 one of the main attractions of the park 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.880
 the wooden coaster colossos lets go 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.120
 with the family attraction mountain 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.120
 rafting 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.060
 it was nice but it was he keeps for that 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.939
 Family not so exciting now 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.829
 because you are just so slow 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.149
 but it was already done nicely 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.350
 with the waterfalls and the cottage 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.119
 So quickly to the largest 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.009
 holzachterbahn europas but really 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.109
 it's not fast then 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.000
 first it says snake are the 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.000
 of course applies to all amusement parks 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.289
 the waiting times much better than 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.729
 last year, nevertheless, with the big ones 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.190
 Attractions had to be up to 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.230
 to wait for half an hour 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.420
 of course, may be available as long as the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.680
 I'm also half an hour then 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.680
 time is also typical 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.989
 But renewal on the one hand makes it so 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.079
 then even more tension on the 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.799
 roller coaster and the anticipation has 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.799
 then worth it 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.480
 no, because they are not that fast, though 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:53.850
 Already rising, it was really round 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:55.020
 makes you fall off but stand in line 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.940
 and the roller coaster ride does that 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.800
 of course hungry at the moment 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.610
 gastronomy our testers still have 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.590
 this also needs improvement 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.900
 year there was the gastronomy still on 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.790
 Most withstand 40 percent of 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.040
 tester was not completely satisfied with that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.459
 offer that means here the parks 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.959
 a little something to learn and that 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.580
 maybe make it richer 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.410
 more healthy things still on the 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.870
 table bring frankly expected 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.850
 you actually have chips and sweets 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.180
 and cotton candy and that is available here 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.640
 also and then I think if it is then 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.410
 also gomez with apple there or 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.140
 Of course, apple fries is a whole lot 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.000
 witty distraction strengthened oneself 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.890
 eg katharina and celebrates on the way to 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.660
 last highlight of the day shows us 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.730
 Let's take a look at the best 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.620
 throw amusement parks 2010 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.730
 the best leisure park in germany 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.170
 became the heath park 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.760
 he has everything to be through 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.900
 performance offer convinces in 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.489
 West Germany ie in North Rhine 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.769
 Westphalia has the phantasialand am 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.290
 Most convinced here, there was also each 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.910
 Crowd attractions The park was very 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.100
 clean 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.959
 Overall winner is the Europa Park 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.519
 had by far the best park 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.549
 equipment the most attractive 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.459
 Rides the most beautiful park environment 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.440
 and has the service very good 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.930
 performs better in any case 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.000
 what is the quality of service what has become 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.680
 As far as the employees are concerned, we had them 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.870
 this year is much better 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.940
 staff were friendly could 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.620
 have given much more competent information 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.350
 taking more time to ask 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.419
 There really was a lot of that happening 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.370
 result again in detail the best 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.140
 amusement park 2010 in germany is the 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.490
 europe park in rust near freiburg who 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.140
 also wins in southern Germany 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.210
 in second place lands the best 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.320
 amusement park in north rhine westphalia the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.120
 phantasialand in brÃ¼hl 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.760
 directly behind the heath park in soltau 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.320
 from the north lies at the front 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.880
 and that's exactly where it comes for katharina and 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.000
 celebrates in the highest freefall tower 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:54.000
 the world is far from it 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 home but first down
