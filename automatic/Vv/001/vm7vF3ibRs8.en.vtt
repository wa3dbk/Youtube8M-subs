00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 comrades still today I'll show you that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.890
 do if you have to mars 1 7 she 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.040
 broke vito viano 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.030
 after 2003 release broke 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.630
 window raisers 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.050
 This problem is very well known 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.400
 many yes yes windows on this 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.470
 models often break who comes out 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.630
 from the position well, since the new one is very 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.300
 expensive then we decided something different 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.430
 do something different these way out 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.809
 provisions are already on this door 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.600
 installed windows work 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.800
 they are from regular buttons windows 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.760
 I used a grenade like this 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.760
 window raisers 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.370
 it fits on lanos on classics 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:08.280
 we completed the extra holes in 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.409
 grilled I sawed here if you 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.869
 notice drilled a hole here 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.150
 this is the top mount and there is the bottom 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.159
 window mount here in this 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.060
 the place I actually 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.549
 will demonstrate 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.509
 and they connected perfectly to the staff 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.880
 window regulator connector 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:35.460
 full-time see what we have all with us 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:43.460
 works with you as a little system 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 locks on glass closed 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.960
 that's the only thing that until the end they 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.840
 glass is coming but I think it is not 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.479
 so scary the total cost of repairs 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.440
 regular windows worth order 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:10.570
 250 euro 1 maybe just some 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.570
 recovered chinese grandfather cheaper but 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:27.040
