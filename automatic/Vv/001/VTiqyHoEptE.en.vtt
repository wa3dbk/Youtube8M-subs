flop<00:00:12.770> now<00:00:13.770> what<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.789> basically<00:00:15.110> explains<00:00:16.110> to

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
flop now what this basically explains to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.590 
flop now what this basically explains to
you<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:17.460> chance<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.940> getting<00:00:18.000> certain

cards to form certain hands when you get

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.290 
cards to form certain hands when you get

to the three-card flop okay we'll jump

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.320 
to the three-card flop okay we'll jump
straight<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:24.990> take<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.440> look<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:25.800> them<00:00:26.330> okay

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
straight in and take a look at them okay

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.960 
straight in and take a look at them okay
the<00:00:27.690> chance<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.050> getting<00:00:28.110> a<00:00:28.470> pair<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.190> five<00:00:29.760> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the chance of getting a pair is five to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720 
the chance of getting a pair is five to
one<00:00:30.180> roughly<00:00:30.840> seventeen<00:00:31.410> percent<00:00:31.620> so<00:00:32.610> if

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
one roughly seventeen percent so if

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.430 
one roughly seventeen percent so if
you're<00:00:32.850> already<00:00:33.090> holding<00:00:33.539> a<00:00:33.780> pair<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.350> then

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
you're already holding a pair and then

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.290 
you're already holding a pair and then
this<00:00:34.559> basically<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.280> your<00:00:35.370> chance<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.909> making

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
this basically is your chance of making

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.979 
this basically is your chance of making
to<00:00:36.570> pen<00:00:36.839> the<00:00:37.820> chance<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.969> getting<00:00:39.269> three<00:00:39.570> cards

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
to pen the chance of getting three cards

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.340 
to pen the chance of getting three cards
of<00:00:40.109> the<00:00:40.199> same<00:00:40.350> suit<00:00:40.859> is<00:00:41.129> 18<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.179> 1<00:00:42.359> so<00:00:42.600> roughly

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of the same suit is 18 to 1 so roughly

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.790 
of the same suit is 18 to 1 so roughly
five<00:00:43.679> percent<00:00:44.690> however<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:46.079> you're<00:00:46.289> after<00:00:46.469> one

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
five percent however if you're after one

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.919 
five percent however if you're after one
suit<00:00:47.069> in<00:00:47.219> particular<00:00:47.519> to<00:00:48.179> make<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.359> flush<00:00:48.749> of

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
suit in particular to make a flush of

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.719 
suit in particular to make a flush of
some<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.350> then<00:00:49.949> the<00:00:50.100> chance<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.519> seeing

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
some kind then the chance of seeing

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.139 
some kind then the chance of seeing
three<00:00:51.089> cards<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.659> that<00:00:51.749> specific<00:00:52.260> suit<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.370> 72

three cards in that specific suit is 72

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.759 
three cards in that specific suit is 72
to<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:55.199> over<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.530> one<00:00:55.769> percent<00:00:56.159> chance

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
to one just over on one percent chance

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.860 
to one just over on one percent chance
if<00:00:58.769> you<00:00:58.979> want<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.249> see<00:00:59.399> any<00:00:59.670> two<00:00:59.969> suited<00:01:00.510> cards

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
if you want to see any two suited cards

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.329 
if you want to see any two suited cards
the<00:01:01.350> chance<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.859> happening<00:01:02.069> is<00:01:02.940> 1.8<00:01:03.690> 2

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
the chance of that happening is 1.8 2

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.670 
the chance of that happening is 1.8 2
155<00:01:05.339> percent<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.540> bear<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.990> mind<00:01:07.080> when

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
155 percent so bear that in mind when

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.610 
155 percent so bear that in mind when
you're<00:01:07.770> looking<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.280> flush<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.200> chance<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
you're looking for a flush the chance of

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.680 
you're looking for a flush the chance of
seeing<00:01:10.860> 3<00:01:11.160> different<00:01:11.190> suits<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.030> flop<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
seeing 3 different suits on the flop is

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.870 
seeing 3 different suits on the flop is
1.5<00:01:13.620> 2<00:01:13.860> 1<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.850> forty<00:01:15.300> percent<00:01:16.880> three

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
1.5 2 1 this is forty percent three

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910 
1.5 2 1 this is forty percent three
cards<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.330> sequence<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:19.170> appear<00:01:19.440> roughly

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
cards in sequence will appear roughly

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.270 
cards in sequence will appear roughly
once<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.550> every<00:01:20.700> 28<00:01:21.450> turns<00:01:22.280> three-point-five

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
once in every 28 turns three-point-five

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.490 
once in every 28 turns three-point-five
percent<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.480> consider<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.350> you're

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
percent so I consider this when you're

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
percent so I consider this when you're
holding<00:01:25.860> out<00:01:25.980> for<00:01:26.010> a<00:01:26.190> straight<00:01:26.550> and<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
sequence is 1.8 2 155 percent the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660 
sequence is 1.8 2 155 percent the

possibility of seeing a three of a kind
in<00:01:39.120> the<00:01:39.630> flop<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.940> 424<00:01:41.940> 21<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:43.020> works<00:01:43.320> out<00:01:43.500> at

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
in the flop is 424 21 this works out at

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.660 
in the flop is 424 21 this works out at
just<00:01:44.100> north<00:01:44.760> point<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.300> four<00:01:45.630> percent<00:01:46.670> finally

just north point to four percent finally

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.760 
just north point to four percent finally
the<00:01:48.090> chance<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.510> seeing<00:01:48.720> any<00:01:48.960> two<00:01:49.260> cards<00:01:49.530> in
