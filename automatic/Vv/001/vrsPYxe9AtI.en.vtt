00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.950
 than to look for them nothing more and they are dedicated to 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.049

 that the pitbull has to coexistence 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.399
 of the dog with other dogs the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.470
 coexistence of the dog with the human being 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.390
 how are we going to take out all that energy that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.000
 the dog has bouncing it and doing 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.200
 what bites is doing what pulls 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.450
 a cart with all that power 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.299
 muscle that the dog has we are going to 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.549
 use all this positive that has the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.409
 race that personally is a race that 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.509
 is not registered at the federation level 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.209
 international canÃ³fila but is one of 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.700
 the most popular breeds in the world the 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.930
 pitbull yes I think they should already 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.580
 have admitted misfortune 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.320
 there are as many variants of the race 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.630
 however it is a race that your 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.240
 temperament his way of being his character 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.430
 if you choose it well and there 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.220
 unfortunately there is a group there was a 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.920
 era in the nineties where a lot 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.410
 people fought them in the sport of 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.540
 bad dogs we are going to fight dogs and 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.420
 they chose the pit bull for their strength 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.460
 has unfortunately it was seen from that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.000
 way but let's eliminate that today 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.970
