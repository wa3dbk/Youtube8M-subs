00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hey people you say here and there I have 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.150
 for you a kill confirmed on the map 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.670
 raid we play again with the ms 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.590
 mmc and yes I have another week 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.480
 Nothing posted that's because of me 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.639
 had brought me factor 3 before three four 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.440
 days and really so much fun in the game 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.990
 I really had to go through nonstop 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.070
 So I searched for the story and I can 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.810
 The game really only recommend to everyone 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.890
 So I still have the multiplayer 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.880
 not played but I will too 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.949
 Check it out now 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.480
 but so far I really love this 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.550
 play and that's why i can 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.109
 recommend to buy and it is 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.480
 really a good change to look at 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.579
 on two with the moment I pretty much 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.710
 But I'm pretty frustrated 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.550
 I also mentioned it before and me 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.110
 I do not want this game either 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.210
 really and some think now 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.219
 also sure you like you do not play you 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.239
 so much for skill based matchmaking 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.710
 and that is exactly what it is 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.120
 So stood out for me was as always 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 already for that reason against normal 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.620
 player shows how good you are in that one 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.390
 she really destroyed what, of course 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 Hard is what you are not always in 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.570
 but every game creates in this game 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.340
 Is it really just one? 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.019
 luck thing if you now with people one 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.250
 lobby com which are relatively normal so 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.200
 Here I was lucky with the lobby though 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.090
 There were also relatively good players 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.680
 you can see that they all raton 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.420
 after the first run his air 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.950
 That's why there are a few 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.020
 parts of the gameplay cut out because 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.880
 it was just too long and I have you 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.159
 Not only nine minutes over here 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.270
 a click away to talk that 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.880
 scored with it for some reason 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.409
 reason 100 there text also in six against 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.720
 six kim films what I totally 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.540
 stupid think but you can well yes 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.340
 do as they please and yes I do 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.890
 So now you have to really in 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.990
 this game is one hundred percent 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.030
 otherwise you can say you can do that 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.439
 In my opinion, so I forget 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.150
 In any case, there are always exceptions 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.090
 on youtube where people are connected 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.820
 eyes and a hundredth of an arm 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.729
 but I know my way around and 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.560
 that's why the game is really in the game 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.840
 moment quite a torment for me 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.790
 So either I'm really coming in 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.729
 lobbies where it runs normally I 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.040
 play 50 4 then I'll play 30 10 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.990
 is still ok and then I have ten 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.620
 play in a row where I'm 11 12 go 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.270
 and then 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.280
 think again I thought I had 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.330
 the game out now but no in 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.540
 I will be sharing the same lobby at once 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.340
 totally destroyed again and that is 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.960
 really something inside me yet no 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.060
 buyer so far happened so I am 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.220
 so far by cod 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.870
 Of course, consistently good scores are achieved 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.890
 you always play negative but that 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.700
 is just the absolute exception 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.500
 been 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.870
 In this game I play either 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.740
 really good or right 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.120
 bad and I want it all up 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.550
 but I push skibbe's matchmaking 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.890
 think that's a bit of the 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.330
 but fundamentally I do not but me 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.440
 as the one above cotton 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.860
 already enough others commented there 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.510
 made 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.070
 we'll talk a bit about that now 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.480
 They are called killstreaks or scott riggs 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.670
 here I have that July like that 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.590
 stepper and the loddar i do it here too 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.630
 I'll call and I think I'll get in 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.460
 This lothar is still a new logo 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.750
 Of course this will not work 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.230
 credited because that is of course 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.790
 Not 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.930
 even if the game has one said now 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.160
 of course, is just before the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.740
 That's the reason why you could be there now 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.580
 So not detect any loss in 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.040
 the game tells a notary ready for bla 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.959
 bla bla and the traffic controller there is not there 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.550
 and then we would not have done that much 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.989
 can that you just can not relish the 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.459
 get displayed because I had 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.290
 me of course in the moment great 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.540
 thought right now I can 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.280
 call again and title easy that 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.810
 would be loose in 70 or 80 church 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.130
 can be driven six against six 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.200
 which would have been pretty cool but no 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.130
 Of course that was not possible 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.959
 but the game is relatively good 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.910
 So gone as I said that is 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.250
 again a lobby where you are relatively good 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.160
 against the enemy comes when you can 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.959
 Stop using weapons like the MSC 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.060
 you still get along relatively well 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.800
 be clear and regular in any case 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.970
 What I can post is I would mean 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.890
 standards have to change a bit 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.290
 for mp3 in any case apply to me 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.269
 others but that does not matter so 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.890
 if you always use good weapons 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.570
 you still get here too 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.340
 relatively well, even if I like it 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.480
 mentioned in between you go 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.950
 just me in between you have 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.320
 just such assholes in the opponent 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.400
 team that you can not handle but me 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.110
 In any case , you have to play in this game 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.300
 always good weapons used in the moment 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.620
 but that's the only thing that's me too 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.290
 still a bit disturbing in the game because 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.670
 that's just the way it has always been for me 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.530
 times had other weapons 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.910
 try it out and thus good 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.859
 scores to achieve something in this game 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.870
 not really possible anymore 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.759
 I find that at the moment in any case 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.800
 not as I said it will still be 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.719
 maybe yoke change some david 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.250
 Roger h is also unpredictable there 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.240
 will also patch some I have 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.460
 already heard that for team deathmatch 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.530
 the scores are adjusted again 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.879
 that would of course be super cool then that 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.469
 league play is also changing me 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.000
 Think like team deathmatch will be one 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:39.009
 own mode maybe its display 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.330
 I would like to try something out there 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.009
 In any case, there are still many 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.939
 possibilities that I try here 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.819
 I can and I will definitely 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.659
 continue to look at two posts 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.979
 Maybe I want to have one now 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.900
 few other videos make of others 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.520
 may not play far cry 3 no 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.500
 let's play or just around you 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.560
 to make the game fun to taste so 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.819
 You can do a mission or something 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.729
 in the comments write something about it 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:02.439
 but want to see is synonymous relative 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.479
 no matter here again a wonderful 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:06.460
 I also love the types of leipers 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.009
 this game but I dig too much 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.240
 I'd like to thank you in any case 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.490
 I would always watch for myself 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.930
 if you like about a like of you then 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.750
 you have not animated me yet and 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.550
 Potters definitely and commented 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.349
 and subscribe and masturbate and what 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.629
 I know 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:24.430
 So thank you for watching please worth 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:30.069
 every case the video of the finance corp 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:31.509
 now I believe 54 2 or 52 41 of them 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.339
 Definitely over 50 in any case 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.469
 I think for the six against 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.120
 six chicks 5 definitely okay 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.039
 By the way, they are still secondary 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.629
 pistol the best in the game, too 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.849
 somehow a threesome shot is but 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:47.580
 is also no matter thanks for watching please 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.580
 will be the video and goodbye
