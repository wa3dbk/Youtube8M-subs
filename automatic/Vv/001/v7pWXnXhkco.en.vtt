00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.590
 hello this a video tutorial where we go 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.010
 to teach to play the song hopefully 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:14.550
 sorry and nothing more than silvio rodrÃ­guez and 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.760
 we started with the introduction of the 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.570
 song I'm going to play it and then I 'm going to 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.570
 teach step things 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.760
 that is the you introduce both the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.530
 production as the stanza 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.640
 the beginning is occupied and then with 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.540
 start singing keep doing 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.920
 the same thing that I just did now and for 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.559
 touching this what we do is first with 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.850
 this chord 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 and for a certain cut what we are going to do is 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.150
 let's do a 2 and we're going to run 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.440
 2 frets 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.890
 more in this way 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.180
 and this from the finger that remains free 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.700
 let's step on what is the third 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.700
 fifth fret string 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.540
 do not 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.140
 it should sound long like this more or less 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:35.870
 and one that I have in this court 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.340
 let's do the arpeggio and the arpeggio goes 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.420
 to start playing the fifth and the second 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.970
 at the same time 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.970
 after we played the fourth and third 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.210
 then we release this chord 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.380
 that is, we leave the strings in the air and 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.380
 we play the fourth string 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.100
 in this way 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.100
 ah 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.080
 after doing this 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.050
 we immediately do a 2 in C major 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.870
 but I got it like a yes but 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.150
 three theme here 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.970
 and we played what is the fifth 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:28.120
 the third the second 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.650
 and the 3rd network 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.650
 I mean, all together, I'm not reading 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.190
 already after we make a sun 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.260
 council equal major sun we play what 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.100
 is the fifth of the second forgiveness the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.100
 sixth the xunta 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.370
 but let's have the fifth the third 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.520
 after 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.520
 we make a minor 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.200
 one the least but this one of packing free 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.650
 that is the third the second string goes 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.650
 to go to the air 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.470
 and with this court we are going to touch what is 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.470
 the fifth rope 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.989
 the third 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.960
 the second 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.340
 and then we step 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.910
 that is, according to the minor and we are looking for 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.910
 the second 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.670
 and then 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.670
 we play the sixth and the second 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:53.370

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.360
 and a lot 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.319
 again 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.659
 and then in a brush 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.530
 after doing 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.799
 and we were in the seventh second the air 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.270
 true 

00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:43.330
 after this we are going to play the third 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.090
 the first and there begins that is 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.150
 we play the second and the sixth at the same 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.180
 time in that we stayed and now as the 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:05:01.240
 third first 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:01.240

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.389
 i 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.389
 the arpeggio that always the same 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.720
 to 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.069

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.730
 or not 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.979
 we already wanted to first touch it sixth and 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:03.030
 the second after I eat you in the third 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:05.610

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:18.729
 first it's three o'clock the three o'clock 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.919
 I say 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:26.580
 second first second to the air is to do 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.580
 as a time 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.190
 the second time we will step on here 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.190
 first agreement to the second fret 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.050
 Y 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.110
 there they are all only in the first and 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.110

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.169
 fret 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:08.659

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:14.010
 um 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.010
 and 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:21.520
 it's a bit difficult to explain 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.520
 but it's practical 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.540
 you 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.169
 and in the end they are to reid
