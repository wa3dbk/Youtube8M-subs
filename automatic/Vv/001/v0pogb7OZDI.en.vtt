00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:10.559
 Of course it is for the entire game 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.820
 But I'll say a south derby for ourselves 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.000
 player is actually about the three 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.000
 Points 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.580
 yes the fan camps are not white now 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.480
 not like maybe it used to be 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.330
 Munich city derby so heated up 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.660
 mood does not expect now I think 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.030
 it's only about three points for us 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.350
 win and of course maybe 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.350
 playing a step forward 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.079
 Of course, they do not say either 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.649
 noticed the first two games 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.120
 stuck backwards not at the top things 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.680
 Distribute your view we have 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.260
 maybe this week maybe 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.360
 contrary to behaving more trained so 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.250
 Bad do not think this from today 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.379
 just like last season 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.129
 he was of course a little something 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.200
 we have changed over to midfield now 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.760
 just a 1 6 and 2 28 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.740
 that is natural for the whole 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.369
 backward movement a bit different 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.409
 also want from the mental orientation 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.390
 we attack early as a whole 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.549
 Team and life processes 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.670
 not sitting 100 percent is too 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.620
 Of course we have the first two 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.710
 won games 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.960
 not necessarily properly shone like 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.710
 maybe that before every game with us 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.510
 is expected 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.910
 with us, not only the victory 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.610
 to give but also one 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.500
 extreme domination that was against now 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.940
 say frankfurt a bit better 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.650
 I believe in comparison 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.610
 to be hinged very little and admitted 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.170
 that's why I think we're on one 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.460
 good way now had a complete 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.970
 training week where to go again 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.890
 have worked hard and but 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.080
 but football is not at all 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.490
 so I can not calculate it 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.970
 Do not promise that you can get one somewhere 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:08.399
 counterrevolutionary situation on Saturday to release those 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.530
 I sat in the stands and we have 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:16.620
 Nevertheless, I believe 63 homebutton application 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.540
 That's why the jupp had to do us 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.050
 heynckes at that time to eat to himself after 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.050
 invite home 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.209
 Thank you in the past 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.260
 at home was always okay in 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.380
 Nuremberg always has our problems 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.390
 but that does not mean anything for Saturday who we are 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.680
 are highly concentrated and for us 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.930
 It's about important three points 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.330
 the beginning of the season is always 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.170
 always very important 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.610
 to get started 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.230
 on saturday against the Bavarian 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.730
 'm going on Tuesday that the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.890
 Dress the leather pants 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.140
 Today they are there and Philip lame in 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.700
 the press conference the bavaria at the fc 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.080
 bavaria is also for the lahnstädter 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.660
 maybe you can get out of her 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.580
 view what they describe 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.730
 this Bavarian way of life captures them 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.520
 in the jersey you were born in bavaria 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.050
 dwellings are growing amazone what it is 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.870
 For you , this club means just that 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.930
 play 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.730
 both now like just any club 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.200
 the regional maybe a big one 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.670
 importance or in germany 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.490
 but also very high internationally 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.430
 looked for and therefore for one 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.650
 Of course, that's what the region is all about 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.810
 so with me was so i was from the beginning 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.760
 bayern-fan, of course, there are some 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.420
 the as a child then maybe in the 60s 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.160
 But I already have camp at home 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.870
 was that then thank god so i 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.830
 bavarian fan was and right from the beginning 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.410
 then did not have to change and me 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.900
 Just make pride in the club 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.550
 play and also with the club so 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.480
 to be successful from the beginning 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.209
 always 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.560
 previously made fiber required 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.090
 also said i asked him like him 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.890
 speaks best of the Bavarian 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.879
 Team but someone that is on everyone 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.580
 case thomas müller 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.180
 yes I'm just not from the city where 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.010
 then a bit like the philipp he 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.709
 It used to be played in the past 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.830
 I say that a little bit washed out 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.900
 but theoretically I can 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.310
 speak normal Bavarian as it is 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.320
 also a village of lye land 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.519
 there is perhaps one spoken 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.519
 very small short tasting 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.139
 would you say they say that 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:39.669
 has become a serious bit 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:42.050
 maybe a very long time ago 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.510
 I think I think it will be easy 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.660
 when one gets older 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.020
 I think so with me at 30 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.030
 feels 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.289
 but if you have three children at home 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.750
 the car markets will be I think 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:58.820
 basically you will grow up but yes 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.010
 Of course that's difficult now 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.750
 whether that is because that frank last 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.729
 year he has played the outstanding 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.310
 years before it has been shown again and again 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.900
 how well there is and of course I hope 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.900
 that he will win the thing too 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.440
 For a long time I think before the fc 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:25.130
 bayern in clubs played in 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.479
 compared to bavarian maybe that 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.070
 have dubious structures and 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.190
 therefore felt water water 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.200
 here and I think he will 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.330
 also by the audience and everyone 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.940
 extreme worshiped and it makes him 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:46.970
 Of course, it's fun too and you have it too 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:48.560
 Feeling that everything is there for the club Yes 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.600
 Well, it is a difference , too 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.150
 Feels like a true Bavarian for the club 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.690
 to play bavaria munich and the other 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.770
 that is something else again 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.200
 maybe that too visa to talk to me 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.110
 what does this one mean to you? 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.580
 the guiding principle of this whole club he is 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.420
 simply a sign of inner strength 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.010
 the belief in itself and took in the last 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.860
 year came again saying that that 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:16.540
 Paired because the success is there 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.540
 Of course also included 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.340
 they have collected or 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:30.190
 I still have those from before three 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.190
 years and that fits well and fits 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.530
 I want to see how it works 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:44.840
 They run home in the control 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:47.450
 how often does it not happen 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.300
 is absolutely pleasant if seven o'clock 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.470
 early at the front door someone rings the 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.150
 you do not know you then she says 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:58.190
 Now please pee on command 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.100
 which is clear but we also want 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.870
 that the sport shows that he is clean 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.370
 I am convinced that he is clean 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.210
 but i can only do it for myself 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.460
 speak and that's why it is 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.620
 important that is controlled over the 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.570
 There is a lot you can do 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.290
 but there are also discussions 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.290
 not the right man 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.080
 I do not know the backgrounds exactly 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:39.169
 why are they staying away? 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.240
 Discussions between the board and fans 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.309
 I was not there, I do not know 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.099
 just the contents in sunny as itself 

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:47.539
 the respective groups then there 

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:48.770
 That's why I can handle it now 

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:51.319
 hard to say something 

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:54.050
 I think it is always very good 

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:56.659
 felt and it should not always 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:59.749
 just go for a few hundred fans 

00:07:56.659 --> 00:08:02.029
 but we are a great club and 

00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:03.589
 I can not influence the people 

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:05.569
 then go to the stadium or not 

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:09.039
 It's a pity, of course, but I know 

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:09.039
 not what motive reasons dar
