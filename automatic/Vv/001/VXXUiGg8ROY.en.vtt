00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
forward and it took about only 20

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.230

minutes<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.650> put<00:01:11.799> it<00:01:11.950> all<00:01:12.100> together<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.729> I<00:01:13.000> can

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
minutes to put it all together and I can

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.030 
minutes to put it all together and I can
remember<00:01:13.479> exactly<00:01:13.689> how<00:01:14.170> much<00:01:14.320> we<00:01:14.560> pay<00:01:14.740> for<00:01:15.009> it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
remember exactly how much we pay for it

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.179 
remember exactly how much we pay for it
but<00:01:15.250> it<00:01:15.369> was<00:01:15.549> anywhere<00:01:16.240> between<00:01:16.299> 33<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.500> 36

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
but it was anywhere between 33 to 36

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.700 
but it was anywhere between 33 to 36
dollars<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:19.330> all<00:01:19.570> in<00:01:19.750> all<00:01:19.869> I<00:01:20.049> think<00:01:20.110> this<00:01:20.409> carry

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
dollars so all in all I think this carry

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.069 
dollars so all in all I think this carry
is<00:01:20.830> awesome<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:21.640> my<00:01:21.789> daughter<00:01:21.999> loves<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.689> she

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
is awesome and my daughter loves it she

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.319

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
calls it the motorcycle ride wherever we

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.859 
calls it the motorcycle ride wherever we
go<00:01:25.509> she's<00:01:26.700> two<00:01:27.700> years<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:28.179> nine<00:01:28.450> months<00:01:28.479> right

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
go she's two years and nine months right

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.160 
go she's two years and nine months right
now<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.280> if<00:01:30.399> I<00:01:30.520> had<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.820> suggest<00:01:31.179> anything<00:01:31.689> that

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
now so if I had to suggest anything that

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.599 
now so if I had to suggest anything that
they<00:01:32.320> could<00:01:32.530> do<00:01:32.649> differently<00:01:33.189> or<00:01:33.280> anything

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
they could do differently or anything

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.910 
they could do differently or anything
that<00:01:33.759> I<00:01:33.939> didn't<00:01:34.719> necessarily<00:01:34.869> like<00:01:35.439> about<00:01:35.770> the

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
that I didn't necessarily like about the

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.069 
that I didn't necessarily like about the
carrier<00:01:36.249> that<00:01:36.490> would<00:01:36.969> be<00:01:37.149> that<00:01:37.329> he<00:01:37.420> sits<00:01:37.689> too

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
carrier that would be that he sits too

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.859 
carrier that would be that he sits too
close<00:01:38.439> to<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.920> bike<00:01:39.520> seat<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.119> as<00:01:40.539> you<00:01:40.689> can

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
close to the bike seat and as you can

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.620 
close to the bike seat and as you can
see<00:01:41.079> here<00:01:41.409> this<00:01:42.159> plastic<00:01:42.789> bar<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.240> they<00:01:43.359> put

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
see here this plastic bar that they put

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.200 
see here this plastic bar that they put
but<00:01:44.079> so<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:44.409> kids<00:01:44.619> can<00:01:44.829> hold<00:01:45.069> on<00:01:45.249> to<00:01:45.460> that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
but so the kids can hold on to that

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.580 
but so the kids can hold on to that
touches<00:01:46.659> my<00:01:46.780> lower<00:01:46.990> back

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
touches my lower back

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.279 
touches my lower back
however<00:01:48.189> this<00:01:48.579> bar<00:01:48.969> can<00:01:49.210> be<00:01:49.240> removed<00:01:49.689> but<00:01:50.049> then

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
however this bar can be removed but then

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.870 
however this bar can be removed but then
your<00:01:50.469> kid<00:01:50.710> doesn't<00:01:50.979> have<00:01:51.159> anything<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.700> hold

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
your kid doesn't have anything to hold

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.190 
your kid doesn't have anything to hold
on<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.179> except<00:01:52.509> you

on to except you

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.779 
on to except you
another<00:01:53.799> thing<00:01:53.979> that<00:01:54.130> worries<00:01:54.310> me<00:01:54.429> is<00:01:54.609> that

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
another thing that worries me is that

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.429 
another thing that worries me is that
the<00:01:55.090> type<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.299> seat<00:01:55.600> that<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:55.810> have<00:01:56.139> has<00:01:56.409> some
