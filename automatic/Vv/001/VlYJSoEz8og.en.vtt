and<00:00:31.410> I'll<00:00:32.219> probably<00:00:32.430> build<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.850> sensor

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and I'll probably build a sensor

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.340 
and I'll probably build a sensor
involved<00:00:33.630> fortress<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.110> they<00:00:34.290> were

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
involved fortress because they were

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.580

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
probably make a storm minifigure and the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
probably make a storm minifigure and the
characters<00:00:41.129> we've<00:00:41.280> seen<00:00:41.489> before<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.000> Mike

like titty and Iseman and I believe and
I<00:00:46.770> believe<00:00:46.800> that's<00:00:47.250> basically<00:00:47.670> oh<00:00:47.789> yeah

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
and I and um by painting his expression

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.420 
and I and um by painting his expression
the<00:03:02.580> expression<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:03.150> based<00:03:03.420> off<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.040> DC<00:03:05.040> flash

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
the expression is based off the DC flash

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.270 
the expression is based off the DC flash
you<00:03:05.940> guys<00:03:06.150> remember<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.600> always<00:03:06.780> use<00:03:07.080> that

you guys remember I always use that

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.170 
you guys remember I always use that
aggressive<00:03:08.280> facial<00:03:08.550> expression<00:03:08.910> because<00:03:09.150> I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
aggressive facial expression because I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.360 
aggressive facial expression because I
just<00:03:09.450> thinks<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:10.260> looks<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.830> lot<00:03:11.190> better

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.350 
use like gray something cuz if you use
because<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.890> know<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.550> movie<00:03:23.850> classes

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
because you know in the movie classes

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.280 
because you know in the movie classes
everything<00:03:25.350> he<00:03:26.130> turn<00:03:26.340> he<00:03:26.880> turns<00:03:27.120> all<00:03:27.810> Mountain

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
everything he turn he turns all Mountain

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.199 
everything he turn he turns all Mountain
yeah<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.800> can<00:03:29.010> barely<00:03:29.489> see<00:03:29.880> his<00:03:29.970> face

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
yeah and you can barely see his face

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.030 
yeah and you can barely see his face
because<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.540> kind<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.780> reflects<00:03:31.170> off<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.950> you

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
because it kind of reflects off so you

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.920 
because it kind of reflects off so you
can't<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.610> can<00:03:32.820> get<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> shape<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.750> good

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
can't you can get the shape of it good

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.690 
can't you can get the shape of it good
but<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.260> can't<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.739> as<00:03:34.920> clearly<00:03:35.190> by

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
but you can't see it as clearly by

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.220 
but you can't see it as clearly by
deciding<00:03:36.030> not<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.239> do<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.630> because<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:37.050> will

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
deciding not to do that because it will

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.050 
deciding not to do that because it will
just<00:03:37.290> look<00:03:37.560> really<00:03:37.890> odd<00:03:38.130> on<00:03:38.459> this<00:03:38.610> minifigure

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
just look really odd on this minifigure

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.580 
just look really odd on this minifigure
so<00:03:39.239> giving<00:03:39.570> him<00:03:39.690> starting<00:03:40.260> with<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.410> black

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
so giving him starting with the black

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.680 
so giving him starting with the black
eyes<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.890> black<00:03:41.130> eyebrows<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.209> doing<00:03:42.510> black

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
eyes and black eyebrows and doing black

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.270 
eyes and black eyebrows and doing black
key<00:03:42.959> booms<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.380> thought<00:03:43.769> that<00:03:43.920> was<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.070> better

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
key booms I thought that was a better

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.130 
key booms I thought that was a better
way<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.459> go<00:03:44.700> rather<00:03:44.940> than<00:03:45.090> just<00:03:45.510> plain<00:03:45.810> gray

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
way to go rather than just plain gray

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.410 
way to go rather than just plain gray
but<00:03:46.560> what<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.739> did<00:03:47.010> with<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.910> plain<00:03:48.120> gray

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
but what I did with just the plain gray

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.420 
but what I did with just the plain gray
was<00:03:48.660> like<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.110> make<00:03:49.290> these<00:03:49.590> crease<00:03:50.070> marks

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
was like to make these crease marks

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.550 
was like to make these crease marks
around<00:03:50.550> and<00:03:50.970> those<00:03:51.150> are<00:03:51.360> very<00:03:51.660> tedious<00:03:52.110> and

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
around and those are very tedious and

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.470 
around and those are very tedious and
hard<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.980> get<00:03:53.130> right<00:03:53.400> around<00:03:53.880> his<00:03:54.209> orange

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
hard to get right around his orange

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.990 
hard to get right around his orange
because<00:03:54.690> his<00:03:54.840> arms<00:03:55.200> he<00:03:55.440> does<00:03:55.650> have<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:56.040> steel

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
because his arms he does have that steel

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.720 
because his arms he does have that steel
lines<00:03:57.390> all<00:03:57.959> over<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.860> that's<00:03:58.980> what<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.220> did<00:03:59.489> I

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
lines all over so that's what I did I

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.380 
lines all over so that's what I did I
and<00:04:00.300> I<00:04:00.570> painted<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.440> steel<00:04:01.739> up<00:04:02.489> here<00:04:02.730> too<00:04:02.910> for

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
and I painted and steel up here too for

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.630 
and I painted and steel up here too for
his<00:04:03.540> chest<00:04:03.989> area<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.560> these<00:04:05.100> two<00:04:05.459> areas

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
his chest area and these two areas

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.520 
his chest area and these two areas
though<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.150> silver<00:04:06.450> bits<00:04:06.840> that's<00:04:07.170> actually

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
though the silver bits that's actually

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.440 
though the silver bits that's actually
not<00:04:07.709> part<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:07.950> his<00:04:08.040> body<00:04:08.220> that's<00:04:08.519> just<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.150> suit

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
not part of his body that's just a suit

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.440 
not part of his body that's just a suit
so<00:04:10.320> yeah<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.850> thought<00:04:11.850> it's<00:04:12.000> better<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.360> make

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
so yeah I thought it's better to make

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.330 
so yeah I thought it's better to make
this<00:04:13.050> version<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.470> classes<00:04:13.860> rather<00:04:14.040> than<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
this version of classes rather than the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.670 
this version of classes rather than the
x-men<00:04:15.150> The<00:04:15.300> Last<00:04:15.450> Stand<00:04:15.600> classes<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.530> one

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
x-men The Last Stand classes the one

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.560 
x-men The Last Stand classes the one
when<00:04:16.890> he<00:04:17.040> has<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.340> X<00:04:17.489> suit<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:17.940> know<00:04:18.060> because

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
when he has the X suit you know because

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.950 
when he has the X suit you know because
pur<00:04:18.780> khaas<00:04:19.080> on<00:04:20.270> classes<00:04:21.270> really<00:04:21.479> didn't<00:04:21.840> do

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
pur khaas on classes really didn't do

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.080 
pur khaas on classes really didn't do
anything<00:04:21.989> in<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.919> movie<00:04:23.340> besides<00:04:23.729> just

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
anything in that movie besides just

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.520 
anything in that movie besides just
wrecking<00:04:24.600> stuff<00:04:24.750> and

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
wrecking stuff and

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.530 
wrecking stuff and
x-men<00:04:25.920> in<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.160> last<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.820> movie<00:04:27.180> sucked

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
x-men in the last and that movie sucked

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.260 
x-men in the last and that movie sucked
so<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.710> for<00:04:29.220> his<00:04:29.340> legs<00:04:29.520> his<00:04:29.670> legs<00:04:29.910> are<00:04:30.030> really

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
so and for his legs his legs are really

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.400 
so and for his legs his legs are really
simple<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.600> there's<00:04:30.780> not<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:31.140> much

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
simple and there's not that much

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.200 
simple and there's not that much
reference<00:04:31.740> pictures<00:04:32.280> but<00:04:32.460> this<00:04:32.670> is<00:04:32.850> something

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
reference pictures but this is something

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.330 
reference pictures but this is something
I<00:04:33.390> could<00:04:33.600> kind<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:33.900> base<00:04:34.200> off<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:35.040> in<00:04:35.190> there

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
I could kind of base off so in there

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.890 
I could kind of base off so in there
yeah<00:04:35.490> there's<00:04:35.760> a<00:04:35.820> lot<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.090> white<00:04:36.300> marks<00:04:36.720> on

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
yeah there's a lot of white marks on

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.500 
yeah there's a lot of white marks on
this<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.080> don't<00:04:37.230> know<00:04:37.320> wasn't<00:04:37.620> what<00:04:37.950> they<00:04:38.160> are

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
this I don't know wasn't what they are

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.200 
this I don't know wasn't what they are
my<00:04:39.510> doesn't<00:04:40.080> matter<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.400> lining<00:04:42.060> I

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
my doesn't matter so and the lining I

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.510 
my doesn't matter so and the lining I
goes<00:04:42.870> all<00:04:43.050> right<00:04:43.230> I<00:04:43.290> think<00:04:43.770> it's<00:04:43.920> sort<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.370> like

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
goes all right I think it's sort of like

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.360 
goes all right I think it's sort of like
he<00:04:44.790> it's<00:04:45.000> his<00:04:45.270> jet<00:04:45.600> it's<00:04:45.750> his<00:04:45.960> jacket<00:04:46.590> buddy

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
he it's his jet it's his jacket buddy

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.120 
he it's his jet it's his jacket buddy
has<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.520> belt<00:04:47.910> wrapped<00:04:48.570> around<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:49.560> his<00:04:49.740> jacket

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
has a belt wrapped around the his jacket

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.560 
has a belt wrapped around the his jacket
so<00:04:50.250> it's<00:04:50.400> not<00:04:50.490> like<00:04:50.670> Iceman<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.240> was<00:04:51.330> like<00:04:51.540> a

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
so it's not like Iceman it was like a

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.810 
so it's not like Iceman it was like a
kind<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.020> like<00:04:52.170> a<00:04:52.200> trenchcoat<00:04:52.560> like<00:04:52.890> thing<00:04:53.160> and

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
kind of like a trenchcoat like thing and

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.300 
kind of like a trenchcoat like thing and
his<00:04:54.270> shoulders<00:04:54.780> are<00:04:54.930> also<00:04:55.230> painted<00:04:55.800> with<00:04:56.130> all

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
his shoulders are also painted with all

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.060 
his shoulders are also painted with all
these<00:04:56.460> tedious<00:04:57.240> little<00:04:57.480> dots<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.290> back<00:04:58.650> here

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
these tedious little dots and back here

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.220 
these tedious little dots and back here
to<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.520> back<00:04:59.550> was<00:05:00.000> really<00:05:00.240> nothing<00:05:00.660> I<00:05:00.750> base

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
to the back was really nothing I base

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.370 
to the back was really nothing I base
this<00:05:01.260> off<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.919> set<00:05:02.220> photo<00:05:03.020> yeah<00:05:04.020> I'm<00:05:04.200> not<00:05:04.350> sure

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
this off the set photo yeah I'm not sure

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.950 
this off the set photo yeah I'm not sure
so<00:05:04.919> it's<00:05:05.160> I<00:05:05.430> guess<00:05:05.820> it's<00:05:06.000> kind<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.360> accurate<00:05:06.750> so

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
so it's I guess it's kind of accurate so

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.580 
so it's I guess it's kind of accurate so
yeah<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.320> um<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:08.130> I<00:05:09.120> would<00:05:09.419> I<00:05:09.660> was<00:05:10.050> gonna<00:05:10.200> do

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
yeah and um and I would I was gonna do

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.960 
yeah and um and I would I was gonna do
the<00:05:10.770> same<00:05:10.919> thing<00:05:10.980> like<00:05:11.280> different<00:05:11.610> witness<00:05:11.850> or

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
the same thing like different witness or

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.770 
the same thing like different witness or
by<00:05:12.180> painting<00:05:12.660> some<00:05:13.140> steel<00:05:13.950> fingers<00:05:14.610> but<00:05:15.240> they

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
by painting some steel fingers but they

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.659 
by painting some steel fingers but they
keep<00:05:16.020> coming<00:05:16.410> off<00:05:16.530> all<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.919> time<00:05:17.160> and<00:05:17.430> it's

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
keep coming off all the time and it's

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.310 
keep coming off all the time and it's
really<00:05:17.730> not<00:05:18.030> necessary<00:05:18.540> for<00:05:18.720> classes<00:05:19.169> to<00:05:19.200> a
