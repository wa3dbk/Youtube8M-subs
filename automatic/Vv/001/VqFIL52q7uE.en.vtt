00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.310
 what others only dream of for him is that 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.200
 everyday life 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.690
 earlier david byrne in the bentley 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.990
 factory is working now he is the 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.510
 company chauffeur and is paid for it 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.990
 This luxury sedan makes the tedious too 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.990
 drive 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.250
 hard to say what a typical 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.680
 Bentley customer is 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.670
 I think it's mainly 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.489
 successful people and the numbers for 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.370
 this luxury vehicle almost 300,000 euros 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.770
 For that you get all extras wood 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.230
 fittings and leather upholstery everything after 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.489
 wish with a special production drives 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.530
 also the royal family 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.860
 The limousine is manufactured south 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.899
 from manchester because they are from the premium 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.750
 model only five copies a day 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.080
 almost everything happens in manufacturing 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.080
 Handwork 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.920
 who works here needs a lot of experience 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.670
 an old-fashioned method no other 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.259
 Manufacturer does it that way it's one 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.580
 labor-intensive art it takes a lot 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.390
 skill the parts so too 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.700
 weld hourly wage around 20 euros 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.760
 about half of what the colleagues 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.950
 earn in germany 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.130
 for volkswagen the german owner 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.229
 The company has a location advantage with over 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.050
 a billion euros vw has the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.910
 production modernized 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.290
 so most models can now 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.110
 be produced tape 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.580
 because barely more than 55 leave 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.580
 dare the factory a day 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.690
 and the boss is a german wolfgang 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.270
 dÃ¼rheimer was formerly a chief engineer 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.590
 porsche and audi 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.070
 for one year , the president of 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.070
 bentley 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.040
 clear case bright special colors so 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.980
 China in China has a lot more 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.980
 Customers also in the USA and Russia 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:29.879
 it is a feeling of absolute pride 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.010
 and luck because there is no activity where 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.599
 you sign up and say hey i want 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.370
 The president of Bentley Motors 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.080
 become 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.209
 You can only be proud of this question 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.950
 say modestly yes, hopefully 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.950
 I can do justice to this task 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.230
 before vw came they made here last 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.590
 owe 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:00.170
 it has been winning for several years 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.170
 around 170 million euros per year 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.209
 From now until 2016 we invest 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.090
 another 800 million pounds in the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.310
 factories crew 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.280
 that means new models in new ones 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:23.129
 building and new machines but of course 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:28.349
 also in coworkers what the cars so 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:30.180
 expensive is the handwork this 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.269
 imprinted purely here that feels 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.739
 soft and they go absolutely 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:39.840
 parallel here is the leather 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.870
 Sewn together for the whole 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.900
 interior paneling it smells 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.019
 cowhide every color is one 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.659
 customer request the high proportion of 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.030
 Handarbeit secures the 4000 jobs 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:04:00.780
 Bentley and many are happy about the 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:02.459
 investments by vw we have the cars 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.739
 Everything is pushed by hand 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.900
 the sum automates the vw here 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.609
 Investing is amazing with it 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.919
 we can develop new models 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:14.699
 In the past there was a new one every 15 years 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:17.599
 model with vw is constantly new and 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:20.970
 Then it is time to polish again 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:24.220
 polish again for the driver 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:28.090
 David Burnham is one of them 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.870
 because for him it is more than a car it 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.870
 is his workplace
