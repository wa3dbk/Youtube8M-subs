00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
to be as frugal as possible the one day

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.710 
to be as frugal as possible the one day
really<00:02:09.430> is<00:02:09.460> this<00:02:09.670> off<00:02:09.850> godfather<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.570> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
really is this off godfather of the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.230 
really is this off godfather of the
saloon<00:02:11.050> these<00:02:11.740> days<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:12.910> it's<00:02:13.090> the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
saloon these days and so it's the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.750 
saloon these days and so it's the
benchmark<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.930> used<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:15.160> master<00:02:15.580> is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
benchmark that we used the master is

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.940 
benchmark that we used the master is
supposed<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.270> be<00:02:16.420> ten<00:02:16.900> miles<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.740> gallon

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
supposed to be ten miles to the gallon

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.370 
supposed to be ten miles to the gallon
better<00:02:18.610> than<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.300> one<00:02:19.420> day<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.020> detect

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
better than the one day of so detect

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.940 
better than the one day of so detect
this<00:02:20.590> we<00:02:21.280> took<00:02:21.520> both<00:02:21.850> cars<00:02:22.240> around<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.320> two-mile

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
this we took both cars around a two-mile

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.090 
this we took both cars around a two-mile
banked<00:02:24.250> Bowl<00:02:24.820> flat<00:02:25.420> out<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.470> see<00:02:26.650> what<00:02:26.920> the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
computers to set the pace we took them

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.790 
computers to set the pace we took them
on<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.430> first<00:02:33.880> full<00:02:34.330> throttle<00:02:34.870> built<00:02:35.230> up<00:02:35.410> speed

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
on a first full throttle built up speed

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.430 
on a first full throttle built up speed
from<00:02:36.040> out<00:02:36.190> four<00:02:36.550> miles<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.930> innocent

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
from out four miles and the innocent

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.920 
from out four miles and the innocent
fuel<00:02:38.709> consumption<00:02:39.250> meter<00:02:39.510> bounce<00:02:40.510> backwards

and<00:02:41.230> forwards<00:02:41.530> from<00:02:41.590> about<00:02:41.800> 17<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.670> 21<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.720> we

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
and forwards from about 17 to 21 so we

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.500 
and forwards from about 17 to 21 so we
reckon<00:02:44.860> we'll<00:02:44.980> give<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.220> an<00:02:45.310> average<00:02:45.670> about<00:02:45.910> 19

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
reckon we'll give it an average about 19

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.280 
reckon we'll give it an average about 19
miles<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.930> gallon

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.320 
miles to the gallon
at<00:02:47.620> 125<00:02:48.550> miles<00:02:48.850> an<00:02:49.030> hour

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
at 125 miles an hour

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.920 
at 125 miles an hour
we<00:02:50.840> took<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.080> mazda6<00:02:51.410> out<00:02:51.860> next<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.720> has

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
we took the mazda6 out next so this has

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.440 
we took the mazda6 out next so this has
got<00:02:54.140> less<00:02:54.770> powerful<00:02:55.370> but<00:02:55.400> more<00:02:55.730> talky<00:02:56.030> engine

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
got less powerful but more talky engine

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.990 
got less powerful but more talky engine

than a 2-liter Mondeo I tell you what
that<00:02:59.090> feels<00:02:59.330> like<00:02:59.450> it's<00:02:59.690> accelerating

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
that feels like it's accelerating

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.590 
that feels like it's accelerating

not just in terminal velocity in top
speed<00:04:45.400> but<00:04:45.550> also<00:04:45.639> it<00:04:46.180> got<00:04:46.599> to<00:04:46.779> that<00:04:46.930> top<00:04:47.139> speed
