00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.449
 hi friends welcome surface since 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.880
 denied today the mag is then looked 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.099
 yesterday I think you'll like it 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.380
 you will need pepper salt from the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.050
 sweet and sour mustard half a baguette 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.239
 obviously a hamburger steak from the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.940
 salad and two bed hives potatoes 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.309
 earth in a pan or to cook the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.829
 meat as well as hives kit from 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.879
 potatoes and we think about salt and 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.520
 pepper the meat 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.850
 you will now have the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.850
 chopsticks 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.440
 once done we go to dressage 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.530
 for the very simple training of the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.739
 mustard on the bottom bread and on the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.420
 bread from the top and you and go well 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.600
 then on the organic bread you go 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.210
 put the salad and on the bottom bread 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.000
 you will put the steaks 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.130
 so if you want to put more 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.560
 you can me I just put one 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.750
 cut in half for the video for not that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.170
 that in sentence too much and then you 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.479
 go put the little pucks of 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.900
 rÃ¶sti then you shut up and that's 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.869
 completed 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.030
 so that yesterday we have beautiful male wand 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:35.549
 well round so I can not wait to taste it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:37.170
 so it's gone hu has the taste 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.720
 frankly delicious it looks 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.479
 really to this schema exception 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.799
 it's a lot cooler a lot more 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.530
 juicy or less dry 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.150
 so here I hope that 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.430

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.290

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.940

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.890
