00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
workflow in Lightroom maybe more so than

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.530 
workflow in Lightroom maybe more so than

you because let's say you wanted to find

you because let's say you wanted to find
an<00:02:26.460> image<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.760> you've<00:02:27.090> shot<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.990> shot

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
an image that you've shot and you shot

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.870 
an image that you've shot and you shot
it<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:28.560> three<00:02:28.920> months<00:02:29.220> or<00:02:29.340> three<00:02:29.520> years<00:02:29.820> ago

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
it like three months or three years ago

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.700 
it like three months or three years ago
and<00:02:30.240> it's<00:02:30.390> somewhere<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:30.840> your<00:02:30.960> library<00:02:31.410> all

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
and it's somewhere in your library all

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.650 
and it's somewhere in your library all
you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.310> do<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.550> type<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:32.910> some<00:02:33.090> keywords<00:02:33.300> and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
you can do is type in some keywords and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.930 
you can do is type in some keywords and
bam<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.350> image<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.800> going<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.980> come<00:02:35.250> up<00:02:35.430> it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
bam that image is going to come up it

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.370 
bam that image is going to come up it
also<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.450> really<00:02:36.600> helpful<00:02:36.960> when<00:02:37.260> you're

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
also is really helpful when you're

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.350 
also is really helpful when you're
exporting<00:02:37.710> your<00:02:37.980> images<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.610> post<00:02:38.940> let's<00:02:39.180> say

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
exporting your images to post let's say

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.360 
exporting your images to post let's say
on<00:02:39.480> Flickr<00:02:39.840> because<00:02:40.560> there's<00:02:40.770> all<00:02:41.010> kinds<00:02:41.340> of

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
on Flickr because there's all kinds of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.430 
on Flickr because there's all kinds of
keyword<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:41.880> tagging<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.260> don't

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
keyword and tagging that if you don't

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.600 
keyword and tagging that if you don't
have<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.770> type<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.190> again

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
have to type it again

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.420 
have to type it again

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
why type it again apply it on the in on

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.940 
why type it again apply it on the in on
the<00:02:47.610> onset<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.200> importing<00:02:49.200> these<00:02:49.320> images<00:02:49.740> and

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the onset of importing these images and

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.310 
the onset of importing these images and
it<00:02:50.040> will<00:02:50.130> be<00:02:50.280> there<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:51.000> I've<00:02:51.210> created<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.110> bunch

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
it will be there so I've created a bunch

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.900 
it will be there so I've created a bunch
here<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.830> I'm<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.160> gonna<00:02:53.250> paste<00:02:53.640> those<00:02:53.850> into

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
here and I'm just gonna paste those into

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.520 
here and I'm just gonna paste those into
there<00:02:54.270> for<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.570> sake<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.810> time<00:02:55.110> I'm<00:02:55.380> going<00:02:55.470> to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
there for the sake of time I'm going to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.460 
there for the sake of time I'm going to
import<00:02:55.950> these<00:02:56.160> now<00:02:56.700> as<00:02:57.120> these<00:02:57.870> images<00:02:58.050> are

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
import these now as these images are

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.190 
import these now as these images are
importing<00:02:59.180> all<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.480> these<00:03:00.630> settings<00:03:01.020> are

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
importing all of these settings are

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.340 
importing all of these settings are
being<00:03:01.500> applied<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.910> one<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.750> things<00:03:04.020> that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
being applied and one of the things that

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.410 
being applied and one of the things that
that<00:03:04.380> really<00:03:04.860> is<00:03:04.980> great<00:03:05.190> about<00:03:05.640> all<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.150> is

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
that really is great about all this is

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.990 
that really is great about all this is
that<00:03:06.450> once<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.350> get<00:03:07.530> these<00:03:07.650> images<00:03:08.190> into<00:03:08.460> my

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
that once I get these images into my

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.080 
that once I get these images into my
library<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:10.020> will<00:03:10.620> have<00:03:10.860> all<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.400> those<00:03:11.580> basic

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
library I will have all of those basic

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.600 
library I will have all of those basic
settings<00:03:12.540> embedded<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.710> these<00:03:13.890> images<00:03:14.070> it

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
settings embedded in these images it

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.220 
settings embedded in these images it
doesn't<00:03:15.030> mean<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.210> that's<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.900> be-all

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
doesn't mean that that's the be-all

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.680 
doesn't mean that that's the be-all
end-all<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:17.160> it's<00:03:17.340> done<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.940> there's<00:03:18.480> no

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
end-all that it's done that there's no

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.630 
end-all that it's done that there's no
way<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:18.960> me<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.380> modify<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.130> or<00:03:20.280> change<00:03:20.520> it

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
way for me to modify it or change it

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.280 
way for me to modify it or change it
just<00:03:20.880> means<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.270> I've<00:03:21.390> applied<00:03:21.660> some<00:03:21.780> basic

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
just means that I've applied some basic

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.900 
just means that I've applied some basic
settings<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.890> I've<00:03:23.160> gotten<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.490> little<00:03:23.700> bit<00:03:23.790> of

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
settings and I've gotten a little bit of

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.270 
settings and I've gotten a little bit of
jump<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.840> game<00:03:25.050> here<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.830> that's<00:03:26.070> what<00:03:26.250> I

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
jump on the game here so that's what I

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.300 
jump on the game here so that's what I
wanted<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.760> talk<00:03:26.910> about<00:03:26.970> today<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:28.310> we're

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
wanted to talk about today and we're

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.220 
wanted to talk about today and we're
going<00:03:29.460> to<00:03:29.520> get<00:03:29.700> into<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.300> lot<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.690> workflow

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230
