00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
since I was 3 and if you want to learn

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.099 
since I was 3 and if you want to learn
the<00:00:14.460> basics<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.030> chest<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.660> have<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.960> know

the basics of chest you have to know

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.859 
the basics of chest you have to know
what<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.250> pieces<00:00:17.580> needs<00:00:17.820> are<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.420> their

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
what the pieces needs are and their

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.179 
what the pieces needs are and their
value<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:20.029> King<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.710> I'm<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.010> start

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
value so King and I'm going to start

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.509 
value so King and I'm going to start
with<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> font<00:00:23.930> upon<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:26.119> worth<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.510> point

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
with the font upon is worth one point

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.339 
with the font upon is worth one point
but<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.119> very<00:00:30.150> valuable<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
but it can be very valuable on the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.280 
but it can be very valuable on the
engine<00:00:31.769> because<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> end<00:00:32.910> game<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:34.079> can

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
engine because in the end game you can

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.040 
engine because in the end game you can
get<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.430> eighth<00:00:36.120> rank<00:00:36.780> back<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:39.050> like

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
get it to the eighth rank back here like

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.729 
get it to the eighth rank back here like
if<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.559> marched<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.700> pawn<00:00:42.350> most<00:00:43.350> unlikely

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
if I marched up this pawn most unlikely

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.229 
if I marched up this pawn most unlikely
but<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.610> marched<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.539> took<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.020> I

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
but if I marched it up and took this I

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.920 
but if I marched it up and took this I
could<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.450> another<00:00:49.320> Queen<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.570> Queens

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
could get another Queen and Queens

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.740 
could get another Queen and Queens
are<00:00:52.160> most<00:00:53.160> powerful<00:00:53.640> pieces<00:00:53.879> or<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.390> could<00:00:54.629> get

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
are most powerful pieces or I could get

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.319 
are most powerful pieces or I could get
a<00:00:54.780> bishop<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:55.320> rock<00:00:55.469> or<00:00:55.649> all<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:56.789> whichever

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
a bishop or rock or all right whichever

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.189 
a bishop or rock or all right whichever
one<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> want<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> they're<00:01:00.059> very<00:01:00.090> viable<00:01:00.930> in

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
one I want it so they're very viable in

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.979 
one I want it so they're very viable in
India<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.010> they<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.430> run<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> very<00:01:03.359> first<00:01:03.690> move

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
India and they can run a very first move

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.600 
India and they can run a very first move
from<00:01:04.500> two<00:01:04.890> squares<00:01:05.430> straight<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:08.280> its

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
from two squares straight so here on its

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.090 
from two squares straight so here on its
very<00:01:08.909> first<00:01:09.119> milk<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.020> after<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.530> after<00:01:10.979> its

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
very first milk but after that after its

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.789 
very first milk but after that after its
first<00:01:11.340> move<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.390> only<00:01:12.510> move<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:12.840> square<00:01:13.380> 4

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
first move it can only move one square 4

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.260 
first move it can only move one square 4
or<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:15.540> you're<00:01:15.780> taking<00:01:16.290> something<00:01:17.060> then<00:01:18.060> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
or if you're taking something then you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
or if you're taking something then you
can<00:01:18.420> move<00:01:18.600> diagonally<00:01:20.030> but<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:22.020> only

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
can move diagonally but the only

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.010 
can move diagonally but the only
disadvantage<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.670> pawns<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.330> they<00:01:24.540> can't<00:01:24.840> move

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
disadvantage to pawns is they can't move

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
disadvantage to pawns is they can't move
backwards<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.430> point<00:01:26.670> wasn't<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:27.180> I

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
backwards so if this point wasn't here I

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.910 
backwards so if this point wasn't here I
can<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.570 

and<00:01:31.150> so<00:01:32.150> this<00:01:32.390> is<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.720> rook<00:01:32.930> it's<00:01:33.890> worth<00:01:34.220> five

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
and so this is the rook it's worth five

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.220 
and so this is the rook it's worth five
so<00:01:35.570> pretty<00:01:36.020> valuable<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.870> it<00:01:38.870> move<00:01:39.830> straight

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
so pretty valuable and it move straight

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.430 
so pretty valuable and it move straight
and<00:01:42.230> stuff<00:01:42.530> as<00:01:43.000> many<00:01:44.000> spaces<00:01:44.360> isn't<00:01:44.840> once<00:01:45.080> as

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
and stuff as many spaces isn't once as

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.290 
and stuff as many spaces isn't once as
long<00:01:45.620> as<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.070> doesn't<00:01:46.310> try<00:01:46.730> and<00:01:46.760> jump<00:01:47.090> over

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
long as it doesn't try and jump over

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.660 
long as it doesn't try and jump over
something<00:01:47.930> saying<00:01:48.500> can't<00:01:49.010> jump<00:01:49.250> over<00:01:49.580> this

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
something saying can't jump over this

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.850 
something saying can't jump over this
pawn<00:01:49.970> if<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:50.990> wanted<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.380> go<00:01:51.530> in<00:01:51.680> that

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
pawn if you wanted to go in that

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.280 
pawn if you wanted to go in that
direction<00:01:52.070> straight<00:01:52.880> you'd<00:01:53.479> have<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:53.840> take<00:01:54.050> it

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
direction straight you'd have to take it

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.590 
direction straight you'd have to take it
and<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:56.030> rooks<00:01:56.210> can<00:01:56.510> go<00:01:56.630> backwards<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:58.600> but

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
and the rooks can go backwards and but

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.780 
and the rooks can go backwards and but
these<00:01:59.960> can't<00:02:00.320> go<00:02:00.500> diagonals<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:02.080> night<00:02:03.790> most

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
these can't go diagonals the night most

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.840 
these can't go diagonals the night most
people<00:02:05.090> call<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.450> horse<00:02:05.650> but<00:02:06.650> it's<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.700> knife

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
people call it a horse but it's a knife

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.140 
people call it a horse but it's a knife
it<00:02:08.509> moves<00:02:09.440> in<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.890> weirdest<00:02:10.280> way<00:02:10.489> just<00:02:10.970> like

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
it moves in the weirdest way just like

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.130 
it moves in the weirdest way just like
its<00:02:11.330> shape<00:02:11.420> up<00:02:11.930> over<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.489> up<00:02:14.090> two<00:02:14.450> squares<00:02:14.840> up

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
its shape up over so up two squares up

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.440 
its shape up over so up two squares up
two<00:02:15.410> squares<00:02:15.739> over<00:02:16.640> one<00:02:16.790> more<00:02:17.260> sideways<00:02:18.260> any

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
two squares over one more sideways any

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.390 
two squares over one more sideways any
two<00:02:20.450> squares<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.290> but<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.890> one<00:02:22.130> can't

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
two squares on it but this one can't

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.100 
two squares on it but this one can't
move<00:02:22.550> diagonally<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.950> full<00:02:25.750> balance<00:02:26.750> to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
move diagonally but the full balance to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.720 
move diagonally but the full balance to
the<00:02:27.230> night<00:02:27.440> why<00:02:27.770> it's<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.130> valuable<00:02:28.370> because

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
the night why it's so valuable because

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.080 
the night why it's so valuable because
it's<00:02:29.180> worth<00:02:29.420> three<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.560> not<00:02:31.280> too<00:02:31.459> bad<00:02:31.670> because

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
it's worth three so not too bad because

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.590 
it's worth three so not too bad because
it<00:02:32.330> can<00:02:32.510> jump<00:02:32.720> over<00:02:32.930> plants<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.620> pieces<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:35.360> it

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
it can jump over plants and pieces so it

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.030 
it can jump over plants and pieces so it
can<00:02:35.750> jump<00:02:35.930> over<00:02:36.170> here<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:39.080> that's<00:02:39.650> pretty

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
can jump over here and so that's pretty

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.240 
can jump over here and so that's pretty
powerful<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.930> nice<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.650> be<00:02:42.799> able<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.010> jump

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
powerful it's nice to be able to jump

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.820 
powerful it's nice to be able to jump
over<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.299> isn't<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.570> bishop<00:02:44.959> it's

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
over and this isn't the bishop it's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.590 
over and this isn't the bishop it's
worth<00:02:46.790> three<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.450> like<00:02:47.630> tonight<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:50.360> can

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
worth three just like tonight and it can

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.949 
worth three just like tonight and it can
move<00:02:50.840> diagonally<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:53.330> like<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.720> rook<00:02:53.930> the

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
move diagonally it's like the rook the

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.470 
move diagonally it's like the rook the
rook<00:02:54.200> can<00:02:54.410> move<00:02:54.739> straight<00:02:55.130> as<00:02:55.519> many<00:02:55.760> spaces<00:02:56.120> as

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
rook can move straight as many spaces as

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.750 
rook can move straight as many spaces as
it<00:02:56.660> wants<00:02:57.049> as<00:02:57.290> long<00:02:57.380> as<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.920> doesn't<00:02:58.130> jump<00:02:58.400> over

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
it wants as long as it doesn't jump over

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.289 
it wants as long as it doesn't jump over
anything

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
anything

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.900 
anything
but<00:02:59.989> this<00:03:00.230> can<00:03:00.560> move<00:03:00.680> diagonally<00:03:01.459> as<00:03:01.610> many

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
but this can move diagonally as many

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.789 
but this can move diagonally as many
spaces<00:03:02.269> as<00:03:02.630> your<00:03:02.780> arms<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:05.600> but<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.560> one

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
spaces as your arms so it but this one

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:07.580 
spaces as your arms so it but this one
can't<00:03:07.010> jump

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
can't jump

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.860 
can't jump
or<00:03:07.709> either<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.370> would<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:08.970> take<00:03:09.180> two<00:03:09.420> just

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
or either it would have to take two just

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.280 
or either it would have to take two just
like<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.230> rook<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:12.120> Queen<00:03:12.390> likes<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.200> be

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
like the rook and the Queen likes to be

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.050 
like the rook and the Queen likes to be
on<00:03:13.319> her<00:03:13.590> color<00:03:13.830> white<00:03:15.020> so<00:03:16.020> this<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.310> queen<00:03:17.580> is

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
on her color white so this the queen is

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.820 
on her color white so this the queen is
the<00:03:18.239> most<00:03:18.420> powerful<00:03:18.810> piece<00:03:19.440> on<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
the most powerful piece on the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.729 
the most powerful piece on the
chessboard<00:03:20.120> because<00:03:21.120> it's<00:03:21.540> worth<00:03:22.080> nine<00:03:22.440> and

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
chessboard because it's worth nine and

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.360 
chessboard because it's worth nine and
it<00:03:23.069> can<00:03:23.220> move<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.580> any<00:03:23.819> direction<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:25.650> wants<00:03:25.950> so

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
it can move in any direction it wants so

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.900 
it can move in any direction it wants so
it's<00:03:26.519> like<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.700> combined<00:03:27.239> rook<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.810> Bishop<00:03:28.910> so

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
it's like a combined rook and Bishop so

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.790 
it's like a combined rook and Bishop so
it<00:03:30.300> can<00:03:30.510> move<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:30.810> any<00:03:30.959> direction<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.709> wants

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
it can move in any direction it wants

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.640 
it can move in any direction it wants
its<00:03:32.099> many<00:03:32.340> spaces<00:03:32.940> but<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.930> like<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.170> bishop

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
its many spaces but just like the bishop

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.290 
its many spaces but just like the bishop
and<00:03:34.769> Roque<00:03:35.220> can't<00:03:35.519> jump<00:03:35.819> over<00:03:35.970> stuff<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:38.300> so

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
and Roque can't jump over stuff and so

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.520 
and Roque can't jump over stuff and so
this<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.049> king

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
this is the king

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.880 
this is the king
it's<00:03:41.400> no<00:03:41.569> valuable<00:03:42.569> piece<00:03:42.810> because<00:03:43.440> if<00:03:43.769> you

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
it's no valuable piece because if you

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.449 
it's no valuable piece because if you
get<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.250> taken<00:03:44.780> game<00:03:45.780> over<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.440> lose<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.370> you

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
get it taken game over you lose so you

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.789 
get it taken game over you lose so you
don't<00:03:47.670> want<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.030> get<00:03:48.150> taken<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.620> piece

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
don't want it to get taken that it piece

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.990 
don't want it to get taken that it piece
has<00:03:49.980> your<00:03:50.160> king<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.760> you're<00:03:51.180> gonna<00:03:51.299> lose<00:03:51.540> and

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
has your king so you're gonna lose and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.910 
has your king so you're gonna lose and
most<00:03:54.000> people<00:03:54.480> say<00:03:54.690> it's<00:03:54.900> worth<00:03:55.080> zero<00:03:55.440> but<00:03:55.709> it's

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
most people say it's worth zero but it's

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.520 
most people say it's worth zero but it's
actually<00:03:56.670> worth<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:56.910> game<00:03:57.360> so<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.230> probably

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
actually worth the game so you probably

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.300 
actually worth the game so you probably
want<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.040> not<00:03:59.459> let<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.849> get<00:03:59.940> taken<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.099> can

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
want to not let it get taken so it can

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.630 
want to not let it get taken so it can
move<00:04:02.489> any<00:04:02.849> direction<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.989> wants<00:04:04.170> but<00:04:04.769> only<00:04:05.010> one

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
move any direction it wants but only one

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.110 
move any direction it wants but only one
square<00:04:06.180> one<00:04:06.540> square<00:04:06.900> so<00:04:07.709> if<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:07.860> move<00:04:08.010> here<00:04:08.340> here

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
square one square so if I move here here

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.099 
square one square so if I move here here
here<00:04:09.690> but<00:04:09.870> it<00:04:09.959> can't<00:04:10.170> move<00:04:10.380> two<00:04:10.680> squares<00:04:10.920> and

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
here but it can't move two squares and

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.800 
here but it can't move two squares and
so<00:04:13.160> once<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.280> learn<00:04:14.459> all<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.480> learn<00:04:15.630> all

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
so once you learn all that and learn all

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.630 
so once you learn all that and learn all
the<00:04:15.930> basics<00:04:16.380> then<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.280> can<00:04:17.430> get<00:04:17.579> on

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
the basics then you can get on

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.420 
the basics then you can get on
strategies<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.660> planning<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.769> one

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
strategies and planning and that one

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.120 
strategies and planning and that one
chest<00:04:20.729> begins
