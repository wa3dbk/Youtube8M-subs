look<00:00:10.740> right<00:00:10.980> back<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.400> here<00:00:12.170> right<00:00:13.170> up<00:00:13.380> there

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
look right back in here right up there

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.420 
look right back in here right up there
is<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.040> spring<00:00:14.570> that's<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.780> spring<00:00:16.109> there

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
is the spring that's the spring there

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.200 
is the spring that's the spring there
what<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.460> did<00:00:17.670> was<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.240> use<00:00:19.140> these<00:00:20.060> needle<00:00:21.060> nose

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
what I did was I use these needle nose

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.089 
what I did was I use these needle nose
pliers<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.160> hook<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:24.199> zip<00:00:25.199> tie<00:00:25.439> up<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
pliers and hook this zip tie up to the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.640 
pliers and hook this zip tie up to the
spring<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.689> actually<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.230> pull<00:00:28.500> it

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
spring and you can actually just pull it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.910 
spring and you can actually just pull it
back<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.189> pop<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.330> over<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:31.439> only<00:00:31.650> thing<00:00:31.830> is

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
back and pop it over the only thing is

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
back and pop it over the only thing is
that<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.099> doesn't<00:00:32.219> go<00:00:32.369> all<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> way<00:00:32.640> over<00:00:32.940> so

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that it doesn't go all the way over so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750 
that it doesn't go all the way over so
you<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.290> use<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.620> needle<00:00:34.860> nose<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.579> push

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you have to use the needle nose to push

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.670 
you have to use the needle nose to push
it<00:00:35.850> over<00:00:36.030> even<00:00:36.120> more<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:37.200> once<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it over even more but once you get it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.660 
it over even more but once you get it
over<00:00:38.989> you'll<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.500> hide<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.950> zip<00:00:41.190> ties<00:00:42.350> down

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
over you'll just hide the zip ties down

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.639 
over you'll just hide the zip ties down
back<00:00:44.670> behind<00:00:46.160> down<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.910> they<00:00:48.780> they

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
back behind down in there and they they

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.560 
back behind down in there and they they
just<00:00:49.680> kind<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.129> hide<00:00:50.309> back<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.670> there<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.059> then

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
just kind of hide back in there and then

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.549 
just kind of hide back in there and then
you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.780> use<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:53.000> needle<00:00:54.000> nose<00:00:54.289> to<00:00:55.289> pull<00:00:55.440> them

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you can use the needle nose to pull them

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.619 
you can use the needle nose to pull them
back<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.949> if<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.820> need<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> reattach<00:00:57.300> them

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
back out if you need to reattach them

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.900 
back out if you need to reattach them
and<00:00:58.789> they<00:00:59.789> lock<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.149> place<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.640> no<00:01:02.640> big<00:01:02.789> deal

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and they lock in place so no big deal

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.179 
and they lock in place so no big deal
but<00:01:03.030> I'm<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> show<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.799> how<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.830> push<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
but I'm going to show you how to push it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.130 
but I'm going to show you how to push it
over<00:01:05.430> because<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.909> try<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.110> one

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
over because I try to do this with one

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.289 
over because I try to do this with one
hand<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.010> needed<00:01:08.369> two<00:01:08.520> hands<00:01:08.729> earlier<00:01:08.850> so

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
hand but I needed two hands earlier so

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:22.440 
hand but I needed two hands earlier so
we'll<00:01:09.689> see

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.990 

perfect<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.290> how<00:01:26.680> I<00:01:26.710> got<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.040> zip<00:01:27.640> tie<00:01:27.850> on

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
perfect so how I got the zip tie on

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.139 
perfect so how I got the zip tie on
originally<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.630> I<00:01:28.810> just<00:01:29.110> grabbed<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.350> spring

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
originally is I just grabbed the spring

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.050 
originally is I just grabbed the spring
pulled<00:01:31.149> it<00:01:31.270> down<00:01:31.299> and<00:01:32.340> use<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.490> zip<00:01:33.700> tie<00:01:33.880> and

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
pulled it down and use the zip tie and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.370 
pulled it down and use the zip tie and
feed<00:01:34.299> it<00:01:34.450> through<00:01:35.580> through<00:01:36.580> pull<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:36.880> down

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
feed it through through pull it down

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.620 
feed it through through pull it down
enough<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.680> where<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.700> can<00:01:40.149> get<00:01:40.270> behind<00:01:40.420> the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
enough to where you can get behind the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.779 
enough to where you can get behind the
spring<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:43.140> then<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.920> then<00:01:45.250> once<00:01:45.430> it's<00:01:45.610> on

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
spring and then and then once it's on

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.350 
spring and then and then once it's on
there<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.869> can<00:01:46.990> just<00:01:47.049> pull<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.619> zip<00:01:47.830> tie

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
there you can just pull the zip tie

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.070 
there you can just pull the zip tie
through<00:01:49.360> on<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:51.130> spring<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:52.090> then<00:01:52.810> do<00:01:52.960> the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
through on the spring and then do the

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.740 
through on the spring and then do the
zip<00:01:53.289> tie<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:57.479> then<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.630> have<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:58.990> there<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.649> is
