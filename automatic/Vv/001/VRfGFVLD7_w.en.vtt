00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.250
 episode 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.250
 today I'm going to make a recipe that is for 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.620

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.509
 diet scheduled for a week from now 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.299
 because it's a chocolate cake with 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.539
 Prestige chocolate coverage is 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.920
 Wonderful is soft in making up the man 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.779
 of caves know how to do 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.609
 so I want to see you do it and then 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.519
 put it in the comments what you found 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.119
 Okay, it's still there as I always say 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.119
 easypeasy 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.930
 reminding everyone that all the revenue is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.650
 in the video description will hit the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.140
 blender the eggs the oil and the milk 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.360
 for about three minutes until 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.430
 a very white color or 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.250
 until that egg smell comes out 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 Then you will reserve this mixture after 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.330
 You'll get a container one 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.050
 container is going to mix the 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.809
 wheat flour the yeast the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.149
 chocolate and grated coconut grated coconut 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.399
 To the pleasure I have a good amount 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.680
 because it is all distributed in the 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.880
 mass and smoked it explores setecs and he 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.550
 little piece of coconut 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.440
 although it will already have in the filling 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.030
 never image 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.490
 after taking a mexidinha where only 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.380
 to stay more or less uniform and there 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.810
 Then you'll get all that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.780
 mix you will have an indicator and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.660
 will start to add gradually 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.180
 In this mixture of flour, sugar and 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.610
 until a consistent mass 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 I'm a lazy dude, I got it. 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.920
 That mixer and I got mad because 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.220
 otherwise I would stay there for a while now if 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.070
 you 're with patience goes deep is a 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.810
 good gym 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.510
 now just get a shape and one with the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.479
 with butter and a hint of my 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.240
 mother-in-law went through wheat flour because 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.490
 then it is much easier to release the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.189
 fashion background cake 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.710
 now just get that mix of 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.979
 flour the sugar and the march you 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.259
 beat the blender and put it on 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.560
 shape and bake for more or less 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.290
 40 minutes or until you 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.660
 put the toothpick and come out clean as I did 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.650
 in the electric oven took me more or less 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.209
 one hour 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.260
 then depends on the oven temperature 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.940
 more or less 200 to 300 degrees for more 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.760
 or less about 40 minutes 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.739
 Now, in a separate phase, we're going to 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.660
 make the sauce that is to wet the goal 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.180
 which is very wet then he 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.310
 You will put your coconut milk and milk 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.380
 the three tablespoons of sugar 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.510
 Then you'll just give me a little bit of candy. 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.739
 is uniform and will leave aside 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.450
 that we will only leave after the 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.370
 cake is ready, now it's going 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.739
 start working 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.310
 full is the following you to a pan 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.819
 take it easy on the butter 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.500
 condensate and about 100 grams of 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.209
 cocaine side I'm going to have a little bit 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.440
 But because as I said at the beginning I 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:04.290
 I moored coconut and then just let it cook 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.540
 a little until you peel off the pan 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.819
 It's too much to cook, you 'll notice 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.709
 video consistency as soon as you unglue 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.079
 the panela is already good 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.670
 then you once again reserve the entire 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.140
 People are doing reservation, right? 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.660
 the revenue also goes to the group of 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.980
 reserved reserved there that the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.410
 people will use it later 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.120
 then you may already realize that is already 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.620
 getting a consistency well way that 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.079
 is more or less what we want 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.989
 saw knee to pan sauce consistency 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:35.010
 perfect now let's work on 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.040
 cover that goes on top of the soft cake 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.829
 This gives me a soft work load. 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.500
 work to take time but is 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.900
 easy to make adopt all 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.280
 ingredients and will let them cook 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.290
 for a good 10 to 15 minutes to 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.840
 consistency stay the way you already 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.099
 can perceive in the video the consistency 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.530
 It's getting like we want it to be. 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.569
 glaciological a syrup then it will lead 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.090
 10 15 minutes will get its consistency 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.639
 cool now what a wonderful after 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.549
 wait for almost an hour the owner got 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:12.060
 I've taken the cake out of the oven and there's the 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.650
 The result was beautiful, how do we 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.139
 will cut onion in the middle 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.389
 My sister-in-law's tip is the people. 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.849
 will pass the knife that is just to show 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.389
 where are we going to vote for our weapon 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:26.310
 secrete a dental floss 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.110
 can not take the meat is present 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.389
 the tooth not we even think 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.660
 dental care and will exactly put us 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:36.449
 began to cut with the knife and will 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.210
 the other side that will cut perfect 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.740
 then when the cake is open to 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.440
 people will get that mix that 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.900
 people made for a look at the prolific cake 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:51.090
 Wet and we'll vote without fear 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:53.460
 but not too pro bono to be a pope 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.020
 right to put to vote with spoon 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.360
 I put a little of a violent way 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.250
 Calm did not like it too much ok then 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.280
 of this process of wetting the cake 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.710
 the part that in my opinion is the best 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.599
 part of the cake filling 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.819
 We'll get the stuff that the 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.759
 people separated and will spread over the 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.770
 cake in a way it gets around 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.509
 whole cake and then after we 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.669
 Does it look like you're stuffing? 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:22.550
 We'll get another piece of cake and 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.500
 going back over and then jabotÃ¡ syrup 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.289

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.110
 done that the cake is ready to people 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.789

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.889
 if you can not resist because it's too 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.630
 hard you resist and there is no I 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.030

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.250
