to set up the tent and then there would

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.330

always be the struggle with the poles
and<00:01:06.700> getting<00:01:06.939> them<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.299> fit<00:01:07.900> through<00:01:08.080> the

seen<00:03:35.920> any<00:03:36.040> saplings<00:03:36.490> around<00:03:36.730> here<00:03:36.910> they<00:03:37.000> were

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
seen any saplings around here they were

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.490 
seen any saplings around here they were
flexible<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.690> bendable<00:03:37.930> enough<00:03:38.230> for<00:03:38.350> me<00:03:38.410> to

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
flexible and bendable enough for me to

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.350 
flexible and bendable enough for me to
do<00:03:38.590> this<00:03:38.740> and<00:03:38.920> if<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:39.730> look<00:03:39.880> up<00:03:40.060> underneath

do this and if you look up underneath

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.140 
do this and if you look up underneath
here<00:03:42.510> you'll<00:03:43.510> see<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:45.400> you<00:03:45.580> can<00:03:45.610> actually

pull tabs here and other points for
attachment<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:56.080> tech<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:56.770> technically<00:03:57.160> I've

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
attachment so tech so technically I've

seen what some people have done is they

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.310 
seen what some people have done is they
have<00:03:59.110> used<00:03:59.530> these<00:04:00.190> points<00:04:00.580> on<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.790> inside<00:04:01.320> to

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
have used these points on the inside to

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.490 
have used these points on the inside to
go<00:04:02.470> ahead<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:04.360> go<00:04:04.480> ahead<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.900> basically

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
go ahead and to go ahead and basically

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.620 
go ahead and to go ahead and basically
make<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:05.890> dome<00:04:06.190> with<00:04:06.490> this<00:04:06.790> putting<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
make a dome with this putting the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.110 
make a dome with this putting the
saplings<00:04:08.080> up<00:04:08.500> underneath<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.760> bendable

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
saplings up underneath and a bendable

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.120 
saplings up underneath and a bendable
kind<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.570> shape<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.080> it<00:04:11.620> works<00:04:11.800> out<00:04:11.980> really

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
kind of shape and it works out really

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.370 
kind of shape and it works out really
well<00:04:12.370> form<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.180> um<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:14.050> know<00:04:14.110> like<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.320> said

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
well form so um you know like I said

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.240 
well form so um you know like I said
there's<00:04:14.620> tons<00:04:14.800> of<00:04:14.860> different<00:04:15.130> configurations

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
there's tons of different configurations

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.849 
there's tons of different configurations
you<00:04:15.850> can<00:04:16.030> use<00:04:16.180> on<00:04:16.390> this<00:04:16.570> it's<00:04:17.410> very<00:04:17.470> flexible

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
you can use on this it's very flexible

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.250 
you can use on this it's very flexible
and<00:04:18.570> fairly<00:04:19.570> chief<00:04:19.750> of<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.930> price<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.230> think

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
and fairly chief of the price I think

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.310 
and fairly chief of the price I think
I've<00:04:20.470> maybe<00:04:20.590> paid<00:04:20.920> about<00:04:21.390> 6070<00:04:22.420> for<00:04:22.960> this<00:04:23.080> ship

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
I've maybe paid about 6070 for this ship

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.950 
I've maybe paid about 6070 for this ship
from<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.530> UK<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.630> it's<00:04:25.630> worked<00:04:25.840> out<00:04:25.900> great

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960

like building some big primitive shelter
go<00:04:47.440> with<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.620> quick<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:47.830> easy<00:04:47.980> setup<00:04:48.280> like<00:04:48.550> this

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
go with a quick and easy setup like this

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.120

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
probably going to pay off a lot better

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.710 
probably going to pay off a lot better
than<00:04:54.490> setting<00:04:54.820> up<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.940> primitive<00:04:55.270> shelter<00:04:55.570> so

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
than setting up the primitive shelter so
