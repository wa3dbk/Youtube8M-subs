nice<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.040> well<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.030> think<00:01:03.479> the<00:01:03.690> tournament

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
nice to see well I think the tournament

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.550 
nice to see well I think the tournament
generated<00:01:04.739> interests<00:01:05.190> in<00:01:05.570> with<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.960> staff<00:01:07.320> and

other<00:01:07.680> departments<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.399> it's<00:01:08.549> now<00:01:08.729> created<00:01:09.090> a

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
other departments and it's now created a

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.389 
other departments and it's now created a
context<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.780> learning<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.380> mathematics<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
context for learning in mathematics and

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.810 
context for learning in mathematics and
modern<00:01:11.640> languages<00:01:11.940> in<00:01:12.330> English<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.899> music<00:01:13.820> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
modern languages in English in music and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.190 
modern languages in English in music and
that's<00:01:15.149> what<00:01:15.360> we're<00:01:15.509> always<00:01:15.630> striving<00:01:15.899> for

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that's what we're always striving for

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.300 
that's what we're always striving for
here<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.440> would<00:01:16.530> Mill<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> lot<00:01:17.280> of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
here it would Mill that we have a lot of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.510 
here it would Mill that we have a lot of
cross<00:01:17.970> curricular<00:01:18.560> contact<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.770> course

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
cross curricular contact and course

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.950 
cross curricular contact and course
development<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.360> think<00:01:21.539> this<00:01:21.660> has<00:01:21.750> lent

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
development and I think this has lent

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.020 
development and I think this has lent
itself<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> very<00:01:22.619> well

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.370 

but<00:01:31.030> we<00:01:31.179> valve<00:01:31.390> schools<00:01:31.719> gonna<00:01:31.869> be<00:01:31.960> about<00:01:32.109> flat

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.350 
four people who never played where
school<00:02:18.890> teams<00:02:19.130> don't<00:02:19.430> necessarily<00:02:20.060> come<00:02:20.180> to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
school teams don't necessarily come to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.300 
school teams don't necessarily come to
practice<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:21.440> they<00:02:21.530> got<00:02:21.680> involved<00:02:21.830> in<00:02:22.160> this

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
practice but they got involved in this

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.080 
practice but they got involved in this
because<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:23.030> was<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.480> guess<00:02:24.400> less<00:02:25.400> competitive

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
because it was I guess less competitive

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.510 
because it was I guess less competitive
or<00:02:26.390> fiercely<00:02:26.930> competitive<00:02:27.260> atmosphere<00:02:27.890> and

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
or fiercely competitive atmosphere and

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.030 
or fiercely competitive atmosphere and
they<00:02:28.820> felt<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.390> could<00:02:29.420> come<00:02:29.720> along<00:02:30.040> it's

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
they felt that it could come along it's

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.340 
they felt that it could come along it's
good<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.400> see<00:02:31.550> boys<00:02:32.180> getting<00:02:32.480> along<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.990> not

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
good to see boys getting along and not

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.380 
good to see boys getting along and not
do<00:02:34.130> miss<00:02:34.280> Ophelia's<00:02:34.700> unless<00:02:34.940> they<00:02:35.090> are<00:02:35.210> just

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
do miss Ophelia's unless they are just

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.110 
do miss Ophelia's unless they are just
having<00:02:36.080> fun<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.650> think<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.430> most<00:02:37.580> satisfying

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
having fun I think the most satisfying

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.240 
having fun I think the most satisfying
aspect<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.780> has<00:02:39.350> been<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.650> amount<00:02:40.100> of

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
aspect of it has been the amount of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.130 
aspect of it has been the amount of
involvement<00:02:40.459> RSC<00:02:41.270> pupils<00:02:41.600> have<00:02:41.720> had<00:02:41.900> and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
involvement RSC pupils have had and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.900 
involvement RSC pupils have had and
running<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.010> they<00:02:43.190> really<00:02:43.580> rose<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
running it they really rose to the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.310 
running it they really rose to the
occasion<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.570> they've<00:02:44.870> taken<00:02:45.020> on<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
occasion and they've taken on the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.380 
occasion and they've taken on the
responsibility<00:02:45.410> with<00:02:46.190> ease<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.610> that's<00:02:47.240> been

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
responsibility with ease and that's been

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.020 
responsibility with ease and that's been
wonderful<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.870> see
