00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.020
 Hello dear friends today I 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.349
 I suggest to see what potential 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.559
 still hidden in the new French mx 30b 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.809
 so map swamp known to all 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.680
 throws us along with nines 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.820
 eights 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.710
 well, and 2 lt 7 level in each team 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.859
 what is important on such a map where constantly 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.900
 reigns reign of course this is light you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 can you tell me that in this fight no 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.579
 artillery and shine to anyone but i tell you 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.790
 I will say that literate highlighting the enemy 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.059
 positions on this map are decided by our 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.379
 French review 410 meters plus on the tank 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.989
 optics installed 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.000
 good dynamics and review allows 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.250
 lighten the enemy's travel well 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.350
 good vertical alignment gives 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.730
 opportunity to damage because of the mounds and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.879
 all kinds of crusts there 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.230
 well, the position on d5 square is excellent 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.809
 fits this tank 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.300
 the main thing not to fall for the light and you will 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.850
 happiness pay attention to the enemy 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.979
 passing vehicle poor t30 which is not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.200
 decided where to become and where to go 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.890
 dying first and not having time 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.369
 notions in general is finished with that 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.280
 further I see very near hiding 704 and 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.810
 Of course you need something to do with it thirst 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.210
 damage makes me hard 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.340
 lean out on this villain and glory 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.560
 god he didn't pay attention to me 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.020
 for his shot french cardboard 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.060
 I would not have survived at that moment . 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.400
 I understand that this position is no longer for me 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.810
 fits and something tells me that 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.610
 enemy square-4 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.340
 completely yearning for mine 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.320
 piercing projectile know this tank 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.049
 really imba but exclusively in 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.299
 straight arms not sure of yourself don't swing 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.560
 bring it differently for the team rather 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.409
 harm than good 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.979
 during the whole battle I try to work from 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.280
 inviza 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.619
 if in Russian, it means without light 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.290
 Well, if you really lit then we are looking for 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.520
 some mound and tank the tower but 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.430
 not worth a second 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.340
 we breed on a shot and here while kv-4 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.740
 distracted by eat 75 can be thrown off 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.110
 him a couple of shells average 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.069
 260 mm armor penetration 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.010
 does not always take this health 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.040
 to generally good help allies and 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.409
 KV-4 goes to the hangar in this battle 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.099
 certainly lucky not at all 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.530
 artillery 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.939
 that's why you can get behind the light and 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.030
 stay unpunished 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:30.639
 Well, I thought that disappeared from the light and 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.099
 decided to spice up vk 4502 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:36.099
 but he kindly told me what else 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.919
 sees me in general with the help of allies 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.780
 send in to to the hangar and now 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.560
 it becomes obvious that on this flank 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.379
 we are waiting 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.930
 I really don't know who I don't want to go there 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.269
 where are you waiting for a loaded weapon and I 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.989
 I make a decision to go to my beloved 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.239
 position is good that dynamics allows 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.760
 when you play on 30 b 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.310
 know you feel free you can 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.680
 in a short time to change the position and order 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.439
 most deliver many problems to the enemy 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.870
 team this tank is absolutely not tied 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.449
 to one direction you need to fight 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.030
 all directions immediately came in general 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:16.180
 I'm on my favorite mountain and see here 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.780
 all the same 704 only now I 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.569
 I am 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.090
 I shoot him from the rear and immediately 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.819
 roll up to not on getting from everyone 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.519
 parties and I don’t know why but he me 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.509
 ignores and then sin does not throw him 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:35.500
 one more time, well, he was cheered up on him 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:36.519
 help arrives su-122 54 and obviously something 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.889
 wants me 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.620
 Well, you know, I don’t care that he 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.470
 wants well let's get a little distracted and 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.419
 let's talk specifically about this tank think 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.439
 not everyone knows what exactly after the model 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:53.229
 mx 30 b was designed a mx 40 yes yes 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:56.139
 it is this slow tank you 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:58.989
 already long ago sold and forgot to 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.109
 devils in my opinion the main 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.569
 the advantages of 30 b are a great weapon and 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.879
 good maneuverability you say that 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.519
 him a good gun mask but i'm not 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:12.579
 I think this is a big plus it is like a drop 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.189
 armor on a piece of cardboard is definitely 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:18.009
 sometimes will help you but not often 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:20.829
 here is a relatively small size it 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:24.639
 ok well how small shine you 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.600
 will be but not as e50m oha is the turret 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.890
 commander 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.510
 no words dpm this tank is 2600 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.790
 not bad for example at object 140 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.220
 2900 but we review a little bit better and 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.930
 speed is higher 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.150
 equipment for 30 b worth putting such 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.200
 which will fit your game 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.090
 I put the rammer optics and 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.700
 ventilation if for example you do not need 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.000
 good visibility and you rely on light 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.370
 allies put everything on the instrument will 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.530
 jumping from a bush taste with one mound 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.500
 on the other being on middle and far 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.070
 distances while doing good damage 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.380
 but honestly, I can't play like that 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.220
 I prefer the near and middle 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.160
 distance 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.880
 but it's worth noting that on this tank in 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.090
 close combat 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.430
 getting involved alone is not worth the neighbor 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.130
 the battle is only relevant for us 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.350
 when allies are close behind 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.320
 which we can hide while not 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.180
 taking no damage but still want you 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.430
 advise to carry with them at least 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.340
 several cumulative in case 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.640
 when the opponent is too strong 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.250
 let's go back to our fight through 8:10 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.950
 my team loses i accept 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.000
 the decision to gently press the flank where 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.850
 fewer enemies 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.150
 I know that 34-ka which I already pretty 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.380
 patted hiding around here somewhere she for 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.870
 me for one shot 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.760
 it needs to be taken urgently trying 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.330
 keep the bushes to light it 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.330
 the first 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.350
 generally takin thirty four 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.350
 I hit the light and rolled back 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.080
 to me nothing flew Well 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.660
 the account was leveled and now I need to somehow 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.270
 gently get on the first line to 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.910
 highlight the yaga that stands near the base 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.479
 on the balcony and yet the tank is very nice 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.580
 with their minuses and with their pluses 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:26.830
 remember i said that one of the good things is 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.100
 review so here it is really big 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:33.340
 plus especially on such maps in the city 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.139
 it will not give you much but here you are 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.660
 can easily use this 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.039
 your plus especially if you will 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.570
 hide behind bushes 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.940
 sometimes even a firefly can 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.449
 earn money like i lit up 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.789
 witch that I did not even see it yes 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:51.160
 big and light it is not particularly difficult 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.949
 make up but still nice let's 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.410
 generalize the tank is very suitable 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:59.020
 to skillful players I recommend more 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.620
 you can’t say anything 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:06.220
 and by the way there is still such a plus unimportant but 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.349
 still tanchik now in hd and if u 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.840
 have a powerful computer 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:12.729
 Looks know in the process of creating 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.010
 video it turned out that unfortunately 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:17.919
 I won't be able to show you the results 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.320
 but if you take my word for it, then I 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:24.340
 I can say that in this fight was about 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:27.190
 nine thousand damage on this i finish 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:31.120
 and you must see how I will take 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:35.340
 yaga and somehow cope 54 thanks for 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.340
 view everyone good luck everyone bye 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.410
