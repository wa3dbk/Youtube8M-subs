it's<00:00:31.410> amazing<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:31.859> enables<00:00:32.219> us<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> work<00:00:32.489> is

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
it's amazing what enables us to work is

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.900 
it's amazing what enables us to work is
a<00:00:33.320> patent-pending<00:00:34.430> innovation<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.700> here

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
a patent-pending innovation we have here

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.000 
a patent-pending innovation we have here
called<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> drop<00:00:36.719> push<00:00:36.960> bolt<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.739> little

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
called the drop push bolt this little

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.819 
called the drop push bolt this little
trapdoor<00:00:38.250> allows<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:40.079> cartridge<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.739> be

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
trapdoor allows the cartridge to be

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
trapdoor allows the cartridge to be
scooped<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> our<00:00:41.520> magazine<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.300> fed

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
scooped out of the our magazine and fed

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.030 
scooped out of the our magazine and fed
on<00:00:42.570> up<00:00:42.690> into<00:00:42.899> battery<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:43.829> allows

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
on up into battery so that's what allows

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.950 
on up into battery so that's what allows
the<00:00:44.190> system<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.550> work<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.539> patented

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the system to work in this this patented

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.040 
the system to work in this this patented
system<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.370> Ruger<00:00:48.030> 204<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> varmint

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
system so this Ruger 204 in the varmint

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.799 
system so this Ruger 204 in the varmint
configuration<00:00:49.620> will<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.239> introduced

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
configuration will be out and introduced

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.569

a<00:01:29.130> 308<00:01:29.460> configuration<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> same<00:01:30.689> setup

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
a 308 configuration in the same setup

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.469 
a 308 configuration in the same setup
that's<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.920> too<00:01:32.040> cool<00:01:32.250> well<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> course<00:01:32.880> this

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
that's just too cool well of course this

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.719 
that's just too cool well of course this
is<00:01:33.540> great<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.290> shooting<00:01:34.500> off<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> bench<00:01:35.430> or

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
is great for shooting off a bench or

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.550
