hey<00:00:24.210> guys<00:00:26.060> before<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.270> give<00:00:27.539> up<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.759> what

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
hey guys before I give up on this what

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.380 
hey guys before I give up on this what
we'll<00:00:29.910> call<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.180> mark<00:00:30.419> one<00:00:30.689> ball<00:00:30.989> turner<00:00:32.390> this

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
we'll call the mark one ball turner this

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.329 
we'll call the mark one ball turner this
expansion<00:00:33.870> idea<00:00:34.379> was<00:00:34.559> partially<00:00:35.309> successful

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339 
expansion idea was partially successful

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.600 
expansion idea was partially successful
we're<00:00:36.210> not<00:00:36.329> good<00:00:36.540> enough<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.220> one<00:00:38.400> other

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
we're not good enough so is one other

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.799 
we're not good enough so is one other
thing<00:00:38.910> I'm<00:00:39.030> going<00:00:39.089> to<00:00:39.269> try<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.870> set<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
thing I'm going to try I just set up the

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.660 
thing I'm going to try I just set up the
t-nut<00:00:42.839> in<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.320> four<00:00:43.559> jaw<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.320> I've<00:00:47.100> got<00:00:47.400> when

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
t-nut in the four jaw and I've got when

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.299 
t-nut in the four jaw and I've got when
I<00:00:47.699> stopped<00:00:48.059> dropping<00:00:48.390> them<00:00:49.370> I've<00:00:50.370> got<00:00:50.760> some

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
I stopped dropping them I've got some

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:03.579 
I stopped dropping them I've got some
real<00:00:53.309> mini<00:00:53.640> bearings<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.690> that<00:01:00.140> they<00:01:01.140> are

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.510 

five<00:01:04.589> by<00:01:05.100> eleven<00:01:05.820> by<00:01:05.970> four<00:01:07.070> if<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.220> remember

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
five by eleven by four if I remember

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.740 
five by eleven by four if I remember
rightly<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.619> can<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.860> about<00:01:11.130> accommodate<00:01:11.789> two

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
rightly I can just about accommodate two

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.990 
rightly I can just about accommodate two
of<00:01:12.929> those<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:14.330> t-nut<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:17.250> size<00:01:17.550> here

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of those in the t-nut and this size here

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.660 
of those in the t-nut and this size here
is<00:01:18.179> at<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.780> moment<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.410> undersized<00:01:20.039> to<00:01:20.460> take

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
is at the moment just undersized to take

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.630 
is at the moment just undersized to take
a<00:01:20.700> bearing<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.509> I'm<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
a bearing so what I'm going to do is to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.649 
a bearing so what I'm going to do is to
put<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> boring<00:01:24.090> bar<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:26.659> increase

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
put a boring bar in there and increase

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.830 
put a boring bar in there and increase
the<00:01:27.900> diverter<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> take<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> bearing<00:01:29.720> flip<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the diverter to take a bearing flip it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.910 
the diverter to take a bearing flip it
round<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.500> do<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> other<00:01:31.979> side<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:33.680> then<00:01:34.680> on

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
round and do the other side and then on

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.870 
round and do the other side and then on
the<00:01:35.240> main<00:01:36.240> unit<00:01:38.119> substitute<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.360> pin<00:01:40.850> for<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the main unit substitute this pin for a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.580 
the main unit substitute this pin for a
smaller<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.450> which<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.840> course<00:01:42.869> may<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.290> too

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
smaller one which of course may be too

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.609 
smaller one which of course may be too
small<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.939> make<00:01:45.180> them<00:01:45.360> they've<00:01:45.509> flex<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.500> it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
small you make them they've flex in it

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440 
small you make them they've flex in it
but<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> don't<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.909> something<00:01:48.180> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
but I don't know it's just something to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.840 
but I don't know it's just something to
try<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.369> again<00:01:50.369> we'll<00:01:51.530> make<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.740> end<00:01:53.040> press

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
try and again we'll make this end press

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.020 
try and again we'll make this end press
fit<00:01:54.649> alright<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.250> we're<00:01:56.430> gonna<00:01:56.520> give<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
fit alright so we're gonna give that a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.120 
fit alright so we're gonna give that a
try<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.479> may<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.930> total<00:01:58.320> waste<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.680> time<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
try it may be a total waste of time and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.279 
try it may be a total waste of time and
then<00:01:59.280> I'll<00:01:59.430> probably<00:02:00.299> get<00:02:00.570> round<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> making

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
then I'll probably get round to making

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.749 
then I'll probably get round to making
you<00:02:01.350> some<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.619> your<00:02:01.710> tooling<00:02:02.039> for<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> mark<00:02:02.520> 2

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you some do your tooling for the mark 2

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.359 
you some do your tooling for the mark 2
version

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.970 

I<00:02:08.259> didn't<00:02:09.259> under<00:02:09.440> bar<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.800> your<00:02:09.950> body<00:02:10.129> with<00:02:10.399> the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
I didn't under bar of your body with the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.530 
I didn't under bar of your body with the
boring<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.250> out<00:02:13.489> as<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.819> think<00:02:13.879> I<00:02:14.090> said<00:02:14.360> it's

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
boring this out as I think I said it's

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.900 
boring this out as I think I said it's
any<00:02:14.750> needed<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.769> small<00:02:16.010> enlargement<00:02:16.670> about

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
any needed a small enlargement about

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.140 
any needed a small enlargement about
twenty<00:02:17.330> five<00:02:17.510> thirty<00:02:17.840> thousand<00:02:18.879> so<00:02:19.879> I<00:02:19.910> got

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
twenty five thirty thousand so I got

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.400 
twenty five thirty thousand so I got
these<00:02:20.269> two<00:02:20.569> small<00:02:20.900> bearings<00:02:21.319> in<00:02:23.260> which<00:02:24.260> you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
these two small bearings in which you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.339 
these two small bearings in which you
can<00:02:24.590> probably<00:02:24.769> see<00:02:25.069> fairly<00:02:25.489> clearly<00:02:26.349> they're

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
can probably see fairly clearly they're

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.770 
can probably see fairly clearly they're
both<00:02:27.530> inset<00:02:28.040> by<00:02:28.340> four<00:02:28.879> or<00:02:28.970> five<00:02:29.180> thousand<00:02:29.629> four

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
both inset by four or five thousand four

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.270 
both inset by four or five thousand four
good<00:02:29.930> clearance<00:02:30.730> now<00:02:31.730> I've<00:02:31.879> got<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.150> make<00:02:32.269> a

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
good clearance now I've got to make a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.160 
good clearance now I've got to make a
spindle<00:02:34.280> or<00:02:34.879> shaft<00:02:35.390> whatever<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:35.959> want<00:02:36.080> to

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
spindle or shaft whatever you want to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.400 
spindle or shaft whatever you want to
call<00:02:36.349> it<00:02:36.790> which<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.819> five<00:02:38.480> millimeter<00:02:39.080> for

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
call it which is five millimeter for

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.059 
call it which is five millimeter for
that<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.940> then<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:44.440> for<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.530> top<00:02:45.769> of<00:02:45.920> this

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
that and then the for the top of this

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.979 
that and then the for the top of this
got<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.459> make<00:02:46.700> something<00:02:47.030> that's<00:02:47.540> going<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.870> be

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
got to make something that's going to be

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.130 
got to make something that's going to be
a<00:02:48.340> press<00:02:49.340> fit<00:02:49.579> in<00:02:49.790> there<00:02:50.170> whether<00:02:51.170> five<00:02:51.620> mill

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
a press fit in there whether five mill

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.220 
a press fit in there whether five mill
will<00:02:54.140> be<00:02:55.000> stiff<00:02:56.000> enough<00:02:56.120> shall<00:02:56.750> we<00:02:56.840> say<00:02:57.019> I'm

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
will be stiff enough shall we say I'm

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.770 
will be stiff enough shall we say I'm
not<00:02:57.410> sure<00:02:57.879> but<00:02:58.879> I'm<00:02:59.060> hoping<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.480> a<00:03:01.480> good<00:03:02.480> fit

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
not sure but I'm hoping that a good fit

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.759 
not sure but I'm hoping that a good fit
in<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.379> bearings<00:03:04.840> should<00:03:05.840> avoid<00:03:06.140> much<00:03:06.500> in<00:03:06.680> the

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
in the bearings should avoid much in the

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.339 
in the bearings should avoid much in the
way<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:06.920> slop<00:03:07.370> these<00:03:07.640> are<00:03:07.790> new<00:03:07.910> bearings<00:03:08.360> so

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
way of slop these are new bearings so

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.759 
way of slop these are new bearings so
there's<00:03:09.530> no<00:03:09.819> particular<00:03:10.819> free<00:03:11.030> play<00:03:11.269> in<00:03:11.450> them

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
there's no particular free play in them

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.629 
there's no particular free play in them
so<00:03:12.769> we'll<00:03:13.040> see<00:03:13.220> where<00:03:13.370> we<00:03:13.459> go<00:03:13.639> with<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.940> just

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
so we'll see where we go with that just

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.930 
so we'll see where we go with that just
made<00:03:16.639> up<00:03:16.819> this<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:19.340> little<00:03:19.730> piece<00:03:19.910> here

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
made up this this little piece here

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.180 
made up this this little piece here
which<00:03:22.510> that's<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.840> run<00:03:24.049> inside<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.739> bearings

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
which that's to run inside the bearings

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.520 
which that's to run inside the bearings
and<00:03:25.459> I'm<00:03:26.299> just<00:03:26.480> going<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.630> see<00:03:26.900> if<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.139> can<00:03:27.290> press

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
and I'm just going to see if I can press

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:39.900 
and I'm just going to see if I can press
this<00:03:27.799> onto<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:30.130> top<00:03:31.130> section<00:03:36.040> right<00:03:37.040> we've

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.970 

pressed<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.150> in<00:03:44.169> it<00:03:45.169> feels<00:03:45.440> pretty<00:03:45.709> good

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
pressed that in it feels pretty good

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.440 
pressed that in it feels pretty good
that<00:03:47.079> was<00:03:48.079> about<00:03:48.319> a<00:03:48.380> thong<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:48.739> wonder<00:03:49.579> it<00:03:49.730> over

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
that was about a thong I wonder it over

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.940 
that was about a thong I wonder it over
to<00:03:50.660> throw<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.260> size<00:03:51.500> pretty<00:03:52.099> tight<00:03:52.400> fit<00:03:52.730> so

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
to throw the size pretty tight fit so

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:04.059 
to throw the size pretty tight fit so
now<00:03:55.239> with<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:59.380> t-nut<00:04:02.739> it<00:04:03.739> remains

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
now with that and the t-nut it remains

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.800 
now with that and the t-nut it remains
to<00:04:04.220> be<00:04:04.280> seen<00:04:04.370> when<00:04:04.849> it's<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.299> tool<00:04:05.569> post

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
to be seen when it's on the tool post

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.569 
to be seen when it's on the tool post
how<00:04:06.109> much<00:04:06.260> slack<00:04:06.620> there<00:04:06.859> is<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.010> doubt<00:04:07.280> if<00:04:07.459> it'll

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
how much slack there is I doubt if it'll

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.629 
how much slack there is I doubt if it'll
be<00:04:07.760> 100%<00:04:08.120> tight<00:04:08.690> but<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.019> may<00:04:09.109> be<00:04:09.139> better

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
be 100% tight but it may be better

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:17.129 
be 100% tight but it may be better
so<00:04:10.639> we'll<00:04:10.819> try<00:04:10.970> it

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.670 

well<00:04:18.139> there's<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.380> bit<00:04:18.530> more<00:04:18.560> improvement<00:04:20.680> not

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
well there's a bit more improvement not

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.330 
well there's a bit more improvement not
perfect<00:04:23.169> just<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.290> little<00:04:24.560> bit<00:04:24.680> of<00:04:27.340> spinning

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
perfect just a little bit of spinning

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.110 
perfect just a little bit of spinning
freely<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.820> course<00:04:29.060> for<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.389> bearings<00:04:29.979> and

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
freely of course for the bearings and

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.340 
freely of course for the bearings and
that<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.389> can<00:04:32.600> detect<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:34.300> very<00:04:35.300> small<00:04:35.870> amount<00:04:36.050> of

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
that I can detect a very small amount of

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.760 
that I can detect a very small amount of
rocking<00:04:40.509> it's<00:04:41.509> a<00:04:41.840> lot<00:04:42.080> better<00:04:42.229> than<00:04:42.410> it<00:04:42.560> was

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
rocking it's a lot better than it was

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.890 
rocking it's a lot better than it was
the<00:04:43.130> any<00:04:43.280> other<00:04:43.520> third<00:04:43.910> option<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.419> might<00:04:44.690> be

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
the any other third option that might be

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:53.650 
the any other third option that might be
tried<00:04:46.419> is<00:04:47.419> to<00:04:50.530> possibly<00:04:52.240> take<00:04:53.240> out<00:04:53.449> the

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
tried is to possibly take out the

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.080 
tried is to possibly take out the
bearing<00:04:54.050> at<00:04:54.199> the<00:04:54.350> bottom<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:55.539> then<00:04:58.090> shorten

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
bearing at the bottom and then shorten

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.860 
bearing at the bottom and then shorten
this<00:04:59.240> down<00:04:59.680> and<00:05:00.820> drill<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.000> tap<00:05:02.030> for<00:05:02.539> a<00:05:02.600> small

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
this down and drill and tap for a small

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.140 
this down and drill and tap for a small
bulk<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:04.479> have<00:05:05.479> a<00:05:05.510> washer<00:05:05.990> in<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:07.150> pocket

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
bulk and have a washer in the pocket

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.290 
bulk and have a washer in the pocket
that<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.479> bearing<00:05:08.840> was<00:05:09.020> in<00:05:09.229> and<00:05:10.180> tighten<00:05:11.180> that

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
that the bearing was in and tighten that

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.770 
that the bearing was in and tighten that
down<00:05:11.360> so<00:05:11.960> that<00:05:12.139> it's<00:05:12.820> really<00:05:13.820> tight<00:05:14.270> against

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
down so that it's really tight against

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.839 
down so that it's really tight against
the<00:05:14.900> t-nut<00:05:17.590> so<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.620> may<00:05:18.889> try<00:05:19.130> that<00:05:19.370> and<00:05:19.639> of

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
the t-nut so I may try that and of

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.320 
the t-nut so I may try that and of
course<00:05:20.030> I've<00:05:20.210> got<00:05:20.240> a<00:05:21.820> got<00:05:22.820> to<00:05:22.970> do<00:05:23.150> some

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
course I've got a got to do some

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.260 
course I've got a got to do some
something<00:05:26.330> else<00:05:26.630> for<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.960> tooling<00:05:27.349> on<00:05:27.500> here

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
something else for the tooling on here

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.420 
something else for the tooling on here
which<00:05:29.270> might<00:05:29.539> be<00:05:29.690> some<00:05:29.930> HSS<00:05:30.590> but<00:05:31.099> I've<00:05:31.250> also

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
which might be some HSS but I've also

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.370 
which might be some HSS but I've also
got<00:05:31.760> to<00:05:31.880> do<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.210> tooling<00:05:32.599> for<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.900> mark<00:05:33.110> to

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
got to do the tooling for the mark to

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.899 
got to do the tooling for the mark to
the<00:05:34.780> boring<00:05:35.780> head<00:05:35.930> version<00:05:36.470> anyway<00:05:37.430> just<00:05:37.760> to

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
the boring head version anyway just to

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.159 
the boring head version anyway just to
show<00:05:38.090> you<00:05:38.150> I<00:05:38.300> didn't<00:05:38.570> bother<00:05:38.659> with<00:05:38.840> all<00:05:39.020> the

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
show you I didn't bother with all the

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.779 
show you I didn't bother with all the
machining<00:05:41.260> basically<00:05:42.260> just<00:05:42.440> showing<00:05:42.789> what

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
machining basically just showing what

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.460 
machining basically just showing what
might<00:05:44.500> improve<00:05:45.500> this<00:05:45.830> one<00:05:46.900> I'm<00:05:47.900> gonna<00:05:47.990> see<00:05:48.289> how

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
might improve this one I'm gonna see how

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.879 
might improve this one I'm gonna see how
it<00:05:48.500> goes<00:05:48.800> when<00:05:49.010> I<00:05:49.070> get<00:05:49.370> to<00:05:49.550> testing<00:05:49.970> it

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
it goes when I get to testing it

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.529 
it goes when I get to testing it
probably<00:05:51.889> when<00:05:52.039> I've<00:05:52.190> got<00:05:52.400> some<00:05:52.729> better

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
probably when I've got some better

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.580 
probably when I've got some better
tooling<00:05:54.430> all<00:05:55.430> right<00:05:55.639> that's<00:05:55.880> it<00:05:56.060> for<00:05:56.120> that<00:05:56.389> one

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
tooling all right that's it for that one

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.570 
tooling all right that's it for that one
I'll<00:05:57.590> try<00:05:57.860> and<00:05:57.979> do<00:05:58.099> some<00:06:00.099> tuning<00:06:01.099> improvement

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
I'll try and do some tuning improvement

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.080 
I'll try and do some tuning improvement
on<00:06:01.669> the<00:06:01.789> mark<00:06:01.970> -<00:06:02.860> boring<00:06:03.860> head<00:06:04.010> version<00:06:04.460> as

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
on the mark - boring head version as

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.770 
on the mark - boring head version as
soon<00:06:05.270> as<00:06:05.389> I<00:06:05.510> can

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
soon as I can

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:17.270 
soon as I can
