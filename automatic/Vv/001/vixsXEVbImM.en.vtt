00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
back to store mode and then once you're

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.109 
back to store mode and then once you're
in<00:00:28.619> story<00:00:28.830> mode<00:00:28.890> start<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.609> new<00:00:29.640> game

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
but it just obviously is a lot easier

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.670 
but it just obviously is a lot easier
because<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.050> don't<00:00:34.290> worry<00:00:34.380> about<00:00:34.469> people

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680

to say loading and never said loading

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.930 
to say loading and never said loading
for<00:02:07.200> me<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.469> that's<00:02:07.530> why<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.789> kept

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
for me so that's why I just kept

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.520 
for me so that's why I just kept
pressing<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.750> mean

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
pressing a so I mean

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.050
