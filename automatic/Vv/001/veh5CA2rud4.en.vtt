00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 the fashion is of the cars that seem off road 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.340
 but they are not and who did not want to stay 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.630
 out was the renan who launched the sandero 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.790
 stepway 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.160
 of breakage beyond adventurous clothing 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.500
 took the opportunity to upgrade the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.500
 interior and looks have pleased 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.940
 the revenue was not different from other 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.450
 factories incorporated into the 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:34.090
 bumper exclusive grill wheels in 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.270
 light league give the biggest suspects 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.530
 are five centimeters higher skirts 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.140
 sides 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.600
 here on the roof with an aerofoil and up 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.780
 tattoo stickers applied on the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.360
 concessionaire 5 but changes in the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.700
 Inside they took that feeling 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.600
 missing something that the normal sander 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.790
 at 40 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.790
 also call attention looks only 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.989
 this was achieved with appliques 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.630
 material imitating aluminum in the console 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.170
 central panel doors and vents 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.790
 and new spelling in the instrument cluster 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.250
 and it can still increase with 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.369
 options such as steering wheel 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.869
 leather seats internal space is the same 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.140
 to the common sandero 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.050
 five adults fit very well only 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.600
 that safety is still poor 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.330
 who are going in the middle do not have 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.330
 head and neither three point belt 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.990
 step engine uses the 1.6 16-valve engine that has 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.630
 107 horses with gasoline and 112 with 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.700
 called alcohol reflects the exchange rate of five 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.830
 marches is equal to that of sandero 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.570
 but as the wheels and tires are bigger and 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.180
 no changes were made to the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.789
 all gear ratios 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.580
 they were long the car ended up getting 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.530
 less pleasant to drive to boot 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.649
 you need to accelerate more than normal 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.929
 for the engine to die and also got 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.990
 slow in acceleration and resumption of 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.990
 velocity 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.950
 furthermore, we need to reduce 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.560
 times to keep the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.200
 traffic , fuel consumption has 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.930
 being harmed is not bad but the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.930
 average of 6.2 kilometers per liter of 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.209
 alcohol and 8.7 kilometers per liter of 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.770
 gasoline on our test track 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.770
 could be better 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.540
 besides causing some noise 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.310
 the highest suspension and the 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.190
 new tires and influenced the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.260
 more negatively 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.780
 tires transmit more 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.300
 ease the imperfections of the soil 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.920
 this combined with higher ride height that 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.680
 causes oscillations of the 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.080
 body straight to discomfort in 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.050
 attention is needed because the 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.230
 excessive body inclination 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.230
 undermines the stability 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.280
 despite the greater sophistication of this 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.709
 version some bad details persist 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.390
 such as the controls on the panel 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.800
 behind the benches 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.830
 the mirrors button 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.160
 external under the brake lever 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.620
 hand and the steppe on the outside for whoever 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.349
 like this type of car or want 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.060
 facing the daily off-road of holes and 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.260
 spines of our streets with more 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.510
 tranquility 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.269
 or even face a 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.160
 earth from time to time sandero stepway 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.560
 it's another option 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.989
 in addition, unless the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.130
 competitors and has the advantage of greater 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.850
 internal space 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.850
 to the next 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.250
 for emilio the good points are the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.310
 space and visibility is the 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.709
 the steering 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.709
 speed and safety 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.569
 sandero stepway 1.6 cost from 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.030
 44 thousand reais 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.880
 with all the options like the third 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.070
 arrives at 52 thousand four hundred and eighty
