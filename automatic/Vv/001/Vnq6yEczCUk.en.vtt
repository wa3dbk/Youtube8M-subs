00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.150
 at the school of no one never liked 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.309
 Cool funny only if you look over it 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.360
 but it always made fun of that 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.130
 best grades 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.070
 even if this one does not like at all 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.039
 One of the cx-5's looks is a real one 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.410
 Since then, the Japanese suv on the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.590
 market is convinced in all subjects 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.119
 the cx-5 by the time maz the best 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.150
 Horse in stall the best selling model 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.769
 with us big growth rate also in the big one 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.289
 he has completed the car picture 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.420
 convinced with a 1 - no reason 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.250
 rest says mazda has the cx-5 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.340
 revised if we convince now 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.410
 So let's see if that works too 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.809
 an annoying nerd mentality itself 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.550
 a 1 - is not enough about the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.140
 own performance will be nagging and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.300
 then in any case even more anxious 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 be so that once was perfectly clean 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.800
 but that's why nerds are always 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.710
 the best at mazda shows that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.989
 clearly in numbers by as much as 17 5 percent 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.510
 the japanese could sell their heels 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.850
 Increase cx-5 with us last year 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.189
 ambitious and in love with detail was the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.030
 around three years old cx-5 for the notes 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.250
 fight processed from the outside inconspicuous 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.020
 Weissmann nerds are usually inconspicuous 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.670
 The grill was at the current 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.290
 brand face adapted and features 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.479
 now also across the transversely 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.130
 Strive front and rear lights are 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.770
 now in full led 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.840
 inside, the newly designed cockpit falls into place 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.880
 eye the center console is complete 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.250
 revised and where you used to be 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.750
 brake handle found one finds now one 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.700
 electronic parking brake 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.680
 the entire interior is again 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.600
 significantly higher quality than before and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.670
 convinced with great materials and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.560
 good excuse to go in 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.380
 School grades to stay very good 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.630
 Processing a 1 in the clean 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.610
 tidy fittings feels a 7 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.009
 inch big display with touch function 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.140
 the mzg connect system works 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.630
 network and complement with smartphones 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.860
 social media entertainment or navi 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.990
 everything is thought 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.240
 completely new he is 25 liters petrol 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.130
 comes from the skyactiv program is yes 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.420
 a mazda specialty the gasoline 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.739
 work with particularly high density 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.930
 yes, he has 13 to one know the engine 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.239
 we already get out of the mazda6 now 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.430
 also the sve nerd four-cylinder 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.200
 the big petrol engine always comes in 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.810
 combination with all-wheel and automatic 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.709
 makes 192 ps and has a maximum 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.230
 torque of 256 newton meters eight 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.090
 in seconds, the cx 500 needs topspeed 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.230
 are 194 at a consumption of 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.330
 7.2 liters of gasoline are listed 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.890
 fine engine quiet and supple 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.410
 had balancing shaft running very quietly 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.000
 There is always together with the automatic 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.830
 sechgang also the newest 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.920
 In-house development switches very gently 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.350
 Overall, a round thing goes well with 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.360
 harmonic tuning 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.920
 the driving experience in the new cx-5 is great 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.810
 This is not least due to the good 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.090
 sit the enough stop and comfort 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.560
 also offer the slouch on the last 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.370
 bank is not lacking in wine or 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.890
 head freedom 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.310
 do you work out the order from the cx-5 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.850
 transporter 1620 liters of maximum storage space 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.590
 Normally it is 503 for those 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.900
 who want it a bit sportier 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.180
 there are the 2 5 liter petrol engine now 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.370
 on a driving mode switch on sport 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.769
 lets the cx 5 1 tick crispier 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.290
 Drive gearbox gas line everything reacts 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.690
 spontaneous but since when actually heard 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.400
 nerd and sport together like this 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.220
 we asked ourselves that too 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.049
 and find that the great 22 liters 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.630
 diesel with the high running culture and the 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.340
 see fuller torque to 8 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.400
 also the buyers so 60 percent 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.239
 opt for the detonator 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.590
 the costs in the base 26 1290 euro 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.170
 the entry into the gasoline is with 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.170
 24,100 90 one more tick cheaper 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.150
 it's not all that much to see 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.430
 what mazda did is good for her 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.590
 The CX-5 was already one before 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.870
 sympathy carrier and it actually still 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.790
 got better in detail great 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.680
 refinished handsome and 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.190
 interesting technology with the facelift 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.570
 the Dauerstreit 65 is better again 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.880
 can other manufacturers that a 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.370
 or other abgucken will work 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.570
 certainly not because as everyone knows 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.570
 let write off nerd media
