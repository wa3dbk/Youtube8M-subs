00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.950
I've spent

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.120
half of my life in the makeup chair. To be able to put all that knowledge now

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.900
into my own makeup kits with Smashbox is a dream come true.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.499
I consider myself style chameleon.

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.560
I like changing up my look based on where I am in the world.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.589
Well, I'm excited to play today because we're going to be doing three different looks.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.439
So, New York, L.A. and London - those are  three very, very, very

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.640
different makeup looks, you know. The L.A. look

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.930
I mean it's soft, gorgeous, beachy, effortless. It's very reflective of

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.020
the lifestyle, exactly. So, what I do

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.500
I pull the eye a little like that. To just kind of make it stiff, so you have a really taut surface.Yes.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.300
Flick! Oh my goodness!

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.610
That is such a great trick! So it's all about having confidence in

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.780
yourself and just flick! I love that! I'm going to call that the Nicky flick.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.570
It just glides right on.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.400
Oh, you're a pro. You're going to have my job in a minute.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.799
Now that's the Smashbox Pure Pigment Photo Angle Gel Liner, and it stays in place.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.450
That's so awesome, and look how that brown really brings out

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.000
the color of your eye.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.929
Part of the L.A. look is a little bit of shadow on the lids, and I'm using the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.000
Screenshot Photo Op eye shadow trio that you picked out.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.450
So, I'm going to take the middle shade and just kind of work that on the outer corner.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.049
And this shade has a gorgeous golden glow.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.150
A little shadow, especially for this look,

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.880
where its kind of soft, a little smoky, is nice.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.030
And this is such an effortless

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.060
and natural look. Of course, no makeup look is ever complete without two cots of my favorite

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.369
Full Exposure mascara.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.250
So, I'm going to use our L.A. Lights. I love these!

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.729
I just love anything that can do two different things, and it's a lip and a cheek.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.060
And it's just like, this kind of like

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.800
flush of color, not overly blush, and I love blush.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.360
That's what it looks like, Flush. Put some color on your lips. I definitely don't look

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.300
like I got my makeup done, which I like. Right. In L.A., you don't want to look

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.500
done, like you got your makeup done. Right. I think you look fantastic. Let's go get Davis.
