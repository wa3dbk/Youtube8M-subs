alright this is a really really fast tip

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.150 
alright this is a really really fast tip
on<00:00:02.820> adding<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.780> project<00:00:04.200> box<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.650> your<00:00:04.770> gimbal

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
on adding a project box to your gimbal

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.369 
on adding a project box to your gimbal
I'm<00:00:06.000> doing<00:00:06.509> that<00:00:06.629> right<00:00:06.690> now<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.230> thought

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
I'm doing that right now so I thought

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.200 
I'm doing that right now so I thought
I'd<00:00:07.529> just<00:00:07.649> document<00:00:08.490> that<00:00:08.610> process<00:00:09.000> for<00:00:09.150> you

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
I'd just document that process for you

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.990 
I'd just document that process for you
guys<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> project<00:00:10.710> box<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.280> had

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
guys this is a project box that I had

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.470 
guys this is a project box that I had
and<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.450> kind<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.349> cut<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.620> up<00:00:14.240> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.330> what

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
and I kind of cut it up this is what

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.550 
and I kind of cut it up this is what
i'll<00:00:15.570> be<00:00:15.660> using<00:00:15.839> you'll<00:00:16.080> see<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> end

i'll be using you'll see what the end

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.529 
i'll be using you'll see what the end
result<00:00:16.859> looks<00:00:16.949> like<00:00:17.279> anyways<00:00:18.090> what<00:00:18.300> i<00:00:18.330> need<00:00:18.510> to

result looks like anyways what i need to
do<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.840> add<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.230> project<00:00:19.619> box<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.340> now

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
do is add this project box here now

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.609 
do is add this project box here now
whether<00:00:21.060> i<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.510> with<00:00:21.779> or<00:00:22.050> without<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
whether i do it with or without the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.410 
whether i do it with or without the
offsets<00:00:23.220> i<00:00:23.430> could<00:00:23.640> put<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> offsets<00:00:24.240> on<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
offsets i could put the offsets on the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.300 
offsets i could put the offsets on the
inside<00:00:24.750> or<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.439> put<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.920> outside

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
inside or I can put this on the outside

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.609 
inside or I can put this on the outside
regardless<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.449> need<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.080> drill<00:00:28.380> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
regardless what I need to do is drill a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.320 
regardless what I need to do is drill a
bunch<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.980> holes<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.640> get<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.090> lined

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
bunch of holes here and get that lined

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.389 
bunch of holes here and get that lined
up<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.529> people<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.830> been<00:00:31.949> asking<00:00:32.070> how

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
up so some people have been asking how

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.979 
up so some people have been asking how
do<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.270> holes<00:00:33.480> are<00:00:33.630> offset

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
do you do that if your holes are offset

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840 
do you do that if your holes are offset
what<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.430> clear<00:00:35.670> piece

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
figure out where my holes are I don't

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.900 
figure out where my holes are I don't
need<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.450> be<00:00:42.770> perfectly<00:00:43.770> straight<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.760> this

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.029 
drill my holes on this template that's
going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.350> me<00:00:57.109> pretty<00:00:58.109> close<00:00:58.320> next<00:00:58.710> what

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
going to get me pretty close next what

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.790 
going to get me pretty close next what
I'm<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.480> side<00:01:00.690> that

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
I'm going to do is this is the side that

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
I'm going to do is this is the side that
that<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.090> side<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that is going to be on this side of the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.450 
that is going to be on this side of the
box<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.140> i<00:01:04.170> need<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.439> put<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.250> side

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
box so i need to put this on this side

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.050 
box so i need to put this on this side
of<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> box<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:07.310> it's<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> end<00:01:08.820> up

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
of the box so it's going to end up

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.600 
of the box so it's going to end up
looking<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.310> where<00:01:11.580> i

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
looking like this and that's where i

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
looking like this and that's where i
would<00:01:11.729> line<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.090> my<00:01:12.330> holes<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:13.560> i<00:01:13.680> would

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
would line up my holes and then i would

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.609 
would line up my holes and then i would
then<00:01:14.610> punch<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:16.409> punch

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
then punch it with this a little punch

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.070 
then punch it with this a little punch
tool<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.070> before<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
tool so before I do that I'm going to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.760 
tool so before I do that I'm going to
add<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> bit<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> blue<00:01:20.130> tape<00:01:20.400> here<00:01:21.560> just<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
add a bit of blue tape here just to the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.280 
add a bit of blue tape here just to the
box<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.030> my<00:01:24.299> template<00:01:24.720> doesn't<00:01:25.020> shift<00:01:25.170> around

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
box so my template doesn't shift around

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.410 
box so my template doesn't shift around
I'm<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> figure<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.670> where<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> nice

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
I'm going to figure out where is a nice

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.710 
I'm going to figure out where is a nice
place<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> add<00:01:28.320> all<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.210> holes<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.450> looks

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
place to add all the holes so it looks

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.030 
place to add all the holes so it looks
pretty<00:01:30.930> square<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.740> centered<00:01:33.860> get<00:01:34.860> enough

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
pretty square and centered get enough

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.580 
pretty square and centered get enough
for<00:01:35.220> me<00:01:35.340> ok<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.689> punch<00:01:36.990> tool<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.470> is

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
for me ok so this punch tool here is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:52.100 
for me ok so this punch tool here is
going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.920> leave<00:01:38.280> some<00:01:38.460> marks<00:01:41.030> in<00:01:42.030> our<00:01:42.600> box<00:01:51.110> so

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
going to leave some marks in our box so

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.450 
going to leave some marks in our box so
once<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.320> take<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:53.130> should<00:01:53.310> have

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
once we take that out we should have

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.780 
once we take that out we should have
some<00:01:53.780> definitive<00:01:54.780> marks<00:01:55.369> where<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.520> need<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
some definitive marks where we need to
