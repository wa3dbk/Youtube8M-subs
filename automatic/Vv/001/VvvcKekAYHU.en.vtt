00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
straight into the side this is a pretty

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.599 
straight into the side this is a pretty
tight<00:02:23.840> turnaround<00:02:24.840> circle<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.859> he's<00:02:26.430> going

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
tight turnaround circle that he's going

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.309 
tight turnaround circle that he's going
to<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.939> here<00:02:27.420> where<00:02:27.599> when<00:02:27.959> he's<00:02:28.079> in<00:02:28.200> that

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
to do here where when he's in that

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.319 
to do here where when he's in that
position<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.920> step<00:02:29.219> almost<00:02:29.579> right<00:02:29.790> behind<00:02:30.120> him

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
position I step almost right behind him

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.449 
position I step almost right behind him
he's<00:02:30.540> got<00:02:30.689> to<00:02:30.719> cut<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:31.139> pretty<00:02:31.739> tight<00:02:32.129> but

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
he's got to cut it pretty tight but

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.420 
he's got to cut it pretty tight but
still<00:02:33.030> stayed<00:02:33.389> to<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.689> front<00:02:34.019> just<00:02:34.950> gives

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
still stayed to the front just gives

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.539 
still stayed to the front just gives
them<00:02:35.549> another<00:02:35.730> angle<00:02:36.150> another<00:02:36.389> view<00:02:36.750> of

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
them another angle another view of
