00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.259
 prepare the ice cream of burnt milk and 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.559
 I want to send a greeting to jessica sarahÃ­ 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.300
 silva the friend and follower of facebook 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.049
 that is always very aware of my 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.049
 publications 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.820
 a can of evaporated milk a cup of 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.770
 sugar 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.430
 vanilla we will occupy approximately 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.350
 one tablespoon 1 liter of water and the 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.210
 plastic bags these are always 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.610
 we use are these 8 x 26 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.399
 in a container I'm going to put the sugar 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.579
 I'm going to light the fire and I'm going to stir 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.600
 until the sugar dissolves and it 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.390
 make a candy 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.059
 I'm going to put medium fire and I'll be 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.079
 stirring until you get sugar 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.079
 it becomes liquid 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.969
 we already see that the sugar got coffee 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.729
 and it started to melt we're not going to let 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.159
 to move we will keep moving until 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.350
 that the sugar melts completely 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.090
 liquid hiding all the sugar in 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.789
 how much we see that sugar no longer has 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.130
 no little ball, let's put the milk 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.200
 here I'm going to lower the fire a little 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.479
 is already completely liquid from the 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.240
 sugar I'm going to put the milk 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.400
 here the sugar without ventures is not 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.930
 worry this was putting hard 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.180
 and here is the stirring here 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.980
 stir it up let's lower the fire to 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.850
 that we are not going to get up much 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:57.080
 milk and this was made the sugar was put 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.630
 everything and see how this was like this 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.640
 We'll have to stir until 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.140
 until it is completely dissolved 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.140
 this is going to dissolve in the milk 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.989
 we are going to be stirring and stirring 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.629
 this tells me that I have everything in the 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.550
 beater but it does not matter this one is going to 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.550
 dissolve and it's going to take off all 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.080
 you have to be very careful when 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.200
 let's do this because if it's a little bit 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.110
 dangerous if we do not go down well the fire will 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.180
 can spill us and this when we are 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.460
 doing this let's try not to be 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.550
 children close to me I do not like to do 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.400
 much these ice creams because apart from that 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.710
 it is very hot 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.530
 to be here we have to be stirring 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.420
 and stirring and then there is the heat of the 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.370
 stove yes the truth that we are given 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.590
 Much hot 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.799
 but as several subscribers were already 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.440
 asking for these recipes later I had to 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:04.129
 do these entities that I am 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.900
 doing is for five or six ice creams if 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.940
 you have to do more then you are going to 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.069
 put double the ingredient I did 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.709
 little bit because the truth that they have 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.140
 a lot of time to be doing more 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.010
 amount if I do with milk treats you 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.140
 I put 2 2 cups of sugar and this and 100 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.970
 more amounts more time to be 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.260
 here stirring stirring in front of the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.390
 stove 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.390
 to put a little more fire 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.950
 and now I do not run the risk of it 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.620
 spill the foam and this time continue 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.510
 I will continue stirring here until 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.599
 get it to dissolve completely 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.670
 all the candy practically already 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.489
 melted all the candy that is very 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.150
 we're going to wait for it to melt 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.150
 all good 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.540
 this is going to be approximately between 3 and 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.939
 5 minutes in what is going to melt 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.890
 completely the candy I will be 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.840
 stirring and stirring so that the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.450
 milk do not get up and I'm going to 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.760
 spill this I will lower the fire 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.190
 because I see that he is getting up 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.079
 there is very little of the candy already 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.909
 I'm making it melt all the 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.909
 candy as you can see I have very little 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.850
 I already have about 3 minutes 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.130
 stirring 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.890
 cut that is finished dissolving everything 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.380
 that I do not have any bits left this 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.870
 of hard candy I'm going to put the liter of 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.900
 water as we already see that practically already 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.730
 it is already melted everything can be a 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.360
 little ball but that does not matter now I'm going 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.360
 to put the water 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.010
 It is one liter of water 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.610
 let's stir I'll put medium fire 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.139
 so that it boils faster 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.680
 because the water is at temperature 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.680
 ambient 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.040
 now we see that it started to boil and 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.740
 we see that the foam goes up 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.139
 is getting up go to foam I'm going to 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.790
 immediately lower the fire so that 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.100
 his hand spilling if we do not 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.610
 we lower the fire its foam is going to 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.130
 pour out of pot 8 of the case then 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.250
 I 'm calling for the fire to go down and I'm going to 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.570
 keep returning and see that it has already been lowered 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.479
 the foam 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.660
 here you have to be well ready because if 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.850
 no one can spill foam 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.910
 out here I will continue 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.669
 stirring one minute plus 1 minute 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.850
 little bit and this and I'm going to turn off the 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.850
 fire 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.350
 since they are completely cold from 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.330
 preparation let's put a spoonful 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.729
 vanilla 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:03.530
 here if you are making milk diet 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.530
 They are two tablespoons of vanilla 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.229
 and now we are going to put it in the 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.039
 plastic bags putting a house to 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.039
 each bag 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.569
 let's make a knot you need a 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:26.270
 little bit of foam if we want we can 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:30.830
 remove the can leave as you 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.539
 We want to make the knot and now 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.910
 I 'm going to tell you how many bags 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.680
 They left 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.260
 with this amount of guidelines that 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.420
 they left 6 in lakes but I will not be 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.880
 very large apparent that it is big 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.550
 because they are lying down but see this 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.500
 Look , we 've already said in other videos 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.720
 the trick to make them look more sebastian 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.030
 great we do the knot here but 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.090
 up and freezing it we're going to 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.620
 freeze like this in this way now I'm going to 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.500
 put in the freezer and wait for tomorrow 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.870
 to freeze 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.840
 This is how we are already canceled 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.700
 ice cream of burnt milk I hope you 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.590
 have liked this video and we are going to 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.590
 wait in my next video tips
