00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
now but I mean it obviously sounds

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.010 
now but I mean it obviously sounds
interesting<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.200> see<00:02:59.440> full<00:02:59.710> master<00:03:00.100> Chen

the<00:03:22.900> season<00:03:23.320> will<00:03:23.440> be<00:03:23.530> called<00:03:23.770> yet<00:03:24.120> these<00:03:25.120> were

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
the season will be called yet these were

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.000

the most these are the ones I believe I
believe<00:03:35.320> these<00:03:35.920> ones<00:03:36.160> because<00:03:36.730> they're<00:03:37.330> from

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
believe these ones because they're from

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.020 
believe these ones because they're from
