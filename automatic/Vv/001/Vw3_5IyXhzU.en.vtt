into<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> box<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:34.770> not

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
into the box because you just will not

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.950 
into the box because you just will not
find<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.250> way<00:01:35.280> past<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.180> opponent's<00:01:36.659> defense

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
find a way past your opponent's defense

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.030 
find a way past your opponent's defense
and<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.409> someone<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> middle<00:01:38.009> that

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and to have someone in the middle that

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.300 
and to have someone in the middle that
can<00:01:38.340> head<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:40.130> kind<00:01:41.130> of

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
can head it in you know is kind of

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.370 
can head it in you know is kind of
essential<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.240> guess<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.840> these<00:01:42.960> guys<00:01:43.110> did

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
essential I guess but these guys did

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.899 
essential I guess but these guys did
score<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> couple<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.070> headers<00:01:44.340> between<00:01:44.700> them

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
score a couple of headers between them

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.580 
score a couple of headers between them
now<00:01:45.299> what<00:01:45.540> we're<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.200> build<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
now what we're going to do is build the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.310 
now what we're going to do is build the
team<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.460> using<00:01:47.490> the

team as you can see I'm using the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.480

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.859 
default player in the game and you can
see<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.670> he<00:02:02.850> gets<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.090> link<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.509> both<00:02:03.689> of

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
cord I've ever built and don't get me

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.380 
cord I've ever built and don't get me
wrong<00:02:30.500> but<00:02:31.040> it's<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.459> decent<00:02:31.880> one<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.030> won<00:02:32.300> the

wrong but it's a decent one I won the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.770 
wrong but it's a decent one I won the
majority<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.840> my<00:02:33.020> games<00:02:33.290> with<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.780> overall

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
majority of my games with it but overall

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.270 
majority of my games with it but overall
I<00:02:35.840> wouldn't<00:02:36.230> recommend<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.770> build<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.130> just

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
I wouldn't recommend you build it just

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.710 
I wouldn't recommend you build it just
because<00:02:37.489> it's<00:02:37.640> very<00:02:37.760> expensive<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.480> it's<00:02:38.660> not

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
because it's very expensive and it's not

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.660 
because it's very expensive and it's not
all<00:02:38.989> round<00:02:39.320> really<00:02:39.650> strong<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.160> get<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.459> much

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
all round really strong you get a much

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.910 
all round really strong you get a much
better<00:02:40.850> team<00:02:41.120> for<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.420> much<00:02:41.660> cheaper<00:02:41.930> price<00:02:42.500> but

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
better team for a much cheaper price but

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.870 
better team for a much cheaper price but
that's<00:02:43.070> what<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.280> get<00:02:43.430> with<00:02:43.550> hybrids

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
that's what you get with hybrids

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.790 
that's what you get with hybrids
sometimes<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.300> have<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.540> use<00:02:44.690> kind<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.440> weaker

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
sometimes you have to use kind of weaker

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.890 
sometimes you have to use kind of weaker
players<00:02:46.070> now<00:02:46.520> sense<00:02:46.850> defensive<00:02:47.390> mid<00:02:47.570> we<00:02:47.750> are

actually going to be using and probably
the<00:02:50.330> weakest<00:02:50.630> player<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.380> team<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.920> it's

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
the weakest player of this team and it's

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.460 
the weakest player of this team and it's
going<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.400> be<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.519> guy<00:02:52.700> called<00:02:53.060> Jakob<00:02:53.600> from<00:02:54.170> West

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
chemistry which is perfect so he's in

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.270 
chemistry which is perfect so he's in
the<00:03:17.750> team<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.200> then<00:03:18.440> at<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.890> centre<00:03:19.160> back

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.500 
the team and then at the centre back
position<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.790> can<00:03:19.880> probably<00:03:20.030> guess<00:03:20.299> who

seven assists and Neymar any had three
then<00:05:06.260> four<00:05:06.770> shot<00:05:07.160> accuracy<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.790> was<00:05:07.880> pretty

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
then four shot accuracy it was pretty

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.130 
then four shot accuracy it was pretty
close<00:05:08.330> 76%<00:05:09.110> to<00:05:09.440> 75%<00:05:10.010> on<00:05:10.550> pass<00:05:11.180> accuracy<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:11.990> was

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
close 76% to 75% on pass accuracy it was

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.340 
close 76% to 75% on pass accuracy it was
85%<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:13.310> 84<00:05:14.030> percent<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.630> then<00:05:15.020> dribble

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
85% to 84 percent and then dribble

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.710 
85% to 84 percent and then dribble
completion<00:05:15.800> was<00:05:15.920> 72<00:05:16.550> percent<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.090> 68<00:05:17.630> percent

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
completion was 72 percent to 68 percent

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.350 
completion was 72 percent to 68 percent
so<00:05:18.380> it<00:05:18.650> wasn't<00:05:19.160> like<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.730> would<00:05:19.880> complete

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
so it wasn't like it would complete
