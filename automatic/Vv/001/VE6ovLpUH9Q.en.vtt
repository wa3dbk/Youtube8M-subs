00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.440
 welcome to claire form 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.150
 I have the espresso I cook 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.400
 Also like a cup of espresso 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.800
 drink then I have you know 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.290
 solution if you still have that 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.940
 classic way of preparing an espresso 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.710
 that happens then on the stove 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.220
 you do not need far coeur anymore 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.560
 now has this electric espresso 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.279
 stainless steel cooker 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.040
 Here you can see the central contact 360 Â° 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.620
 cordless that means simple 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.180
 Put on easy weight loss and you 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.780
 have also seen one 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.010
 cable winder but it fresh 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.760
 Cooking is child's play 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.719
 simple 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.030
 Let's do something like that 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.059
 here we have the water tank 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.840
 unscrew them and then have them 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.440
 here two bets one bet for three 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.770
 cups of espresso and an insert for 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.580
 six cups of espresso filling in with 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 make water like once for three cups 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.700
 Now I have the use for 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.340
 three mugs ever prepared if 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.040
 then we do it here and then 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.439
 screws like the coffee pot or the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.180
 espresso pot back on it which also 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.990
 important for you to know 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.040
 Here we have an optimized valve 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.729
 for their safety, only that this 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.619
 respect and then screw it again 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.619
 have two files here and if that 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:51.119
 show each other then is sitting 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:54.119
 the well firmly on the central contact and 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.930
 then turn it on and that's nice if 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.790
 the espresso is cooked then switched 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:06.360
 He also turns off automatically 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:09.209
 small compact space band that means 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.000
 wherever you have a power outlet 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.660
 Now you can cook your espresso 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.450
 so they take the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.170
 is also an espresso pocher with im 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.810
 vacation 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.500
 looks beautiful small compact-and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.360
 everywhere her favorite espresso and how 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.610
 Do they actually do the best 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.340
 espresso of course with freshly ground 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.670
 beans and the fresh made living 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:39.100
 of course they paint in these 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.190
 coffee grinder so meanwhile cooks here 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:47.250
 ever had the espresso but I had 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.250
 I've already prepared nespresso like that 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:56.080
 that fragrance ever honest 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:03:00.700
 espresso delicious I can tell you 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.840

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.840
