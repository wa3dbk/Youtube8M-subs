 It is a hero interview 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.559
 Today's hero is Katsumi Nakamura and 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.559
 Shohei Otani 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.100
 At first Nakamura pitcher was nice pitching 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.100
 Come on that 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:38.850
 At the moment the name was called, a loud cheer started 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:45.260
 How do you feel now ? 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.260
 Since the firm was able to throw in the event of the day I am really very glad value ordering 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.589
 And today 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.620
 This season's second win and the first in charge of taking a bath for the first time 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.370
 Thank you very much 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.370
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:12.590
 It is feeling any good in the first complete game first shutout victory 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:18.130
 Really I am taking a lot of points even more of a yes is so really today 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.130
 Thank you for letting me throw in an easy development 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.930
 What kind of place was good about your own pitching today 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.930
 That's right 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:41.580
 To be it what Kanto firm to Tee 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.580
 I think that it was this kind of development that you could go 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:51.580
 And in the 8th time the attack bunt involved in scoring also jumped out 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:57.840
 What kind of bats did you enter at bat 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.840
 That's right, only the bunt stood at bat, trying to decide firmly 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.130
 Then continue 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.759
 Nakamura Masaru initially invested 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.239
 First of all I would go to Otani, it was nice batting 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.239
 Thank you 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.800
 In the scene of no hit in consecutive bats 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.360
 Pre-emptive timely two-base 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.150
 How do you feel now 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.269

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.269
 Also I think that was good to Te one day to oh well I did not really 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:41.280
 Today was the starting point at Wright, but looking at Nakamura Katsura from behind, I can see what it looks like 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.280
 Did 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:50.390
 Well there was no time to fly to the lights too 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.390
 I think it was good to have a sense of security so much because it was so pitching 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:01.719

 It seems that revision has also become a force, first of all from Otani 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:14.760
 I think there will be a lot of people in there, and I think that support will be very powerful, so come again 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.760
 I think if you can 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.240
 Then continue 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.860
