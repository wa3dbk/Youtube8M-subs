do<00:00:47.050> you<00:00:47.140> really<00:00:47.350> think<00:00:47.469> for<00:00:47.979> example<00:00:48.370> one<00:00:48.909> can

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
do you really think for example one can

of diet soda per year would do you any
harm<00:00:51.999> the<00:00:52.809> answer<00:00:53.079> is<00:00:53.109> no<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.710> if<00:00:53.920> you<00:00:54.069> think

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
harm the answer is no and if you think

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.520 
harm the answer is no and if you think
otherwise<00:00:54.429> and<00:00:54.729> you<00:00:55.179> need<00:00:55.329> to<00:00:55.420> get<00:00:55.539> a<00:00:55.569> clue<00:00:55.839> the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
otherwise and you need to get a clue the

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.789 
otherwise and you need to get a clue the
point<00:00:56.829> being<00:00:56.889> that<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.909> 3ds<00:00:58.420> applies<00:00:58.839> so<00:00:59.469> at

00:00:59.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
point being that the 3ds applies so at

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.629 
point being that the 3ds applies so at
what<00:00:59.979> point<00:01:00.010> does<00:01:00.659> the<00:01:01.659> dose<00:01:02.159> of<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.370> synthetic

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
what point does the dose of a synthetic

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:06.090 
what point does the dose of a synthetic
sweetener<00:01:04.210> become<00:01:04.629> really<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.530> issue<00:01:05.680> and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
sweetener become really the issue and

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.820 
sweetener become really the issue and
that's<00:01:06.400> really<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.880> unknown<00:01:07.300> I<00:01:07.900> can<00:01:08.440> tell<00:01:08.650> you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
that's really the unknown I can tell you

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.160 
that's really the unknown I can tell you
that<00:01:09.270> synthetic<00:01:10.270> sweeteners<00:01:10.720> meet<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.020> Mayo

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
that synthetic sweeteners meet the Mayo
