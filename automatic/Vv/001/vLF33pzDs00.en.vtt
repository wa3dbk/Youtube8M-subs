we<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> spectator<00:00:19.680> give<00:00:19.980> us<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.250> number

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
we have a spectator give us a number

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.720 
we have a spectator give us a number
between<00:00:20.820> 10<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.840> 20<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.130> let's<00:00:23.369> say<00:00:23.519> they<00:00:23.699> say

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
between 10 and 20 so let's say they say

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.320 
between 10 and 20 so let's say they say
13<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:26.160> go<00:00:26.310> 1<00:00:26.519> 2<00:00:26.820> 3<00:00:26.849> 4<00:00:27.210> 5<00:00:27.810> 6<00:00:28.109> 7<00:00:28.619> 8<00:00:28.800> 9<00:00:28.859> 10<00:00:29.550> 11<00:00:29.760> 12

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
13 so we go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.709 
13 so we go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13<00:00:30.830> now<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> normal<00:00:32.219> car<00:00:32.700> trick<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.450> would

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
13 now in a normal car trick this would

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.080 
13 now in a normal car trick this would
be<00:00:33.870> your<00:00:34.050> card<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.250> trick<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.910> go

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
be your card but in this trick we go

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.240 
be your card but in this trick we go
further<00:00:36.420> than<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.380> we'll<00:00:37.649> add<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.100> two

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
further than that so we'll add the two

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.060 
further than that so we'll add the two
digits<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.730> 13<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:39.989> chosen<00:00:40.290> number<00:00:40.590> together

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
digits of 13 your chosen number together

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.299 
digits of 13 your chosen number together
which<00:00:41.309> would<00:00:41.430> be<00:00:41.550> 1<00:00:41.820> &amp;<00:00:42.059> 3<00:00:42.090> which<00:00:42.960> equals<00:00:43.379> 4<00:00:43.710> so

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
which would be 1 &amp; 3 which equals 4 so

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.430 
which would be 1 &amp; 3 which equals 4 so
your<00:00:44.489> card<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.149> gonna<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> fourth<00:00:46.110> card

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929 
with a little riffle and we're gonna say
I<00:01:07.140> think<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.619> deck<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.979> talking<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.580> me<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
I think the deck is talking to me and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.630 
I think the deck is talking to me and
it's<00:01:09.479> telling<00:01:09.960> me<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:11.010> card<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it's telling me that your card is the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.080 
it's telling me that your card is the
ace<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.970> spades<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:13.080> am<00:01:13.710> i<00:01:13.860> right<00:01:13.890> yes<00:01:14.490> well

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
ace of spades now am i right yes well

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.700 
ace of spades now am i right yes well
that<00:01:15.479> would<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> pretty<00:01:15.960> good<00:01:16.229> trick<00:01:16.500> but

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that would be a pretty good trick but

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.920 
that would be a pretty good trick but
this<00:01:16.920> trick<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.369> go<00:01:17.549> further<00:01:17.820> than<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.119> now

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
this trick we go further than that now

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.840 
this trick we go further than that now
let's<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.650> card<00:01:19.920> will<00:01:20.130> reveal<00:01:20.460> itself

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
let's see if the card will reveal itself

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.410 
let's see if the card will reveal itself
it<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.540> an<00:01:21.689> ace<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.560> we'll<00:01:22.740> spell<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.280> Cee<00:01:24.090> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it was an ace so we'll spell a Cee and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.100 
it was an ace so we'll spell a Cee and
it<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.350> spades<00:01:26.240> SP<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:28.040> des<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.930> there's<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
not only is that the ace of spades over
there<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.060> we're<00:01:36.750> gonna<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> little

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
there but we're gonna go a little

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.890 
there but we're gonna go a little
further<00:01:37.560> than<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:39.299> other<00:01:39.540> three

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.819 
than that now the 2 3 4 5 6 7 of spades
reveal<00:01:48.329> themselves<00:01:48.570> now<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.470> would<00:01:49.680> be<00:01:49.710> a

order now here's what happens no matter

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.900 
order now here's what happens no matter
what<00:02:44.040> number<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.670> selected<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:46.050> 13<00:02:46.800> 14<00:02:47.580> 15

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
what number is selected if it's 13 14 15

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.710 
what number is selected if it's 13 14 15
16<00:02:48.570> any<00:02:49.110> number<00:02:49.590> between<00:02:49.770> 10<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.370> 19<00:02:50.720> that's

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
16 any number between 10 and 19 that's

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.580 
16 any number between 10 and 19 that's
selected<00:02:52.320> let's<00:02:52.530> say<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:52.830> 17<00:02:53.400> 1<00:02:54.000> 17<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.080> then

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
selected let's say it's 17 1 17 and then

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.690 
selected let's say it's 17 1 17 and then
1<00:02:56.310> plus<00:02:56.610> 7<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.150> 8<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.170> take<00:02:58.560> 17<00:02:59.130> minus<00:02:59.520> 8

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
1 plus 7 is 8 so you take 17 minus 8

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.820 
1 plus 7 is 8 so you take 17 minus 8
gives<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.090> 9<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.630> that's<00:03:01.050> what's<00:03:01.530> gonna

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
gives you 9 and that's what's gonna

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.770 
gives you 9 and that's what's gonna
happen<00:03:02.100> no<00:03:02.520> matter<00:03:02.700> how<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.000> do<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.480> it's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
8 9 10 11 12 13 and then we count down 1

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.979 
8 9 10 11 12 13 and then we count down 1
2<00:03:18.510> 3<00:03:18.890> 4<00:03:19.890> there's<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.580> ace<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.940> spades<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.750> put

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.900 
then we put it right back on top of the
deck<00:03:30.360> now<00:03:30.930> one<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.620> things<00:03:31.890> that<00:03:32.160> I've

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
deck now one of the things that I've

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.970 
deck now one of the things that I've
seen<00:03:33.239> in<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.480> trick<00:03:33.690> where<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> couple<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:34.560> fall

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
seen in the trick where a couple of fall

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.800 
seen in the trick where a couple of fall
shuffles<00:03:35.489> where<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.030> guy<00:03:36.180> actually<00:03:36.450> just

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
shuffles where the guy actually just

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.360 
shuffles where the guy actually just
ripples<00:03:37.350> through<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.530> cards<00:03:37.890> like<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.310> and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
ripples through the cards like this and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.850 
ripples through the cards like this and
then<00:03:39.209> he<00:03:39.330> just<00:03:39.540> actually<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:40.110> makes<00:03:40.709> like

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
then he just actually just makes like

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.320 
then he just actually just makes like
he's<00:03:41.010> sliding<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.550> together<00:03:41.820> but<00:03:42.060> he<00:03:42.120> just

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
he's sliding it together but he just

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.470 
he's sliding it together but he just
puts<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.989> deck<00:03:43.230> right<00:03:43.830> on<00:03:43.980> top<00:03:44.250> again<00:03:44.970> if<00:03:45.360> you

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
puts the deck right on top again if you

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.039 
puts the deck right on top again if you
look<00:03:45.630> real<00:03:45.870> close<00:03:46.140> he<00:03:46.680> goes<00:03:46.830> like<00:03:47.040> this<00:03:48.049> just

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
look real close he goes like this just

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.440 
look real close he goes like this just
like<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.799> he's<00:03:50.130> not<00:03:50.340> into<00:03:50.640> twining<00:03:51.330> the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
like that and he's not into twining the

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.180 
like that and he's not into twining the
cards<00:03:51.810> he's<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:52.080> putting<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.830> one<00:03:53.040> right

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
cards he's just putting this one right

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.370 
cards he's just putting this one right
back<00:03:53.400> on<00:03:53.640> top<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.480> deck<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.840> not<00:03:54.870> being

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
back on top so the deck is not being

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.160 
back on top so the deck is not being
disturbed<00:03:55.709> in<00:03:55.920> any<00:03:56.070> way<00:03:56.480> then<00:03:57.480> we<00:03:57.840> say<00:03:58.019> the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
disturbed in any way then we say the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.199 
disturbed in any way then we say the
trick<00:03:58.320> will<00:03:58.440> go<00:03:58.560> further<00:03:58.799> than<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.370> the

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
trick will go further than that and the

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.660 
trick will go further than that and the
cards<00:04:00.630> would<00:04:00.810> spell<00:04:01.140> AC<00:04:01.410> e<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.400> spades<00:04:03.269> s<00:04:03.750> tage

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.100 
cards would spell AC e and spades s tage
s<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:06.230> there's<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.440> ace<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.769> space<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:09.110> wow

this<00:04:53.940> guy<00:04:54.120> doesn't<00:04:54.419> really<00:04:54.479> nicely<00:04:54.840> in<00:04:55.169> one<00:04:55.319> of

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
this guy doesn't really nicely in one of

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.129 
this guy doesn't really nicely in one of
the<00:04:55.530> videos<00:04:55.860> where<00:04:56.160> looks<00:04:56.610> like<00:04:56.759> he's

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
the videos where looks like he's

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.450 
the videos where looks like he's
shuffling<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.229> cards<00:04:58.410> but<00:04:58.710> he's<00:04:58.800> not<00:04:58.979> the

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
shuffling the cards but he's not the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.070 
shuffling the cards but he's not the
whole<00:04:59.669> time<00:04:59.909> you're<00:05:00.120> keeping<00:05:00.449> the<00:05:00.569> deck<00:05:00.780> in

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
whole time you're keeping the deck in

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.520 
whole time you're keeping the deck in
order<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.009> you're<00:05:02.970> keeping<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.750> ace<00:05:03.990> in<00:05:04.349> the

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
order and you're keeping the ace in the

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.339 
order and you're keeping the ace in the
9th<00:05:04.770> position<00:05:05.009> and<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:06.900> trick<00:05:07.139> will<00:05:07.319> work

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
9th position and the trick will work

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.210 
9th position and the trick will work
every<00:05:07.860> time<00:05:08.099> so<00:05:08.789> I<00:05:09.720> really<00:05:10.409> didn't<00:05:10.919> want<00:05:11.039> to<00:05:11.099> do

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
every time so I really didn't want to do

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.830 
every time so I really didn't want to do
this<00:05:11.340> trick<00:05:11.580> because<00:05:11.970> it's<00:05:12.150> really<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.419> silly

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
this trick because it's really a silly
