00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.910
 I do not forget accem equality or 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.120
 commenting good morning and we're on 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.280
 turn ok on let's say a new map on the 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.740
 site ni golden apple ok 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.040
 This is going to be created for the 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.040
 excel 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:26.059
 because it's going to be to make a super 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.699
 server for subscribers or for 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.919
 all of you but eye only for those who 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.730
 have jailbreak because it is by ip and 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.989
 Then right now I tell you my idea ok 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.430
 this server is going to be created for that 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.050
 for you as good as they were going to 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.079
 appear on the back a super 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.199
 Answer made by me for child 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.949
 ok, the server is going to have its 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.390
 parcels is going to have its stores and everything 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.789
 try to make it more faithful to what it was 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.370
 before not for the old ones like in March 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.699
 I had a good series not series but 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.549
 had a very father map on the server 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:04.280
 this we had done is the chaos leo 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:07.369
 Juan was not yet my friend it was a show and 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.770
 this one but it helped and that map had 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.530
 created let's say excellent had its 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.740
 coliseum its stores a hotel and we had 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.140
 made a plane a boat we had finally 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.130
 made a jet of things until a 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.539
 sub a super sub troll that I wish the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.539
 well if you are watching this video 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.320
 it occurred to him to have the mold explode 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.110
 tnt in creative to what this one put tnt 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.560
 for all the space put did a relax 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.520
 practically bone and the spam exploded not 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.350
 spam and exploited it and every one someone 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.290
 it entered account beam that appeared 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.020
 let's say spam and I told them I show them 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.390
 exposing to let's say there on earth 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.010
 where is the balloons ton and the other 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.460
 person appeared up here for example 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.440
 if it appears up here sorry and I had to 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.119
 fly and then already leave or that was a 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.800
 I relax and it was when I did not have 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.259
 androids I did not know that you could 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.080
 change creative and that but you 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.130
 we have amended by luck although the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.390
 coordinates can only be in android and 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.120
 what we want to do is do it 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.170
 as faithful as possible the plots tell them 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.170
 how much will he be measured 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.930
 ok look now you are going to make a 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.760
 graphic representation 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.890
 while I continue explaining that there is and 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.370
 let's do what you want 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.780
 I said and what we have planned to do that 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.129
 the truth would be a very fatherly idea if 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.359
 remember I wanted to do the series of 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.189
 stadiums but that series I'm not going to 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:57.329
 can do for other issues that do not 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:59.519
 is this policeman and well I think that 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.139
 I want it to be a father and we are going to invite 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.209
 the subscribers right now that is already 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.569
 return the servers by ipe and things 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.659
 well and only to the jailbreak ok 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.730
 let's try to build things for 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.620
 those who have jailbreak do the super 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.180
 city ​​and everything for those who do not have 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.799
 jailbreak then if you can wait 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.139
 know in the real ones and I'm going to 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.349
 set aside a plot I assure you already 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.209
 that multiplayer before minecraft is not 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.970
 available in ios 5 and we have 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.000
 5 there but I like to invite 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.099
 I can already those who have not have 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.200
 jailbreak and want to enter then in the 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.730
 comments put me today and I want 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.340
 enter I do not know if I would be separated is a place 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.670
 or thing if it exists is that we are all 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.160
 the south of 12 in the fumes of juan all 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.840
 ok then this sub is going to stay macro 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.269
 excel this upload this this server is going to 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.800
 to be excellent I say you already know that 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.410
 I think I tell them we want to do what 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.819
 more faithful and equal as possible to how 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.549
 we have the other one that the truth was very 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.049
 father and here is pretty much how much is going to 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.209
 measure the plots so that they have 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.240
 an idea ok the super seems that of lives 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.190
 by 10 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.040
 and for example, ours will be 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.320
 here, not mine, it can be here in 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.540
 the one in the box here and two in the field 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:19.300
 now I'm not going to do they are there and because 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.300
 We are all practically the same. 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.040
 normal everything must be normal what is not 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.690
 there must be differences this here goes to 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.150
 be mine for example and things like that 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.710
 but the first comment that I put 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.360
 I'm going to be there I'm sure that 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.360
 I'll be there even if it does not come out 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.520
 24 because we are 4 grams 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.540
 but yes 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:55.600
 and that they put the name of the let's say 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.080
 youtuber they want to be behind or 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.960
 with 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.819
 and also to ok this well he made a good 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.220
 idea that the first comment then 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.930
 obviously going to put it is going to have the 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.849
 ability to choose and then the 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.889
 first four nothing else are going to have the 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.780
 ability to choose who they want 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.520
 be because they suppose I think that I 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.750
 You got married back from the meadow, I think 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.310
 shows that behind the water I 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.979
 I think the mystique of what I left 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.659
 of 12 or things like that the first four 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.050
 days then others as they go 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:26.599
 coming for example if my house is this 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:31.099
 is going to be the quartzite representation 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:34.610
 this is mine, that is Juan's and the 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.620
 of 12 ok here are our houses if I 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.599
 they put in a subscriber I want back 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.330
 Dago it back if back water 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:44.300
 from israel here behind Juan here and 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.599
 behind two in here and that's how they're going to 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.430
 be the first four if a 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.199
 comment if the second comment is 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.150
 repeat with the first one so that I 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.000
 I want 12 and the other one I also want 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.949
 12 will only count the first and the 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.860
 another sub has to be rushed through 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.569
 to say it I want to get it low that no 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.200
 you win the other youtuber is a mini 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.810
 dynamic 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.480
 we want to implement then you already 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.460
 after that for example another one that already 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.560
 after those 4 that you have chosen or 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.200
 be after the four plots 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.150
 behind us are ready the 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.280
 next subscriber and nothing else is going to 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.110
 put I want to be and put yo yo 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.820
 I want to be and I will touch you I 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.040
 I want also and after the other that 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.900
 Say no, well, I would like to and here and 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.710
 that is, they are going to agree as 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.290
 are there or give them the option to choose free 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.790
 ok that would also please me 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.740
 they chose the area where they would like to be 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.480
 but then those first four 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.510
 comments would be behind our 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.510
 houses ok then the dynamics we will deal with 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.770
 of being coliseums as we had them done 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.380
 super own hotels not to see now 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.940
 Now everyone is going to have their house 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.030
 all in super creative already after 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.590
 when survival is past and it's already 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.200
 when they are going to be able to go explore and things 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.570
 well and kill yourself ok then this has been 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.190
 everything if you want to participate you know and 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.580
 no more than you did speed ago 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.580
 Isabel 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.340
 then more than saying goodbye to something and 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.340
 goodbye 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.910
 yes 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.860
 and
