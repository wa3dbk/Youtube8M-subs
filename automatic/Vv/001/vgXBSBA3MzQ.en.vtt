00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.160
 to learn how you do the images 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.160
 recorded 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.530
 this is the node 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.140
 the gap looks here legal people 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.939
 He has these four little things here. 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.159
 does this is about layers here in part 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:26.539
 from above and here on the bottom 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.810
 only in the middle is this space 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.700
 looking like a small diamond and looks 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.700
 just inside another color 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.039
 What is inside here is simply 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.560
 a little piece of paper you will learn how 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.069
 do this in step by step what I go 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.509
 teach you now 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.759
 always reminding staff that the video 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.500
 Then I've inverted it from here. 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.420
 holding the thick part of the tie 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.399
 my right hand is on the side of here 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.439
 holding the final part is recorded is 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.349
 my left hand 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.750
 this knot is made with the final part of the 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:02.239
 tie then as always in this type of 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.569
 and you can leave the thick part of the 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:08.269
 tie a little above the height it 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:10.700
 You want and do not need to mess anymore. 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.790
 in her then to begin let's do is 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.010
 the one who learns here in the thick part 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.150
 and tie bring to the middle where it goes 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.209
 stay marked 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.799
 It's going to be a knot and we're going to pick up the thin part. 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:29.299
 of the tie bring popular right and gives 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:32.139
 the back from behind and the left gripper only 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:36.799
 I turned around and asked before 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:38.930
 we play the middle back 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.760
 we passed the first one playing back 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.620
 triangles and effect now you go through 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.660
 end part above the triangle 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.660
 to make this part flat and from here 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.430
 we passed here through the middle again 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.430
 playing back engraved from the front 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.090
 now you get a fish in the necktie plays 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.100
 the right above the Trio 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.420
 same again and you will only give 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.540
 back from behind is just passing here from the side 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.300
 voting portals that here now 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:24.810
 You will pass that inside as is 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:28.260
 made in eldridge love already did there that 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.140
 right triangle and this is going to be here 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.510
 the top of our diamond 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:39.630
 from the tie now you play passes 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:43.020
 here behind this part of the collar and 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.420
 now comes the end of the knot you go 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.460
 take this thin part and do this 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.670
 move here รณ put it diagonally 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.870
 following the right-hand side of the triangle 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.420
 series that play on the diagonal work and 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.800
 You 're going to put your finger now. 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:05.360
 is at the base of the triangle here and reverse the 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:09.060
 tie letting the seam out 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.560
 Right, I put it diagonally down. 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.670
 seeing here 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.410
 inverted tie was up and this 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.540
 part of that way you can see that 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.280
 here if we close here it will be 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.190
 the triangle is ready 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.810
 Sergio only here so here we go 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.430
 go inside 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.740
 in this look here 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:41.220
 this way put the record 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:44.070
 here I received here is not to miss this turn 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:49.700
 and that's not much to adjust at the end 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:52.800
 just like shulan another way is trash lan 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.770
 was the previous video and can be checked 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.540
 there is a lot of adjustment at the end but more 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.730
 It is ready our triangle it 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.550
 here you can if you can spare too much you can 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:06.410
 hide behind just a little bit alone 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:10.670
 let the same collar is is the cap 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.670
 I'll lower the collar and now 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.040
 now we got our triangle and now 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.830
 you can put something in there 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.520
 to stay in another color had a little 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.030
 white paper put here 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.030
 inside 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:45.200
 it will ensure a good risk of 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:45.200
 if the paper falls correctly 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.840
 I was just leaving the year says 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.820
 serginho de novo 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.820

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:04.109

 other than just example the green 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.659
 I do not think it's going to work. 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:20.849
 combine this prissy thing but 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:24.409
 Just for you, you see a nice limp in a 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:27.149
 paper clothes and ran away 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.789
 there the green paper he looks at 

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:32.459
 That's very cool, that knot. 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:35.569
