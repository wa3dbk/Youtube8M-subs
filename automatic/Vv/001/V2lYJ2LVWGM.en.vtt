with deke oh yeah hello and we have made

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.560 
with deke oh yeah hello and we have made
this<00:00:13.410> two<00:00:14.190> out<00:00:14.519> of<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.820> floor<00:00:15.089> bud<00:00:15.389> switch

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
this two out of the floor bud switch

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.660 
this two out of the floor bud switch
sodiq<00:00:16.529> was<00:00:16.680> gonna<00:00:16.830> walk<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.039> through<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.400> how

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
sodiq was gonna walk you through it how

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.550 
sodiq was gonna walk you through it how
it<00:00:17.820> works<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.420> he's<00:00:18.600> gonna<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.350> tutorial

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
it works and he's gonna do the tutorial

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.290 
it works and he's gonna do the tutorial
as<00:00:19.949> well<00:00:21.529> well<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.430> put<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> torch<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.119> this

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
as well well we just put a torch on this

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.790 
as well well we just put a torch on this
block<00:00:24.570> here<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.140> see<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> pissing

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
block here and you see the pissing

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.580 
block here and you see the pissing
detects<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.970> block<00:00:27.390> updates<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.380> that

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
detects the block updates and then that

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.810 
detects the block updates and then that
goes<00:00:28.800> through<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> dropper<00:00:29.519> which<00:00:29.640> also

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
goes through the dropper which also

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.089 
goes through the dropper which also
detects<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.269> block<00:00:30.480> updates<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:31.949> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
detects a block updates so it's going to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.590 
detects a block updates so it's going to
shoot<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> item<00:00:32.669> into<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.969> hopper<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
shoot the item into the hopper here and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.959 
shoot the item into the hopper here and
then<00:00:33.980> activate<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> system<00:00:35.280> through<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
then activate the system through that

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.200 
then activate the system through that
comparator<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.100> that's<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.820> very

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
comparator there and that's in very

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.639 
comparator there and that's in very
short<00:00:39.480> term<00:00:39.660> sat<00:00:39.930> works<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:40.500> it's

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
short term sat works because it's

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.990 
short term sat works because it's
actually<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> lot<00:00:41.129> more<00:00:41.280> complicated<00:00:41.579> than<00:00:41.820> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
actually a lot more complicated than I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.540 
actually a lot more complicated than I
just<00:00:42.210> want<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.230> describe<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
just want to just describe because it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.790 
just want to just describe because it
actually<00:00:44.670> needs<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.270> bud<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.050> dropper<00:00:46.590> in

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
actually needs to bud to the dropper in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.819 
actually needs to bud to the dropper in
off<00:00:47.280> states<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.719> thinks<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.500> off<00:00:49.649> but

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
off states so it thinks it it's off but

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.100 
off states so it thinks it it's off but
exactly<00:00:50.010> powered<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.390> piston<00:00:51.719> should<00:00:51.899> be

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
exactly powered and the piston should be

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.860 
exactly powered and the piston should be
thinking<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.710> off<00:00:52.949> no<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.120> well<00:00:54.719> it's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
thinking it's off no it's on well it's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.950 
thinking it's off no it's on well it's
not<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.760> it's<00:00:56.760> kind<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.030> complicated<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
not so it's kind of complicated to do so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.349 
not so it's kind of complicated to do so
we<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.550> powering<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
we see we have one but powering the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.270 
we see we have one but powering the
piston<00:01:00.719> here<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.770> powering<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
piston here and one but powering the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.750 
piston here and one but powering the
dropper<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.890> that's<00:01:04.890> basically<00:01:05.129> all

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
dropper here and that's basically all

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.690 
dropper here and that's basically all
there<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> ring<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
there is to it so now go to ring you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.600 
there is to it so now go to ring you
through<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> tutorial<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.040> let's<00:01:11.040> see<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
through the tutorial and let's see it I

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.770 
through the tutorial and let's see it I
don't<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.180> want<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> build<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.630> or

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
don't know if you want to build it or

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.990 
don't know if you want to build it or
something<00:01:13.140> go<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.460> yeah<00:01:14.460> maybe<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.880> very

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
something go to yeah maybe it's very

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.330 
something go to yeah maybe it's very
cool<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.509> base<00:01:15.630> or<00:01:15.810> something<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
cool for your base or something so to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.710 
cool for your base or something so to
start<00:01:17.520> off<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.850> want<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> place<00:01:18.240> your<00:01:18.390> sticky

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
start off you want to place your sticky

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.060 
start off you want to place your sticky
piston<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> block<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.530> top<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
piston with a block on top of it and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.399 
piston with a block on top of it and
surround<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:20.880> four<00:01:21.180> blocks<00:01:21.450> then

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
surround it with your four blocks then

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.440 
surround it with your four blocks then
underneath<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.920> place<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.490> drop<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:24.119> facing

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
underneath it place a drop or facing

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.660 
underneath it place a drop or facing
sideways<00:01:24.830> with<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> hopper<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.280> front<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.490> its

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
sideways with the hopper in front of its

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.490 
sideways with the hopper in front of its
place<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.420> hopper<00:01:27.659> would<00:01:27.810> shift<00:01:28.020> click<00:01:28.259> onto

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
place that hopper would shift click onto

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.190 
place that hopper would shift click onto
the<00:01:28.920> into<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> dropper<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:30.659> will<00:01:30.840> face

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the into the dropper so they will face

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.679 
the into the dropper so they will face
into<00:01:31.439> each<00:01:31.530> other<00:01:31.710> oh<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.360> then<00:01:33.360> from<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
into each other oh and then from the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
into each other oh and then from the
side<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> dropper<00:01:34.409> taking<00:01:34.979> comparator

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
side of the dropper taking comparator

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.090 
side of the dropper taking comparator
output<00:01:35.369> into<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> block<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
output into a block and then it's a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.830 
output into a block and then it's a
repeater<00:01:38.460> that's<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> fit<00:01:39.659> into

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
repeater that's going to fit into

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.469 
repeater that's going to fit into
another<00:01:40.140> block<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.180> side

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
another block and then on one side

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.850 
another block and then on one side
you're<00:01:42.600> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> place<00:01:43.079> your<00:01:43.110> redstone<00:01:43.530> dust

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
you're going to place your redstone dust

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.399 
you're going to place your redstone dust
and<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> back<00:01:44.610> torch<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> other

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and on the back torch and on the other

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.600 
and on the back torch and on the other
side<00:01:46.680> you're<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.979> place<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.340> wrestling

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
side you're going to place one wrestling

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.080 
side you're going to place one wrestling
dust<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> repeater<00:01:49.729> then<00:01:50.729> we're<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
dust and repeater then we're going to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.630 
dust and repeater then we're going to
place<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.630> block<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.259> slide<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> back

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
place a block the slide or on the back

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.060 
place a block the slide or on the back
of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.270> dropper<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.680> that's<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.979> to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
of the dropper here so that's going to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.539 
of the dropper here so that's going to
be<00:01:56.130> butting<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> piston<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.420> down<00:01:58.049> here

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
be butting the piston and then down here

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.709 
be butting the piston and then down here
we're<00:01:59.549> going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.729> place<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> redstone<00:02:00.119> block

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
we're going to place a redstone block

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.469 
we're going to place a redstone block
with<00:02:01.170> redstone<00:02:01.530> talk<00:02:01.950> events<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
with redstone talk events like that and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.230 
with redstone talk events like that and
it's<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.840> bought<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.229> draw<00:02:04.439> brother

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
it's going to bought the draw brother

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.730 
it's going to bought the draw brother
then<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.479> place<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> sticky<00:02:06.990> piston<00:02:07.229> here

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
then you can place a sticky piston here

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.070 
then you can place a sticky piston here
two<00:02:08.429> blocks<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.179> we'll<00:02:09.450> place<00:02:09.660> that's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
two blocks like so we'll place that's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
two blocks like so we'll place that's
real<00:02:10.319> later<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:11.550> underneath<00:02:11.849> this

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
real later and then underneath this

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.700 
real later and then underneath this
block<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:12.989> already

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
block here already

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.130 
block here already
dust<00:02:14.070> with<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> comparator<00:02:15.420> arm<00:02:15.450> side<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.960> so

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
dust with a comparator arm side of it so

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.290 
dust with a comparator arm side of it so
that's<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.500> subtractor<00:02:17.010> mode<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.490> then

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
that's the subtractor mode and then

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.880 
that's the subtractor mode and then
place<00:02:18.630> your<00:02:18.660> roots<00:02:18.960> nora<00:02:19.260> pitre<00:02:19.380> right<00:02:19.680> there

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
place your roots nora pitre right there

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.130 
place your roots nora pitre right there
a<00:02:20.300> sticky<00:02:21.300> piston<00:02:21.450> coming<00:02:21.810> off<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.930> that

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
a sticky piston coming off of that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.240 
a sticky piston coming off of that
redstone<00:02:22.440> dust<00:02:22.650> right<00:02:22.830> there<00:02:23.040> with<00:02:23.220> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
redstone dust right there with a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.270 
redstone dust right there with a
redstone<00:02:23.640> block<00:02:24.170> then<00:02:25.170> place<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> block<00:02:26.040> there

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
redstone block then place a block there

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.060 
redstone block then place a block there
and<00:02:26.580> two<00:02:26.910> blocks<00:02:27.210> down<00:02:27.330> here<00:02:27.860> your<00:02:28.860> redstone

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
and two blocks down here your redstone

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.650 
and two blocks down here your redstone
right<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.700> then<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.970> block<00:02:30.240> will<00:02:30.420> cut

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
right there and then that block will cut

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.480 
right there and then that block will cut
off<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.900> power<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.680> power<00:02:31.860> from<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.220> here

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
off the power so the power from up here

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.000 
off the power so the power from up here
will<00:02:33.000> not<00:02:33.180> travel<00:02:33.480> down<00:02:33.840> into<00:02:34.500> red<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.920> red

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
will not travel down into red the red

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.790 
will not travel down into red the red
stone<00:02:35.220> down<00:02:35.400> there<00:02:35.670> then<00:02:36.570> grab<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.170> furnace<00:02:37.590> and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
stone down there then grab a furnace and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.980 
stone down there then grab a furnace and
detector<00:02:38.760> rail<00:02:38.910> place<00:02:39.270> your<00:02:39.540> furnace<00:02:39.870> right

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
detector rail place your furnace right

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.560 
detector rail place your furnace right
there<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.500> put<00:02:41.430> any<00:02:41.610> random<00:02:41.940> item<00:02:42.210> inside<00:02:42.420> of

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
there and put any random item inside of

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.150 
there and put any random item inside of
its<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.990> then<00:02:43.320> place<00:02:43.560> your<00:02:43.590> detector<00:02:44.040> rail

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
its and then place your detector rail

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.760 
its and then place your detector rail
right<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.820> then<00:02:45.810> lastly<00:02:46.350> you're<00:02:46.620> going

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
right there and then lastly you're going

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.970 
right there and then lastly you're going
to<00:02:46.830> place<00:02:46.980> your<00:02:47.010> block<00:02:47.370> there<00:02:48.500> one<00:02:49.500> more<00:02:49.680> thing

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
to place your block there one more thing

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.160 
to place your block there one more thing
you<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.340> place<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> block<00:02:50.910> there<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.510> a

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
you have to place a block there and a

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
you have to place a block there and a
torch<00:02:52.770> yeah<00:02:53.640> that's<00:02:53.850> true<00:02:53.970> not<00:02:54.570> about<00:02:54.630> that

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
torch yeah that's true not about that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.650 
torch yeah that's true not about that
and<00:02:56.190> then<00:02:56.370> just<00:02:56.580> place<00:02:56.790> your<00:02:57.060> items<00:02:57.150> out<00:02:57.630> of

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
and then just place your items out of

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.970 
and then just place your items out of
the<00:02:58.100> dropper<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.810> then<00:03:00.990> just<00:03:01.200> replaces<00:03:01.740> block

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
the dropper so then just replaces block

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.210 
the dropper so then just replaces block
and<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.910> see<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.210> will<00:03:03.360> work<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:04.620> if<00:03:04.710> we<00:03:04.740> grab<00:03:05.010> a

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
and you see it will work so if we grab a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.350 
and you see it will work so if we grab a
torch<00:03:06.290> alright<00:03:07.290> slats<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.850> extends<00:03:09.150> again

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
torch alright slats and it extends again

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.240 
torch alright slats and it extends again
now<00:03:09.570> do<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:09.990> make<00:03:10.170> sure<00:03:10.350> not<00:03:10.590> update<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.100> too

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
now do you make sure not update is too

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.650 
now do you make sure not update is too
quickly<00:03:11.490> because<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.000> piston<00:03:12.270> is<00:03:12.360> going<00:03:12.570> to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
quickly because the piston is going to

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.340 
quickly because the piston is going to
break<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:14.480> sorry<00:03:15.480> about<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.630> scribe<00:03:15.900> Sabbath

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
break and sorry about the scribe Sabbath

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.550 
break and sorry about the scribe Sabbath
or<00:03:16.530> whatever<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.570> can<00:03:18.960> take<00:03:19.140> your<00:03:19.170> outputs

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
or whatever so you can take your outputs

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.880 
or whatever so you can take your outputs
from<00:03:19.680> wherever<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.250> want<00:03:20.460> this<00:03:20.970> will<00:03:21.210> work

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
from wherever you want this will work

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.200 
from wherever you want this will work
everything<00:03:22.890> which<00:03:23.220> basically<00:03:23.520> toggles<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
everything which basically toggles the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.560 
everything which basically toggles the
redstone<00:03:24.690> signal<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.970> rather<00:03:26.970> not<00:03:27.210> to<00:03:27.300> read

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
redstone signal so rather not to read

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.300 
redstone signal so rather not to read
some<00:03:27.780> block<00:03:27.990> because<00:03:28.710> then<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.040> not<00:03:29.160> going

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
some block because then it's not going

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.560 
some block because then it's not going
to<00:03:29.490> work<00:03:29.580> because<00:03:29.670> that's<00:03:29.970> never<00:03:30.150> gonna<00:03:30.360> turn

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
to work because that's never gonna turn

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.900 
to work because that's never gonna turn
off<00:03:30.750> basically<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.500> if<00:03:32.160> anything<00:03:32.610> goes<00:03:32.820> wrong

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
off basically and if anything goes wrong

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.090 
off basically and if anything goes wrong
and<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.210> want<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.480> reset<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:34.230> be<00:03:34.860> sure<00:03:35.070> to
