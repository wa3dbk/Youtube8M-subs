00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this area is volcanic in nature it's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.500 
this area is volcanic in nature it's
what<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.050> origination<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.860> whole

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
what the origination of the whole

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.779 
what the origination of the whole
geology<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.289> turns<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.219> pumice

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
geology is and so that turns to pumice

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.479 
geology is and so that turns to pumice
and<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.570> pumice<00:01:00.989> turns<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> really<00:01:02.129> soft

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and that pumice turns to a really soft

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.570 
and that pumice turns to a really soft
trail<00:01:03.149> surface<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.260> challenging<00:01:05.040> riding<00:01:05.489> in

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
trail surface so challenging riding in

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
trail surface so challenging riding in
Mammoth<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.180> because<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.630> very<00:01:06.840> very<00:01:07.020> soft

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
Mammoth it because it's very very soft

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.050 
Mammoth it because it's very very soft
it<00:01:07.619> gets<00:01:07.770> very<00:01:07.830> powdery<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> bikes

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it gets very powdery from all the bikes

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
it gets very powdery from all the bikes
hammering<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> really<00:01:10.260> deep<00:01:10.470> drifts<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
hammering it really deep drifts and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250 
hammering it really deep drifts and
interspersed<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.180> all<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> lot<00:01:13.080> of

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
interspersed and all of that is a lot of

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
interspersed and all of that is a lot of
chunky<00:01:13.680> rock<00:01:13.920> broke<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.640> kind<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.880> odd<00:01:15.090> angled

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
chunky rock broke and kind of odd angled

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
chunky rock broke and kind of odd angled
rocks<00:01:15.810> stuck<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> ground<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> tree<00:01:16.979> roots

rocks stuck in the ground and tree roots

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
rocks stuck in the ground and tree roots
so<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.970> challenging<00:01:18.450> place<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> ride<00:01:19.080> so

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
so it's a challenging place to ride so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.109 
so it's a challenging place to ride so
flotation<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.189> being<00:01:20.430> able<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> punch<00:01:20.909> into

flotation and being able to punch into

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.179 
flotation and being able to punch into
that<00:01:21.299> surface<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.020> some<00:01:22.200> traction<00:01:22.470> is

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
that surface and get some traction is

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.910 
that surface and get some traction is
really<00:01:23.520> key<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> having<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.210> good<00:01:24.360> time<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.920> the

for<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.790> type<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.090> soil<00:02:27.540> up<00:02:27.750> here<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.020> Mammoth

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
for this type of soil up here in Mammoth

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.790 
for this type of soil up here in Mammoth
and<00:02:28.730> in<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.970> full<00:02:30.420> on<00:02:30.569> 2.5<00:02:31.230> descent<00:02:31.650> it's

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
and in the full on 2.5 descent it's

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.710 
and in the full on 2.5 descent it's
about<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.069> thousand<00:02:32.640> gram<00:02:32.819> tire<00:02:33.090> it's<00:02:33.330> under<00:02:33.690> a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
about a thousand gram tire it's under a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.600 
about a thousand gram tire it's under a
thousand<00:02:34.170> grams<00:02:34.230> actually<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.459> about

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
thousand grams actually so it's about

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.890 
thousand grams actually so it's about
three<00:02:35.880> hundred<00:02:35.970> grams<00:02:36.150> lighter<00:02:36.600> than<00:02:36.870> a

three hundred grams lighter than a

three hundred grams lighter than a
descent<00:02:37.290> which<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.590> significant<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.640> models

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
descent which is significant the models

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.470 
descent which is significant the models
I<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.209> have<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.780> TNT<00:02:40.319> casing<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.880> it's

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
I have have the TNT casing so it's it's

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.530 
I have have the TNT casing so it's it's
pretty<00:02:42.840> pretty<00:02:43.560> good<00:02:44.090> thickness<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.239> me<00:02:45.330> when

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
pretty pretty good thickness to me when

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.910 
pretty pretty good thickness to me when
you're<00:02:45.840> feeling<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.470> know<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.769> feels

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you're feeling it you know it feels

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.800 
you're feeling it you know it feels
stout<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.640> got<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.850> lot<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.120> body<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.569> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
stout it's got a lot of body to the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.199 
stout it's got a lot of body to the
casing<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:50.400> all<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.700> trails<00:02:50.940> up<00:02:51.060> here

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
casing and on all the trails up here

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.880 
casing and on all the trails up here
today<00:02:51.360> including<00:02:51.630> some<00:02:52.049> very<00:02:52.350> very<00:02:52.560> rocky

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
today including some very very rocky

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.009 
today including some very very rocky
stuff<00:02:53.310> I've<00:02:53.610> never<00:02:53.850> even<00:02:54.060> got<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.330> scuff<00:02:54.690> on<00:02:54.870> it

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
stuff I've never even got a scuff on it

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.539 
stuff I've never even got a scuff on it
so<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.380> seems<00:02:55.650> like<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.100> pretty<00:02:56.280> tough

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
so it seems like it's a pretty tough

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.210 
so it seems like it's a pretty tough
casing<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.870> aggressive<00:02:58.380> knobs<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:59.040> deep
