00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
these are the differences of the curved

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.290 
these are the differences of the curved
edges<00:06:00.690> of<00:06:01.020> these<00:06:01.260> two<00:06:01.440> devices<00:06:01.560> here<00:06:02.250> and<00:06:02.460> it's

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
edges of these two devices here and it's

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.969 
edges of these two devices here and it's
up<00:06:03.690> to<00:06:03.720> you<00:06:03.960> which<00:06:04.169> one<00:06:04.350> you<00:06:04.380> should<00:06:04.710> get

before I make my final verdict let's

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.320 
before I make my final verdict let's
summarize<00:06:08.100> the<00:06:08.130> differences<00:06:08.820> in<00:06:09.030> between

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
summarize the differences in between

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.810 
summarize the differences in between
these<00:06:09.479> two<00:06:09.690> devices<00:06:09.900> note<00:06:10.890> edges<00:06:11.280> screen<00:06:11.580> is

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
these two devices note edges screen is

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.300 
these two devices note edges screen is
fully<00:06:12.180> curved<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:12.840> it's<00:06:13.200> basically<00:06:13.830> separate

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
fully curved and it's basically separate

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.490 
fully curved and it's basically separate
from<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:14.760> screen<00:06:15.090> content<00:06:15.479> that's<00:06:16.169> why<00:06:16.440> the

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
from the screen content that's why the

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.130 
from the screen content that's why the
images<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:17.280> videos<00:06:17.340> doesn't<00:06:18.180> look<00:06:18.510> curved<00:06:18.960> or

images and videos doesn't look curved or

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.410 
images and videos doesn't look curved or
distorted<00:06:19.919> at<00:06:20.100> the<00:06:20.250> site<00:06:20.490> where

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
distorted at the site where

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.390 
distorted at the site where

screen is basically curved at both the

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.760 
screen is basically curved at both the
sides<00:06:26.220> and<00:06:26.510> images<00:06:27.510> and<00:06:27.690> videos<00:06:28.140> looks<00:06:28.500> like

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
we popped up from the phone I also

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.020 
we popped up from the phone I also
really<00:06:31.260> don't<00:06:31.560> mind<00:06:31.830> the<00:06:32.220> slight<00:06:32.550> distortion

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
really don't mind the slight distortion

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.050 
really don't mind the slight distortion
of<00:06:33.390> images<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.590> symmetric<00:06:35.130> design<00:06:35.460> of<00:06:35.640> s6

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
of images the symmetric design of s6

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.850 
of images the symmetric design of s6
edge<00:06:36.300> also<00:06:36.570> makes<00:06:36.930> it<00:06:37.080> much<00:06:37.410> more<00:06:37.680> attractive

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
edge also makes it much more attractive

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.790 
edge also makes it much more attractive
than<00:06:38.520> the<00:06:38.670> note<00:06:38.880> edge<00:06:39.180> not<00:06:40.110> to<00:06:40.290> mention<00:06:40.470> the

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
glass back and the curved metal vessel

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.890 
glass back and the curved metal vessel
of<00:06:43.440> s6<00:06:43.950> edge<00:06:44.160> also<00:06:44.700> add<00:06:44.970> to<00:06:45.360> the<00:06:45.390> beauty<00:06:45.720> of

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
of s6 edge also add to the beauty of

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.130 
of s6 edge also add to the beauty of
this<00:06:46.350> new<00:06:46.740> device<00:06:47.040> so<00:06:47.910> my<00:06:48.090> final<00:06:48.570> verdict<00:06:49.020> is

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140
