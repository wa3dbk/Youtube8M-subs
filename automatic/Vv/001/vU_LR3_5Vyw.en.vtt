to come up about six to twelve inches
and<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.049> reason<00:01:41.319> why<00:01:41.409> we<00:01:41.590> want<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.859> do<00:01:41.979> that<00:01:42.189> is

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
and the reason why we want to do that is

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.399 
and the reason why we want to do that is
because<00:01:42.849> to<00:01:43.329> new<00:01:43.509> branches<00:01:43.990> are<00:01:44.109> going<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.349> be

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
because to new branches are going to be

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.679 
because to new branches are going to be
growing<00:01:44.649> in<00:01:44.829> below<00:01:45.189> it<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:46.090> then<00:01:46.240> next<00:01:46.450> year

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
growing in below it so then next year

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.019 
growing in below it so then next year
this<00:01:46.840> two<00:01:47.319> branch<00:01:47.679> here<00:01:48.279> is<00:01:48.429> going<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:48.880> turn

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:49.029 
this two branch here is going to turn

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:51.419 
this two branch here is going to turn
into<00:01:49.240> four<00:01:49.450> branches<00:01:49.929> and<00:01:50.679> over<00:01:50.950> time<00:01:51.159> you'll

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
into four branches and over time you'll

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.489 
into four branches and over time you'll
then<00:01:51.639> become<00:01:52.270> thicker<00:01:52.719> and<00:01:52.929> thicker<00:01:53.139> of<00:01:53.380> a

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:53.499 
then become thicker and thicker of a

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:57.809 
then become thicker and thicker of a
shrub<00:01:53.950> more<00:01:54.429> flowers<00:01:54.909> as<00:01:55.119> well<00:01:56.310> once<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.429> trim

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
shrub more flowers as well once you trim

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.399 
shrub more flowers as well once you trim
the<00:01:57.999> top<00:01:58.209> of<00:01:58.329> the<00:01:58.389> crepe<00:01:58.719> you<00:01:59.049> should<00:01:59.200> have<00:01:59.289> a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
the top of the crepe you should have a

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.599 
the top of the crepe you should have a
finished<00:01:59.740> product<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.130> looks<00:02:00.369> something

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
finished product that looks something

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.609 
finished product that looks something
similar<00:02:00.999> to<00:02:01.090> this<00:02:01.270> one<00:02:02.109> thing<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.380> keep<00:02:02.499> in

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
similar to this one thing to keep in

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.959 
similar to this one thing to keep in
mind<00:02:02.829> when<00:02:03.039> you<00:02:03.099> are<00:02:03.219> trimming<00:02:03.489> is<00:02:03.700> making

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
mind when you are trimming is making

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.550 
mind when you are trimming is making
sure<00:02:04.119> that<00:02:04.149> you're<00:02:04.419> cutting<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.929> branches<00:02:05.380> at

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
sure that you're cutting the branches at

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.739 
sure that you're cutting the branches at
an<00:02:05.889> angle<00:02:06.249> so<00:02:06.669> that<00:02:06.819> way<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.060> water<00:02:07.329> is<00:02:07.450> able

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
an angle so that way the water is able

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:09.690 
an angle so that way the water is able
to<00:02:07.840> run<00:02:08.020> off<00:02:08.229> otherwise<00:02:08.890> you're<00:02:09.250> more<00:02:09.399> prone

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
to run off otherwise you're more prone

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.940 
to run off otherwise you're more prone
for<00:02:09.759> diseases<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.660> funguses<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.319> occur<00:02:11.770> so

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
for diseases and funguses to occur so

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.350 
for diseases and funguses to occur so
just<00:02:12.459> keep<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:12.849> mind<00:02:13.000> when<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.240> are

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
just keep that in mind when you are

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.320 
just keep that in mind when you are
trimming<00:02:14.370> also<00:02:15.370> since<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.790> was<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.030> first

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330
