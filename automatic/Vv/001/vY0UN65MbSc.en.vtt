00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
really really cool let's take a look at

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.380 
really really cool let's take a look at
the<00:00:24.600> colors<00:00:24.900> first<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.800> blue<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.490> spectacular

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the colors first the blue is spectacular

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.609 
the colors first the blue is spectacular
it<00:00:27.480> doesn't<00:00:27.660> really<00:00:27.750> make<00:00:27.930> sense<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.349> blood

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
it doesn't really make sense for blood

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.830 
it doesn't really make sense for blood
out<00:00:28.740> floor<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.730> everybody's<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.480> red<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
out floor like everybody's all red and

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
out floor like everybody's all red and
stuff<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:32.219> blue<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.059> one's<00:00:33.300> all

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
stuff but the blue and this one's all

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.030 
stuff but the blue and this one's all
right<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> blue<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.440> definitely<00:00:34.950> where

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
right but the blue is definitely where

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.709 
right but the blue is definitely where
it's<00:00:35.190> at<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.579> look<00:00:35.820> man<00:00:35.850> look<00:00:36.210> at<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.390> look

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
it's at like look man look at that look

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.420 
it's at like look man look at that look
at<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.870> ass<00:00:37.079> as<00:00:37.290> well<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:38.280> really

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
at that ass as well it's really

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.729 
at that ass as well it's really
impressive<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.960> compare<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
impressive you compare that to the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.709 
impressive you compare that to the
regular<00:00:41.489> skin<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> you'll<00:00:42.090> see<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.570> know<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
regular skin and you'll see you know a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.810 
regular skin and you'll see you know a
lot<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.110> differences<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> fact<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
lot of differences just the fact that

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.720 
lot of differences just the fact that
it's<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.180> night<00:00:45.360> elf<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.289> huge<00:00:46.950> difference<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
it's a night elf is a huge difference I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.630 
it's a night elf is a huge difference I
actually<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.829> vanilla<00:00:49.829> color<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.370> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
actually like the vanilla color but this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.420 
actually like the vanilla color but this
is<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:50.969> much<00:00:51.149> cooler<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.620> another<00:00:53.129> thing

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
is so much cooler and another thing

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
is so much cooler and another thing
about<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.820> scanner<00:00:54.090> right<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> hair

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
about the scanner right that the hair

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.049 
about the scanner right that the hair
changes<00:00:55.800> colors<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> an<00:00:56.550> intangible

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
changes colors this is an intangible

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.240 
changes colors this is an intangible
thing<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.170> need<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.469> work<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.800> because

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
thing that they need to work on because

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
thing that they need to work on because
when<00:00:59.789> you're<00:00:59.940> tinting<00:01:00.449> these<00:01:00.600> colors<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
when you're tinting these colors and the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.349 
when you're tinting these colors and the
hair<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.500> changing<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:01.980> well<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.820> happens<00:01:03.180> for

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
hair is changing as well it happens for

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.380 
hair is changing as well it happens for
both<00:01:03.510> kind<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.500> but<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.820> actually

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
both kind of but like this as actually

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.780 
both kind of but like this as actually

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
change much else except that but that is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
change much else except that but that is
huge<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.450> i'm<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> give<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
huge so because i'm going to give this a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.340 
huge so because i'm going to give this a
4<00:01:16.650> out<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> 5<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> very<00:01:18.509> good<00:01:18.630> value<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
4 out of 5 it's a very good value the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.080 
4 out of 5 it's a very good value the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
hair and like the quality of the color

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.410 
hair and like the quality of the color
change<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> price<00:01:22.460> 750<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.850> goes<00:01:24.060> up

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
change and the price 750 if this goes up

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.620 
change and the price 750 if this goes up
I<00:01:24.689> would<00:01:25.140> probably<00:01:25.290> drop<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.799> 3<00:01:26.100> 3.5<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.150> for

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I would probably drop it a 3 3.5 but for

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600 
I would probably drop it a 3 3.5 but for
now<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> value<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.500> too<00:01:28.770> high<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.280> it's

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
now the value is too high it's it's

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.429
