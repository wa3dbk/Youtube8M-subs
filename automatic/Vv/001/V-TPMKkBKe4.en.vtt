records<00:00:56.280> even<00:00:56.399> four<00:00:56.789> seconds<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.270> that's

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
records even four seconds so that's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.590 
records even four seconds so that's
crazy<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.430> then<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.609> also<00:00:59.730> got<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> pretty<00:01:00.390> good

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
crazy and then I also got a pretty good

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.920 
crazy and then I also got a pretty good
kill<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.170> krill<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:02.239> ten<00:01:03.239> seconds<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.719> well

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
