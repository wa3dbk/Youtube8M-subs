00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.660 
finally an option this time before I
move<00:01:07.720> on<00:01:07.869> any<00:01:08.170> further<00:01:08.439> a<00:01:08.619> small<00:01:09.159> side<00:01:09.430> note

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670

that I want to mention is that of the

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.440 
that I want to mention is that of the
new<00:01:11.439> speakers<00:01:11.890> they<00:01:12.640> are<00:01:12.790> noticeably<00:01:13.210> louder

new speakers they are noticeably louder

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.630 
new speakers they are noticeably louder
and<00:01:13.810> lest<00:01:14.049> any<00:01:14.320> than<00:01:14.530> before<00:01:14.650> which<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.340> good

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
and lest any than before which is a good

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.969 
and lest any than before which is a good
thing<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.970> course<00:01:16.409> overall<00:01:17.409> they<00:01:17.590> sound

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
thing of course overall they sound

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.920 
thing of course overall they sound
pretty<00:01:18.340> good<00:01:18.520> but<00:01:18.970> they<00:01:19.090> still<00:01:19.390> only<00:01:19.659> project

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
pretty good but they still only project

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.560 
pretty good but they still only project
sound<00:01:20.409> out<00:01:20.710> of<00:01:20.860> one<00:01:21.189> side<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.729> tablet<00:01:21.909> this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
sound out of one side of the tablet this

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.239 
sound out of one side of the tablet this
is<00:01:22.689> an<00:01:22.840> area<00:01:23.140> where<00:01:23.439> without<00:01:23.829> a<00:01:23.890> doubt<00:01:24.219> the

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:24.249 
is an area where without a doubt the

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:26.550 
is an area where without a doubt the
iPad<00:01:24.880> lacks<00:01:25.179> behind<00:01:25.570> its<00:01:25.689> competitors<00:01:26.320> and

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
iPad lacks behind its competitors and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.230 
iPad lacks behind its competitors and
another<00:01:27.189> thing<00:01:27.280> is<00:01:27.609> that<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.880> device

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
another thing is that the device

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.880 
another thing is that the device
actually<00:01:28.539> vibrates<00:01:29.350> when<00:01:29.590> you're<00:01:29.710> playing

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
actually vibrates when you're playing

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.709 
actually vibrates when you're playing
sound<00:01:30.219> out<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:30.759> I<00:01:31.119> assume<00:01:31.450> this<00:01:31.659> is

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
sound out of it and I assume this is

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.469 
sound out of it and I assume this is
because<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.530> added<00:01:32.679> bass<00:01:33.039> moving<00:01:34.030> on<00:01:34.179> I'm

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
because of the added bass moving on I'm

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.719 
because of the added bass moving on I'm
glad<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.140> say<00:01:35.289> that<00:01:35.499> the<00:01:35.619> screen<00:01:35.979> is<00:01:36.039> better

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
glad to say that the screen is better

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.819 
glad to say that the screen is better
too<00:01:37.030> although<00:01:37.719> I<00:01:37.749> didn't<00:01:38.079> see<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.380> retina<00:01:38.710> HD

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
too although I didn't see the retina HD

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.830 
too although I didn't see the retina HD
screen<00:01:39.429> I<00:01:39.460> was<00:01:39.700> hoping<00:01:40.030> for<00:01:40.090> there<00:01:40.509> are<00:01:40.630> still

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
screen I was hoping for there are still

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.469 
screen I was hoping for there are still
some<00:01:41.079> really<00:01:41.530> big<00:01:41.679> improvements<00:01:42.429> first<00:01:43.240> off

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
some really big improvements first off

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.450 
some really big improvements first off
there<00:01:43.780> isn't<00:01:44.079> an<00:01:44.170> air<00:01:44.350> gap<00:01:44.560> in<00:01:44.859> between<00:01:44.979> layers

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
there isn't an air gap in between layers
