that's probably what he got and I took

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.660 
that's probably what he got and I took
the<00:01:57.600> risk<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.130> after<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.159> looked<00:01:59.340> at<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the risk that after I looked at it I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.940 
the risk that after I looked at it I
figured<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.180> was<00:02:00.590> actually<00:02:01.590> cost<00:02:01.799> me

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
figured that it was actually cost me

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.499 
figured that it was actually cost me
more<00:02:02.130> than<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.280> thought<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.579> would<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:02.850> anyway

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
more than I thought it would but anyway

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.719 
more than I thought it would but anyway
it<00:02:03.570> wasn't<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:04.049> wasn't<00:02:04.200> all<00:02:04.380> too<00:02:04.530> bad<00:02:04.729> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
it wasn't it wasn't all too bad the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.639 
it wasn't it wasn't all too bad the
whole<00:02:05.880> cooling<00:02:06.360> systems<00:02:07.759> bought<00:02:09.649> replaced
