00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.690 
was like $20 for like six feet so all
right<00:02:46.860> well<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:47.910> if<00:02:48.060> right<00:02:48.270> now<00:02:49.700> signing

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
right well this is if right now signing

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.170 
right well this is if right now signing
off

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
off

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.470 
off
so<00:02:51.690> basically<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.200> already<00:02:52.440> cut<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:53.300> four<00:02:54.300> piece

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
so basically I already cut a four piece

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.940 
so basically I already cut a four piece
of<00:02:54.630> angle<00:02:54.720> iron<00:02:54.930> which<00:02:55.230> are<00:02:55.380> like<00:02:55.500> twenty<00:02:55.800> nine

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
of angle iron which are like twenty nine

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.090 
of angle iron which are like twenty nine
and<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.160> half<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:57.810> got<00:02:58.080> one<00:02:58.290> there<00:02:58.530> one

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
and a half and you got one there one

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.160 
and a half and you got one there one
here<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.670> then<00:03:00.239> again<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.480> got<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.840> another

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
here and then again you got to another

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.250 
here and then again you got to another
on<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> other<00:03:01.650> side<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.569> got<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.870> line<00:03:04.080> on

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
on the other side and I got that line on

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.309 
on the other side and I got that line on
the<00:03:04.290> back<00:03:04.530> which<00:03:04.799> is<00:03:04.830> level<00:03:05.600> with<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.630> front<00:03:07.080> end

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
the back which is level with a front end

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.449 
the back which is level with a front end
you<00:03:07.700> know<00:03:08.700> over<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.510> girl<00:03:09.720> right<00:03:09.870> here<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
you know over the girl right here so the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.479 
you know over the girl right here so the
next<00:03:11.700> step<00:03:11.970> would<00:03:12.180> be<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.709> tack<00:03:13.709> each<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
next step would be to tack each and

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.490 
next step would be to tack each and
wiring<00:03:14.880> on<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.209> side<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:17.489> basically<00:03:18.440> put<00:03:19.440> it

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
wiring on one side and basically put it

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.320 
wiring on one side and basically put it
at<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.680> same<00:03:19.920> height<00:03:20.190> as<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.459> or<00:03:20.819> slightly

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
at the same height as this or slightly

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.570 
at the same height as this or slightly
above<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.680> when<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:22.920> slide<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> grates

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
above it that when you slide the grates

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.199 
above it that when you slide the grates
it<00:03:23.850> won't<00:03:24.000> be<00:03:24.209> hitting<00:03:24.450> or<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.870> stuck<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.940> tack

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
it won't be hitting or in stuck and tack

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.229 
it won't be hitting or in stuck and tack
them<00:03:27.239> on<00:03:27.450> one<00:03:27.630> place<00:03:28.760> double<00:03:29.760> check<00:03:29.970> was<00:03:30.120> your

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
them on one place double check was your

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.000 
them on one place double check was your
level<00:03:30.420> kinda<00:03:31.290> like<00:03:31.380> put<00:03:31.560> your<00:03:31.709> level<00:03:31.920> on<00:03:31.980> top

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
level kinda like put your level on top

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.460 
level kinda like put your level on top
like<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:34.280> also<00:03:35.840> get<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:37.109> close<00:03:37.320> as

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
like that and also get it as close as

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.580 
like that and also get it as close as
you<00:03:37.530> can<00:03:37.739> when<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.010> square<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.840> then<00:03:40.380> from

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you can when you square it and then from

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.530 
you can when you square it and then from
there<00:03:40.739> once<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.070> got<00:03:41.220> all<00:03:41.370> these<00:03:41.880> tack<00:03:42.150> on<00:03:42.329> one

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
there once you got all these tack on one

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.599 
there once you got all these tack on one
side<00:03:42.810> just<00:03:43.170> go<00:03:43.620> back<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.220> other<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
side just go back to the other the

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.569 
side just go back to the other the
opposite<00:03:45.090> end<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:46.070> double-check<00:03:47.070> Harriton

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
opposite end and double-check Harriton

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.050 
opposite end and double-check Harriton
square<00:03:48.359> them<00:03:48.510> off<00:03:48.630> level<00:03:49.260> them<00:03:49.380> off<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.060> tack

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
square them off level them off and tack

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.970 
square them off level them off and tack
them<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.480> then<00:03:51.630> once<00:03:52.440> you're<00:03:52.620> happy<00:03:52.739> just

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
a thickness on this angle iron and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.710 
a thickness on this angle iron and
quarter<00:04:40.320> inch<00:04:40.500> on<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.490> bottom<00:04:41.760> frame<00:04:43.370> and
