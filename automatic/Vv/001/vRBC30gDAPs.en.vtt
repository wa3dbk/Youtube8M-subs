well how's it going guys I know it's

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.980 
well how's it going guys I know it's
been<00:00:12.580> a<00:00:12.670> while<00:00:12.849> since<00:00:13.090> I<00:00:13.269> did<00:00:13.300> a<00:00:13.450> layout<00:00:13.690> update

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
been a while since I did a layout update

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.550 
been a while since I did a layout update
I<00:00:14.559> haven't<00:00:15.340> done<00:00:15.460> a<00:00:15.519> lot<00:00:15.820> but<00:00:16.420> over<00:00:17.200> the<00:00:17.320> summer

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
I haven't done a lot but over the summer

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.740 
I haven't done a lot but over the summer
I<00:00:17.740> did<00:00:18.099> do<00:00:18.310> some<00:00:18.550> ground<00:00:18.849> cover<00:00:19.180> and<00:00:19.480> scenery

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
I did do some ground cover and scenery

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.339 
I did do some ground cover and scenery
in<00:00:20.079> the<00:00:20.230> yard<00:00:20.500> area<00:00:20.739> here<00:00:21.250> and<00:00:22.210> as<00:00:23.079> I<00:00:23.200> was

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
in the yard area here and as I was

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.679 
in the yard area here and as I was
working<00:00:23.739> on<00:00:23.860> that<00:00:24.070> pulling<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:25.090> engines<00:00:25.509> in

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
working on that pulling the engines in

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.889 
working on that pulling the engines in
and<00:00:25.840> out<00:00:25.960> of<00:00:26.230> the<00:00:26.590> yard<00:00:26.829> I<00:00:27.270> noticed<00:00:28.270> that<00:00:28.689> the

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:28.899 
and out of the yard I noticed that the

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.049 
and out of the yard I noticed that the
command<00:00:29.259> control<00:00:29.770> engines<00:00:30.309> were<00:00:30.460> not<00:00:30.610> working

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059 
command control engines were not working

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.090 
command control engines were not working
too<00:00:31.239> well<00:00:31.270> they<00:00:32.200> were<00:00:32.259> getting<00:00:32.470> hung<00:00:32.770> up<00:00:32.920> at

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
too well they were getting hung up at

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.520 
too well they were getting hung up at
certain<00:00:33.370> points<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:33.910> lights<00:00:34.120> were<00:00:34.359> blinking

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
certain points and lights were blinking

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.189 
certain points and lights were blinking
and<00:00:35.699> further<00:00:36.699> investigation<00:00:37.570> revealed<00:00:37.600> that

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
and further investigation revealed that

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.290 
and further investigation revealed that
this<00:00:38.440> was<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.649> ground<00:00:39.010> plane<00:00:39.250> issue<00:00:39.609> with<00:00:40.059> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
this was a ground plane issue with the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.630 
this was a ground plane issue with the
lion<00:00:40.629> LT<00:00:41.050> mcc<00:00:41.879> command<00:00:42.879> control<00:00:43.269> system<00:00:44.640> so

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
lion LT mcc command control system so

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.930 
lion LT mcc command control system so
what<00:00:46.269> I<00:00:46.300> did<00:00:46.539> to<00:00:46.690> solve<00:00:46.929> this<00:00:47.199> was<00:00:47.589> I<00:00:47.949> took<00:00:48.399> a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
what I did to solve this was I took a

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.729 
what I did to solve this was I took a
piece<00:00:49.570> of<00:00:49.600> wire<00:00:50.109> and<00:00:50.140> attached<00:00:50.739> it<00:00:51.039> to<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
piece of wire and attached it to the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.560 
piece of wire and attached it to the
ground<00:00:53.850> plane<00:00:54.850> in<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.300> house<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.890> my<00:00:57.010> conduit

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
ground plane in the house to my conduit

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.529 
ground plane in the house to my conduit
and<00:00:58.570> I<00:00:59.440> ran<00:00:59.649> it<00:00:59.800> up<00:00:59.949> through<00:01:00.819> the<00:01:00.940> layout<00:01:01.269> on<00:01:01.510> a

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
and I ran it up through the layout on a

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.929 
and I ran it up through the layout on a
telephone<00:01:01.899> pole<00:01:02.350> on<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.559> wire<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:05.729> took<00:01:06.729> these

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
telephone pole on a wire and took these

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.380 
telephone pole on a wire and took these
this<00:01:07.390> wire<00:01:07.689> and<00:01:08.079> strung<00:01:08.409> it<00:01:08.560> across<00:01:08.950> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
this wire and strung it across the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.270 
this wire and strung it across the
layout<00:01:10.409> where<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.560> engines<00:01:11.890> were<00:01:12.040> having

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
layout where the engines were having

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.929 
layout where the engines were having
trouble<00:01:12.640> and<00:01:12.880> this<00:01:13.540> seemed<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.899> fix<00:01:14.170> it<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.790> it

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
trouble and this seemed to fix it but it

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.819 
trouble and this seemed to fix it but it
didn't<00:01:16.149> look<00:01:16.240> too<00:01:16.479> good<00:01:16.509> having<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.409> wire<00:01:17.590> lay

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
didn't look too good having a wire lay

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.340 
didn't look too good having a wire lay
in<00:01:17.890> there<00:01:18.189> so<00:01:18.549> I<00:01:18.790> put<00:01:19.180> up<00:01:19.270> these<00:01:19.780> telephone

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
in there so I put up these telephone

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.359 
in there so I put up these telephone
poles<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:22.350> strung<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.469> wire<00:01:23.619> across<00:01:23.920> that

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
poles and strung the wire across that

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.429 
poles and strung the wire across that
and<00:01:24.820> hot<00:01:25.060> glued<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.930> some<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.380> the

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
and hot glued it to some of the

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.160 
and hot glued it to some of the
insulators<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.420> eventually<00:01:28.420> terminated<00:01:29.049> it

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
insulators and eventually terminated it

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.480 
insulators and eventually terminated it
over<00:01:29.409> here<00:01:29.710> at<00:01:30.130> this<00:01:30.700> Kaline<00:01:31.270> transformer

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.130 

after<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:36.520> did<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:36.820> there<00:01:37.210> weren't<00:01:37.360> really<00:01:37.840> no

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
after I did that there weren't really no

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.440 
after I did that there weren't really no
problems<00:01:38.740> with<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.790> command<00:01:40.120> control

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
problems with the command control

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.250 
problems with the command control
engines<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:40.990> see<00:01:41.200> here<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:42.870> this<00:01:43.870> is<00:01:44.110> just

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
engines you see here and this is just

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.220

some<00:01:44.470> more<00:01:44.710> video<00:01:45.700> now<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.630> ground<00:01:49.900> cover

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
some more video now of the ground cover

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.880 
some more video now of the ground cover
some<00:01:50.800> little<00:01:51.130> rocks<00:01:51.370> i<00:01:51.610> put<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:52.710> some<00:01:53.710> of<00:01:53.800> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
some little rocks i put in some of the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.160 
some little rocks i put in some of the
stones<00:01:54.160> and<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.610> grassy<00:01:55.090> areas<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.930> go<00:01:59.050> ahead

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
stones and the grassy areas so go ahead

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.680

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
it's just different angles of the yard

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.430 
it's just different angles of the yard
area<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:06.030> maybe<00:02:07.030> i'll<00:02:07.210> be<00:02:07.240> back<00:02:07.570> with<00:02:08.229> some
