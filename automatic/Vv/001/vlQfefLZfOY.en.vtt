00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.860
 Here is everything from samsung on 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.719
 the ces in las vegas on the way and here 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.369
 a small look into the future 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.900
 because this is the 3d tv wehr again 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.789
 So it's really new 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.080
 look into the future but left here 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.580
 really interesting where at the moment is 3d 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.590
 just do not mind the glasses 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.060
 father then there is still polarization 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.380
 everything is different for good 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.000
 the eyes that press a contract 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.990
 their less and that 's just always like that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.160
 a thing and here is the whole 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.899
 number then really interesting because 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.649
 we have a dollar / usd tv here 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.809
 50 inches 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.180
 so you have without glasses 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.290
 needs the 3d effect that does that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.610
 Creations you something in the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.059
 pixel structure changes you do not know 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.620
 exactly 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.690
 and then actually has broken if I have 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.649
 now watch it I see completely 3g s 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.219
 is because you can, of course, difficult 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.440
 capture 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.390
 but that is above all together and one 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.010
 usually mostly calculated 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.020
 then somehow certain points in the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.270
 room where this 3d effect 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.550
 works and there was 76 so far 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.870
 67 points and then of course that's how it is 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.189
 a cause because then more people 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.090
 coming in to the room from any 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.700
 other corners and then works 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.740
 not so often with the lord of over 35 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.689
 points sweet spots where this 3d 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.950
 effect for the eyes works because 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.479
 you look at it that's it 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.030
 fascinating what is possible of him 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.090
 with hd 3d this is already crazy or 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.700
 krams if you have a tomato now 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.200
 a 3 d film counteracts the effect 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.430
 is pretty impressive but so 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.380
 say that the pictures are straight for me 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.720
 slightly jerky it is probably because 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.009
 that you just reproduce usd content 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.119
 and that's really study here so 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.950
 this is a technology in the lakes 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.520
 34 years are the earliest wishes 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.439
 market value that's yes I say so 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.030
 3d could actually be back on brands 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.600
 it is always as much a thing as the whole 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.130
 then looks 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.170
 Here you do not look at that is in 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.360
 flat panel so not all this power 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.520
 Now someone is really very popular 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.079
 this technique is already behind it 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.490
 really interesting, however, by 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.689
 that you have so many different sweet ones 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.680
 I've just used the spots 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.870
 impression that the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.700
 hd resolution is not really the case 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.840
 because you just set up the pixel so 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.520
 that's because of different 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.020
 works and then you do not have for 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.000
 every point just the resolution 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.170
 interesting future technology there 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.820
 I think sometime comes with it 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.470
 then also 3d back I have this one 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.850
 short overview you liked that 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.070
 is a prototype on the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.450
 Always save the market as a child 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.160
 Maybe five years or maybe start 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.750
 three four years at least and then 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.300
 it is the work guaranteed low 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.709
 but is otherwise us on YouTube 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.120
 Subscribe here to what's there now 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.860
 comes with a lot of videos 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.750
 many interesting things in this respect 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.520
 It is definitely worth something and 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.480
 samsung otherwise you look at the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.480
 days back blank
