suspension<00:01:14.430> I'm<00:01:14.970> thinking<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:15.450> getting

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
suspension I'm thinking about getting

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.460 
suspension I'm thinking about getting
the<00:01:16.500> triangulated<00:01:17.070> four-link<00:01:17.450> system<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the triangulated four-link system with a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.410 
the triangulated four-link system with a
Ford<00:01:19.770> nine-inch<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.400> coil<00:01:20.580> over<00:01:20.820> shocks<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
Ford nine-inch and coil over shocks and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.780 
Ford nine-inch and coil over shocks and
the<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.590> bars<00:01:22.799> attached<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> frame<00:01:23.640> I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the the bars attached to the frame I

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.160 
the the bars attached to the frame I
didn't<00:01:23.970> want<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> replace<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.720> rear<00:01:24.900> frame

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
didn't want to replace the rear frame

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
didn't want to replace the rear frame
rails<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:27.360> hoping<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.640> that'll<00:01:29.640> work

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
rails so I'm hoping that that'll work

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.429 
rails so I'm hoping that that'll work
because<00:01:30.570> we're<00:01:30.720> gonna<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> change<00:01:31.290> these

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
because we're gonna have to change these

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.920 
because we're gonna have to change these
floors<00:01:31.710> anyway<00:01:32.130> my<00:01:32.310> concern<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:32.939> this

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
floors anyway my concern is that this

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.050 
floors anyway my concern is that this
cars<00:01:34.320> gonna<00:01:34.470> sit<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> lot<00:01:34.920> lower<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> rear

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
cars gonna sit a lot lower and the rear

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.149 
cars gonna sit a lot lower and the rear
end<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.570> tucked<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
end is going to be tucked up and the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.590 
end is going to be tucked up and the
tunnel<00:01:38.460> isn't<00:01:38.579> gonna<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:38.939> big<00:01:39.119> enough<00:01:39.240> here

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
tunnel isn't gonna be big enough here

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.010 
tunnel isn't gonna be big enough here
for<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.840> driveshaft<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.689> actually

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
for the driveshaft so it's actually

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.300 
for the driveshaft so it's actually
probably<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.380> good<00:01:43.530> thing<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.009> floor<00:01:44.220> is

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
probably a good thing that the floor is

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.319 
probably a good thing that the floor is
rotting<00:01:44.579> because<00:01:44.729> we're<00:01:44.850> gonna<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
rotting because we're gonna have to

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.990 
rotting because we're gonna have to
replace<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.659> anyway<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.829> get<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.189> drive

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
replace that anyway to get the drive

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.149 
replace that anyway to get the drive
shaft<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.450> clear<00:01:50.930> nice<00:01:51.930> hitch<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.799> big

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
shaft it clear nice hitch to a big

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.990 
shaft it clear nice hitch to a big
trailer<00:01:53.939> hitch<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.299> there<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.670> yeah<00:01:56.820> that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
trailer hitch on there so yeah that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.499 
trailer hitch on there so yeah that
should<00:01:57.210> all<00:01:57.560> work<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.710> okay<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.329> want<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> use

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
should all work out okay I want to use

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.499 
should all work out okay I want to use
this<00:02:00.719> existing<00:02:01.290> crossmember<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.390> for<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
this existing crossmember here for the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.999 
this existing crossmember here for the
coil<00:02:03.990> over<00:02:04.170> shocks

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.620 

but<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.670> don't<00:02:08.850> really<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.060> room<00:02:09.360> for<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
but we don't really have room for a

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.440 
but we don't really have room for a
bigger<00:02:09.840> tire<00:02:10.170> back<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.740> either<00:02:10.890> because<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
bigger tire back here either because the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.340 
bigger tire back here either because the
body<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:13.340> right<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:15.660> know<00:02:15.780> three<00:02:16.080> inches

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
body is right in you know three inches

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.320 
body is right in you know three inches
past<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.010> frame<00:02:17.250> rail<00:02:17.490> there<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:17.940> was<00:02:18.090> even

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
past the frame rail there if it was even

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330 
past the frame rail there if it was even
with<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.569> frame<00:02:18.810> rail<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.950> wheel<00:02:20.100> tub

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
with the frame rail like the wheel tub

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.630 
with the frame rail like the wheel tub
then<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.730> could<00:02:20.880> fit<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> big<00:02:21.330> tire<00:02:21.569> in<00:02:21.720> here<00:02:21.930> so

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
then we could fit a big tire in here so

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.130 
then we could fit a big tire in here so
well<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> decided<00:02:23.910> yet<00:02:24.390> what<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.600> do<00:02:24.840> there

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
well I decided yet what to do there

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.559 
well I decided yet what to do there
about<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.800> floor<00:02:26.069> it'd<00:02:26.220> be<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> lot<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.209> work<00:02:27.360> to

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
about the floor it'd be a lot of work to

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.309 
about the floor it'd be a lot of work to
widen<00:02:28.290> those<00:02:28.500> tubs<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.209> then<00:02:30.209> try<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.020> get<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
widen those tubs and then try to get the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.190 
widen those tubs and then try to get the
rear<00:02:31.470> seat<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.830> fit<00:02:32.040> too<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.750> right<00:02:36.900> now<00:02:37.050> I'm

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
and I can start measuring and cutting

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.229 
and I can start measuring and cutting

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.850 
heads apart here just to check things
out<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.600> know<00:03:03.750> they<00:03:03.930> had<00:03:04.080> new<00:03:04.260> valves<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.769> them

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
out I know they had new valves in them

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.949 
out I know they had new valves in them
before<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.310> last<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:06.090> think<00:03:06.600> there's<00:03:06.780> like

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
before the last I think there's like

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.860 
before the last I think there's like
three<00:03:07.410> races<00:03:07.890> on<00:03:08.040> these<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.510> valves<00:03:09.780> are

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
three races on these so the valves are

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.270 
three races on these so the valves are
brand<00:03:10.080> new<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.560> just<00:03:10.800> want<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.010> take<00:03:11.160> things

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
brand new so I just want to take things

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.650 
brand new so I just want to take things
apart<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.820> have<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.940> look<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.360> make<00:03:12.480> sure

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
apart and have a look to make sure

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.770 
apart and have a look to make sure
there's<00:03:12.870> no<00:03:13.160> damage<00:03:14.160> seats<00:03:14.700> or<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.329> know<00:03:15.450> burp

everything looks to be in good shape
actually<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.299> was<00:03:21.510> looking<00:03:21.600> in<00:03:21.840> these<00:03:21.930> ports

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
actually I was looking in these ports

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.860 
actually I was looking in these ports
and<00:03:22.470> there's<00:03:22.620> some<00:03:22.970> ridges<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.120> stuff<00:03:24.360> in

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
and there's some ridges and stuff in

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.699 
and there's some ridges and stuff in
there<00:03:25.489> just<00:03:26.489> like<00:03:26.700> not<00:03:26.880> on<00:03:29.209> shitty<00:03:30.209> late<00:03:30.709> but

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
there just like not on shitty late but

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.039 
there just like not on shitty late but
it<00:03:32.010> could<00:03:32.220> actually<00:03:32.370> be<00:03:32.760> cleaned<00:03:33.660> up<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.930> little

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
it could actually be cleaned up a little

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.750 
it could actually be cleaned up a little
bit<00:03:34.290> maybe<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.620> little<00:03:34.890> bit<00:03:35.070> more<00:03:35.190> flow<00:03:35.489> out<00:03:35.640> of

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
bit maybe a little bit more flow out of

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.120 
bit maybe a little bit more flow out of
them<00:03:36.140> so<00:03:37.140> our<00:03:37.260> my<00:03:37.410> cleaning<00:03:37.769> is<00:03:37.829> up<00:03:37.980> really

wheels and see if I can get those heads

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.330 
wheels and see if I can get those heads
to<00:03:43.380> flow<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.620> little<00:03:43.769> bit<00:03:43.980> better

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340
