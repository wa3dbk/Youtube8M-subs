and Myrtle Beach around noon or shortly

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.599 
and Myrtle Beach around noon or shortly
thereafter<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.949> let's<00:00:23.220> take<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> look<00:00:23.490> at<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
thereafter so let's take a look at the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.980 
thereafter so let's take a look at the
satellite<00:00:23.820> picture<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.869> can

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
satellite picture for you and you can

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.259 
satellite picture for you and you can
see<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.289> storm<00:00:25.619> moving<00:00:25.890> its<00:00:26.130> way<00:00:26.279> slowly<00:00:26.849> but

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
see the storm moving its way slowly but

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.580 
see the storm moving its way slowly but
surely<00:00:27.300> up<00:00:27.779> towards<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> coast<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
surely up towards the coast of the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.349 
surely up towards the coast of the
Carolinas<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> center<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.119> circulation

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
Carolinas and the center of circulation

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.170 
Carolinas and the center of circulation
is<00:00:31.050> right<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.520> noticed<00:00:33.000> yesterday

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
is right here and we noticed yesterday

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.470 
is right here and we noticed yesterday
westerly<00:00:34.110> winds<00:00:34.320> were<00:00:34.739> shearing<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:35.850> pushing

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
westerly winds were shearing or pushing

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.209 
westerly winds were shearing or pushing
all<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.140> heavy<00:00:37.350> rain<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.680> thunderstorms

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
all the heavy rain and thunderstorms

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.790 
all the heavy rain and thunderstorms
well<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.510> east<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> center<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.649> this

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
well to the east of the center so this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.830 
well to the east of the center so this
storm<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.370> not<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.850> strengthening<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.420> it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
storm will not be strengthening as it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.650 
storm will not be strengthening as it
continues<00:00:43.440> its<00:00:43.680> slower<00:00:44.040> trudge<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:45.149> towards

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
continues its slower trudge up towards

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.270 
continues its slower trudge up towards
the<00:00:45.840> coast<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.829> we're<00:00:46.980> looking<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
