 automatically with our android emulator 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.049
 Next, we need a white 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.749

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:03.319

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.549
 directly into the folder 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:12.120
 where does the android sdk want to install 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.700
 namely have here 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.739
 there we see the file agb the pull 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.360

 give a blank in seoul 1 again 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.299
 and now drag the apk file in here 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:43.280
 inter that was it already now 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.959
 the app will be installed 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.700
 we see the message starts it now 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.700
 Let's have a look here and see 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:04.769
 we see here it is in one click 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:08.819
 starts can you actually having to 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.950
 make any apps and so on 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.060
 test apps before they finally hit your 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.510
 smartphone plays on or easily 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.510
 certainly useful 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:33.290

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.290

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:52.410
 I did not want to go on it 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.030
 click and now we can actually 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.769
 already started as we said we can 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.419
 Testing apps right makes sense when we do that 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.819
 want to uninstall whole again 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.980

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.389
 go into the application here 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.930
 so again and just click the 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:18.320
 menu button and now we go often 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.320
 Manager 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.880

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.180
