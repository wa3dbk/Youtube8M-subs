00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.570
 everyone knows at the high I hope that 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.100
 you are well then we are 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.879
 today not for a presentation of 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.509
 snapshot 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:21.540
 but for a summary of minecraft 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:25.770
 1.5 and then small lips that 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.119
 rumors about the 1.6 so already 1.5 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.880
 he said he would not leave the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.890
 meadow either last friday or thursday 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.710
 last but they did not do it because 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.940
 they announced that would not go out the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.470
 take not simple as we 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.250
 will not have solved all the bugs of 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.410
 crash and the bugs on the red stone we 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.010
 it rests suddenly this pre release is 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.360
 71.5 at a later date so that's 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.960
 for that they came out the other 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.540
 Hierges if I'm not mistaken the a13 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.240
 double 09 is that they include that 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.740
 bug fixes and maybe some 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.630
 snapshot feeling later with 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.450
 others because bugs actions so they 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.350
 will be 35 hrs pm and the stone bundles 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.890
 to get out the meadow 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.820
 but we already know that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.530
 e 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.870
 we still know that it will be released in the month 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.190
 of march because the face they make it 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.700
 too late 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.380
 March we are here on March 2, 2013 so 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.450
 therefore should not delay the week 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.810
 next time the mans I think in 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.030
 two weeks so that's like 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.290
 first to the meadow and then the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.910
 definitive version 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.570
 so it will unfortunately still need 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.570
 wait 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.990
 and there unconscious but matching that one 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.810
 already talking about the 1.6 and yes because jobs has 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.030
 already unveiled info like what gives 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.429
 a weight 6 there will be new mob 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.469
 we do not know what but there is 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.209
 will be new then for a year it's 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.119
 live who did it we could see 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.829
 and they took a screenshot not they 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.219
 have found to register and several 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.420
 May horse screenshots 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.670
 to the creatures he had in his 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.489
 files so if we play a little bit we 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.530
 can distinguish horses see her on 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:13.459
 the hind legs and where so maybe 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.040
 that gm will add us for 11.6 of 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.110
 horses and yes will know 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.760
 because if we look closely sends it the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.580
 hedges 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.700
 and how to say small screenshot 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.099
 photos d 1.6 1.5 rather with the by 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.769
 example the quartz blocks and others 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.790
 little things so we can hope in 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.860
 point 6 horses and yes so that's it 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.319
 do not know but in any case what is sure 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.610
 is that there will be new mob is 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.190
 also imprinted syst 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.890
 It is we saw this screenshot was 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.409
 unveiled a new straw block so 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.500
 maybe a bag but we do not count 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.180
 rather 1.6 and a straw blue that will be 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.760
 will do like a block of gold or diamond 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.829
 but had that straw fire at this 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.319
 will give us this on all of the roofs 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.329
 stubble if brown not bad and even the 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:09.579
 guys to put them through like those 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:11.409
 ci like the sleds so horses times his 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.260
 sas coordinates so you never know 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.780
 maybe we do not know we know 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.269
 also there will be for the 1.6 again 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.530
 launcher so the launcher is when 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.040
 even the interface when you near 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.230
 Minecraft 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.230
 you'll have you oin and Vassas 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.000
 if he's going to change so here's that cracked salt 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.900
 I do not know but in any case there is 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.100
 will have a new launcher 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.660
 There will also be 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.580
 minecraft online which is a function 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.800
 which makes it possible to make servers for 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.440
 beginners that's where there is no 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.540
 pluvign touch what and so for them 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.550
 beginners that we have nothing to jack could 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.280
 test this feature in point 5 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.660
 may with the snapshots same structure to 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.620
 1.6 probably so that's for the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.760
 some rumors of the 1.6 but dies and 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.110
 truth also because because the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.870
 words count is that there will be two names 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.810
 at mob l we also retain probably 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.250
 end of May so we still have time but 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.350
 good it was next year that shifted 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.240
 will also shift that so maybe 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.890
 early June earlier so that's so 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.489
 that's all for this little video 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:21.320
 information 1.5 and 1.6 and I will 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.640
 not remind of time 1.5 update 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.070
 that they will not have to correct all 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.920
 the crash and sow bugs and the bugs of 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.350
 lara stone in stone for a sail 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.090
 been the daytime experience they want 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.360
 also try to correct a maximum of 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.760
 bugs 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.300
 so we will not have your ass right now 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.800
 to wait and sneaky snapshot 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.930
 so I hope this video does not 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.180
 will have more republic and the team do not hesitate 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.659
 not to leave a green thumb commented 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.229
 in the sense that you have brokers 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.229
 and we end up
