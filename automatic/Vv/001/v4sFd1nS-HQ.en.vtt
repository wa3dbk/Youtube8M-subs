so this next drill is called stroke

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.130 
so this next drill is called stroke
release<00:00:02.730> this<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.540> when<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.750> ball<00:00:03.959> is

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140

position if you notice is leading hand

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.310 
position if you notice is leading hand
once<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.880> establish<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.540> position<00:00:12.990> shows

away<00:00:25.170> from<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> peeterman<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:27.090> allows<00:00:27.390> you

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
away from the peeterman this allows you

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.370 
away from the peeterman this allows you
not<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> keep<00:00:28.050> gravity<00:00:29.929> and<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> underwater

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
not to keep gravity and the underwater

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
not to keep gravity and the underwater
camera<00:00:31.740> you'll<00:00:31.920> also<00:00:32.099> notice<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.640> our<00:00:32.700> body

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
camera you'll also notice that our body

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.910 
camera you'll also notice that our body
position<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.630> almost<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.110> 45<00:00:34.530> degree<00:00:34.559> angle

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
position is almost at a 45 degree angle

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.830 
position is almost at a 45 degree angle
so<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.550> he<00:00:35.640> doesn't<00:00:35.969> lose<00:00:36.059> contact<00:00:36.390> at<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
so if he doesn't lose contact at the
