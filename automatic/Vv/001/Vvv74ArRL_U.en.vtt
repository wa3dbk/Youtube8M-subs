00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.109

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.910
 title urgent notice closing of channels and 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.040
 if it's something I want to talk to you about 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.900
 today because recently by 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.879
 These dates have been closed several 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.680
 channels whether channels are small channels 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.900
 large but they have closed enough 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.070
 channels because the reason I do not know about 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.830
 done if you can remember 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.170
 recently the youtube channel like this 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.779
 that the one who uploads absurd tutorials 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.730
 had been closed for a little while and 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.710
 then they opened it again but there 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.500
 smaller channels like my 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.410
 friend frank mx that unfortunately not 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.930
 they can reopen them not at least not 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.790
 they pay as much attention as they give 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.400
 the biggest ones then in this video 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.350
 I wanted to talk to you a little about this and in 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.180
 if it happens that god does not 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.280
 he wants you to close this channel 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.440
 well what are we going to do not good more than 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.940
 nothing mainly good in the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.820
 description of this video I'm going to 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.200
 leave so in the front line they will see that 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.810
 part of cheap games but fair 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.000
 after that I'm going to put what's going 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.640
 doing my secondary channel so that 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.590
 to subscribe and the day that is not 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.030
 nobody wants it can be I arrived in the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.070
 closed this channel or anything 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.800
 can pass that hopefully and nothing happens 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.930
 just go to that channel and there 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.369
 You can see some explanation and you can 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.250
 keep watching the videos that are 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.020
 accustomed and accustomed to seeing 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.580
 closed several channels that like that 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.590
 take time to open them again in fact 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.690
 recently the channel was closed 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.220
 Dominguez live an English youtuber 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.869
 big pauted that many 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.090
 leaks and some little things 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.830
 big cars and it has not been reopened 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.830
 so that's why I tell you more than anything 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.229
 subscribe to this channel because there 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.270
 they can be much more attentive not 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.500
 currently in this channel I'm not 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.090
 uploading many gameplays in fact 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.950
 I want from the new year you can 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.630
 be going up in English there and it was more 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.920
 that nothing what I wanted to say no 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.200
 that went through this channel 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.300
 currently from that channel I think I have 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.429
 almost four thousand subscribers so 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.140
 subscribe as for anything 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.300
 because there they can be attentive because the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.039
 day that something happens that can happen 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.110
 never arrive that day but well 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.390
 avoid anything if it's someone who 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.190
 you always have to be careful and then 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.200
 if something happens to me, then this 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.610
 video I could not see it and there would not be 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.380
 way to like you 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.900
 I could tell you or warn you of any 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.790
 so that we could do so 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.890

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.870
