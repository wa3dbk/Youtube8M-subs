 Sports car and at the same time consciously waived 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.949
 Both combine the Porsche Cayenne 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.910
 Off-road clearance can be increased to around 27 meters 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.519
 by disengaging the stabilizers and calls and rear axle entangles the 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.609
 Porsche even more and is suitable for the heaviest terrain 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.199
 The speed of the shipowner is through multi-plate clutch 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.200
 gets boring 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.930
 adapted optimally to the respective fraction of the subsoil 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.640
 But I am in the interior space around the large warehouse volume 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.640
 make the galleries a combo for every purpose 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.710
 the Porsche Cayenne 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.170
 it combines extreme performance in a previously unseen form 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 permanent all-wheel drive last year + ground clearance 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.110
 and traction control make it fully off-road capable 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.689
 in the street 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.559
 falls the excellent chassis 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:17.229
 d &amp; b's strong and heavy all-wheel-drive back on track 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.489
 five full seats and a lot but not too 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.739
 make the wedge 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.289
 Firstly, they are suitable for everyday use 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:28.109
 Porsche come 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.109
 the starting price of 48 thousand euros 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.529
 it is compared to similar vehicles of this class 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:36.909
 Dugard still relatively cheap
