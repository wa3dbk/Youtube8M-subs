motor<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.530> would<00:00:46.620> work<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.280> out<00:00:47.460> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
motor that would work and it's out of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.240 
motor that would work and it's out of
Toyotas<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.809> bunch<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.140> Toyotas<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.860> know<00:00:50.010> from

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
Toyotas a bunch of Toyotas you know from

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.200 
Toyotas a bunch of Toyotas you know from
like<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:51.780> 90s<00:00:52.230> through<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.590> 2000s<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:54.059> also

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
like the 90s through the 2000s it's also

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.510 
like the 90s through the 2000s it's also
unlike<00:00:54.719> Geo<00:00:54.930> Metro<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.710> things<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
unlike Geo Metro and things like that so

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.729 
unlike Geo Metro and things like that so
I<00:00:56.550> got<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.910> model<00:00:57.390> though<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.469> search<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
I got a model though I'm in search of

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:23.250 
I got a model though I'm in search of
that<00:00:59.219> should<00:00:59.789> fit<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.270> my<00:01:00.390> door

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.780 

and<00:01:24.260> so<00:01:24.950> we<00:01:25.100> wound<00:01:25.310> up<00:01:25.490> with<00:01:25.810> two<00:01:27.640> motors<00:01:28.640> out

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
and so we wound up with two motors out

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.060 
and so we wound up with two motors out
of<00:01:28.910> a<00:01:28.970> 99<00:01:29.420> Toyota<00:01:29.870> for<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.260> windows<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.890> left

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
of a 99 Toyota for the windows the left

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.750 
of a 99 Toyota for the windows the left
and<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.310> right

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
and a right

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.640 
and a right
these<00:01:32.180> are<00:01:32.360> rear<00:01:32.600> motors<00:01:33.140> but<00:01:33.380> I<00:01:33.410> think

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
these are rear motors but I think

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.840 
these are rear motors but I think
they're<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.890> same<00:01:34.040> as<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.310> front<00:01:34.460> ones<00:01:34.729> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
they're the same as the front ones the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.340 
they're the same as the front ones the
front<00:01:35.060> ones<00:01:35.240> were<00:01:35.360> gone<00:01:35.540> in<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.900> car<00:01:36.050> I<00:01:36.080> tore

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
front ones were gone in the car I tore

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.540 
front ones were gone in the car I tore
apart<00:01:37.000> then<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.030> also<00:01:38.300> got<00:01:38.660> two<00:01:39.250> door<00:01:40.250> lock

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
apart then I also got two door lock

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.620 
apart then I also got two door lock
motors<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.100> these<00:01:43.100> are<00:01:43.310> pretty<00:01:43.490> simple<00:01:43.940> they

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
motors so these are pretty simple they

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.100 
motors so these are pretty simple they
just<00:01:45.190> see<00:01:46.190> if<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.340> can<00:01:46.490> get<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.760> just<00:01:47.540> click

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
just see if I can get it just click

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.480 
just see if I can get it just click
click<00:01:48.760> click<00:01:49.760> that's<00:01:50.300> all<00:01:50.540> they<00:01:50.660> do<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.490> you

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
know got the little deal there so I may

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.280 
know got the little deal there so I may
use<00:01:55.369> those<00:01:55.580> I<00:01:55.759> may<00:01:55.940> not<00:01:56.149> but<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:56.720> figured<00:01:57.140> while

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
use those I may not but I figured while

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.820 
use those I may not but I figured while
I<00:01:57.320> had<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.649> door<00:01:58.210> torn<00:01:59.210> apart<00:01:59.300> I'd<00:02:00.020> take<00:02:00.710> them

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
I had the door torn apart I'd take them

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.080 
I had the door torn apart I'd take them
out<00:02:01.009> of<00:02:01.040> there<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.490> I<00:02:01.550> don't<00:02:01.610> know<00:02:01.790> what<00:02:01.970> they

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
out of there and I don't know what they

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.650 
out of there and I don't know what they
charge<00:02:02.360> me<00:02:02.540> for<00:02:02.780> them<00:02:04.060> then<00:02:05.060> when<00:02:05.210> charging

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
charge me for them then when charging

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.740 
charge me for them then when charging
for<00:02:05.840> one<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.200> looks<00:02:06.380> like<00:02:07.119> yeah<00:02:08.119> because<00:02:08.570> it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
for one it looks like yeah because it

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.170 
for one it looks like yeah because it
they<00:02:09.590> couldn't<00:02:09.800> find<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.220> right<00:02:10.369> deal<00:02:10.910> so

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
they couldn't find the right deal so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.510 
they couldn't find the right deal so
they<00:02:11.300> charged<00:02:11.510> me<00:02:11.570> 12<00:02:11.900> bucks<00:02:12.040> 13<00:02:13.040> bucks<00:02:13.280> for

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
they charged me 12 bucks 13 bucks for

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.210 
they charged me 12 bucks 13 bucks for
both<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.880> them<00:02:14.000> which<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.390> fine<00:02:14.950> that's<00:02:15.950> fair

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
both of them which is fine that's fair

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.330 
both of them which is fine that's fair
but<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.270> think<00:02:17.750> their<00:02:17.870> price<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.140> 12<00:02:18.950> bucks<00:02:19.220> for

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
but I think their price is 12 bucks for

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.920 
but I think their price is 12 bucks for
the<00:02:19.489> whole<00:02:19.580> lock<00:02:19.820> assembly<00:02:20.150> or<00:02:20.510> something<00:02:20.870> I

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
the whole lock assembly or something I

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.759 
the whole lock assembly or something I
didn't<00:02:21.170> have<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.530> just<00:02:21.739> had<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> motor<00:02:22.190> so

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
didn't have that I just had the motor so

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.890 
didn't have that I just had the motor so
there<00:02:24.769> we<00:02:24.860> go<00:02:26.500> there's<00:02:27.500> one<00:02:27.590> way<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.750> we'll

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
there we go there's one way and we'll

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.850 
there we go there's one way and we'll
reverse<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.260> polarity<00:02:32.590> spin<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.769> other

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
reverse the polarity spin it the other

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.310 
reverse the polarity spin it the other
way<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.370> drilled<00:02:34.700> out<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.180> four<00:02:35.600> rivets<00:02:35.900> here

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
way I drilled out the four rivets here

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:44.110 
way I drilled out the four rivets here
and<00:02:39.640> just<00:02:40.640> use<00:02:40.820> an<00:02:41.000> old<00:02:41.120> screwdriver<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:43.120> drive

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
and just use an old screwdriver to drive

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.080 
and just use an old screwdriver to drive
underneath<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.750> gear<00:02:45.080> here<00:02:45.670> see<00:02:46.670> if<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.880> can

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
underneath this gear here see if I can

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.600 
underneath this gear here see if I can
pop<00:02:48.080> this<00:02:48.290> thing<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.650> rest<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.040> way<00:02:49.160> out

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.340 

looks<00:02:55.610> like<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.970> wants<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:57.070> yeah<00:02:58.150> good<00:02:59.150> thing

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.020 

so<00:03:03.350> then<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.340> question<00:03:04.519> is<00:03:05.440> can<00:03:06.440> we<00:03:06.940> can<00:03:07.940> we

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
so then the question is can we can we

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.910 
so then the question is can we can we
get<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:08.299> motor<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.750> there<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:11.769> don't<00:03:12.769> know

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
get this motor in there I don't know

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920 
get this motor in there I don't know
which<00:03:13.160> side<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.519> want<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.000> use<00:03:14.180> for<00:03:14.450> which<00:03:14.600> side

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
which side I want to use for which side

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.240 
which side I want to use for which side
you<00:03:15.260> know<00:03:15.489> there's<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.579> left<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.000> right<00:03:17.030> I

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
you know there's a left and a right I

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.740 
you know there's a left and a right I
figure<00:03:19.250> it'll<00:03:19.430> be<00:03:19.579> very<00:03:19.790> apparent<00:03:20.120> which<00:03:20.480> side

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
figure it'll be very apparent which side

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.140 
figure it'll be very apparent which side
should<00:03:21.019> go<00:03:21.170> where<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.799> think<00:03:22.730> that's<00:03:22.940> how<00:03:23.120> I

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
should go where I think that's how I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.720 
should go where I think that's how I
want<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.660> sit<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.650> could<00:03:24.920> sit<00:03:25.190> like<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.430> I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
want it to sit it could sit like that I

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.909 
want it to sit it could sit like that I
guess

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
guess

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.900 
guess
it<00:03:27.919> looks<00:03:28.100> like<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.340> might<00:03:28.489> work<00:03:28.519> like<00:03:28.880> that

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
it looks like it might work like that

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.869 
it looks like it might work like that
I'm<00:03:29.750> going<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.959> go<00:03:30.079> ahead<00:03:30.200> and

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.059 
I'm going to go ahead and
grind<00:03:32.540> all<00:03:32.719> this<00:03:32.900> crap<00:03:33.290> off<00:03:33.530> there<00:03:33.829> so

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
grind all this crap off there so

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.099 
grind all this crap off there so
hopefully<00:03:34.219> I<00:03:34.430> can<00:03:34.640> fit<00:03:34.849> it<00:03:34.939> in<00:03:35.090> there<00:03:35.269> we'll

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
hopefully I can fit it in there we'll

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:44.910 
hopefully I can fit it in there we'll
see<00:03:36.140> what<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.650> get

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.240 

there<00:03:45.920> we<00:03:46.040> go<00:03:46.160> shaved<00:03:46.550> down<00:03:47.710> now<00:03:48.710> for<00:03:48.770> this

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
there we go shaved down now for this

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.450 
there we go shaved down now for this
piece<00:03:49.580> you<00:03:50.620> know<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:51.710> can<00:03:52.010> see<00:03:52.160> I<00:03:52.190> got<00:03:52.430> a

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
piece you know you can see I got a

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.950 
piece you know you can see I got a
little<00:03:52.640> stuff<00:03:52.910> standing<00:03:53.270> up<00:03:53.420> there<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.870> I'm

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
little stuff standing up there and I'm

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.000 
little stuff standing up there and I'm
kind<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.620> fitting<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:54.950> motor<00:03:55.160> up<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:57.010> I'm

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
kind of fitting the motor up and I'm

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.790 
kind of fitting the motor up and I'm
running<00:03:58.340> into<00:03:58.490> some<00:03:58.960> issues<00:03:59.960> with<00:04:00.410> clearance

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
running into some issues with clearance

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.710 
running into some issues with clearance
right<00:04:00.980> there<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:01.550> I'm<00:04:02.120> going<00:04:02.240> to<00:04:02.300> cut<00:04:02.570> this

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
right there so I'm going to cut this

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.670 
right there so I'm going to cut this
little<00:04:03.020> corner<00:04:03.320> out<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:04.750> see<00:04:05.750> if<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:06.080> helps

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
little corner out and see if that helps

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:24.730 
little corner out and see if that helps
my<00:04:06.860> plan<00:04:09.820> will<00:04:10.820> have<00:04:10.940> it<00:04:23.080> some<00:04:24.080> holes<00:04:24.320> for<00:04:24.470> my

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
my plan will have it some holes for my

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.280 
my plan will have it some holes for my
bolts<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.370> got<00:04:26.330> those<00:04:26.540> in<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.870> had<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.080> grind

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
bolts and got those in I had to grind

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.980 
bolts and got those in I had to grind
the<00:04:27.530> head<00:04:27.770> off<00:04:27.950> this<00:04:28.280> one<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:29.630> get<00:04:29.750> enough

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
the head off this one to get enough

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.960 
the head off this one to get enough
clearance<00:04:30.440> there<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:30.980> it<00:04:31.490> just<00:04:31.700> barely

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
clearance there and it just barely

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.020 
clearance there and it just barely
clears<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.720> gears<00:04:33.320> but<00:04:33.700> it<00:04:34.700> looks<00:04:34.880> like

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
clears the gears but it looks like

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.670 
clears the gears but it looks like
everything's<00:04:35.450> in<00:04:35.630> there<00:04:35.750> solid<00:04:36.050> so<00:04:36.470> let's

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
everything's in there solid so let's

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.970 
everything's in there solid so let's
give<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:36.920> a<00:04:37.070> shot<00:04:37.100> here<00:04:38.170> who<00:04:39.170> better<00:04:39.710> get<00:04:39.860> out

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
give it a shot here who better get out

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.980 
give it a shot here who better get out
of<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.160> way<00:04:40.480> there's<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:43.370> way<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.810> we'll

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
of the way there's that way and we'll

00:04:44.990 --> 00:05:16.630 
of the way there's that way and we'll
reverse<00:04:45.320> it

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.030 

don't<00:05:17.640> let<00:05:17.760> your<00:05:17.850> meatloaf
