00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
looks quite nice as well I'm really like

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.500 
looks quite nice as well I'm really like
how<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.600> looks<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.860> for<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.760> actual<00:02:26.150> console

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
how it looks and for the actual console

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.470 
how it looks and for the actual console
itself<00:02:26.630> now<00:02:27.459> but<00:02:28.459> first<00:02:28.940> let's<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.209> check

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
itself now but first let's just check

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.690 
itself now but first let's just check
this<00:02:29.660> out<00:02:29.840> again<00:02:30.230> nobody<00:02:31.070> reads<00:02:31.250> any<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.580> these

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
this out again nobody reads any of these

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:40.420 
this out again nobody reads any of these
anyway<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.180> whatever<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:38.410> also<00:02:39.410> have<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.890> okay

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
anyway so whatever and also have a okay

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.820 
anyway so whatever and also have a okay
so<00:02:41.300> I'm<00:02:41.420> assuming<00:02:41.570> this<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.110> for<00:02:42.290> charging

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
so I'm assuming this is for charging

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.030 
so I'm assuming this is for charging
right<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:43.940> charge<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.540> gs4<00:02:45.170> i'ma

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
right this is to charge the gs4 i'ma

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.330 
right this is to charge the gs4 i'ma
show<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.220> google<00:02:46.370> shop<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.910> controllers

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
show you google shop for controllers

show you google shop for controllers
check<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.459> out<00:02:49.580> this<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.600> standard<00:02:50.930> microUSB

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
check it out this is a standard microUSB

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.430 
check it out this is a standard microUSB
just<00:02:53.450> see<00:02:53.600> if<00:02:53.690> maybe<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.170> just<00:02:54.200> a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
just see if maybe this is just a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.170 
just see if maybe this is just a
standard<00:02:54.769> microUSB<00:02:55.100> i'm<00:02:55.580> thinking<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.000> just

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
standard microUSB i'm thinking it's just

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.530 
standard microUSB i'm thinking it's just
standard<00:02:56.750> probably<00:02:57.260> whoops<00:02:58.180> moved<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.299> a<00:02:59.360> bit

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
standard probably whoops moved it a bit

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.330 
standard probably whoops moved it a bit
it's<00:03:00.140> probably<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.650> standard<00:03:00.980> microUSB

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
it's probably just a standard microUSB

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.569 
it's probably just a standard microUSB
no<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:02.329> actually<00:03:02.480> mini<00:03:02.900> isn't<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.320> i<00:03:03.579> think

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
no it's actually mini isn't it i think

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:10.600 
no it's actually mini isn't it i think
its<00:03:04.670> standard<00:03:05.060> probably<00:03:05.959> is<00:03:09.579> pardon<00:03:10.579> the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
its standard probably is pardon the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.509 
its standard probably is pardon the
interruption<00:03:10.880> my<00:03:11.360> maid<00:03:11.540> was<00:03:12.190> i'm<00:03:13.190> going<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.459> go

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
interruption my maid was i'm going to go

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.979 
interruption my maid was i'm going to go
to<00:03:13.579> eat<00:03:13.790> now<00:03:13.970> but<00:03:14.209> i'll<00:03:14.329> just<00:03:14.480> finish<00:03:14.720> up<00:03:14.810> this

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
to eat now but i'll just finish up this

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.660 
to eat now but i'll just finish up this
unboxing<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.709> yeah<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:15.920> probably<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.340> just<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
unboxing so yeah it probably is just the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.180 
unboxing so yeah it probably is just the
standard<00:03:17.120> mini<00:03:17.360> cable<00:03:17.650> I'm<00:03:18.650> sure<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.040> can

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
standard mini cable I'm sure you can

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.100 
standard mini cable I'm sure you can
just<00:03:19.340> buy<00:03:19.489> any<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.730> these<00:03:19.910> for<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.540> ds3<00:03:20.810> could

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
just buy any of these for a ds3 could

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.080 
just buy any of these for a ds3 could
actually<00:03:21.230> just<00:03:21.410> buy<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.680> micro<00:03:22.100> USB<00:03:22.280> cable<00:03:22.760> so

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
actually just buy a micro USB cable so

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.880 
actually just buy a micro USB cable so
this<00:03:23.750> probably<00:03:24.049> shouldn't<00:03:24.320> be<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:24.500> hard<00:03:24.799> to

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
this probably shouldn't be that hard to

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.970 
this probably shouldn't be that hard to
acquire<00:03:25.630> now<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.690> be<00:03:26.959> packed<00:03:27.230> on<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.530> console

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
acquire now to be packed on the console

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.819 
acquire now to be packed on the console
I<00:03:28.570> hope<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.660> don't<00:03:29.720> drop<00:03:29.989> it<00:03:30.079> it's<00:03:30.560> actually

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
I hope I don't drop it it's actually

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.030 
I hope I don't drop it it's actually
surprisingly<00:03:31.430> lighter<00:03:31.670> than<00:03:31.880> I<00:03:31.970> expected<00:03:32.060> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
surprisingly lighter than I expected and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.160 
surprisingly lighter than I expected and
it<00:03:34.040> looks<00:03:34.640> quite<00:03:34.820> nice
