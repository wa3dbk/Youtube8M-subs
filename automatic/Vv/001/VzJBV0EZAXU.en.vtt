be<00:00:55.170> frozen<00:00:55.559> again<00:00:55.649> which<00:00:56.010> would<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.340> too

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
be frozen again which would be too

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.250 
be frozen again which would be too
dangerous<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:57.030> her<00:00:57.120> body<00:00:57.329> she<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:57.870> has<00:00:58.109> to

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.100 
frozen state that was pretty terrifying
and<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.880> those<00:02:38.090> scenes<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.599> writing<00:02:38.959> was

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
and in those scenes the writing was

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.320 
and in those scenes the writing was
basically<00:02:39.560> just<00:02:39.709> all<00:02:39.980> over<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.610> pages<00:02:40.849> which

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
basically just all over the pages which

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.430 
basically just all over the pages which
I<00:02:41.420> think<00:02:41.599> might<00:02:41.780> have<00:02:41.900> been<00:02:41.930> some<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.319> these

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
I think might have been some of these

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.380 
I think might have been some of these
strongest<00:02:42.950> chapters<00:02:43.310> in<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.580> book<00:02:43.730> also<00:02:44.030> if

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
strongest chapters in the book also if

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.940 
strongest chapters in the book also if
there's<00:02:44.599> one<00:02:44.900> thing<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.170> kind<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.620> stands

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
there's one thing that kind of stands

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.740 
there's one thing that kind of stands
out<00:02:46.160> from<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.549> book<00:02:46.730> series<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.510> there

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
out from this book series is that there

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.410 
out from this book series is that there
are<00:02:47.930> constant<00:02:48.590> revelations<00:02:49.400> every<00:02:50.060> couple<00:02:50.329> of

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
are constant revelations every couple of

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.120 
are constant revelations every couple of
chapters<00:02:50.660> your<00:02:51.140> view<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.680> what<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:51.890> thought

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
chapters your view of what you thought

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.979 
chapters your view of what you thought
this<00:02:52.340> world<00:02:52.640> was<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.209> shattered

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
this world was is shattered

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.150 
this world was is shattered
I<00:02:54.019> think<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.319> camp<00:02:54.530> setting<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.130> very

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
I think the camp setting is very

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.890 
I think the camp setting is very
cinematic<00:02:55.849> I've<00:02:56.239> always<00:02:56.450> thought<00:02:56.569> that<00:02:56.780> this

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
cinematic I've always thought that this

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.630 
cinematic I've always thought that this
book<00:02:57.140> would<00:02:57.290> make<00:02:57.440> an<00:02:57.590> excellent<00:02:57.829> movie<00:02:58.519> I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
book would make an excellent movie I

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.949 
book would make an excellent movie I
feel<00:02:58.760> like<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.970> main<00:02:59.150> character<00:02:59.390> should<00:02:59.900> be

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
feel like the main character should be

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.110 
feel like the main character should be
played<00:03:00.319> by<00:03:00.500> Molly<00:03:00.769> Quinn<00:03:01.130> who<00:03:01.370> plays<00:03:01.579> Alexis

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
played by Molly Quinn who plays Alexis

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.490 
played by Molly Quinn who plays Alexis
and<00:03:02.269> castle<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.930> I'm<00:03:03.049> pretty<00:03:03.200> sure<00:03:03.349> I'm<00:03:03.440> not

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
and castle and I'm pretty sure I'm not

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.110 
and castle and I'm pretty sure I'm not
the<00:03:03.590> only<00:03:03.709> person<00:03:03.920> who<00:03:04.280> thinks<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.549> I<00:03:04.910> think

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
the only person who thinks that I think

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.430 
the only person who thinks that I think
the<00:03:05.209> characters<00:03:05.569> are<00:03:05.750> kind<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.260> middle

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
the characters are kind of in the middle

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.530 
the characters are kind of in the middle
for<00:03:06.739> me<00:03:06.769> they're<00:03:07.190> not<00:03:07.459> like<00:03:07.760> super<00:03:08.120> flat<00:03:08.360> and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
for me they're not like super flat and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.900 
for me they're not like super flat and
boring<00:03:08.750> or<00:03:09.140> they're<00:03:09.260> also<00:03:09.410> not<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.370> most<00:03:10.519> well

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
boring or they're also not the most well

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.789 
boring or they're also not the most well
developed<00:03:10.940> characters<00:03:11.540> there<00:03:12.260> are<00:03:12.290> some

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
developed characters there are some

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.500 
developed characters there are some
really<00:03:13.069> interesting<00:03:13.220> side<00:03:14.000> characters

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
really interesting side characters

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.420 
really interesting side characters
though<00:03:14.720> that's<00:03:14.989> very<00:03:15.230> easy<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.739> imagine<00:03:15.950> what

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
though that's very easy to imagine what

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.009 
though that's very easy to imagine what
they<00:03:16.549> look<00:03:16.819> like<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.209> descriptions<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.840> that

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
they look like the descriptions of that

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.390 
they look like the descriptions of that
are<00:03:18.170> really<00:03:18.410> good<00:03:18.590> because<00:03:18.889> sometimes<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.250> can

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
are really good because sometimes I can

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.039 
are really good because sometimes I can
read<00:03:19.549> an<00:03:19.639> entire<00:03:19.760> book<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.209> all<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.900> of

read an entire book and all I have of

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.960 
read an entire book and all I have of
that<00:03:21.170> character<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:21.829> name<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.579> because<00:03:22.819> it

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
that character is a name and because it

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.059 
that character is a name and because it
