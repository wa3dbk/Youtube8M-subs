00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.870
 hello in the series jo plays with my 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.820
 dehydrator i will show you 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.620
 today how to make species of 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.590
 big banana cake and cool on 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.580
 can cut then rolled is presented 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.610
 like that like something to nibble 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.910
 sweet and that will be made with fruits 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.850
 that's what you said then we go this 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.050
 way I want to do it then I 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.029
 will put nine bananas 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.259
 so I troubleshoots very hard bananas 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.090
 apples you have to have bananas that's at 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.130
 to say with little small spots 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.600
 brown that's how they are 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.790
 blackberries that's how they are 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.300
 developed what are the lamido and 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.110
 has transformed and that now she 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.200
 is perfectly digestible this madam 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.480
 I will take a small knife to 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.469
 remove the parts possibly too much 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 blackberries one silver the nine months yes 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:06.190
 obviously there they are a little bit 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.540
 damaged all the same time sometimes we 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.920
 buy fruit for example this morning 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.670
 I ate it I bought two 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.830
 moliers which was 2 euros 50 when 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.240
 even a big manga not referring on 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.640
 marco this is how it is 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.939
 see this is slip where there is 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.950
 still and in principle they are 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.500
 succulent and I make her look very 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.210
 mature very very nice and I opened 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.990
 this morning impossible to eat I have 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.509
 took a bite 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.450
 he was leaning on his mouth is weird 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.700
 it's as if they were had 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.259
 fermented actually it looked like 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.080
 dreadful appalling I have everything 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.210
 spit out I threw everything then stopped 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.460
 these two 52 fischer but at the same time 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.150
 these are fruits it's normal it's 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.570
 something alive 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.580
 sure you buy crackers be 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.440
 something else because it lasts 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.560
 long only there is no life 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.910
 in it's all dry 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.960
 so I accept all kinds but 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.080
 that's how it's not seen 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.460
 the outside and since then I'm going 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.660
 put a little yellow ball away 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.400
 not bad and I add chia seeds 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.430
 so I have this mark there and in 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.530
 general I find them on the internet because 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.840
 I start early from home 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.720
 so here I have a little cup like 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:32.470
 that I put it in I do not add especially 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.880
 no water here are the chia seeds so 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.430
 you put them in the water you'll see 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.230
 it's still stalking her this 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.090
 it's great if for example if you 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.500
 want to make a sauce in a room in 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.420
 discover that she is a little bit 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.060
 of consistency and well you put some 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.040
 you mix tomatoes for example 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.500
 and then you put to cook mouth of 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.910
 cat are you waiting a little bit 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.680
 mix and it will make a little sauce 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.840
 thick we do that too much on this 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.880
 for desserts possibly yes 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.800
 you make a little grout of 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.630
 strawberry raspberries for example summer and 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.100
 and then you put yourself a little fear 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.580
 dogs in it and it makes a sauce 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.040
 thick is nice then the seeds of 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.620
 chia his full of omega 6 it's up to my 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.860
 I already like seeds 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.990
 black one way 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.840
 chia seeds this put us in 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.590
 in terms of nutrient intake is when 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.760
 even very good anyway there I have everything 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.970
 bet there for some positions they 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:33.260
 are going to thicken and now that I have 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:37.580
 mixed all that I'll exercise to yes I 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:41.780
 did not tell you about a fruit bowl of 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.690
 blends of frozen red fruits 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.959
 I have three cups and I mix 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.540
 hills with angelic getting parent adds 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:55.670
 that it remains whole small berries 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:04:00.140
 reds a little cinnamon you are 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.110
 I do not have to have cinnamon I love it but 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.770
 it can be done with or without so done 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.480
 absolutely 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.709
 when you want the principle it's 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.920
 really bananas from the seeds of 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.080
 dogs and whole red fruits and 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.280
 after that we 'll show off his then if we have the 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.310
 patience we wait a little bit 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.200
 take the gel but it's not very 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.370
 important we go especially the m so you 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.530
 see on 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:29.340
 leaves from 5 pm to the room 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.260
 there is there I saw a leaf that goes from 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.680
 breath and that prevents colette 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.400
 especially the pass to go through the three 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.350
 spaces then we put in the middle and then 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:46.169
 then we are doing 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:49.680
 events like that good voila I did 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.050
 a cream like that I'm going to put it 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.470
 in zealots I will make one 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.820
 other until I believed paws 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.580
