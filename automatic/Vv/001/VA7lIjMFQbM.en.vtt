00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
neat in there and then oh let's do the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.199 
neat in there and then oh let's do the
front<00:02:04.110> bit<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.000> split<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.180> into<00:02:06.330> two<00:02:06.570> pieces<00:02:06.780> so

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
front bit so split it into two pieces so

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.430 
front bit so split it into two pieces so
take<00:02:09.209> off<00:02:09.360> first<00:02:09.600> section<00:02:09.929> doesn't<00:02:10.200> matter<00:02:10.320> if

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
take off first section doesn't matter if

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.020 
take off first section doesn't matter if
they're<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.649> even<00:02:10.979> why<00:02:11.160> not<00:02:11.340> put<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> little

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
they're not even why not put a little

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.759 
they're not even why not put a little
bit<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.269> backcombing<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.260> hold<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.620> in

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
bit of backcombing in just to hold it in

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.020 
bit of backcombing in just to hold it in
place<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.850> then<00:02:15.600> smooth<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:17.519> this<00:02:17.640> point<00:02:17.910> I

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
place and then smooth it at this point I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.110 
place and then smooth it at this point I
would<00:02:18.209> probably<00:02:18.510> put<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.750> hairspray<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:20.120> and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
would probably put the hairspray in and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
would probably put the hairspray in and
then<00:02:21.299> just<00:02:21.330> fold<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.049> back<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.620> itself<00:02:24.140> like

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
then just fold it back on itself like

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:35.200 
then just fold it back on itself like
that<00:02:25.970> stick<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> gripping

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.850 

then<00:02:35.810> we<00:02:35.900> can<00:02:36.050> tidy<00:02:36.260> all<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:36.590> up<00:02:36.740> with

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
then we can tidy all this up with
