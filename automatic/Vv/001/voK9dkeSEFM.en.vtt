00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 hayushki with all their on point and friends 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.240
 I've got a wild burnt it 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.940
 can as livelihood and here we are 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.130
 We will again Count Jerking case 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.109
 that I thought to myself to buy the game 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.850
 write naturally to 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.810
 check it out what's the game worth it 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.730
 I took it to my home 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.070
 yourself first on playstation 4 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.689
 I went there this demku I liked me 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.519
 I thought about buying but then decided 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.630
 to see how it will look on 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.899
 x-box one and here it closed the most 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.480
 xbox one friends 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.710
 Unfortunately much lower resolution here 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.780
 It is clearly visible that this is 720p and at the same time FPS 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.730
 jumps just wild in general now you 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.469
 see on the x-box one screens the player a 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.460
 can of duty on xbox one right now i'm 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.210
 straight live 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.920
 live will play and if you 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.359
 now notice this game is real 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.809
 tremble there are small 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.489
 slowing down it goes not quite 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.860
 smoothly 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.020
 as you can see the frame rate is somewhere around 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.729
 thirty 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.729
 because of what i like best 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.140
 xbox one gamepad is not natural to play 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.960
 it is more convenient here but but to be honest 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.929
 I've connected the playstation 4 right now 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.450
 like xbox one and there already launched the game 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:31.590
 Wright and let's quickly constantly 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.130
 pause, roll it up and see how the game 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.470
 playstation 4 looks and friends well 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.369
 Here you can immediately notice the resolution 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.190
 Already a lot more guys I just now 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.110
 do not incline you to the choice there and hurriedly 4 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.929
 Is there anything else I'm just showing you 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.649
 living example how developers come in 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:56.190
 refers badly to the platform and xbox one and 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.740
 just nothing is normal there 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.850
 fit under this platform will see 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.909
 it's getting smoother here 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.049
 I think the resolution is even higher 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.429
 lighting is the best here is the best 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.640
 lighting is better 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.250
 world trees that is x-box one 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.690
 I'm in the first race when I went I noticed 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.019
 that some trees I don't even have 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.640
 painted some know what's on xbox 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.680
 one there is a problem for developers with 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.519
 the ram there with her 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.170
 distribution and other things in general 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.340
 many simply do not know how to play 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.590
 customize it to the xbox and here 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.109
 this is the best example of friends here I am 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.380
 you are now just showing live 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:43.109
 how much graphics can vary like 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.709
 you see here and 1080p and everything is smooth 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.810
 goes and I specifically loaded youtube st 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.800
 in the source that is, I will not worry 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.170
 by 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.810
 video guys 3 is all the editing studio 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.240
 as here I will have a capture card 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.510
 filmed so I will load so that you are right here 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.990
 in the original quality saw how much everyone 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.550
 happens to be bad friends that's how much I would 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.850
 I would love to get this game 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.070
 yourself on playstation 4 but unfortunately mine 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.410
 hands are sharpened under another non gamepad and 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.270
 how am I right now 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.960
 simple mode with all the helpers not 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.860
 can catch up 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.530
 1 while the game is just that much 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.620
 nicer played on playstation 4 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.110
 so now we bump everything possible 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.320
 pause and let's go back 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.870
 back to xbox one 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.060
 all live broadcast friends switching 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.000
 farther on xbox one and as you see here 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.520
 the picture is like before 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.330
 showed the real next-gene and now how 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.980
 as if playing korn attacks that is 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.110
 as if on playstation 3 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.730
 like there i showed on playstation 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.430
 4 and here on playstation 3 that is 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.770
 graphics when power is different in 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.110
 first there are some more shadows 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.950
 harsh I don't like non communication soft 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.300
 and the pictures with too contrast and 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.050
 compare with playstation 4 as you can 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:11.370
 notice also the environment and detail 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.170
 everything is somehow at a worse level but at 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.870
 for some reason, at least to me 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.980
 It is played under a lighter, that is, after all 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.690
 calmly leave without any straining 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.810
 first at low frequency 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.670
 There are quite a few frames about lags here. 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:29.710
 of at Bani 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:33.280
 also writes to touch me and so here we are 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.870
 too impressed so let's again 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.470
 quickly switch to playstation 4 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.960
 dubna are back and see see soft 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.310
 shadows normal detail normal 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.670
 playable resolution 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.230
 this game can call us the genome and 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.220
 absolutely impossible to call us a gene 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.130
 on xbox one 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.610
 I don't know what the problem is really with me 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.010
 friends will just be real 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.170
 Like when I saw it like that 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.500
 It became very disappointing for xbox one because 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.870
 well, many still know what to eat 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.240
 good games then we are for what 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.880
 buy this prefix take the same phrase 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.010
 where everything is fine there are no such problems 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.040
 code loads 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.930
 here's a multiplatform is lame this of course 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.630
 everybody knows 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.330
 but right is the brightest indicator of that 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.090
 how much multiplatform is lame 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.160
 On xbox one in general, friends, I drove 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.190
 first club of large station 4 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.870
 let's pause and come back 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.870
 back to xbox one 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:44.449
 Well, the difference is the graphics are immediately visible 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.259
 most naturally of course 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:50.809
 the picture catches the eye right away 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:53.330
 see there is a slowdown i just don't 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:55.610
 I know where they are from here the game is not so much 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.610
 I consider demanding staff zbox van 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.210
 she braked so much but there is 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.990
 squat unfortunately 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.860
 are present in general now I will pass 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.990
 this circle and summarize the friends from 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.490
 today's so small direct 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.759
 inclusions can be said 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.220
 so so while well, that's just played 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:21.620
 better due to vibrating sticks somehow 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:25.520
 you feel more motorbike easier you 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:29.660
 turn it upside down and we drove 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.750
 here we pause the circle and friends 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.220
 just some epic fail I understand 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.099
 there can only be such a problem with 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:41.690
 haze and in the full game everything will be fine 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:44.120
 but here it is impossible to do dna it too 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.940
 game rate people will definitely 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.750
 download haze before you buy this 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.539
 a game and I think that motorcycle racing 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.180
 not so popular thing to 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:59.090
 it was just spit on demule people will 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.180
 there is no such game 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.039
 won't be in general even now I'm on 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.819
 pause when I twist back to playstation 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:10.009
 4 and as you can see a picture but it is better and but 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:12.169
 maybe you will not be noticeable but I 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:14.300
 urge you to put in 1080 and 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:17.509
 expand to full screen and you will see 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.699
 how much difference is the detail in general 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:23.060
 friends with you were dmitry you point this 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:26.659
 there was such a small little inclusion 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.550
 such a small bangladeshi about smoke 

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:29.810
 and right 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.949
 thank you for seeing me if you 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.840
 liked this video do not forget 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.360
 subscribe to channel like and 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.009
 comment on 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.199
 the signal still catches the eye 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:42.820
 because it’s straight to me at all 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:42.820
 just beats on not
