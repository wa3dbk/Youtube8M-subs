00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.219
 unpublished with the best of meat 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.489
 argentina the best sauce to accompany 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.920
 the roast I will make a vacuum injected 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.980
 with chimichurri no no no a party a 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.200
 madness do not know how it looks 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 they have panic the injections abstain 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.980
 with this we are going to start garlic and parsley 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.880
 Pepper, ground pepper and oregano oil 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:05.300
 olive and wine vinegar salt water one 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.900
 blender lalala syringe and clean cloth 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.510
 and a two-kilo steer vacuum look 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.570
 what is the vacuum that we hit 100% 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.330
 steer many people believe that veal 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.490
 it's the best meat but that's pure myth 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.920
 the steer meat to be a cow of 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.530
 older age has more fat and so 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.600
 much much much more flavor compared 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.150
 with the calf also if they make it 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.550
 on a slow fire it comes out just as tender and 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.040
 It is more economical to recommend them 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.050
 to make the test remember to know 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.150
 of meat is essential to make a 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.490
 great roast now let's start with the 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.890
 chimichurri the most traditional sauce 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.170
 Argentina very easy to do and it 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.020
 fuses perfectly with the meat 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.890
 add as in all chimichurri chili 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.980
 ground oregano pepper salt garlic and 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.320
 parsley a base of olive oil with 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.780
 a little wine vinegar at hand 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.640
 and we close with a trickle of water only 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.950
 a splash to make the mixture a little 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.299
 more liquid 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.299
 now we are going to liquefy 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.320
 from chimichurri kebab 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.600
 we have the mix ready and now we are going 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.120
 to pass to strain the for this was the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.840
 work 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.840
 we do not throw 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.640
 and it goes 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.219
 and then we drain it well so that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.560
 drop all the liquid this is for 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.060
 avoid leaving large pieces that 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.989
 then they can get to lock the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.359
 syringe 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.480
 this do not throw it away because then we 're going 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:38.939
 to use it's time for syringes 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.450
 look what if this syringe that we 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:44.170
 we get this is ideal special for 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.599
 inject meat 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.940
 for the whole kitchen you can see if 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.610
 they get much better if they can not 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.220
 reconcile the pharmacy try to have the 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.819
 largest syringe possible to make it 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.770
 easier 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.910
 we started by filling it 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.910
 let's go to the meat 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.850
 is that the games remain inside so 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.700
 so we are going to drill well diagonally 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.740
 and while we're taking out that hole 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.290
 we are going to fill it with liquid 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.290
 now we are going to put a little salt 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.750
 the touch of grace 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.450
 although there was plenty left over 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.850
 this is the touch of crazy people to sing of 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.850
 chimichurri being grilled 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.519
 help 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.519
 before that emptiness 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.330
 to novice meat you have to take it to 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.760
 Slow fire 10 seconds of heat has 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.420
 to hold your hand and so we're going to 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.520
 leave for approximately 45 minutes 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.520
 well quiet after we cheer him up 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.660
 before we turn around we are going to take him out 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.220
 all the excess of chimichurri that 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.549
 we had put so that it does not burn 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.280
 now look at how this comes from luxe 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.770
 is tremendous we are going to turn around and 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.280
 leave 20 minutes for it does good 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.280
 the skin 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.510
 enter as rank to the crutch 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.990

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.600
