kind<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.540> met<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:00.990> 10<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.909> even<00:02:03.509> though<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
kind of met at 10 so even though as you

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.380 
kind of met at 10 so even though as you
mentioned<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.560> stability<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.310> great<00:02:05.579> as<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
mentioned the stability is great as you

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.749 
mentioned the stability is great as you
can<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.719> here<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.710> hard<00:02:08.399> time

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
can see here you have a hard time

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.320 
can see here you have a hard time
shooting<00:02:09.509> light<00:02:09.810> bulbs<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.489> so<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.120> take

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
shooting light bulbs out so you can take

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.850 
shooting light bulbs out so you can take
many<00:02:12.569> repeated<00:02:12.989> shots<00:02:13.080> at<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.650> with

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
many repeated shots at it with

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.710 
many repeated shots at it with
accuracy<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.880> not<00:02:15.240> going<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.570> be<00:02:15.690> that

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
accuracy but it's not going to be that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.080 
accuracy but it's not going to be that
good<00:02:15.990> anyway<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> damage<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.010> good<00:02:17.220> at<00:02:17.400> 23<00:02:18.060> I

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
good anyway the damage is good at 23 I

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.060 
good anyway the damage is good at 23 I
think<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.600> puts<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.050> par<00:02:19.080> for<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.710> cross

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
think that puts it on par for the cross

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.970 
think that puts it on par for the cross
skill<00:02:20.460> as<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:21.120> stock<00:02:21.600> weapon<00:02:22.050> but<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.740> believe

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
skill as a stock weapon but I believe

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.880 
skill as a stock weapon but I believe
you<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:23.250> mod<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.840> with<00:02:24.840> about<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.080> plus<00:02:25.380> 7<00:02:25.800> on

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
you can mod it with about a plus 7 on

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.440 
you can mod it with about a plus 7 on
that<00:02:26.100> let's<00:02:26.400> take<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.640> look<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.030> how<00:02:27.330> it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
that let's take a look and see how it

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.920 
that let's take a look and see how it
does<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.780> move<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.500> move<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:30.540> okay

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
does on the move on the move it's okay

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.250 
does on the move on the move it's okay
it's<00:02:31.830> not<00:02:32.040> great<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.460> think<00:02:32.730> for<00:02:33.390> some<00:02:33.720> reason

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
it's not great I think for some reason

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.280 
it's not great I think for some reason
the<00:02:34.470> accuracy<00:02:35.280> seems<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.820> hurt<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.330> more<00:02:37.080> than

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
the accuracy seems to hurt it more than

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.530 
the accuracy seems to hurt it more than
it<00:02:37.440> should<00:02:37.500> as<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:38.490> see<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.790> my<00:02:38.820> second

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
it should as you can see in my second

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.250 
it should as you can see in my second
line<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> little<00:02:40.500> better<00:02:40.709> than<00:02:40.890> my<00:02:41.040> first

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
line is a little better than my first

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.310 
line is a little better than my first
but<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.530> still<00:02:43.800> not<00:02:44.070> great<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.660> for<00:02:46.260> a

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
but it's still not great so as for a

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.550 
but it's still not great so as for a
pistol<00:02:47.040> I'd<00:02:47.220> put<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.000> comma<00:02:48.560> category

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
pistol I'd put it in the comma category

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.270 
pistol I'd put it in the comma category
on<00:02:49.680> them<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.250> move<00:02:50.459> here<00:02:50.840> but<00:02:51.840> uh<00:02:52.280> nothing

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
on them on the move here but uh nothing

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.100 
on them on the move here but uh nothing
to<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:53.610> terribly<00:02:54.030> disappointed<00:02:54.120> about<00:02:54.750> but

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
to be terribly disappointed about but

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.810 
to be terribly disappointed about but
not<00:02:55.290> what<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.650> would<00:02:55.860> really<00:02:56.280> seek<00:02:56.610> this

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
not what you would really seek this

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.220 
not what you would really seek this
thing<00:02:57.000> out<00:02:57.150> for<00:02:57.180> let's<00:02:57.690> take<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.870> look<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.170> see

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
thing out for let's take a look and see

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.340 
thing out for let's take a look and see
how<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.500> does<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.770> jewelry<00:02:59.160> store<00:03:03.110> as<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.200> can

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
how it does on jewelry store as you can

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.650 
how it does on jewelry store as you can
see<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.500> can<00:03:04.620> one-shot<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.660> standard

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
see I can one-shot the standard

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.710 
see I can one-shot the standard
uniformed<00:03:07.230> guards<00:03:07.620> here<00:03:07.890> with<00:03:08.310> Lee<00:03:08.580> 23<00:03:09.360> damage

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
uniformed guards here with Lee 23 damage

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.020 
uniformed guards here with Lee 23 damage
which<00:03:09.959> is<00:03:10.220> nice<00:03:11.220> nothing<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.820> write<00:03:11.970> home

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
which is nice nothing to write home

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.360 
which is nice nothing to write home
about<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:12.720> what<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.380> noticed<00:03:13.800> here<00:03:14.010> playing

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
about but what I noticed here playing

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.930 
about but what I noticed here playing
jewelry<00:03:14.850> store<00:03:15.260> was<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.250> accuracy<00:03:17.910> of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
jewelry store was that the accuracy of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.740 
jewelry store was that the accuracy of
10<00:03:18.360> doesn't<00:03:19.290> seem<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:19.890> good<00:03:20.750> numerically

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
10 doesn't seem that good numerically

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.900 
10 doesn't seem that good numerically
and<00:03:21.959> doesn't<00:03:22.320> seem<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.590> good<00:03:22.980> when<00:03:23.880> I'm

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
and doesn't seem that good when I'm

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.150 
and doesn't seem that good when I'm
playing<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.140> safe<00:03:25.380> house<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.950> playing

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
playing in the safe house and playing

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.250 
playing in the safe house and playing
all<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> range<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.540> grouping<00:03:27.900> didn't<00:03:28.140> seem

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
all the range the grouping didn't seem

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.890 
all the range the grouping didn't seem
that<00:03:28.320> great<00:03:28.440> but<00:03:28.950> in<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.700> actual<00:03:29.850> game<00:03:30.180> it

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
that great but in the actual game it

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.530 
that great but in the actual game it
seems<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.470> be<00:03:31.650> good<00:03:31.920> enough<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.580> was<00:03:32.850> at<00:03:33.390> least

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
seems to be good enough I was at least

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.150 
seems to be good enough I was at least
on<00:03:33.750> jewelry<00:03:34.200> store<00:03:34.410> which<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.650> not<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.890> long

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
on jewelry store which is not a long

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.890 
on jewelry store which is not a long
range<00:03:35.489> map<00:03:35.760> it's<00:03:36.000> kind<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.269> medium<00:03:36.690> range

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
range map it's kind of a medium range

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.229 
range map it's kind of a medium range
map<00:03:37.110> I<00:03:37.590> was<00:03:38.130> able<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.400> put<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.610> lot<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:38.940> headshots

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
map I was able to put a lot of headshots

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.080 
map I was able to put a lot of headshots
on<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.200> get<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> lot<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.890> long-range<00:03:41.700> shots

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
on and get a lot of long-range shots

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.270 
on and get a lot of long-range shots
that<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.330> wasn't<00:03:42.630> expecting<00:03:42.989> with<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> typical

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
that I wasn't expecting with a typical

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.729 
that I wasn't expecting with a typical
10<00:03:44.549> accuracy<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.510> think<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.170> has<00:03:46.260> something<00:03:46.500> to

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
10 accuracy I think it has something to

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.380 
10 accuracy I think it has something to
do<00:03:46.860> with<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.100> way<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.340> game<00:03:47.370> kind<00:03:48.269> of

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
do with the way the game kind of

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.020 
do with the way the game kind of
strangely<00:03:48.930> handles<00:03:49.530> pistols<00:03:50.070> they<00:03:50.640> seem<00:03:50.910> to

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
strangely handles pistols they seem to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.610 
strangely handles pistols they seem to
be<00:03:51.180> more<00:03:51.450> accurate<00:03:51.720> than<00:03:52.140> their<00:03:52.290> numbers

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
be more accurate than their numbers
