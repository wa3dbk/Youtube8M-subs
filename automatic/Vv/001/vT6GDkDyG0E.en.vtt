if it was easy every single person would
be<00:03:24.760> doing<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.419> you're<00:03:25.480> not<00:03:26.169> always<00:03:26.440> going

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
be doing it and you're not always going

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.349 
be doing it and you're not always going
to<00:03:26.799> be<00:03:26.859> successful<00:03:27.459> you're<00:03:27.849> going<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.060> fail

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
to be successful you're going to fail

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.720 
to be successful you're going to fail
and<00:03:28.660> failure<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.560> actually<00:03:30.310> completely

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
and failure is actually completely

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.030 
and failure is actually completely
acceptable<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.510> encouraged<00:03:32.049> as<00:03:32.260> long<00:03:32.799> as<00:03:32.950> you

can<00:03:33.190> learn<00:03:33.340> from<00:03:33.579> it<00:03:33.790> because<00:03:34.090> failure<00:03:34.599> is<00:03:34.870> a

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
can learn from it because failure is a

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.839

fail and learn nothing from it then it

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.770 
fail and learn nothing from it then it
was<00:03:38.859> a<00:03:38.889> big<00:03:39.160> waste<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.519> time<00:03:39.760> this<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.599> why<00:03:40.750> a
