00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.130
 just before starting the study 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.170
 I want to give you a little summary of 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.349
 what I will try to do for 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.810
 every week for the rest of the year 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.480
 so I will try to make individuals 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.370
 every Sunday a presentation be 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.120
 the site is 2 maps on request 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.590
 outside shows a short video of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.870
 series or adventure 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.030
 Friday is obviously I 'm going to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.950
 say but rather the Sundays document 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
 did not say it's okay so we get 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.070
 find today to show you 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.719
 a little tutorial a little earlier in the month 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.969
 from October to slips but hey we go 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.800
 stay in the series of tutorials is 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.739
 today returned how to pose a 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.850
 sign or even so it's a bit if 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.739
 normally if you normally do 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.480
 because it will still suits also 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.650
 care because when we try to be close and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.970
 the coach also like us like that 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.229
 with my senses we can not produce it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.610
 an open trade 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.290
 so that's why 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.360
 that I want to show how to do it 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.560
 then you will need for that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.290
 boards blocked cool what does that trigger 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 the leader both can obviously of 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.189
 two sides also in and front tracy 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 and grass earth blocks so you 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.540
 start you ask your two blocks you 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.310
 then ask in peace signs with 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.920
 write what you want on which by 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.899
 example by wall we fart the block of 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 butter involved the crusts sheet metal and like 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.090
 you can notice the block has 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.280
 gone but the sign stays here and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.530
 when we make the mole thanks that's for 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.259
 cards floats in the air like that you 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.450
 can put your chest right in 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.979
 below and you can see that blake in 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.500

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.659
