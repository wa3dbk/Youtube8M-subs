00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
that bill Bates was in motion

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.200 
that bill Bates was in motion
I<00:00:37.890> thought<00:00:38.890> bill<00:00:39.160> left<00:00:39.489> early<00:00:39.760> but<00:00:39.850> I<00:00:39.910> never

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
I thought bill left early but I never

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.750 
I thought bill left early but I never
saw<00:00:40.480> a<00:00:40.510> fly<00:00:40.840> built<00:00:41.680> look<00:00:41.890> bills<00:00:42.160> passed<00:00:42.460> mark

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
saw a fly built look bills passed mark

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.420 
saw a fly built look bills passed mark
power<00:00:42.970> before<00:00:43.420> Mara<00:00:43.660> even<00:00:43.930> gets<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.199> ball

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
power before Mara even gets the ball

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.979 
power before Mara even gets the ball
there<00:00:45.430> was<00:00:45.610> a<00:00:45.640> more<00:00:45.910> there's<00:00:46.120> a<00:00:46.180> motion<00:00:46.480> call

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
there was a more there's a motion call

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.579 
there was a more there's a motion call
on<00:00:47.230> this<00:00:47.440> play<00:00:47.710> it<00:00:48.570> took<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.690> touchdown<00:00:50.199> away

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
on this play it took the touchdown away

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.240 
on this play it took the touchdown away
here<00:00:50.949> and<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:52.449> still<00:00:52.659> have<00:00:52.809> 22<00:00:53.290> seconds<00:00:53.769> so<00:00:53.949> and

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
here and we still have 22 seconds so and

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.119 
here and we still have 22 seconds so and
first<00:00:54.610> down<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.720> one<00:00:56.079> timeout<00:00:56.559> well<00:00:56.920> you<00:00:56.979> know

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
first down and one timeout well you know

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.130 
first down and one timeout well you know
it<00:00:57.309> seemed<00:00:57.519> like<00:00:57.550> Adolphe<00:00:57.940> more<00:00:58.180> people<00:00:58.690> wear

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
it seemed like Adolphe more people wear

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.259 
it seemed like Adolphe more people wear
off<00:00:59.320> before<00:00:59.739> the<00:01:00.129> ball<00:01:00.339> came<00:01:00.699> off<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.149> I<00:01:01.210> think

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
off before the ball came off and I think

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.759 
off before the ball came off and I think
there's<00:01:01.690> a<00:01:01.780> possibility<00:01:01.960> that<00:01:02.620> maybe

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
there's a possibility that maybe

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.189 
there's a possibility that maybe

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
been a little slow that time and caught

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.990 
been a little slow that time and caught
him<00:01:14.380> offside<00:01:14.830> because<00:01:15.250> there<00:01:15.429> is<00:01:15.550> about<00:01:15.759> three

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
him offside because there is about three

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.609 
him offside because there is about three
people<00:01:16.390> that<00:01:16.570> were<00:01:16.660> in<00:01:16.810> motion<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.380> couple

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
people that were in motion the couple

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.230 
people that were in motion the couple
alive<00:01:17.860> in<00:01:18.039> both<00:01:18.220> guards<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.789> it<00:01:18.910> looked<00:01:19.090> like

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
alive in both guards and it looked like

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.779 
alive in both guards and it looked like
of<00:01:19.750> course<00:01:19.780> obviously<00:01:20.380> Bates<00:01:21.039> was<00:01:21.250> in<00:01:21.399> motion

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
of course obviously Bates was in motion

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.639 
of course obviously Bates was in motion
so<00:01:22.330> now<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.720> brings<00:01:22.929> the<00:01:23.050> ball<00:01:23.170> back<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.560> the

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
so now it brings the ball back to the

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.889 
so now it brings the ball back to the
five<00:01:23.830> yard<00:01:24.100> line<00:01:24.250> with<00:01:24.460> 22<00:01:24.909> seconds<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.479> go<00:01:25.630> in

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.410 
the first half
Nebraska<00:01:29.200> still<00:01:29.409> got<00:01:29.649> a<00:01:29.860> first<00:01:30.159> down<00:01:30.429> so<00:01:31.300> I'm

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
Nebraska still got a first down so I'm

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.910 
Nebraska still got a first down so I'm
sure<00:01:31.659> that<00:01:31.810> they<00:01:31.899> will<00:01:32.020> probably<00:01:32.170> try<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.619> pass

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
sure that they will probably try to pass

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.880 
sure that they will probably try to pass
it<00:01:33.159> three<00:01:33.369> times<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.940> see<00:01:34.060> what<00:01:34.179> happens

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
