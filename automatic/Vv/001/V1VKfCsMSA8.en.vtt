well one of the most famous forms of
Venetian<00:00:04.650> glass<00:00:05.549> was<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.240> mirror<00:00:07.820> this<00:00:08.820> was

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
Venetian glass was the mirror this was

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.200 
Venetian glass was the mirror this was
not<00:00:09.450> developed<00:00:09.750> originally<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.620> Venice<00:00:11.210> but

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
not developed originally in Venice but

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.629 
not developed originally in Venice but
came<00:00:12.660> down<00:00:12.870> from<00:00:13.019> Germany<00:00:13.469> but<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.160> Venetians

came down from Germany but the Venetians

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.490 
came down from Germany but the Venetians
perfected<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> art<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.750> mirrors<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.350> made

developed the fine glass mirror was

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.209 
developed the fine glass mirror was
developed<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.140> Venice<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.829> spread<00:00:41.100> around

developed in Venice and in spread around

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.060 
developed in Venice and in spread around
Europe<00:00:42.110> what<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.230> even<00:00:43.469> more<00:00:43.500> difficult<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
Europe what is even more difficult to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.310 
Europe what is even more difficult to
realize<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.550> how<00:00:44.730> enormous<00:00:45.719> was<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> effect

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
realize is how enormous was the effect

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
realize is how enormous was the effect
of<00:00:46.649> having<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.579> glass<00:00:47.789> mirror<00:00:48.950> there<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.129> at

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
of having a glass mirror there are at

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.850 
of having a glass mirror there are at
least<00:00:50.370> four<00:00:50.879> major<00:00:51.469> transformations<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
least four major transformations to the

least four major transformations to the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
way in which the world looked to human

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.490 
way in which the world looked to human
beings<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:56.129> by<00:00:56.789> reflecting<00:00:57.329> himself<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
beings because by reflecting himself it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.430 
beings because by reflecting himself it
trend<00:00:58.890> transformed<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.760> relationships<00:01:00.440> one

development of medieval optics and later

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.660 
development of medieval optics and later
on<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.409> way<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:07.890> which<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.130> could<00:01:08.369> examine

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
on the way in which you could examine

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.899 
on the way in which you could examine
light<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.659> how<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.409> worked<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:11.520> deeply

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
light and how the I worked was deeply

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.820 
light and how the I worked was deeply
affected<00:01:12.180> by<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> possibility<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.380> juggling

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
affected by the possibility of juggling

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
affected by the possibility of juggling
with<00:01:14.010> light<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:14.760> mirrors<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
with light with mirrors so the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
with light with mirrors so the
development<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.890> medieval<00:01:17.310> science<00:01:17.670> was

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
development of medieval science was

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.960 
development of medieval science was
effected<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.439> second<00:01:19.970> great

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
effected then a second great

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.580 
effected then a second great
transformation<00:01:21.840> which<00:01:21.990> only<00:01:22.200> occurred

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
transformation which only occurred

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.219 
transformation which only occurred
apparently<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.610> part<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> world<00:01:24.229> was

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
apparently in one part of the world was

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.100 
apparently in one part of the world was
in<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> way<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.330> destabilized<00:01:27.330> vision<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
in the way it destabilized vision and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.179 
in the way it destabilized vision and
helped<00:01:28.979> art<00:01:29.810> because<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:31.049> mirrors<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
helped art because with mirrors you

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.940 
helped art because with mirrors you
could<00:01:32.369> begin<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.700> suddenly<00:01:33.360> look<00:01:33.509> at<00:01:33.689> reality

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
could begin to suddenly look at reality

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.980 
could begin to suddenly look at reality
in<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.100> new<00:01:35.280> way<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.420> curious<00:01:36.659> way<00:01:36.840> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
in a new way in a curious way you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.960 
in a new way in a curious way you
couldn't<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.710> directly<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.790> just

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
couldn't see it directly if you just

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.270 
couldn't see it directly if you just
looked<00:01:39.180> at<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.390> then<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> looked<00:01:40.740> at<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> in

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
looked at it then if you looked at it in

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.480 
looked at it then if you looked at it in
a<00:01:41.700> mirror<00:01:42.470> suddenly<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> saw<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.979> more

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
a mirror suddenly you saw it more

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.160 
a mirror suddenly you saw it more
realistically<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> great<00:01:45.720> painters<00:01:46.140> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
realistically and the great painters of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.840 
realistically and the great painters of
the<00:01:46.350> Renaissance<00:01:46.829> used<00:01:47.130> mirrors<00:01:47.430> all<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the Renaissance used mirrors all the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.100 
the Renaissance used mirrors all the
time<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.570> try<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.619> reality<00:01:50.009> more<00:01:50.670> clearly

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
time to try and see reality more clearly

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.319 
time to try and see reality more clearly
so<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.350> Renaissance<00:01:53.009> may<00:01:53.340> well<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.820> partly

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
so the Renaissance may well have partly

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.679 
so the Renaissance may well have partly
stemmed<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> use<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.890> mirror

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
stemmed out of the use of the mirror

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.069 
stemmed out of the use of the mirror
thirdly<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.619> led<00:01:59.579> to<00:02:00.000> another<00:02:00.630> form<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
thirdly it led to another form of

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.740 
thirdly it led to another form of
scientific<00:02:01.619> development<00:02:02.340> which<00:02:02.640> was<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.570> use

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
scientific development which was the use

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.020 
scientific development which was the use
of

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
of

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.780 
of
scopes<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:06.140> early<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.799> great<00:02:07.040> telescopes<00:02:07.580> of

only a a brass or steel mirror you could

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.030 
only a a brass or steel mirror you could
see<00:07:11.630> yourself<00:07:11.780> vaguely<00:07:12.320> in<00:07:12.590> it<00:07:12.740> but<00:07:12.890> you

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.040 
see yourself vaguely in it but you

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.860 
see yourself vaguely in it but you
didn't<00:07:13.310> look<00:07:13.430> at<00:07:13.610> yourself<00:07:14.120> you<00:07:14.570> didn't<00:07:14.810> look

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
didn't look at yourself you didn't look

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.200 
didn't look at yourself you didn't look
at<00:07:15.020> the<00:07:15.110> person<00:07:15.500> that<00:07:15.530> was<00:07:15.800> you<00:07:15.980> you<00:07:16.610> gazed<00:07:16.910> it

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
at the person that was you you gazed it

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.710 
at the person that was you you gazed it
into<00:07:17.840> it<00:07:17.990> to<00:07:18.410> see<00:07:18.440> through<00:07:19.100> the<00:07:19.880> image<00:07:20.240> into

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 
into it to see through the image into

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.590 
into it to see through the image into
your<00:07:20.900> inner<00:07:21.230> spirit<00:07:21.530> or<00:07:21.890> cell<00:07:22.160> and<00:07:22.610> so<00:07:23.480> it

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:23.600 
your inner spirit or cell and so it

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.600 
your inner spirit or cell and so it
wasn't<00:07:23.930> used<00:07:24.170> as<00:07:24.410> a<00:07:24.470> way<00:07:24.680> of<00:07:24.710> looking<00:07:25.550> at

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610 
wasn't used as a way of looking at

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.390 
wasn't used as a way of looking at
yourself<00:07:25.820> rather<00:07:26.780> at<00:07:27.050> your<00:07:27.260> your<00:07:27.920> spiritual

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
yourself rather at your your spiritual

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.790 
yourself rather at your your spiritual
side<00:07:28.700> so<00:07:29.390> I<00:07:29.420> think<00:07:29.600> that<00:07:29.780> even<00:07:30.050> if<00:07:30.380> they<00:07:30.590> had

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 
side so I think that even if they had

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.670 
side so I think that even if they had
had<00:07:30.940> glass<00:07:31.940> mirrors<00:07:32.390> with<00:07:33.260> that<00:07:33.470> tradition

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 
had glass mirrors with that tradition

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.950 
had glass mirrors with that tradition
there<00:07:34.250> it<00:07:34.910> would<00:07:35.090> have<00:07:35.210> led<00:07:35.360> to<00:07:35.540> a<00:07:35.570> different

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 
there it would have led to a different

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.850 
there it would have led to a different
result<00:07:36.080> you<00:07:36.410> wouldn't<00:07:36.620> have<00:07:36.710> necessarily

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.860 
result you wouldn't have necessarily

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.510 
result you wouldn't have necessarily
have<00:07:37.250> the<00:07:37.280> individualism<00:07:37.970> of<00:07:38.210> the<00:07:38.300> West
