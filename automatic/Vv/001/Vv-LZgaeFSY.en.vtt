Sep<00:00:07.810> is<00:00:07.960> that<00:00:08.290> seat

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
Sep is that seat

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.290 
Sep is that seat
actually<00:00:09.740> brings<00:00:10.100> the<00:00:10.400> scanner<00:00:10.730> in<00:00:10.940> and

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
actually brings the scanner in and

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.590 
actually brings the scanner in and
our<00:00:11.360> situation<00:00:12.140> they<00:00:12.710> bring<00:00:12.920> it<00:00:13.040> in<00:00:13.130> the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
our situation they bring it in the

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.960 
our situation they bring it in the
before<00:00:13.930> we<00:00:14.680> have<00:00:14.770> marks<00:00:15.220> on<00:00:15.370> the<00:00:15.520> floor<00:00:15.760> in

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
before we have marks on the floor in

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.370 
before we have marks on the floor in
terms<00:00:16.180> of<00:00:16.360> whether<00:00:16.540> it's<00:00:16.690> head<00:00:16.870> first<00:00:17.080> or<00:00:17.350> feet

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
terms of whether it's head first or feet

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.920 
terms of whether it's head first or feet
first<00:00:17.530> and<00:00:17.920> I<00:00:18.040> post<00:00:18.370> it<00:00:18.550> appropriately<00:00:19.240> so

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
first and I post it appropriately so

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.019 
first and I post it appropriately so
generally<00:00:20.350> the<00:00:20.530> table<00:00:21.070> and<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:21.400> scanner<00:00:21.730> are

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
generally the table and the scanner are

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.880 
generally the table and the scanner are
in<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.450> room<00:00:22.660> while<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:22.960> nurses<00:00:23.350> are<00:00:23.560> setting

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
in the room while the nurses are setting

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.370 
in the room while the nurses are setting
up<00:00:24.010> at<00:00:24.880> that<00:00:25.000> point<00:00:25.210> anesthesia<00:00:25.900> brings<00:00:26.230> the

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
up at that point anesthesia brings the

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.350 
up at that point anesthesia brings the
patient<00:00:26.770> in<00:00:26.890> on<00:00:27.040> our<00:00:27.190> gurney<00:00:27.460> and<00:00:27.760> they<00:00:28.180> will

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
patient in on our gurney and they will

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.420 
patient in on our gurney and they will
anesthetize<00:00:29.110> the<00:00:29.380> patient<00:00:29.410> because<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.250> vast

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
anesthetize the patient because the vast

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.190 
anesthetize the patient because the vast
majority<00:00:30.550> of<00:00:31.000> our<00:00:31.090> cases<00:00:31.300> were<00:00:31.660> doing<00:00:31.900> prone

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
majority of our cases were doing prone

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.710 
majority of our cases were doing prone
so<00:00:32.950> they<00:00:33.070> anesthetize<00:00:33.730> them<00:00:33.910> on<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.180> gurney

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
so they anesthetize them on the gurney

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.780 
so they anesthetize them on the gurney
once<00:00:35.260> all<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.559> IVs<00:00:35.860> have<00:00:36.129> been<00:00:36.250> started<00:00:36.700> the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
once all the IVs have been started the

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.240 
once all the IVs have been started the
Foley's<00:00:37.150> been<00:00:37.330> inserted<00:00:37.870> then<00:00:38.410> we<00:00:38.650> turn<00:00:39.040> the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
Foley's been inserted then we turn the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.549 
Foley's been inserted then we turn the
patient<00:00:39.430> to<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.449> prone<00:00:40.660> position<00:00:40.690> on<00:00:41.410> the

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
patient to the prone position on the

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.119 
patient to the prone position on the
Trump<00:00:41.800> table<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:43.270> at<00:00:43.390> that<00:00:43.570> point<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.890> do<00:00:45.100> a

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
Trump table and at that point we do a

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.180 
Trump table and at that point we do a
collision<00:00:45.489> check<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:47.500> of<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.710> things<00:00:47.980> that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
collision check one of the things that

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.119 
collision check one of the things that
can<00:00:48.370> be<00:00:48.519> done<00:00:48.699> is<00:00:49.540> that<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.230> instruments<00:00:50.949> can

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
can be done is that the instruments can

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.299 
can be done is that the instruments can
be<00:00:51.159> calibrated<00:00:52.030> anywhere<00:00:52.750> along<00:00:52.989> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
be calibrated anywhere along the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.119 
be calibrated anywhere along the
procedure<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.449> for<00:00:56.050> us<00:00:56.170> it<00:00:56.409> varies<00:00:56.860> so

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
procedure and for us it varies so

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.000 
procedure and for us it varies so
sometimes<00:00:57.879> they're<00:00:58.150> calibrated<00:00:58.870> while<00:00:59.710> we

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
sometimes they're calibrated while we

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.610 
sometimes they're calibrated while we
are<00:01:00.070> positioning<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.879> patient<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.440> the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
are positioning the patient and the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.560 
are positioning the patient and the
nurse<00:01:02.650> will<00:01:03.190> calibrate<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.940> instruments<00:01:04.420> at

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
nurse will calibrate the instruments at

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.260 
nurse will calibrate the instruments at
that<00:01:04.750> time<00:01:05.019> there<00:01:06.010> are<00:01:06.040> other<00:01:06.159> times<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:07.060> it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
that time there are other times that it

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.760 
that time there are other times that it
may<00:01:07.390> be<00:01:07.450> done<00:01:07.720> while<00:01:07.990> we're<00:01:08.170> prepping<00:01:08.470> and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
may be done while we're prepping and

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.680 
may be done while we're prepping and
draping<00:01:09.190> or<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:09.880> could<00:01:10.030> be<00:01:10.120> done<00:01:10.270> while<00:01:10.510> we're

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
draping or it could be done while we're

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.289 
draping or it could be done while we're
exposing<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.470> spine<00:01:11.770> so<00:01:12.549> that<00:01:12.580> all<00:01:13.030> that's

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
exposing the spine so that all that's

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.510 
exposing the spine so that all that's
done<00:01:13.600> before<00:01:14.140> we're<00:01:14.290> ready<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.920> actually<00:01:15.070> use

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
done before we're ready to actually use

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.330 
done before we're ready to actually use
them<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:17.140> we<00:01:17.350> were<00:01:17.470> going<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.829> do<00:01:17.979> a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
them if we were going to do a

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.209 
them if we were going to do a
percutaneous<00:01:18.759> case<00:01:19.740> again<00:01:20.740> we<00:01:20.860> have<00:01:20.979> two

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
percutaneous case again we have two

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.279 
percutaneous case again we have two
options<00:01:21.670> my<00:01:22.060> preference<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.869> attach<00:01:23.259> the

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
options my preference is to attach the

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.859 
options my preference is to attach the
clamp<00:01:23.799> to<00:01:23.860> a<00:01:23.979> spinous<00:01:24.369> process<00:01:24.850> its<00:01:25.479> offs<00:01:25.659> make

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
clamp to a spinous process its offs make

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.959 
clamp to a spinous process its offs make
a<00:01:26.020> small<00:01:26.380> incision<00:01:26.770> attach<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.549> clamp<00:01:27.820> to

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
a small incision attach the clamp to

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.850 
a small incision attach the clamp to
that

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.580 

an<00:01:31.550> alternative<00:01:32.240> is<00:01:32.480> to<00:01:32.690> place<00:01:32.870> two<00:01:33.170> pins<00:01:33.410> in

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
an alternative is to place two pins in

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.410 
an alternative is to place two pins in
the<00:01:33.680> iliac<00:01:34.010> crest<00:01:34.400> once<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.970> patient's

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420

prepped and drape and the clamp is

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.540 
prepped and drape and the clamp is
attached<00:01:37.280> you're<00:01:37.970> ready<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.420> scan<00:01:39.370> we<00:01:40.370> then

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
attached you're ready to scan we then

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.480 
attached you're ready to scan we then
place<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:41.180> clear<00:01:41.540> plastic<00:01:41.840> drape<00:01:42.470> over<00:01:43.460> the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
patient and we have the anesthesiologist

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.360 
patient and we have the anesthesiologist
move<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.730> table<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:47.990> preset<00:01:48.800> position

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
from the table and do the actual scan

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.980 
from the table and do the actual scan
while<00:02:22.459> everybody<00:02:22.850> else<00:02:22.970> was<00:02:23.180> outside<00:02:23.720> of<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
while everybody else was outside of the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.070 
while everybody else was outside of the
room<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.440> then<00:02:25.190> folks<00:02:25.970> would<00:02:26.150> return<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.959> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
room and then folks would return to the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.559 
room and then folks would return to the
room<00:02:27.290> we<00:02:28.010> would<00:02:28.220> reposition<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.060> scanner<00:02:29.360> in

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
room we would reposition the scanner in

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.140 
room we would reposition the scanner in
the<00:02:29.600> table<00:02:30.050> take<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.440> drape<00:02:30.650> off<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.220> by<00:02:32.060> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
the table take the drape off and by the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.050 
the table take the drape off and by the
time<00:02:32.450> we<00:02:32.690> had<00:02:32.810> done<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:34.010> images<00:02:34.459> would

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
time we had done that the images would

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.790 
time we had done that the images would
have<00:02:35.209> been<00:02:35.390> sent<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.750> bring<00:02:35.840> lap<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.470> we<00:02:36.560> would

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
have been sent to bring lap and we would

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.040 
have been sent to bring lap and we would
be<00:02:36.950> ready<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.370> implant<00:02:37.819> screws<00:02:38.180> it's

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
be ready to implant screws it's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.809 
be ready to implant screws it's
important<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:40.100> checked<00:02:40.430> with<00:02:40.670> the

make<00:02:43.880> sure<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.110> as<00:02:45.350> accurate<00:02:45.830> as<00:02:46.010> you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
make sure that it is as accurate as you

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.699 
make sure that it is as accurate as you
want<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.850> then<00:02:47.209> reposition<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.320> table<00:02:48.590> to

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
want and then reposition the table to

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.380 
want and then reposition the table to
the<00:02:48.830> operative<00:02:49.130> position<00:02:49.700> you're<00:02:49.970> ready<00:02:50.180> to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
the operative position you're ready to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.020 
the operative position you're ready to
operate<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.050> then<00:02:51.140> Church<00:02:51.410> screws<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.280> again

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
operate and then Church screws and again

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.580 
operate and then Church screws and again
on<00:02:53.239> average<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.810> takes<00:02:54.019> six<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.500> eight

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
on average that takes six to eight

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.240 
on average that takes six to eight
minutes

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.100 

then<00:02:57.940> generally<00:02:58.390> at<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.540> end<00:02:58.750> of<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.900> case

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
then generally at the end of the case

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.140 
then generally at the end of the case
I'll<00:02:59.350> take<00:02:59.500> an<00:02:59.680> x-ray<00:02:59.980> showing<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.700> position

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
I'll take an x-ray showing the position

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.110 
I'll take an x-ray showing the position
of<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.600> screws<00:03:01.930> but<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.620> will<00:03:02.920> not<00:03:03.100> rescan<00:03:03.820> if

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
of the screws but I will not rescan if

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.510 
of the screws but I will not rescan if
anywhere<00:03:04.990> along<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.470> line<00:03:05.500> I'm<00:03:05.890> concerned

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
anywhere along the line I'm concerned

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.670 
anywhere along the line I'm concerned
about<00:03:06.760> any<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.360> screws<00:03:07.690> then<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.410> will

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
about any of the screws then I will

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.520 
about any of the screws then I will
rescan<00:03:09.190> at<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.520> end<00:03:09.750> when<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.780> do<00:03:10.870> rescan<00:03:11.500> I

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
rescan at the end when I do rescan I

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.949 
rescan at the end when I do rescan I
usually<00:03:12.040> rescan<00:03:12.700> at<00:03:12.940> ten<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.450> twenty<00:03:13.810> percent

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
usually rescan at ten to twenty percent

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.550 
usually rescan at ten to twenty percent
less<00:03:14.530> than<00:03:15.280> what<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.550> original<00:03:15.610> scan<00:03:16.240> was<00:03:16.560> so

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
less than what the original scan was so

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.390 
less than what the original scan was so
for<00:03:17.860> me<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.390> advantages<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.450> arrow<00:03:20.380> is<00:03:21.340> that

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
for me the advantages of arrow is that

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.860 
for me the advantages of arrow is that
it's<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:22.060> true<00:03:22.570> thirty<00:03:23.020> to<00:03:23.230> slice<00:03:23.530> CT<00:03:24.250> scanner

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
it's a true thirty to slice CT scanner

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.420 
it's a true thirty to slice CT scanner
so<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.900> means<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.470> there's<00:03:26.709> less<00:03:26.950> scatter

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
so that means that there's less scatter

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.420 
so that means that there's less scatter
radiation<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.450> better<00:03:29.110> image<00:03:29.500> quality<00:03:29.530> than

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
radiation and better image quality than

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.270 
radiation and better image quality than
the<00:03:30.670> cone<00:03:31.060> based<00:03:31.330> systems<00:03:31.930> along<00:03:32.650> with<00:03:32.709> that

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
the cone based systems along with that

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.729 
the cone based systems along with that
being<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:33.640> true<00:03:33.910> CT<00:03:34.330> scanner<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:35.350> allows<00:03:35.709> a

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
being a true CT scanner it allows a

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.000 
being a true CT scanner it allows a
larger<00:03:36.430> field<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:36.940> view<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.270> for<00:03:38.230> example<00:03:38.770> I

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
larger field of view so for example I

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.640 
larger field of view so for example I
could<00:03:39.700> scan<00:03:40.180> from<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.690> skull<00:03:40.989> down<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.530> the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
could scan from the skull down to the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.400 
could scan from the skull down to the
sacrum<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.760> takes<00:03:42.970> about<00:03:43.120> 45<00:03:43.780> seconds<00:03:44.230> to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
sacrum and it takes about 45 seconds to

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.810 
sacrum and it takes about 45 seconds to
do<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.709> entire<00:03:45.070> scan<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:46.480> also<00:03:46.690> allows<00:03:47.110> me<00:03:47.140> to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
do the entire scan it also allows me to

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.449 
do the entire scan it also allows me to
adjust<00:03:48.820> radiation<00:03:49.750> dosage<00:03:50.260> by<00:03:50.770> working<00:03:51.040> with

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
adjust radiation dosage by working with

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.920 
adjust radiation dosage by working with
arrow<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:53.290> allows<00:03:53.560> me<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:54.100> have<00:03:54.930> lesser

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
arrow so it allows me to have lesser

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.890 
arrow so it allows me to have lesser
radiation<00:03:56.770> dosage<00:03:57.250> for<00:03:57.550> patients<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.330> it's

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
radiation dosage for patients and it's

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.320 
radiation dosage for patients and it's
got<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.260> largest<00:03:59.500> bore<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.610> any<00:04:00.970> of<00:04:01.209> the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
got the largest bore of any of the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.780 
got the largest bore of any of the
scanners<00:04:01.810> that's<00:04:02.110> out<00:04:02.290> there<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:02.950> with<00:04:03.549> that

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
scanners that's out there so with that

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.630 
scanners that's out there so with that
I've<00:04:04.120> been<00:04:04.150> able<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.890> not<00:04:05.890> have<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.370> compromise

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
I've been able to not have to compromise

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.300 
I've been able to not have to compromise
how<00:04:07.299> I<00:04:07.330> position<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.110> patient<00:04:08.320> in<00:04:08.890> order<00:04:09.070> to

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
how I position the patient in order to

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.570 
how I position the patient in order to
be<00:04:09.400> able<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.730> scan<00:04:10.230> interoperative<00:04:11.230> Lee<00:04:11.580> and

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
be able to scan interoperative Lee and

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.910 
be able to scan interoperative Lee and
then<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.880> image<00:04:13.120> quality<00:04:13.390> so<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.080> date<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.860> have

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
then the image quality so to date I have

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.490 
then the image quality so to date I have
not<00:04:15.010> found<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.610> patient<00:04:16.090> or<00:04:16.540> part<00:04:17.080> of<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.260> spine
