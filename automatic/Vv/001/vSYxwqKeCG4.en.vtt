 hello how about dear subscribers I am 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.810
 diego and today I bring you a video in which 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.130
 I'm going to explain a trick that still 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.660
 has not risen in anyone in the community 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.939
 Spanish or the community 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 Latin American and it's to put us 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.480
 Any logo on the black shirt is worth 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.939
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.250
 put the open American is worth this 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.129
 we can find it in any store 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.170
 It's good when we have already put 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.660
 the black American we go to the section 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.879
 of shirts worth and shirts 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.739
 we will choose the shirt with the logo that 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.470
 more we like it is worth that you who 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.740
 is the one you like the most 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.620
 good in my case I choose is to catch 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.150
 any one and I put it on when 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.430
 let's put it on what we have to do 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.770
 is to go to the watch section that is 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.660
 down at the bottom and put ourselves on the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.430
 first do not choose it is worth only us 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.950
 we put on the first one we give to the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.960
 be a kid and we turn it another 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.090
 time to give to the start and as you see then 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.220
 we will have our logo on the shirt 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.100
 black is worth I think it's a trick 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.540
 pretty good simple simple and good 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.700
 Here I leave another example so that 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.080
 you see and well I hope you enjoy it 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.250
 that you give daiki if you are not 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.250
