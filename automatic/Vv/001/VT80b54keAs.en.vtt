00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.520
 record a flake 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.660

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.659
 Ronald in wrong covers and that is 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.810

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.699

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.289

 I show on a sick book but this one 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.639
 you can also make that simon at home too dark 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.099

 and this is actually my gaming setup yes 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.580
 it's not very much about it but it 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.139
 is good enough like each other anyway 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.580
 You can see a little bit of the program opening 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:37.620
 that looks like 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.419
 because I see you also see drifts 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.380
 now a little indication a little idea 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.380

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.229

 room tour is my bathroom catholic 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.759
 but that's good that is 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.009
 unnecessary information 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:41.610
 boys this is my room for words 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.199

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.669
 this was my room 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.530
 I didn't enjoy another one 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.599
 sometime my room is not that big 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.729
 but I am also as a 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.110
 spinning around maybe it seems like 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.820

 chemical special because we have we 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:59.969

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:03.889
 behind it not done and the speak and 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.889
 utterly mean say late with a show
