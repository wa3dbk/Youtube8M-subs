00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
these pieces aren't super important

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.690

because they don't touch a lot of food
but<00:03:28.790> they<00:03:28.880> should<00:03:29.060> be<00:03:29.180> cleaned<00:03:29.420> because<00:03:29.600> they

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
but they should be cleaned because they

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.509 
but they should be cleaned because they
can<00:03:29.989> get<00:03:30.049> pretty<00:03:30.230> dirty<00:03:30.440> as<00:03:30.620> well<00:03:30.799> so<00:03:31.340> just

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
as well there was going to be a lot of

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.190 
as well there was going to be a lot of
ice<00:04:31.890> cream<00:04:32.100> inside<00:04:32.310> those<00:04:32.520> ones<00:04:33.050> make<00:04:34.050> sure

you're spinning it around getting all

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.080 
you're spinning it around getting all
the<00:04:36.420> little<00:04:36.510> pieces<00:04:40.580> once<00:04:41.580> that's<00:04:41.760> done<00:04:41.910> you

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
the little pieces once that's done you

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
it inside the sanitizer as well and

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.140 
it inside the sanitizer as well and
that's<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.700> first<00:04:56.970> major<00:04:57.210> step<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:59.190> taking<00:05:00.060> it

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
that's the first major step to taking it

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.710 
that's the first major step to taking it
apart<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:01.890> next<00:05:02.010> step<00:05:02.310> are<00:05:02.490> these<00:05:02.760> two<00:05:03.360> huge

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
apart the next step are these two huge

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.500 
apart the next step are these two huge
pieces<00:05:04.080> inside<00:05:04.970> before<00:05:05.970> we<00:05:06.120> get<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.390> those

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
pieces inside before we get to those

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.590 
pieces inside before we get to those
you've<00:05:06.780> got<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.730> smaller<00:05:08.730> metal<00:05:09.000> pieces<00:05:09.270> and

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
you've got the smaller metal pieces and

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.240 
you've got the smaller metal pieces and
these<00:05:09.780> two<00:05:09.930> small<00:05:10.260> plastic<00:05:10.770> pieces<00:05:10.920> now<00:05:11.160> these

these two small plastic pieces now these

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.560 
these two small plastic pieces now these
are<00:05:11.460> very<00:05:11.610> difficult<00:05:11.820> sometimes<00:05:12.210> they're

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.880 

when<00:05:21.450> you're<00:05:21.570> taking<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.140> large<00:05:22.350> pieces<00:05:22.620> out

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
when you're taking the large pieces out

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.280 
when you're taking the large pieces out
you<00:05:23.850> want<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.060> be<00:05:24.120> careful<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.600> several<00:05:25.140> things

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
you want to be careful of several things

you want to be careful of several things
first<00:05:25.560> of<00:05:25.680> all<00:05:25.830> notice<00:05:26.640> these<00:05:26.880> white<00:05:27.210> plastic

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
first of all notice these white plastic

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.620 
first of all notice these white plastic
pieces<00:05:28.290> with<00:05:28.530> Springs<00:05:29.030> it's<00:05:30.030> very<00:05:30.330> easy<00:05:30.510> for

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
pieces with Springs it's very easy for

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.910 
pieces with Springs it's very easy for
them<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:30.960> come<00:05:31.110> off<00:05:31.260> so<00:05:31.290> make<00:05:31.650> sure<00:05:31.680> you're

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
them to come off so make sure you're

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.590 
them to come off so make sure you're
holding<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.310> in<00:05:32.370> a<00:05:32.460> proper<00:05:32.640> way<00:05:32.970> so<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.450> all

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
holding it in a proper way so that all

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.390 
holding it in a proper way so that all
of<00:05:33.780> them<00:05:33.900> are<00:05:33.960> staying<00:05:34.200> on<00:05:34.320> there<00:05:34.560> also<00:05:35.040> notice

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
of them are staying on there also notice

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.490 
of them are staying on there also notice
this<00:05:35.520> black<00:05:35.820> gasket<00:05:36.720> that<00:05:36.870> I've<00:05:36.960> just<00:05:37.230> pulled

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
this black gasket that I've just pulled

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.170 
this black gasket that I've just pulled
out<00:05:37.590> of<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.740> machine<00:05:38.010> that<00:05:38.190> should<00:05:38.880> be<00:05:38.970> on<00:05:39.060> the

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
out of the machine that should be on the

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.820 
out of the machine that should be on the
end<00:05:39.300> as<00:05:39.450> well<00:05:39.570> it's<00:05:39.990> very<00:05:40.080> easy<00:05:40.290> for<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:40.710> to

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
end as well it's very easy for that to

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.270 
end as well it's very easy for that to
come<00:05:40.950> off<00:05:42.380> now<00:05:43.380> it's<00:05:43.560> taken<00:05:43.830> me<00:05:43.950> a<00:05:43.980> while<00:05:44.100> to

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
come off now it's taken me a while to

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.580 
come off now it's taken me a while to
discover<00:05:44.850> this<00:05:45.150> but<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.960> way<00:05:46.110> I'm<00:05:46.200> holding<00:05:46.350> it

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
discover this but the way I'm holding it

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.720 
discover this but the way I'm holding it
there<00:05:46.710> is<00:05:46.830> actually<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.220> perfect<00:05:47.580> way<00:05:47.700> to

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
there is actually the perfect way to

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.970 
there is actually the perfect way to
hold<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.150> in<00:05:48.750> a<00:05:48.960> way<00:05:49.140> that<00:05:49.440> and<00:05:49.620> you<00:05:49.860> can

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
hold it in a way that and you can

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.410 
hold it in a way that and you can
discover<00:05:50.250> it<00:05:50.370> for<00:05:50.430> yourself<00:05:50.550> but<00:05:51.090> it<00:05:51.180> needs<00:05:51.360> to

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
discover it for yourself but it needs to

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.030 
discover it for yourself but it needs to
be<00:05:51.570> in<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:51.870> way<00:05:52.020> that<00:05:52.290> none<00:05:52.500> of<00:05:52.590> the<00:05:52.650> pieces<00:05:52.800> can

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
be in a way that none of the pieces can

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.700 
be in a way that none of the pieces can
fall<00:05:53.250> off<00:05:54.020> you<00:05:55.020> never<00:05:55.110> want<00:05:55.380> anything<00:05:55.620> to

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
fall off you never want anything to

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.540 
fall off you never want anything to
touch<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.980> ground<00:05:56.130> that's<00:05:56.490> a<00:05:56.550> big<00:05:56.670> problem

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
touch the ground that's a big problem

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.630 
touch the ground that's a big problem
this<00:05:59.550> point<00:06:00.290> some<00:06:01.290> days<00:06:01.500> it'll<00:06:01.980> be<00:06:02.100> dirtier

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
this point some days it'll be dirtier

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.980 
this point some days it'll be dirtier
than<00:06:02.760> other<00:06:02.910> days<00:06:03.060> depending<00:06:03.480> on<00:06:03.600> how<00:06:03.870> much

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
than other days depending on how much

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.110 
than other days depending on how much
ice<00:06:04.170> cream<00:06:04.200> we<00:06:04.470> did<00:06:04.620> but<00:06:05.280> usually<00:06:05.820> these<00:06:05.910> white

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
ice cream we did but usually these white

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.070 
ice cream we did but usually these white
pieces<00:06:06.330> need<00:06:06.570> to<00:06:06.600> be<00:06:06.660> scrubbed<00:06:06.960> pretty<00:06:07.170> well

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
pieces need to be scrubbed pretty well

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.820 
pieces need to be scrubbed pretty well
with<00:06:10.080> that<00:06:10.260> same<00:06:10.530> little<00:06:10.770> scrub<00:06:11.100> brush

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.890 

be<00:06:14.670> very<00:06:14.850> careful<00:06:15.060> that<00:06:15.330> you<00:06:15.420> don't<00:06:15.510> knock<00:06:15.720> the

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
be very careful that you don't knock the

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.150 
be very careful that you don't knock the
springs<00:06:16.230> out<00:06:16.410> they<00:06:16.590> can<00:06:16.710> be<00:06:16.800> very<00:06:16.890> hard<00:06:17.070> to

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
springs out they can be very hard to

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.620 
springs out they can be very hard to
find<00:06:17.430> if<00:06:17.610> you<00:06:17.700> do<00:06:17.880> it's<00:06:18.030> not<00:06:18.180> a<00:06:18.210> big<00:06:18.360> deal<00:06:18.510> you

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
find if you do it's not a big deal you

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.330 
find if you do it's not a big deal you
can<00:06:18.690> put<00:06:18.900> them<00:06:18.990> back<00:06:19.020> in<00:06:19.290> but<00:06:19.950> you<00:06:20.100> don't<00:06:20.220> want

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
can put them back in but you don't want

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.000 
can put them back in but you don't want
to<00:06:20.400> lose<00:06:20.550> those<00:06:20.760> Springs<00:06:21.090> that's<00:06:21.300> a<00:06:21.360> problem

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
to lose those Springs that's a problem

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.470 
to lose those Springs that's a problem
now<00:06:23.010> this<00:06:23.160> is<00:06:23.310> the<00:06:23.430> first<00:06:23.670> of<00:06:23.880> the<00:06:24.000> two<00:06:24.150> large

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
now this is the first of the two large

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.470 
now this is the first of the two large
shaft<00:06:24.810> pieces<00:06:26.210> definitely<00:06:27.210> want<00:06:27.330> to<00:06:27.390> get

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
shaft pieces definitely want to get

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.060 
shaft pieces definitely want to get
inside<00:06:27.720> here<00:06:28.050> with<00:06:28.200> the<00:06:28.410> scrub<00:06:28.620> brush<00:06:28.740> because

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
inside here with the scrub brush because

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.800 
inside here with the scrub brush because
there's<00:06:29.220> a<00:06:29.280> lot<00:06:29.460> of<00:06:29.550> grease<00:06:29.790> that<00:06:30.060> we<00:06:30.660> actually

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
there's a lot of grease that we actually

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.330 
there's a lot of grease that we actually
put<00:06:31.140> on<00:06:31.290> there<00:06:31.440> we<00:06:31.560> actually<00:06:31.890> put<00:06:32.070> some

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
put on there we actually put some

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.280 
put on there we actually put some
lubricant<00:06:32.880> in<00:06:33.000> there<00:06:33.180> so<00:06:33.930> you<00:06:33.990> want<00:06:34.080> to<00:06:34.200> make

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
lubricant in there so you want to make

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:40.460 
lubricant in there so you want to make
sure<00:06:34.410> you're<00:06:34.560> getting<00:06:34.740> all<00:06:34.860> that<00:06:35.010> out<00:06:39.290> be<00:06:40.290> very

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470

careful and make sure you get all the
pieces<00:06:41.910> inside<00:06:42.030> as<00:06:42.330> well<00:06:42.480> it's<00:06:42.660> easy<00:06:42.780> to<00:06:42.870> skip

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
pieces inside as well it's easy to skip

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.720 
pieces inside as well it's easy to skip
over<00:06:43.260> this<00:06:43.410> part<00:06:43.500> but<00:06:43.860> a<00:06:44.040> lot<00:06:44.520> of<00:06:44.610> ice<00:06:44.700> cream

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
over this part but a lot of ice cream

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.180 
over this part but a lot of ice cream
gets<00:06:45.060> stuck<00:06:45.240> to<00:06:45.360> that<00:06:45.510> piece<00:06:45.770> I'm<00:06:46.770> definitely

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
gets stuck to that piece I'm definitely
