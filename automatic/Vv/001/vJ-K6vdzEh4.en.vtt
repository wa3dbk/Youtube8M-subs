back in 2009 with about 50 feeding sites

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.780 
back in 2009 with about 50 feeding sites
and<00:01:29.960> gradually<00:01:30.960> began<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> expand<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.730> we

the<00:01:56.549> stage<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.930> awakening

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the stage one is that the awakening

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.180 
the stage one is that the awakening
stage<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.729> then<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.060> second<00:02:00.479> phase<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
stage and then the second phase is the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
is stage restructuring estates

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.029 
is stage restructuring estates
so<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> feel<00:02:08.610> finally<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.690> leave<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.380> area<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
so I feel finally we leave the area and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.970 
so I feel finally we leave the area and
they<00:02:11.459> become<00:02:11.730> self-reliant<00:02:12.390> community<00:02:13.350> our

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
they become self-reliant community our

they become self-reliant community our
goal<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:15.000> three-year<00:02:15.930> project<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.709> to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
goal for this three-year project is to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.850 
goal for this three-year project is to
have<00:02:17.310> ceremony<00:02:17.940> attrition<00:02:18.480> we<00:02:19.260> hope<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
have ceremony attrition we hope that

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.820 
have ceremony attrition we hope that
after<00:02:20.069> three<00:02:20.550> years<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.910> implementation

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
after three years of implementation

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.440 
after three years of implementation
these<00:02:22.830> children<00:02:23.550> who<00:02:23.760> are<00:02:23.790> under<00:02:24.060> weights

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
these children who are under weights

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.080 
these children who are under weights
will<00:02:24.930> be<00:02:25.080> eradicated<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> first<00:02:26.850> phase

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
will be eradicated so the first phase

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.120 
will be eradicated so the first phase
now<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.570> increasing<00:02:28.110> those<00:02:28.260> feeding<00:02:28.650> programs

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
now is increasing those feeding programs

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.280 
now is increasing those feeding programs
that<00:02:29.850> create<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.420> reliable<00:02:31.020> sustainable

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
concern and deep lab I don't think that

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.490 
concern and deep lab I don't think that
it<00:05:22.919> will<00:05:23.070> be<00:05:23.130> very<00:05:23.520> very<00:05:23.760> successful
