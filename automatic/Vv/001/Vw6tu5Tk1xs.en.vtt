00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
there was a couple of limitations or one

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.180 
there was a couple of limitations or one
of<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.110> things<00:01:02.290> that<00:01:02.380> it's<00:01:02.650> missing<00:01:03.040> is<00:01:03.160> the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
of the things that it's missing is the

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.429 
of the things that it's missing is the
lockout<00:01:04.000> capability<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.720> suspension<00:01:05.049> so

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
lockout capability and the suspension so

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.999 
lockout capability and the suspension so
you<00:01:05.500> can't<00:01:05.799> make<00:01:06.040> this<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.610> forks<00:01:07.770> lock<00:01:08.770> into

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
you can't make this the forks lock into

place<00:01:09.280> so<00:01:09.700> when<00:01:09.880> you're<00:01:10.000> climbing<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.840> bike

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
place so when you're climbing the bike

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.330 
place so when you're climbing the bike
is<00:01:11.229> flexing<00:01:11.649> every<00:01:11.799> time<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.009> pedal<00:01:12.159> your

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
is flexing every time you pedal your

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.740 
is flexing every time you pedal your
kind<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.579> burning<00:01:12.759> energy<00:01:12.939> doing<00:01:13.360> that<00:01:13.509> and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
kind of burning energy doing that and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.620 
kind of burning energy doing that and
