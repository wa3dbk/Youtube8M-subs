00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.310
 Hmm 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:17.260
 Yes it is a practical course of the star effect This time it is Paclow I use it 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.560
 I would like to create a party black animation that bounces like this 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.560
 Yes 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:30.590
 a First, let's enter the composition text. 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:36.580
 The length of the crowded director I think enough or if there even 5 seconds 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:41.809
 I will make one picture here. First of all, it is a plane for applying particles. 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:48.050
 Apply track code a granular from the effect 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:50.610
 Well this is happening, but now it's spreading in all directions now but here 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.660
 Gravity in physics 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:00.370
 If you add gravity 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.370
 Those that occur will be in the form going down toward the bottom 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:10.830
 There is further placed a plain It is another factor here 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:14.720
 I do not mind making the same thing in Black Hiramei, so make this a 3 layer 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.720
 Keep the name as the floor 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.280
 a If you do so , just look from the side 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.280
 Add a city turn 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.380
 Yes rotate 90 degrees 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.690
 Bring it below the text layer 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.990
 In addition here to the camera even if it repeated one 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.579
 The camera is also a little 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.579
 We will have to to 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:52.900
 Yes, I'll go back to particle settings, right here 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.900
 I will add bounce settings in the physics section above . 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:04.850
 If you choose the floor layer as the floor here, it is here 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.780
 The particle of the particle will be in the form of bounce 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.350
 Come on actually look at the camera view 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:17.360
 What happened from here 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:21.890
 It is a state of on are also caught in the floor of the layer just in such form 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.170
 Then I would like to make various adjustments from here 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.890
 First of all to the race and view 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.900
 You are the first I source is the emitter, but Re epo 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.790
 Not a point but a bigger box 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.629
 There is a direction 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.629
 I would like to keep it rotated 90 degrees 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.110
 Yeah it is not flowing sort 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.220
 Sideways 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.220
 And then 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.790
 You have a little changed direction since being rotated, but in such a form 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.000
 We will decide the size of the generation source. Actually, it will be adjusted while looking with a normal camera. 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.690
 I think it is good 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.250
 It occurs further 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.250
 It does not occur in order little by little, but at a stretch 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.170
 First 10,000 buildings 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.730
 Ray 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.730
 It will occur at once and stop occurring in about 3 frames 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.150
 Yes I set the life to 4 seconds 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.030
 Size too 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.870
 Large from a small place 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.069
 It is a state, such as yes now 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.430
 The rest is already velocity and I will adjust the spread etc. 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.840
 To various 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:59.470
 I think whether it is good to be a random hill slope Bound random addiction 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:05.670
 You can adjust the size of the bound child 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.670
 Well, here's a: Add one adjustment layer 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:15.230
 Also of trap code 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.230
 Staff Road I will add this to the light 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.130
 Please choose the color of light 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.130
 I will have Christmas for the Diet for the time being 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:35.250
 After that , I apply transition effect to the station. 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.250
 It is completed To give to adjust to come gradually visible from the bottom to the top 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:46.060
 After that, let's fine-tune other than the position of the particle and the camera 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:51.580
 Yes I did preview like this 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:55.230
 It is bound beautifully, isn't it? In this case, it is the text of the grandchild, and it is strange 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:00.330
 The point is say that would cut out and timing 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:05.560
 Even if you don't do anything special, you will see it there and suddenly 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:09.790
 I think that I think we not much problem be with this issued a, for example, cut 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.080
 Oh yes, it 's such a bound, or that kind of physics 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:17.080
 If it works well 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:19.560
 You can make more various particles, so try to adjust it like this 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.560
 Please give me
