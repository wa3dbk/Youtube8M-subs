and wendler the previous cycle I got up
to<00:01:19.490> 396<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:21.000> think<00:01:21.270> pounds<00:01:21.689> now<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> did<00:01:22.350> eight

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
to 396 I think pounds now I did eight

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.190 
to 396 I think pounds now I did eight
reps<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.580> was<00:01:23.729> thinking<00:01:23.880> maybe<00:01:24.750> six

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
reps of that so I was thinking maybe six

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
reps of that so I was thinking maybe six
reps<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> app<00:01:25.770> gave<00:01:26.009> me<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> target<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.670> six

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
reps the app gave me the target of six

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.100 
reps the app gave me the target of six
reps<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.390> thought<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.750> would<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.930> nice

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
reps so I thought that would be a nice

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.740 
reps so I thought that would be a nice
target<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.619> hit<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.700> first<00:01:29.939> rep<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.540> the

here is that i've said it before I feel

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.050 
here is that i've said it before I feel
like<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:09.720> fine<00:02:10.379> after<00:02:10.979> my<00:02:11.099> form<00:02:11.340> solid<00:02:11.700> it's

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
like I'm fine after my form solid it's

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.309 
like I'm fine after my form solid it's
getting<00:02:12.360> better<00:02:12.510> until

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
getting better until

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.199 
getting better until
get<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.829> heavier<00:02:14.129> weights<00:02:14.400> not<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
get to the heavier weights not the

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.580 
get to the heavier weights not the
really<00:02:15.390> heavy<00:02:15.599> weights<00:02:15.870> like<00:02:16.079> this<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.439> for

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
really heavy weights like this one for

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.289 
really heavy weights like this one for
example<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> said<00:02:17.879> also<00:02:18.060> feeling

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
example and like I said also feeling

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.390 
example and like I said also feeling
great<00:02:18.540> today<00:02:18.659> and<00:02:19.590> at<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.709> point<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.159> does

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
great today and at that point it does

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.920 
great today and at that point it does
start<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.790> deteriorate<00:02:20.999> so<00:02:21.510> I'm<00:02:21.719> going<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
start to deteriorate so I'm going to

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.739 
start to deteriorate so I'm going to
keep<00:02:22.109> working<00:02:22.319> on<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.799> but<00:02:23.150> I'm<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.569> have

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:24.749 
keep working on it but I'm going to have

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.099 
keep working on it but I'm going to have
to<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.930> bare<00:02:25.319> with<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:26.519> days<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.299> sets

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
to just bare with the days the the sets

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.300 
to just bare with the days the the sets
when<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.499> technique<00:02:28.799> isn't<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.249> strong

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
when the technique isn't so strong

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.280 
when the technique isn't so strong
because<00:02:29.700> otherwise<00:02:30.060> I'm<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.049> spend

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
because otherwise I'm going to spend

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.860 
because otherwise I'm going to spend
forever<00:02:31.469> trying<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.519> build<00:02:32.730> up<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.659> don't

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
forever trying to build up and I don't

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.449 
forever trying to build up and I don't
wanna<00:02:33.989> do<00:02:34.109> that<00:02:34.139> so<00:02:34.500> as<00:02:34.769> long<00:02:35.189> as<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
wanna do that so as long as the

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.979 
wanna do that so as long as the
technique<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.909> safe<00:02:36.180> which<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.540> believe<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.959> is

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
technique is safe which I believe it is

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.409 
technique is safe which I believe it is
it's<00:02:37.319> not<00:02:37.500> great<00:02:37.769> it's<00:02:37.950> no<00:02:38.159> by<00:02:38.430> no<00:02:38.459> means<00:02:38.879> ideal

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:39.419 
it's not great it's no by no means ideal

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.599 
it's not great it's no by no means ideal
but<00:02:40.049> i<00:02:40.079> believe<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.590> safe<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.219> i<00:02:41.250> will

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
but i believe it's safe and so i will

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:42.940 
but i believe it's safe and so i will
keep<00:02:41.790> trying<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.209> do<00:02:42.269> i'm<00:02:42.450> doing<00:02:42.689> which<00:02:42.840> is

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
keep trying to do i'm doing which is

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.129 
keep trying to do i'm doing which is
incorporate<00:02:43.950> my<00:02:44.159> proper<00:02:45.120> form<00:02:45.419> as<00:02:45.659> much<00:02:45.900> as<00:02:46.049> i

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
incorporate my proper form as much as i

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.440 
incorporate my proper form as much as i
can<00:02:46.349> but<00:02:47.010> if<00:02:47.250> i'm<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.609> heavy<00:02:47.909> and<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.269> breaks

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
can but if i'm going heavy and it breaks

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.869 
can but if i'm going heavy and it breaks
down<00:02:48.599> i'm<00:02:49.079> not<00:02:49.409> gonna<00:02:49.590> give<00:02:50.310> up<00:02:50.340> because<00:02:50.669> i

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
down i'm not gonna give up because i

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.789 
down i'm not gonna give up because i
don't<00:02:51.150> want<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.480> last<00:02:52.139> out<00:02:52.319> don't<00:02:52.560> want<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.739> go

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
don't want to last out don't want to go

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.530 
don't want to last out don't want to go
back<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.010> scratch<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.579> build<00:02:53.730> up<00:02:53.879> from<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
back to scratch and build up from the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.990 
back to scratch and build up from the
start<00:02:54.780> because<00:02:54.900> that'll<00:02:55.139> take<00:02:55.290> forever<00:02:55.439> and<00:02:56.000> i

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
start because that'll take forever and i

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.330 
start because that'll take forever and i
don't<00:02:57.780> think<00:02:57.959> it's<00:02:58.079> necessary<00:02:58.469> anyway<00:02:59.099> this

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
don't think it's necessary anyway this

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.280 
don't think it's necessary anyway this
is<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.609> first<00:02:59.939> of<00:03:00.150> my<00:03:00.269> five<00:03:00.510> sets<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.930> 10<00:03:01.139> that

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
is the first of my five sets of 10 that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.740 
is the first of my five sets of 10 that
was<00:03:01.439> back<00:03:01.590> down<00:03:01.829> 2<00:03:02.040> 319<00:03:02.639> pounds<00:03:03.000> hundred<00:03:03.419> 45

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
was back down 2 319 pounds hundred 45

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.740 
was back down 2 319 pounds hundred 45
kilos<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:04.889> it<00:03:05.010> was<00:03:05.129> hard<00:03:05.370> again<00:03:06.239> as<00:03:06.480> has<00:03:06.629> been

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
kilos and it was hard again as has been

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.720 
kilos and it was hard again as has been
the<00:03:06.810> case<00:03:07.019> recently<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:07.620> only<00:03:07.889> got<00:03:08.129> three<00:03:08.459> sets

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
the case recently I only got three sets

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.939 
the case recently I only got three sets
of<00:03:08.849> 10<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.299> was<00:03:09.780> absolutely<00:03:10.019> ruined<00:03:10.739> at<00:03:10.829> that

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:10.949 
of 10 I was absolutely ruined at that

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.699 
of 10 I was absolutely ruined at that
point<00:03:11.219> I<00:03:11.400> didn't<00:03:11.790> want<00:03:11.939> to<00:03:12.000> push<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.299> my<00:03:12.709> my

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
point I didn't want to push it my my

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.250 
point I didn't want to push it my my
form<00:03:14.010> still<00:03:14.400> wasn't<00:03:14.730> great<00:03:14.939> the<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:16.049> plus

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
form still wasn't great the the plus

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.899 
form still wasn't great the the plus
reps<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.739> really<00:03:16.980> took<00:03:17.099> out<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.400> me<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:17.759> I've

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
reps it really took out of me so I've

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.300 
reps it really took out of me so I've
played<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.419> safe<00:03:18.659> and<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.989> left<00:03:19.169> it<00:03:19.349> there<00:03:19.530> now

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
played it safe and I left it there now

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.309 
played it safe and I left it there now
this<00:03:20.549> is<00:03:20.609> some<00:03:20.819> accessory<00:03:21.299> work<00:03:21.509> as<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.199> can

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
this is some accessory work as you can

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.800 
this is some accessory work as you can
see<00:03:22.530> i'm<00:03:22.919> doing<00:03:23.609> some<00:03:23.879> i<00:03:24.269> forgot<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.659> name

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
see i'm doing some i forgot the name

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.390 
see i'm doing some i forgot the name
again<00:03:25.169> someone<00:03:25.500> reminded<00:03:25.799> but<00:03:25.919> i<00:03:25.979> forgot<00:03:26.250> it

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
again someone reminded but i forgot it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.219 
again someone reminded but i forgot it
some<00:03:26.879> kind<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.120> reverse<00:03:27.389> bench<00:03:27.810> press<00:03:28.019> here

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
some kind of reverse bench press here

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.729 
some kind of reverse bench press here
obviously<00:03:28.379> it's<00:03:28.709> like<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:28.859> row<00:03:29.209> action<00:03:30.209> i<00:03:30.739> did

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
obviously it's like a row action i did

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.679 
obviously it's like a row action i did
three<00:03:32.040> sets<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.489> about<00:03:32.790> twelve<00:03:33.150> reps<00:03:33.419> of<00:03:33.569> these

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
three sets of about twelve reps of these

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.080 
three sets of about twelve reps of these
now<00:03:33.930> i'm<00:03:34.379> actually<00:03:34.590> starting<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.519> like<00:03:35.639> these

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
now i'm actually starting to like these

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.249 
now i'm actually starting to like these
have<00:03:36.239> done<00:03:36.329> it<00:03:36.419> a<00:03:36.449> couple<00:03:36.509> of<00:03:36.750> times<00:03:36.959> recently

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:37.259 
have done it a couple of times recently

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.679 
have done it a couple of times recently
i<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.979> because<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.939> fact<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.269> my<00:03:39.449> feet

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
i like it because the fact that my feet

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:40.849 
i like it because the fact that my feet
you're<00:03:39.810> up<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.079> chair<00:03:40.169> as<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.709> see

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
you're up on a chair as you can see

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.309 
you're up on a chair as you can see
there<00:03:41.040> means<00:03:41.370> i<00:03:41.579> can<00:03:41.759> kind<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.150> vary<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
there means i can kind of vary the

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.649 
there means i can kind of vary the
amount<00:03:43.409> of<00:03:43.769> resistance<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.400> if<00:03:44.609> I<00:03:45.060> kind<00:03:45.599> of

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
amount of resistance so if I kind of

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.539 
amount of resistance so if I kind of
rock<00:03:45.959> my<00:03:46.109> body<00:03:46.259> forwards<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.829> bit<00:03:47.009> then<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.370> make

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
rock my body forwards a bit then it make

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.729 
rock my body forwards a bit then it make
it<00:03:47.759> means<00:03:48.090> I've<00:03:48.269> got<00:03:48.299> less<00:03:48.750> resistance<00:03:49.650> to

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
it means I've got less resistance to

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.619 
it means I've got less resistance to
pull<00:03:49.889> up<00:03:50.040> if<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.609> do<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.909> opposite<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.329> means<00:03:51.509> I

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
pull up if I do the opposite it means I

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.390 
pull up if I do the opposite it means I
have<00:03:51.659> more<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.109> obviously<00:03:52.379> as<00:03:52.470> like<00:03:52.590> as<00:03:53.069> I<00:03:53.220> get

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
have more so obviously as like as I get

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.209 
have more so obviously as like as I get

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
I thought you know what let's do it i

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.040 
I thought you know what let's do it i
want<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.280> hit<00:04:53.400> some<00:04:53.580> rear<00:04:53.760> delts<00:04:54.150> because<00:04:54.900> they

obviously<00:04:55.260> I'm<00:04:55.560> not<00:04:55.590> involved<00:04:56.280> in<00:04:56.370> any<00:04:56.550> of<00:04:56.640> my

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
obviously I'm not involved in any of my
