00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
how I feel I feel like my the math in my

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.500 
how I feel I feel like my the math in my
head<00:04:09.209> tells<00:04:09.780> me<00:04:10.019> that<00:04:10.549> we're<00:04:11.549> just<00:04:11.849> that

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
everything's just science and and

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.890 
everything's just science and and
randomness<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.410> patterns<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.519> but<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.419> main

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
randomness and patterns and but the main

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.240 
randomness and patterns and but the main
thing<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.320> feel<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.829> it's<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:20.070> great

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
thing I feel is that it's a great

to<00:05:06.700> a<00:05:06.730> certain<00:05:06.970> age<00:05:07.240> we<00:05:07.540> were<00:05:07.690> made<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:07.990> go<00:05:08.350> to

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
to a certain age we were made to go to

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.430 
to a certain age we were made to go to
Catholic<00:05:08.770> like<00:05:09.430> after<00:05:09.820> school<00:05:10.060> training

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
Catholic like after school training

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.040

until<00:05:11.440> we<00:05:12.010> got<00:05:12.130> our<00:05:12.280> first<00:05:12.520> communion<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.960> she

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
until we got our first communion so she

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.830 
until we got our first communion so she
thought<00:05:14.290> if<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.530> give<00:05:14.770> a<00:05:14.800> kid<00:05:14.920> that<00:05:15.340> far<00:05:15.840> after

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
thought if you give a kid that far after

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.960 
thought if you give a kid that far after
that<00:05:16.870> you'd<00:05:17.290> let<00:05:17.650> him<00:05:17.740> choose<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:18.580> obviously

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
that you'd let him choose and obviously

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.210 
that you'd let him choose and obviously
it<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.450> know<00:05:19.570> whatever<00:05:19.810> I<00:05:19.960> was<00:05:20.230> 10<00:05:20.890> years<00:05:20.920> old

it you know whatever I was 10 years old

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.330 
it you know whatever I was 10 years old
if<00:05:21.460> I<00:05:21.550> was<00:05:21.970> told<00:05:22.150> I<00:05:22.240> didn't<00:05:22.420> have<00:05:22.510> to<00:05:22.600> go<00:05:22.690> before

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
if I was told I didn't have to go before

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.100 
if I was told I didn't have to go before
certainly<00:05:24.340> didn't<00:05:24.550> want<00:05:24.700> to<00:05:24.760> go<00:05:24.880> but<00:05:25.690> I'm<00:05:25.990> glad

certainly didn't want to go but I'm glad

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.600 
certainly didn't want to go but I'm glad
she<00:05:26.230> did<00:05:26.560> that<00:05:26.650> because<00:05:26.920> I<00:05:26.950> understand<00:05:27.520> what

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
she did that because I understand what

it's<00:07:37.090> worth<00:07:37.360> it<00:07:37.629> because<00:07:37.870> maybe<00:07:38.680> there's

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 
it's worth it because maybe there's

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:41.460 
it's worth it because maybe there's
something<00:07:39.219> there
