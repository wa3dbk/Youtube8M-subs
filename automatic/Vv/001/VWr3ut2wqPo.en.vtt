00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.860 
back here we've got a small fan that
also<00:02:34.569> has<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> high-low<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:36.340> an<00:02:36.459> off<00:02:36.700> mode<00:02:37.000> so

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
also has a high-low and an off mode so

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.839 
also has a high-low and an off mode so
if<00:02:38.230> you're<00:02:38.379> using<00:02:38.620> SSD<00:02:39.220> as<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.459> probably<00:02:39.700> can

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
if you're using SSD as you probably can

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.790 
if you're using SSD as you probably can
leave<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.209> in<00:02:40.269> off<00:02:40.450> mode<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.959> not<00:02:41.500> have<00:02:41.680> to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
leave it in off mode and not have to

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.490 
leave it in off mode and not have to
worry<00:02:41.980> about<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:42.400> heating<00:02:42.640> up<00:02:42.730> too<00:02:42.909> much<00:02:43.060> and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
worry about it heating up too much and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.339 
worry about it heating up too much and
with<00:02:44.500> 5400<00:02:45.280> RPM<00:02:45.670> drives<00:02:46.000> yeah<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.080> probably

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
with 5400 RPM drives yeah you probably

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.820 
with 5400 RPM drives yeah you probably
would<00:02:47.590> be<00:02:47.709> good<00:02:47.860> with<00:02:48.040> with<00:02:48.459> low<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.480> low<00:02:50.050> spit

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
would be good with with low a low spit

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.229 
would be good with with low a low spit
on<00:02:50.950> low<00:02:51.099> speed<00:02:51.159> but<00:02:51.909> if<00:02:52.000> you're<00:02:52.120> running

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
on low speed but if you're running

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.690 
on low speed but if you're running
higher-end<00:02:52.840> 7200<00:02:53.620> RPM<00:02:53.950> drives<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.370> may<00:02:54.520> need

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
higher-end 7200 RPM drives you may need

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.180 
higher-end 7200 RPM drives you may need
to<00:02:54.850> push<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.630> fan<00:02:55.840> up<00:02:56.050> too<00:02:56.200> high<00:02:56.380> too<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:57.160> keep

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
to push the fan up too high too to keep

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.150 
to push the fan up too high too to keep
it

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
it

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.960 
it
bullets<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:58.910> place<00:02:59.560> this<00:03:00.560> does<00:03:00.830> support<00:03:01.190> say

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
bullets in place this does support say

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.090 
bullets in place this does support say
two<00:03:02.030> one<00:03:02.300> two<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.660> three<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.530> have<00:03:03.740> speeds

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
two one two and three so you have speeds

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.930 
two one two and three so you have speeds
up<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.400> six<00:03:04.610> gigabits<00:03:05.180> per<00:03:05.240> second<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.940> you

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
up to six gigabits per second and you

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.730 
up to six gigabits per second and you
can<00:03:08.090> see<00:03:08.270> on<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.540> back<00:03:08.690> here<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:09.440> we've<00:03:09.590> got

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
can see on the back here that we've got

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.250 
can see on the back here that we've got
six<00:03:10.070> SATA<00:03:10.340> ports<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.150> each<00:03:11.300> Drive<00:03:11.720> has<00:03:11.990> an

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
six SATA ports so each Drive has an

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.190 
six SATA ports so each Drive has an
individual<00:03:12.890> data<00:03:13.850> connection<00:03:14.330> so<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:14.960> can

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
individual data connection so you can

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.710 
individual data connection so you can
use<00:03:15.410> these<00:03:15.850> individually<00:03:16.850> or<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.450> can

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
use these individually or you can

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.440 
use these individually or you can
connect<00:03:18.110> them<00:03:18.260> into<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.920> rate<00:03:19.550> controller<00:03:19.940> as<00:03:20.150> I

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
right here we have a quick little

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.840 
right here we have a quick little
diagram<00:03:50.120> that's<00:03:50.750> right<00:03:51.440> on<00:03:51.710> the<00:03:51.950> casein

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
diagram that's right on the casein

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.170 
diagram that's right on the casein
itself<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:54.470> shows<00:03:54.710> all<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:54.980> different

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
itself that shows all the different

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.330 
itself that shows all the different
reports<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.390> they're<00:03:56.690> all<00:03:56.780> labeled<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.350> it

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
reports and they're all labeled and it

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.360 
reports and they're all labeled and it
is<00:03:58.550> a<00:03:58.580> full<00:03:59.000> metal<00:03:59.510> construction<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:01.010> this<00:04:01.220> is

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
is a full metal construction so this is

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.360 
is a full metal construction so this is
very<00:04:01.670> solid<00:04:02.330> there's<00:04:02.840> no<00:04:03.770> way<00:04:03.950> you're<00:04:04.190> going

bay has an anti vibration technology and

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.420 
bay has an anti vibration technology and
EMI<00:04:34.220> grounding<00:04:34.790> so<00:04:35.419> this<00:04:36.260> right<00:04:36.470> here<00:04:36.530> grounds

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
EMI grounding so this right here grounds

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.180 
EMI grounding so this right here grounds
the<00:04:37.610> dried<00:04:38.330> bay<00:04:38.540> and<00:04:38.780> also<00:04:39.320> helps<00:04:39.620> reduce<00:04:39.740> the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
the dried bay and also helps reduce the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.730 
the dried bay and also helps reduce the
vibration<00:04:40.550> of<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.270> drives<00:04:41.870> running<00:04:42.290> in<00:04:42.530> the

vibration of the drives running in the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.930 
vibration of the drives running in the
metal<00:04:42.980> cage<00:04:44.260> this<00:04:45.310> connection<00:04:46.310> itself<00:04:46.640> is

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
metal cage this connection itself is

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.500 
metal cage this connection itself is
called<00:04:47.270> an<00:04:47.450> eagle<00:04:47.720> hook<00:04:47.870> connection<00:04:48.320> so<00:04:48.830> it

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
called an eagle hook connection so it
