00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.190 
today I'm going to show you how to
freeze<00:00:05.790> Brutus<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.509> different<00:00:06.870> way<00:00:06.960> if<00:00:07.109> you

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
freeze Brutus a different way if you

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.810 
freeze Brutus a different way if you
haven't<00:00:07.500> seen<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.859> other<00:00:08.189> way<00:00:08.429> I'm<00:00:08.490> not<00:00:08.670> too

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
haven't seen the other way I'm not too

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.400 
haven't seen the other way I'm not too
sure<00:00:09.030> if<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.210> still<00:00:09.420> works<00:00:09.450> there<00:00:10.110> will<00:00:10.230> be<00:00:10.320> an

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
sure if it still works there will be an

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.110 
sure if it still works there will be an
annotation<00:00:10.800> on<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.099> screen<00:00:11.219> because<00:00:11.820> that

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
annotation on the screen because that

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.999 
annotation on the screen because that
way<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.300> quite<00:00:12.509> cool<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.990> quite<00:00:13.410> weird<00:00:13.740> how<00:00:13.950> to

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
way is quite cool and quite weird how to

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.010 
way is quite cool and quite weird how to
do<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.460> one<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.120> lot<00:00:15.389> more<00:00:15.570> easier

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
do it but this one is a lot more easier

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.590 
do it but this one is a lot more easier
and<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.949> lot<00:00:17.190> more<00:00:17.250> useful<00:00:17.609> really<00:00:18.090> because<00:00:18.570> you

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
and a lot more useful really because you

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.510 
and a lot more useful really because you
can<00:00:18.869> just<00:00:18.900> keep<00:00:19.320> Brewers<00:00:19.740> here<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.189> I'm<00:00:20.490> not

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
can just keep Brewers here and I'm not

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.160 
can just keep Brewers here and I'm not
too<00:00:20.820> sure<00:00:21.029> if<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.300> would<00:00:21.359> work<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.720> any<00:00:21.990> other

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
too sure if it would work on any other

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.650 
too sure if it would work on any other
locations<00:00:22.859> where<00:00:23.070> he<00:00:23.250> actually<00:00:23.340> spawns<00:00:23.939> but

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
locations where he actually spawns but

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.269 
locations where he actually spawns but
it<00:00:24.900> could<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> guys<00:00:25.920> want<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> try

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
it could do so if you guys want to try

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.160 
it could do so if you guys want to try
it<00:00:26.369> out<00:00:26.519> then<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.300> by<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.599> means<00:00:27.810> use<00:00:27.990> this

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
it out then the by all means use this

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.490 
it out then the by all means use this
method<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.730> like<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.449> his<00:00:30.689> spawn

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
method to like do it on his spawn

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.709 
method to like do it on his spawn
locations<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.460> stuff<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.880> right<00:00:33.510> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
locations and stuff like that right to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.630 
locations and stuff like that right to
do<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> glitch<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.559> want<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.250> zombie

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
make sure it's like an angle like it

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770 
make sure it's like an angle like it
like<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.430> seen<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.270> not<00:00:54.420> like

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
like I have seen you like it's not like

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.080 
like I have seen you like it's not like
dead<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.140> straight<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.789> just

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
dead on straight and then I just

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.279 
dead on straight and then I just
fast-forward<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> don't

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
fast-forward it here because I don't

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.900 
fast-forward it here because I don't
want<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.469> skip<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.399> wanted<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> show

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
want to skip it because I wanted to show

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.910 
want to skip it because I wanted to show
you<00:00:59.940> guys<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.570> actually<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.199> sit

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you guys that you actually have to sit

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.090 
you guys that you actually have to sit
here<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.480> fast<00:01:03.480> forward<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.930> fast<00:01:04.680> forwarded

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
here so fast forward it fast forwarded

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.219 
here so fast forward it fast forwarded
this<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.080> how<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
this so you can actually just see how to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.450 
this so you can actually just see how to
kill<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> zombies<00:01:07.890> because<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.310> what

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
kill the zombies because this is what

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.100 
kill the zombies because this is what
you<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.600> wait<00:01:09.900> here

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
you have to do you have to wait here

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.440 
you have to do you have to wait here
apparently<00:01:10.590> Brutus<00:01:11.100> spawns<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.580> Ram<00:01:11.790> six<00:01:12.180> to

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
apparently Brutus spawns like Ram six to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.770 
apparently Brutus spawns like Ram six to
seven<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> then<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.850> these<00:01:15.390> spawns

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
seven and then like just these spawns

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.929 
seven and then like just these spawns
randomly<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:17.880> know

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
randomly it's like you see don't know

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.820 
randomly it's like you see don't know
you<00:01:18.210> guys<00:01:18.390> will<00:01:18.600> probably<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.680> see

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you guys will probably know as you see

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.320 
you guys will probably know as you see
we're<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.280> killing<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.700> zombies<00:01:21.150> here

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330

we're just like killing or zombies here
waiting<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.229> Brutus<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.710> spawn<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> doesn't

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
waiting for Brutus to spawn it doesn't

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.190 
waiting for Brutus to spawn it doesn't
actually<00:01:23.400> spawned<00:01:23.880> till<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> next<00:01:24.299> round<00:01:24.630> so

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
actually spawned till the next round so

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.219 
actually spawned till the next round so
we<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.860> let<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.850> labor<00:01:27.229> it's
