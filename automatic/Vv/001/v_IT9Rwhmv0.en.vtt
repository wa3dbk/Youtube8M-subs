00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:05.199
 trends 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.809
 many of us grew up seeing how 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.570
 in science fiction movies 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.730
 it was enough to bring the eye to a reader 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.710
 to enter a maximum vault 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.960
 security or as with a couple of images 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.570
 in a matter of seconds it was determined 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.489
 the identity of a criminal then in 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.099
 our days this type of technologies 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.349
 of identification are everywhere 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.720
 and we use them to enter our 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.390
 homes and jobs or to unlock the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.280
 cellular for example in the process of 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.320
 Issuance or renewal of a license 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.750
 driving is usual to ask us 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.809
 verify our identity through a 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.489
 fingerprint scanner which in an open and 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.949
 Close your eyes filter the 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.989
 fingerprint features on a base 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.989
 of data and endorse our identity 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.260
 because behind this rapid process there is 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.940
 an extensive technological operation that 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.040
 allows to increase the levels of 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.890
 security in this type of transactions 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.960
 so we could see it when visiting the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.880
 olimpia facilities a company 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.550
 specialized in security services 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.610
 technology that works among others 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.570
 companies with more than 15 of the most banks 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.550
 of the country since the 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.740
 Company facilities is verified 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.930
 the identity of thousands of Colombians to 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.240
 daily paperwork such as the issuance of 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.640
 driving licenses permits for the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.860
 carrying weapons or entering events 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.680
 massive as concerts or matches 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.420
 soccer daniel medina olimpia manager 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.780
 spoke with technosphere about 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.259
 Main trends of the industry 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.259
 biometrics in the country 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.030
 and send biometric security is being 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.259
 three main challenges facing the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.080
 decreased impersonation 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.350
 identity in procedures and applications before 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.189
 entities and before the government 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.439
 the ease between presenting processes 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.210
 before the government before procedures that 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.240
 do not require the physical presence of 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.190
 people and the third the video surveillance 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.959
 through facial recognition in 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.620
 public principles such as 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.840
 Transmilenio stadiums and cities that 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.090
 allow to enter a scheme of cities 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.190
 smart other of the examples of 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.250
 advance of biometrics in the country is 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.770
 identical a specialized company from 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.230
 technology sector that recently 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.920
 got the innovation patent for a 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.870
 biometric authentication device 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.300
 It is a portable computer 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.830
 fingerprint that allows the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.140
 transaction authorization 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.330
 electronic payment of services and 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.970
 products the control of schedules and 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.840
 assistance or follow-up to processes 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.910
 logistics among others 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.239
 the system is accompanied by a 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.040
 central control and small terminals 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.110
 portable low cost biometrics or 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.950
 fixed that allow validation via 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.260
 telephone text messages datÃ¡fono o 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.330
 website is also compatible with 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.150
 information from the national registry 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.599
 or under the international standards of 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.599
 biometrics
