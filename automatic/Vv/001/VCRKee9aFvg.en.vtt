00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.350
 water that comes to the taps is not 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.910
 charged 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.069
 we pay only for the services of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.150
 treatment and distribution 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.519
 Is that why brasil? 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.340
 waste so much water 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.430
 when the house bills come in 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.090
 beginning of the month is always a discomfort 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.869
 this time the villain was the water bill 300 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.060
 real 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.609
 but we saved a few months 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.660
 was not consuming 46 in the cubic 1 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.420
 10 cubic meters of which is a gain 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.820
 We are learning to save is is 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.860
 so is taking effect 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.559
 water without worry is a 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.870
 old problem among Brazilians 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.450
 according to the ministry of cities 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.440
 Brazilian average of waste of water 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.030
 is practically 40% the number four 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.120
 times greater than that of 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.300
 developed as germany and japan by 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.379
 example where the index is below the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.230
 ten per hundred 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.570
 in these countries, the impact 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.540
 directly in the value of the account what 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.479
 helps to curb consumption that does not 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.420
 It happens in Brazil, we do not pay here. 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.630
 water as a collection resource 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.150
 by use is based only on the costs of 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.430
 services provided by companies 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.290
 supply is the service that the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.549
 operating components 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.299
 dealers charge for pick up 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.610
 water in the spring added water to treat and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.650
 distribute turner porn and if the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.960
 we paid for the water that we 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.210
 by the sewage that has been received to 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.460
 the sanitation companies to get 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.950
 in the value of the account the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.439
 supply of life to users in 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.399
 commercial residential categories 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.369
 industrial and public sectors for each 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.829
 there is a billing table in sÃ£o 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.829
 for example the minimum consumption of 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.759
 up to 10 cubic meters for residences 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.590
 It costs about $ 16 this specialist 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.469
 explains that the billing system 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.080
 adopted in European countries, which 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.710
 cost of raw and treated water can 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.870
 serve as a model for the 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.180
 brazil but complete that to diminish 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.630
 consumption is important. 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.230
 to adopt policies of awareness and 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.460
 reuse of water in Brazil we have less 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.500
 not more than 1% 2% of the water consumed 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.710
 is the reuse water 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.870
 we could reach if we were to take the 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.830
 spain israel japan case 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:45.210
 certainly more than 50% in some cases 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.210
 almost 100% of the water being reused
