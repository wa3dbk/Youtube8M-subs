00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.699
 it is alongside your case me it goes very 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.199
 well today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.420
 pretty special video you've seen 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.029
 lately that I had posted a video 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.560
 on the must but public number 2 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.710
 so today I propose you is a 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.359
 pretty original challenge which is however I 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.619
 went home a lot on youtube 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.870
 this challenge there and it was never done on 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.020
 in France anyway in america to 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.000
 usa and yes it has already been done that was 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.640
 passed by the Americans I was 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.650
 inspired this challenge but in France I 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.010
 go look everywhere everywhere 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.770
 all over 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.470
 I have never seen a single French but 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.810
 even a guy who has fifty buses these 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.730
 videos I've never seen a filthy top 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:00.270
 finance so I think I'm 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.920
 the first in France to make this challenge 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.019
 so I think you have seen right in 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.150
 down the site and I think you know 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.640
 what it's challenging is the extreme 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.609
 of niche abuse simply lodges 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.170
 the concept is to mix milk and 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:18.820
 red bull in a big glass that's it 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.740
 the two extremes principle after if you 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.119
 want to make the balance sheet of michel enough 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.060
 to have a drink but that's it 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.159
 also just to have a drink a big 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.600
 glass of preference is to mix the 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.909
 milk and income for those who will not 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.499
 easy to find it does when the 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.499
 reactions when you put red bull and 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:36.219
 milk that as a form of delay for 

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:38.590
 make cheese 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.090
 I had arrived this made a form of 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.950
 curdling whatever are doing that 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.259
 you mix both and mobsters 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.259
 so finding out I'm going to have a drink 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:02:02.640
 not a glass or rather two glasses 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:07.860
 and for that I still need a dj component 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.600
 red bull 2 responds that 's the truth and 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.640
 could still I will need some 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.860
 milk so preferably from normal milk 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.120
 a month I take the raw food and you 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.770
 so I create my mandates without success 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.050
 Dominique reiniche I do not want to 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.270
 see the mark owes its game i'm going soccer 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.830
 and the mark in the voice so here I am 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:32.130
 half skim happened like that as 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.959
 you're used to walloons a 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.320
 bottle we never know if it's missing 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.160
 milk and without this label are not no 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.400
 like so I'll show you already 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.040
 reaction of milk and red bull 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.090
 so that's gone I already have theirs and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:03:05.599
 pull in the transports these sources 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:05.599
 a dlc achille go it's gone 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:16.760
 What is this color? 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.760
 to the seven islands changed the color 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.420
 it's not a lot in this verse 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.360
 Algeria where I may have France 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.819
 wobble the contents of this worm there in this 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.110
 goal there because that way I can 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.700
 see a whole big glass and it will be 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.980
 better it will be faster for you 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.599
 it's the classic 335mm and the 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.920
 track you leave these colors my son 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.510
 but I think I'm going to make a 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.370
 little break and jérôme and that first 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.160
 so here I have a little transfer to 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.549
 dawn the disappointments the d2 content the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.989
 up police for milk so as 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.470
 you can see it's a very very 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.209
 great flavor close a little big like a 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.150
 worm big as I do not know what 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.600
 to make these big rave jeans small for 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.010
 to attack power renaissance 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.739

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.180
 a learn so I will show you 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.180
 a little the reaction that it makes 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.950

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.950

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.270
