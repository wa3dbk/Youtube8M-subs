jump right into drill man stage this is

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.770 
jump right into drill man stage this is
actually<00:00:11.519> one<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.730> cost<00:00:12.120> me<00:00:12.330> quite<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.599> few

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
actually one that cost me quite a few

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.320 
actually one that cost me quite a few
rerecords<00:00:13.710> not<00:00:14.160> because<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.730> full<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> big

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
rerecords not because it is full of big

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.840 
rerecords not because it is full of big
moves<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:15.809> because<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.379> actually

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
moves but because it is actually

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.790 
moves but because it is actually
legitimately<00:00:17.850> hard<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.660> do<00:00:21.170> it<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.710> not

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
legitimately hard to do it is really not

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.000 
legitimately hard to do it is really not
badly<00:00:23.160> designed<00:00:23.310> however<00:00:24.619> even<00:00:25.619> these<00:00:25.949> guys

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
badly designed however even these guys

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.099 
badly designed however even these guys
here<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.880> actually<00:00:27.090> see<00:00:27.570> coming<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
here you can actually see coming a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.710 
here you can actually see coming a
little<00:00:28.289> though<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.340> still<00:00:29.760> really<00:00:30.269> really<00:00:30.300> do

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
little though is still really really do

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.200 
little though is still really really do
not<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.170> concept<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.830> also<00:00:32.160> very<00:00:32.669> spawn

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
not like the concept and also very spawn

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.810 
not like the concept and also very spawn
rate<00:00:33.890> okay<00:00:34.920> he's<00:00:35.130> not<00:00:35.309> coming<00:00:35.640> back

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
rate okay he's not coming back

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.170 
rate okay he's not coming back
fortunately<00:00:36.540> enough<00:00:37.430> I've<00:00:38.430> never<00:00:38.820> actually

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
fortunately enough I've never actually

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.330 
fortunately enough I've never actually
shown<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.170> guys<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> NES

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
shown up of these guys to in the NES

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.510 
shown up of these guys to in the NES
there<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.059> think<00:00:42.920> these<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.100> probably<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
there I think these are probably the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.540 
there I think these are probably the
most<00:00:45.110> non-threatening<00:00:46.110> enemies<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.219> all<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
most non-threatening enemies in all of

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.100 
most non-threatening enemies in all of
the<00:00:47.700> Mega<00:00:47.879> Man<00:00:48.090> games<00:00:48.500> probably<00:00:50.750> easy<00:00:51.750> enough

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the Mega Man games probably easy enough

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.350 
the Mega Man games probably easy enough
first<00:00:52.500> part<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.070> eases<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.640> into<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.030> level

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
first part it eases you into the level

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
first part it eases you into the level
but<00:00:54.930> yeah<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:56.100> waiting<00:00:56.399> for

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
but yeah that I'm not waiting for

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.330 
but yeah that I'm not waiting for
these<00:00:56.699> guys<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.090> come<00:00:57.239> down<00:00:57.449> again<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:58.340> -

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
these guys to come down again because -

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.299 
these guys to come down again because -
missile<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:00.960> good

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
missile is actually really really good

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.700 
missile is actually really really good
going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:02.789> good<00:01:03.059> later<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:04.650> is

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
going to see how good later on this is

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
going to see how good later on this is
kind<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.010> baffling<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:05.909> mostly<00:01:06.240> taking

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
kind of baffling but it's mostly taking

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.660 
kind of baffling but it's mostly taking
so<00:01:06.900> long<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.590> all<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> slowdown<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
so long because of all the slowdown and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
so long because of all the slowdown and
think<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.540> too<00:01:09.780> many<00:01:09.900> sprites<00:01:10.290> on

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
think it's just too many sprites on

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.789 
think it's just too many sprites on
screen<00:01:11.750> little<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
screen little up here but this

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.160 
screen little up here but this
section<00:01:14.340> starts<00:01:14.729> what<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:15.840> like

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
section starts what I really really like

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.160 
section starts what I really really like
because<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.950> year<00:01:17.400> has<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> masterpiece<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
because this year has a masterpiece of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.530 
because this year has a masterpiece of
gameplay<00:01:19.619> flow<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.610> keep<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:20.970> if

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
gameplay flow you can just keep going if

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
gameplay flow you can just keep going if
you<00:01:21.689> hope<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.470> you're<00:01:22.650> doing

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you hope I know what you're doing

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.730 
you hope I know what you're doing
and<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.790> also<00:01:23.970> even<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.600> by<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.020> reflexes

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and you can also even get by on reflexes

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.010 
and you can also even get by on reflexes
I<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.280> really<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.759> segment<00:01:27.479> there

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
I really really like that segment there

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.050 
I really really like that segment there
should<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.290> more<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.500> these<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.130> games<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
should be more of these in the games you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
should be more of these in the games you
can<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.570> course<00:01:30.840> still<00:01:31.200> take<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.619> time<00:01:31.860> but

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
can of course still take your time but

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.500 
can of course still take your time but
it's<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.280> much<00:01:32.670> more<00:01:32.700> fun

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
it's just much more fun

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.750 
it's just much more fun
fortunate<00:01:35.350> enough<00:01:35.560> is<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.800> two-year<00:01:36.400> otherwise

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
fortunate enough is a two-year otherwise

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.430 
fortunate enough is a two-year otherwise
this<00:01:37.030> would<00:01:37.210> be<00:01:37.330> teak<00:01:37.510> move<00:01:37.720> Sentra<00:01:38.170> but<00:01:38.290> it's

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
this would be teak move Sentra but it's

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.320 
this would be teak move Sentra but it's
still<00:01:38.620> really<00:01:39.070> hard<00:01:39.550> have<00:01:39.730> you<00:01:39.850> seen<00:01:40.090> how<00:01:40.300> I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
still really hard have you seen how I

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.910 
still really hard have you seen how I
bumped<00:01:40.690> my<00:01:40.750> head<00:01:40.870> on<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.230> top<00:01:41.410> button<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:41.830> is

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
bumped my head on the top button it is

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.460 
bumped my head on the top button it is
really<00:01:42.490> really<00:01:42.820> easy<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.330> fall<00:01:43.510> off<00:01:43.720> here<00:01:43.990> then

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
really really easy to fall off here then

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.410 
really really easy to fall off here then
these<00:01:44.650> platforms<00:01:45.250> are<00:01:45.460> incredibly<00:01:46.000> hard<00:01:46.270> to

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
these platforms are incredibly hard to

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.440 
these platforms are incredibly hard to
deal<00:01:46.600> with<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.990> begin<00:01:47.320> with<00:01:47.560> so<00:01:48.370> yeah<00:01:48.580> not<00:01:48.850> fun

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
deal with to begin with so yeah not fun

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.710 
deal with to begin with so yeah not fun
at<00:01:49.750> all<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:50.320> dive<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.800> lock<00:01:51.010> there<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:52.270> more<00:01:52.600> of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
at all I dive and lock there and more of

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.150 
at all I dive and lock there and more of
these<00:01:52.870> platform<00:01:53.440> fortunately<00:01:54.070> this

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
these platform fortunately this

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.000 
these platform fortunately this
completely<00:01:54.670> optional<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.650> I<00:01:56.650> still<00:01:56.890> need

blocks are not that they are too bad but
I<00:02:22.630> still<00:02:22.690> decided<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.710> talk<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.370> skip<00:02:24.640> it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790

this is a very interesting room because

this is a very interesting room because
it's<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.640> mini<00:02:27.880> puzzle<00:02:28.360> didn't<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.930> itself

your usual instinct would be to go a
bath<00:02:35.200> but<00:02:35.530> it's<00:02:35.650> actually<00:02:36.070> far<00:02:36.340> better<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.790> go

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970

below<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:38.290> problem<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.800> if<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.130> slide<00:02:39.400> on

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
below the problem is if you slide on

both of them I still am not perfect at
this<00:02:47.740> I<00:02:47.920> have<00:02:48.100> done<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.400> before<00:02:48.520> without

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
this I have done it before without

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.910 
this I have done it before without
getting<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.450> but<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.959> frigid<00:02:50.410> half<00:02:50.620> it's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
getting it but it's a frigid half it's

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.510 
getting it but it's a frigid half it's
pretty<00:02:51.220> tough<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.750> see<00:02:52.989> how<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.800> great

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
pretty tough you can see how the great

pretty tough you can see how the great
dive<00:02:54.850> missiles<00:02:55.300> pierces<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.870> blocks<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.590> all

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
dive missiles pierces the blocks and all

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
of their individual degree pieces get

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.470 
of their individual degree pieces get
destroyed<00:02:59.410> at<00:02:59.620> once<00:02:59.800> it's<00:02:59.980> pretty<00:03:00.250> cool<00:03:00.489> this

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
destroyed at once it's pretty cool this

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.870 
destroyed at once it's pretty cool this
actress<00:03:01.810> also<00:03:02.530> pretty<00:03:02.800> tough<00:03:03.160> because<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.610> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
actress also pretty tough because of the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.300 
actress also pretty tough because of the
rampant<00:03:04.239> slowdown<00:03:04.810> it<00:03:05.320> is<00:03:05.500> relatively<00:03:06.040> hard

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
rampant slowdown it is relatively hard

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.810 
rampant slowdown it is relatively hard
to<00:03:06.550> time<00:03:06.820> around<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:09.459> is<00:03:09.640> the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
to time around that this is the

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.850 
to time around that this is the
mandatory<00:03:10.209> rush<00:03:10.720> usage<00:03:11.140> by<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.380> way<00:03:11.530> can<00:03:11.739> in

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
mandatory rush usage by the way can in

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.199 
mandatory rush usage by the way can in
two<00:03:11.980> shots<00:03:12.220> nice<00:03:12.550> for<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:13.750> level

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
two shots nice for this level

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.899 
two shots nice for this level
it's<00:03:15.329> still<00:03:16.129> baffling<00:03:17.129> to<00:03:17.310> me<00:03:17.340> why<00:03:17.640> they<00:03:17.760> would

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
it's still baffling to me why they would

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.990 
it's still baffling to me why they would
do<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.689> just<00:03:18.980> busy<00:03:19.980> work<00:03:20.219> it's<00:03:20.790> not

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
do that it's just busy work it's not

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.920 
do that it's just busy work it's not
hard<00:03:21.299> or<00:03:21.450> anything<00:03:21.859> pretty<00:03:22.859> strange<00:03:23.250> but<00:03:23.930> yeah

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
hard or anything pretty strange but yeah

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.599 
hard or anything pretty strange but yeah
this<00:03:25.319> is<00:03:25.379> also<00:03:25.709> pretty<00:03:25.859> strange<00:03:26.250> earnest

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
this is also pretty strange earnest

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.550 
this is also pretty strange earnest
because<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:27.060> doesn't<00:03:27.359> do<00:03:27.540> anything<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.290> just

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
because it doesn't do anything you just

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.550 
because it doesn't do anything you just
wait<00:03:29.099> here<00:03:29.459> there<00:03:30.359> is<00:03:30.480> absolutely<00:03:31.079> no<00:03:31.349> reason

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
wait here there is absolutely no reason

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.220 
wait here there is absolutely no reason
to<00:03:31.739> ever<00:03:31.889> go<00:03:32.099> up<00:03:32.250> there<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:32.819> this<00:03:33.120> guy<00:03:33.599> up<00:03:33.780> top

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
to ever go up there so this guy up top

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.399 
to ever go up there so this guy up top
is<00:03:34.560> pretty<00:03:35.040> pointless<00:03:35.389> this<00:03:36.389> however<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:37.019> also

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
is pretty pointless this however is also

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.099 
is pretty pointless this however is also
a<00:03:37.859> little<00:03:38.370> trap<00:03:38.639> but<00:03:38.909> I<00:03:39.150> think<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.689> gives<00:03:39.870> you

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
a little trap but I think it gives you

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.990 
a little trap but I think it gives you
quite<00:03:40.290> enough<00:03:40.680> time<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.189> react<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.790> max

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
quite enough time to react to the max

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.709 
quite enough time to react to the max
and<00:03:42.950> it's<00:03:43.950> actually<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> nice<00:03:44.519> introduction<00:03:45.239> to

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:45.719 
and it's actually a nice introduction to

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.690 
and it's actually a nice introduction to
the<00:03:45.870> Shadow<00:03:46.109> Man<00:03:46.319> platforms<00:03:47.010> strangely

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
the Shadow Man platforms strangely

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.110 
the Shadow Man platforms strangely
enough<00:03:47.879> there<00:03:48.150> at<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.480> end<00:03:48.629> of<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.989> level<00:03:50.120> die

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
enough there at the end of the level die

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.770 
enough there at the end of the level die
great<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.889> as<00:03:53.069> I<00:03:53.099> said<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.579> is<00:03:53.639> pretty<00:03:54.090> fun

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
great so as I said this is pretty fun

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.009 
great so as I said this is pretty fun
little<00:03:55.200> romp<00:03:55.470> with<00:03:55.709> quite<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.730> beauty<00:03:57.239> showing

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
little romp with quite a beauty showing

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.920 
little romp with quite a beauty showing
however<00:03:58.519> so<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.819> is<00:04:00.000> very<00:04:00.209> possible<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.719> dive

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
however so it is very possible to dive

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.440 
however so it is very possible to dive
quite<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.260> few<00:04:01.500> spots<00:04:02.060> Sherman<00:04:03.060> has<00:04:03.239> been

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
quite a few spots Sherman has been

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.500 
quite a few spots Sherman has been
improved<00:04:04.049> drastically<00:04:04.409> just<00:04:05.340> by<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.579> fact

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
improved drastically just by the fact

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.420 
improved drastically just by the fact
that<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:06.900> can<00:04:07.109> now<00:04:07.139> hit<00:04:07.680> him<00:04:07.919> while<00:04:08.219> he's

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
that you can now hit him while he's

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.509 
that you can now hit him while he's
drilling<00:04:08.760> down<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:10.019> makes<00:04:10.319> is<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:11.010> much<00:04:11.219> less

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
drilling down this makes is so much less

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.610 
drilling down this makes is so much less
tedious<00:04:11.819> he<00:04:12.540> still<00:04:12.870> takes<00:04:13.079> far<00:04:13.349> too<00:04:13.409> long

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
tedious he still takes far too long

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.800 
tedious he still takes far too long
underground<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.639> he<00:04:14.879> still<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.150> on<00:04:15.480> your<00:04:15.659> ass

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
underground and he still is on your ass

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.069 
underground and he still is on your ass
and<00:04:16.079> really<00:04:16.560> hard<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.979> dodge<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.970> as<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.959> can

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
and really hard to dodge but as you can

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.990 
and really hard to dodge but as you can
actually<00:04:19.260> damage<00:04:19.709> him<00:04:20.039> now<00:04:20.190> while<00:04:20.459> he's<00:04:20.669> going

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000

in<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.209> ground<00:04:21.329> and<00:04:21.720> he<00:04:22.349> won't<00:04:22.500> damage<00:04:22.860> you

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
in the ground and he won't damage you

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.700 
in the ground and he won't damage you

bad of a fight after all the design is
still<00:04:28.760> questionable<00:04:29.760> but<00:04:30.270> they<00:04:30.479> did<00:04:30.659> really

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
still questionable but they did really

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.740 
still questionable but they did really
improve<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.710> in<00:04:31.800> comparison<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.760> NES<00:04:33.150> not
