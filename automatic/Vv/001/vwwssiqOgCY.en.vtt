00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.730
 thanks for the weekend and the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.710
 robotics is no longer the future is the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.870
 present each time a greater number of 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.019
 Young Mexicans specializes in this 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.019
 branch 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 everything seems calm in the uam 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.110
 azcapotzalco unaware that a threat 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.110
 on eight legs stalks the university 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.290
 to contain the danger maybe it's 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.830
 necessary the presence of a robot 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.830
 humanoid 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.700
 50 years ago the image of a robot only 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.340
 it was possible on the screen 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.860
 cinematographic today university 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.230
 Mexicans that made reality in others 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.760
 countries call us japan-china we are already 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.470
 seeing this kind of thing is not something that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.660
 say in the future they will be important 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.970
 they are right now we already have them 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.059
 this kind of robots for example an air 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.480
 certainly the robot spider does not represent 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.000
 no threat, just the opposite for 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.330
 build rights to rescue 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.740
 certain way and with that that a child or 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.750
 something so that he gets stuck in some 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.340
 place a strainer you can send this 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.259
 type of robots to move inside 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.720
 of the surface where humans do not 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.700
 can enter the robotics seeks to open 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.800
 way in our country more and more 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.080
 universities include it is a plan of 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.940
 studies 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.180
 jorge the posture that branch of the 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.070
 electronic Engineering 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.790
 both the processes in the industry as 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.650
 everyday life in the house have a 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.840
 certain degree of robotics not then the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.720
 to be able to control and understand those processes 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.090
 is half much make up 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.390
 with most of these books already have 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.390
 real estate with which this in understanding 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.330
 with a good understanding while 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.700
 we have issues are still few young people 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.410
 who know this career but are expected 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.310
 Gradually increase enrollment 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.900
 tells us some history of our day 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.340
 say what are these characteristics 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.340
 that describe these configurations 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.259
 well we have the boats that with their 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.259
 translation movement 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.430
 the humanoid robot is already waiting for Jorge in the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.630
 lab meanwhile it's not bad 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.630
 exercise the transistors 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.480
 it is a career that is multidisciplinary 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.600
 it is very much covered from the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.900
 electronic we have the mechanics that is 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.640
 apart from being a very funny father or 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.520
 whether you want to see it on that side of 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.739
 What's wrong is that this career bored me 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.950
 by God it is not boring in truth what 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.950
 you do 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.060
 the programming of each robot is done 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.130
 approximately in a year includes the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.410
 tuning the various engines 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.860
 results are just the children of a 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.840
 future promising robotic the strength of 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.020
 these students to change the course of the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.020
 country 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.290
 a point 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.969
 for hernandez project 40 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.140
 a very very good your bouquets I'm 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.690
 talking about students the next 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.980
 notice for the almost 320 thousand students that 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.980
 this year they will finish high school
