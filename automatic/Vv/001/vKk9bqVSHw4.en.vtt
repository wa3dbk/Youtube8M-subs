distribution problem there are political
problems<00:00:12.099> but<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.960> humans<00:00:14.440> can<00:00:14.679> grow<00:00:14.950> a

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
problems but the humans can grow a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.779 
problems but the humans can grow a
phenomenal<00:00:17.109> amount<00:00:17.560> of<00:00:17.769> food<00:00:17.980> right<00:00:18.279> now<00:00:18.460> in<00:00:18.699> a

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
phenomenal amount of food right now in a

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.689 
phenomenal amount of food right now in a
very<00:00:18.970> small<00:00:19.449> small<00:00:20.140> particle<00:00:20.829> of<00:00:20.980> land<00:00:21.429> and

very small small particle of land and

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.849 
very small small particle of land and
it's<00:00:23.489> a<00:00:24.489> lot<00:00:25.300> there's<00:00:25.569> a<00:00:25.659> lot<00:00:25.779> of<00:00:26.019> control

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
it's a lot there's a lot of control

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.089 
it's a lot there's a lot of control
going<00:00:27.279> into<00:00:27.729> agricultural<00:00:28.599> production<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
going into agricultural production the

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.040 
going into agricultural production the
seeds<00:00:30.460> have<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.939> ability<00:00:31.329> to<00:00:31.359> grow<00:00:31.689> so<00:00:32.020> much

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
seeds have the ability to grow so much

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.040 
seeds have the ability to grow so much
more<00:00:32.410> than<00:00:32.650> they<00:00:32.770> do<00:00:32.830> but<00:00:33.280> but<00:00:33.850> yet<00:00:34.120> seeds

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
more than they do but but yet seeds

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.470 
more than they do but but yet seeds
respond<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.770> consciousness<00:00:36.310> and<00:00:36.760> of<00:00:37.270> the

they<00:00:44.140> only<00:00:44.350> produce<00:00:44.650> so<00:00:45.310> much<00:00:45.490> we<00:00:46.240> want<00:00:46.390> to

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
they only produce so much we want to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
produce more from the seeds that you

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.720 
produce more from the seeds that you
plant<00:00:48.640> on<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:48.820> ground<00:00:49.120> carry<00:00:49.990> them<00:00:50.290> with<00:00:50.320> you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
before you plant them in the ground they

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.010 
before you plant them in the ground they
will<00:00:58.780> contain<00:00:59.290> your<00:00:59.590> DNA<00:01:00.250> your<00:01:01.090> energy<00:01:01.780> your

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
will contain your DNA your energy your

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.069 
will contain your DNA your energy your
essence<00:01:02.560> you'll<00:01:03.520> have<00:01:03.790> beautiful<00:01:04.269> phenomenal

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
essence you'll have beautiful phenomenal

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.029 
essence you'll have beautiful phenomenal
crops<00:01:05.350> without<00:01:06.130> having<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:07.060> have<00:01:07.179> fertilizer

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
crops without having to have fertilizer

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.190 
crops without having to have fertilizer
there<00:01:09.039> are<00:01:09.130> more<00:01:09.369> resistance<00:01:10.119> to<00:01:10.450> resistant

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
there are more resistance to resistant

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.309 
there are more resistance to resistant
to<00:01:11.350> pests<00:01:12.039> and<00:01:12.249> to<00:01:12.640> drought<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.420> do<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.079> do

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:14.319 
to pests and to drought and do and do

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:18.209 
to pests and to drought and do and do
other<00:01:15.090> elements<00:01:16.090> if<00:01:16.810> food<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:17.139> not<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.380> problem

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
other elements if food is not a problem

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.760 
other elements if food is not a problem
but<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:18.999> humans<00:01:19.389> are<00:01:19.569> focused<00:01:20.049> on<00:01:20.170> survival

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
but so humans are focused on survival

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.520 
but so humans are focused on survival
which<00:01:20.950> is<00:01:21.179> which<00:01:22.179> is<00:01:22.210> interesting<00:01:23.079> in<00:01:23.200> itself

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
which is which is interesting in itself

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.569 
which is which is interesting in itself
also<00:01:23.829> because<00:01:24.509> survival<00:01:25.509> in<00:01:25.749> this<00:01:26.429> modern<00:01:27.429> age

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
also because survival in this modern age

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.550 
also because survival in this modern age
is<00:01:27.819> really<00:01:28.030> quite<00:01:28.299> easy<00:01:28.329> everything<00:01:29.289> is<00:01:29.409> there

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
is really quite easy everything is there

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
running out of energy really really it's

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.649 
running out of energy really really it's
not<00:02:04.420> it's<00:02:05.409> not<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.490> might<00:02:07.090> be<00:02:07.240> running<00:02:07.389> out

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
not it's not the it might be running out

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.280 
not it's not the it might be running out
of<00:02:07.719> oil<00:02:08.460> but<00:02:09.460> isn't<00:02:09.580> it<00:02:09.820> time<00:02:10.210> that<00:02:10.240> humans<00:02:11.020> got

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
of oil but isn't it time that humans got

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.510 
of oil but isn't it time that humans got
off<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.590> oil<00:02:12.100> anyway<00:02:12.700> there's<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.450> many

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
off of oil anyway there's so many

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.510 
off of oil anyway there's so many
technology's<00:02:15.520> cold<00:02:15.880> fusion<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.750> one<00:02:17.520> and

please don't lecture me about solar and
wind<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:23.020> ancient<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:24.060> old<00:02:25.060> there<00:02:25.750> are

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
wind that is so ancient so old there are

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.199 
wind that is so ancient so old there are
technologies<00:02:26.319> right<00:02:26.980> now<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.790> are<00:02:27.819> coming
