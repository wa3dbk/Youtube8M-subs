00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
of the upgrades or all the upgrades I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.410 
of the upgrades or all the upgrades I
don't<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> whole<00:00:43.649> lot<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:44.329> starting<00:00:45.329> up

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
don't have a whole lot of starting up

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350

the bars they're not as strong as a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.439 
the bars they're not as strong as a
triple<00:01:00.930> clamp<00:01:01.230> mount<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:02.059> they<00:01:03.059> mount<00:01:03.300> on

into<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.940> just<00:02:18.970> knew<00:02:19.240> I<00:02:19.270> didn't<00:02:19.540> want<00:02:19.660> to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
into it I just knew I didn't want to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.800 
into it I just knew I didn't want to
bang<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.080> hell<00:02:20.110> out<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.380> my<00:02:20.530> radiator<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.370> the

that<00:03:47.770> I<00:03:47.830> believe<00:03:48.100> these<00:03:48.250> are<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.430> 602<00:03:49.060> style

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
that I believe these are the 602 style

that I believe these are the 602 style
signals<00:03:50.680> they're<00:03:51.270> flexible<00:03:52.270> flexi<00:03:52.990> I<00:03:53.200> wanna<00:03:53.620> I

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
signals they're flexible flexi I wanna I

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.440 
signals they're flexible flexi I wanna I
think<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.040> is<00:03:54.100> the<00:03:54.160> 600<00:03:54.550> ones<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.090> wanted

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
think this is the 600 ones that I wanted

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.300 
think this is the 600 ones that I wanted
I<00:03:55.630> might<00:03:56.350> have<00:03:56.470> my<00:03:56.530> numbers<00:03:56.800> backwards<00:03:57.250> I

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
I might have my numbers backwards I

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.980 
I might have my numbers backwards I
wanted<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.670> lower<00:03:57.850> profile<00:03:58.360> ones<00:03:58.600> but<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.780> went

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
wanted the lower profile ones but I went

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.150 
wanted the lower profile ones but I went
with<00:03:59.110> these<00:03:59.200> because<00:03:59.380> they're<00:03:59.620> flexi<00:04:00.040> and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
with these because they're flexi and

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.550 
with these because they're flexi and
they<00:04:00.250> might<00:04:00.460> not<00:04:00.610> snap<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.810> readily<00:04:02.170> if<00:04:02.410> I

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
they might not snap so readily if I

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.520 
they might not snap so readily if I
smash<00:04:02.920> them<00:04:02.950> on<00:04:03.160> something<00:04:03.460> I<00:04:04.230> got<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.320> same

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
smash them on something I got the same

I've<00:04:08.710> got<00:04:08.830> the<00:04:08.920> yellow<00:04:09.070> lenses<00:04:09.490> at<00:04:09.640> home<00:04:09.790> for

I've got the yellow lenses at home for
them<00:04:10.180> but<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.540> clears<00:04:10.810> work<00:04:11.050> they<00:04:11.980> still

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
them but the clears work they still

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.650 
them but the clears work they still
flash<00:04:12.520> really<00:04:12.760> fast<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.270> haven't<00:04:13.510> put<00:04:13.630> a

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
flash really fast I haven't put a

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.110 
flash really fast I haven't put a
flasher<00:04:14.080> relay<00:04:14.260> into<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:17.730> replicate<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.880> load

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
flasher relay into to replicate the load

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.970

that<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.450> stock<00:04:19.780> bulbs<00:04:20.200> put<00:04:20.380> on<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.590> system

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
that the stock bulbs put on the system

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.860 
that the stock bulbs put on the system
so<00:04:21.310> they<00:04:21.489> do<00:04:21.549> flash<00:04:21.940> really<00:04:22.210> quick<00:04:22.540> being<00:04:22.780> an

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
so they do flash really quick being an

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.380 
so they do flash really quick being an

people's<00:04:28.539> attention<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:29.020> little<00:04:29.229> better<00:04:29.410> so

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
people's attention a little better so

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
people's attention a little better so
