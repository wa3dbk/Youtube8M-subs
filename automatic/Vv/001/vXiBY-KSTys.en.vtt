the proliferative phase of endometrium
the<00:00:39.570> proliferative<00:00:40.440> phase<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.270> bit

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the proliferative phase is a little bit

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.860 
the proliferative phase is a little bit
thinner<00:00:43.050> perhaps<00:00:43.680> 50<00:00:44.219> percent<00:00:44.760> than<00:00:45.539> the

is<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:09.450> there<00:02:09.660> are<00:02:09.780> also<00:02:10.430> mitotic<00:02:11.430> figures

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
is that there are also mitotic figures

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.800 
is that there are also mitotic figures
within<00:02:12.480> the

within the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.430 
within the
drama<00:02:13.250> this<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.520> very<00:02:15.090> very<00:02:15.540> important<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
drama this is very very important to

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.190 
drama this is very very important to
find<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.730> normally<00:02:18.330> don't<00:02:18.569> have<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.810> trouble

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
find you normally don't have a trouble

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.490 
find you normally don't have a trouble
that's<00:02:20.069> probably<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.030> mitotic<00:02:21.630> figure<00:02:22.200> there

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
that's probably a mitotic figure there

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.370 
that's probably a mitotic figure there
within<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.099> endometrial<00:02:23.880> stroma<00:02:24.270> let's<00:02:25.230> see

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
within the endometrial stroma let's see

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.580 
within the endometrial stroma let's see
if<00:02:25.470> we<00:02:25.590> could<00:02:25.739> find<00:02:26.010> another<00:02:26.160> one<00:02:26.700> maybe

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
if we could find another one maybe

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.979 
if we could find another one maybe
they're<00:02:28.590> not<00:02:28.770> hard<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.190> find<00:02:29.340> that's<00:02:30.150> possibly

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
they're not hard to find that's possibly

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.190 
they're not hard to find that's possibly
one<00:02:31.380> but<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.769> would<00:02:31.890> like<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.130> see<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.430> good

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
one but I would like to see a good

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.020 
one but I would like to see a good
metaphase<00:02:34.200> just<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.160> can<00:02:35.310> hear<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.610> here<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.880> go

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.300 
metaphase just I can hear it here you go
there's<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> mitotic<00:02:36.840> figure<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.980> reason<00:02:38.220> why

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
there's a mitotic figure the reason why

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.830 
there's a mitotic figure the reason why
it's<00:02:38.430> more<00:02:38.670> important<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.239> find<00:02:39.450> mitosis

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
it's more important to find mitosis

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.460 
it's more important to find mitosis
within<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.860> stroma<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.849> because<00:02:42.660> even<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.319> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
within the stroma is because even in the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.910 
within the stroma is because even in the
secretory<00:02:43.980> phase<00:02:44.160> there<00:02:44.940> still<00:02:45.269> may<00:02:45.480> be<00:02:45.510> some

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
secretory phase there still may be some

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.220 
secretory phase there still may be some
glandular<00:02:46.940> mitosis<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.750> secretory

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
glandular mitosis but in the secretory

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.210 
glandular mitosis but in the secretory
phase<00:02:49.410> there<00:02:49.980> are<00:02:50.130> almost<00:02:50.580> zero<00:02:52.010> mitosis<00:02:53.010> in

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
phase there are almost zero mitosis in

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.309 
phase there are almost zero mitosis in
the<00:02:53.400> stroma<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:55.310> one<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.519> most<00:02:56.760> often

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
proliferative and secretory phases you

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.240 
proliferative and secretory phases you
can<00:03:23.820> guess<00:03:24.200> what<00:03:25.200> day<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.859> of<00:03:26.100> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
can guess what day it is of the

can guess what day it is of the
menstrual<00:03:26.760> cycle<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:27.989> is<00:03:28.200> much<00:03:28.500> much

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
menstrual cycle and this is much much

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.789 
menstrual cycle and this is much much
more<00:03:29.069> easy<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.700> pinpoint<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.840> secretory

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
more easy to pinpoint in the secretory

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.240 
more easy to pinpoint in the secretory
phase<00:03:32.010> or<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.880> post<00:03:33.180> ovulatory<00:03:33.870> phase<00:03:34.290> then

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
phase or the post ovulatory phase then

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
estrogenic phase as you might guess in

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.430 
estrogenic phase as you might guess in
the<00:03:45.840> proliferative<00:03:46.410> phase<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:48.079> more<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.290> get

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
the proliferative phase the more you get

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.220 
the proliferative phase the more you get
into<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.549> more<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:51.269> endometrium<00:03:52.079> is

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
into it the more the endometrium is

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.250 
into it the more the endometrium is
proliferated<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.180> one<00:03:54.450> thing<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.810> you

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
proliferated but the one thing that you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.819 
proliferated but the one thing that you
must<00:03:55.650> look<00:03:55.859> for<00:03:55.920> our<00:03:57.260> mitosis<00:03:58.260> within<00:03:58.709> the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
must look for our mitosis within the

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.789 
must look for our mitosis within the
stroma<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.760> of<00:04:00.600> course<00:04:00.840> always<00:04:01.200> be<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.440> lot<00:04:01.650> of

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
stroma and of course always be a lot of

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.979 
stroma and of course always be a lot of
them<00:04:01.950> in<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.220> glands<00:04:02.549> as<00:04:02.819> well<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.359> when<00:04:03.870> you

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
them in the glands as well and when you

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.930 
them in the glands as well and when you
see<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:05.370> know<00:04:05.549> you're<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:05.850> the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
see that you know you're in the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.870 
see that you know you're in the
proliferative<00:04:06.750> phase<00:04:07.130> this<00:04:08.130> woman<00:04:08.519> has<00:04:08.700> not

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
proliferative phase this woman has not

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.129 
proliferative phase this woman has not
ovulate<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:09.780> in<00:04:10.680> addition<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:12.209> will<00:04:12.420> not<00:04:12.690> see

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
ovulate it in addition you will not see

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.060 
ovulate it in addition you will not see
any<00:04:13.470> vacuoles<00:04:14.459> or<00:04:15.079> secretion<00:04:16.079> within<00:04:16.950> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
any vacuoles or secretion within the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.969 
any vacuoles or secretion within the
glands<00:04:17.570> because<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.750> is<00:04:18.930> not<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.410> secretory

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
glands because this is not the secretory

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.899 
glands because this is not the secretory
phase<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.959> let's<00:04:22.680> end<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.159> right<00:04:23.220> there<00:04:23.430> and

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
phase so let's end it right there and

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.840 
phase so let's end it right there and
say<00:04:24.390> what<00:04:24.900> we<00:04:25.020> said<00:04:25.200> at<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.380> begin

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
say what we said at the begin

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.960 
say what we said at the begin
this<00:04:26.270> is<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.450> world's<00:04:26.870> most<00:04:27.140> normal<00:04:27.970> textbook

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
this is the world's most normal textbook

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.500 
this is the world's most normal textbook
a<00:04:29.500> proliferative<00:04:30.520> endometrium<00:04:31.520> notice<00:04:32.360> that

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
a proliferative endometrium notice that

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.450 
a proliferative endometrium notice that
some<00:04:32.780> of<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.020> glands<00:04:33.350> are<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.680> little<00:04:33.980> bit<00:04:34.190> into

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
some of the glands are a little bit into

some of the glands are a little bit into
the<00:04:34.580> myometrium<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.780> kind<00:04:36.020> of<00:04:36.050> like<00:04:36.170> the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
the myometrium this is kind of like the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.340 
the myometrium this is kind of like the
regenerative<00:04:37.070> part<00:04:37.880> of<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.420> this<00:04:38.930> is<00:04:39.110> more

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
regenerative part of it and this is more

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.840 
regenerative part of it and this is more
the<00:04:39.500> functional<00:04:40.160> phase<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:42.640> this<00:04:43.640> is

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
the functional phase and this is

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.850 
the functional phase and this is
actually<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.780> phase<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.230> will<00:04:45.350> love<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.650> the

actually the phase that will love it the

actually the phase that will love it the
part<00:04:46.250> that<00:04:46.460> will<00:04:46.580> eventually<00:04:47.210> be<00:04:47.420> shed<00:04:47.780> the

secretory<00:04:55.520> phase<00:04:55.700> which<00:04:56.630> we'll<00:04:56.870> get<00:04:57.050> into

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
secretory phase which we'll get into

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.980 
secretory phase which we'll get into
next<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:58.430> must<00:04:58.730> if<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.360> can<00:04:59.510> only<00:04:59.600> remember

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
next you must if you can only remember

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.390 
next you must if you can only remember
one<00:05:00.470> thing<00:05:01.000> you<00:05:02.000> must<00:05:02.360> look<00:05:02.900> for<00:05:03.320> mitosis<00:05:03.680> and

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
one thing you must look for mitosis and

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.040 
one thing you must look for mitosis and
lack<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.240> secretion<00:05:06.940> especially<00:05:07.940> mitosis<00:05:08.930> and

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
lack of secretion especially mitosis and

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.680 
lack of secretion especially mitosis and
the<00:05:09.200> stroma<00:05:09.530> but<00:05:10.130> they'll<00:05:10.310> also<00:05:10.580> be<00:05:10.940> a<00:05:10.970> lot<00:05:11.360> of

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
the stroma but they'll also be a lot of

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.010 
the stroma but they'll also be a lot of
mitosis<00:05:12.350> and<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:12.950> glands<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.580> this<00:05:14.420> with<00:05:14.900> the

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
mitosis and the glands and this with the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.740 
mitosis and the glands and this with the
presence<00:05:15.530> of<00:05:15.620> no<00:05:16.100> secretion<00:05:17.000> or<00:05:17.120> vacuoles

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
presence of no secretion or vacuoles

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.350 
presence of no secretion or vacuoles
within<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.380> epithelium<00:05:19.070> means<00:05:20.260> you<00:05:21.260> are<00:05:21.440> in

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
within the epithelium means you are in

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.040 
within the epithelium means you are in
the<00:05:23.470> proliferative<00:05:24.470> phase<00:05:24.770> of<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:26.810> cycle

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
the proliferative phase of the cycle

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.220 
the proliferative phase of the cycle
thank<00:05:27.560> you<00:05:27.710> very<00:05:27.920> much
