00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 It is up to you to get rid of the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:13.590
 water chlorine a very simple way water 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:21.180
 from the street down the street passing the police 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:23.250
 sand maranha the sand barrier and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.510
 falling here on the other side already totally 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:34.890
 filtered and dechlorinated passes by clicking 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:39.750
 here's all torn down to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:47.399
 fall with very good flow in the lake as 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:54.510
 You can see this water is already the

 and maintain the water level. 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.990
 now we are going to test the text on chlorine in 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.990
 Water 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:26.790
 Chlorine tests a chlorine developer in the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:29.570
 Water was put to the test 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.570
 risk 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:02:01.000
 shake without chlorine and one will do the same 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.360
 process with chlorine water direct water 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.360
 from street 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.960
 the difference
