take<00:00:00.240> a<00:00:00.269> look<00:00:00.450> here<00:00:00.630> these<00:00:00.810> are<00:00:00.930> our<00:00:00.960> socks

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
take a look here these are our socks

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:02.810 
take a look here these are our socks
servos<00:00:01.709> setups<00:00:02.070> that<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.190> use<00:00:02.340> on<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.490> f-117

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
servos setups that we use on the f-117

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.240 
servos setups that we use on the f-117
it<00:00:03.149> works<00:00:03.300> great<00:00:03.540> can<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:03.899> zero<00:00:04.230> in<00:00:04.319> that<00:00:04.890> is

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
it works great can you zero in that is

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.940 
it works great can you zero in that is
just<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.520> push<00:00:05.940> rod<00:00:06.180> it's<00:00:06.629> crimped<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.230> its<00:00:07.680> then

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
just a push rod it's crimped on its then

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.730 
just a push rod it's crimped on its then
zip-tied<00:00:08.490> it's<00:00:08.880> then<00:00:09.090> hot<00:00:09.330> glue<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:10.110> idea<00:00:10.469> is

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
zip-tied it's then hot glue the idea is

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.570 
zip-tied it's then hot glue the idea is
it<00:00:11.190> rolls<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.450> rod<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:13.469> then<00:00:13.620> rolls<00:00:13.860> out<00:00:14.130> and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
it rolls the rod it then rolls out and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.029 
it rolls the rod it then rolls out and
then<00:00:14.849> does<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> Louie<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.900> then<00:00:16.320> bends<00:00:16.590> and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
then does a Louie and then bends and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.150 
then does a Louie and then bends and
then<00:00:17.340> hot<00:00:17.850> glued<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.600> taped<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.289> there<00:00:19.560> for

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
then hot glued and taped on there for

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.500 
then hot glued and taped on there for
you<00:00:20.369> paint<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.730> doesn't<00:00:21.000> stick<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.210> paint<00:00:21.420> very

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
you paint it doesn't stick to paint very

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.120 
you paint it doesn't stick to paint very
well<00:00:21.750> you'll<00:00:22.230> know<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.769> want<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> put<00:00:23.100> a

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
well you'll know what you want to put a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.500 
well you'll know what you want to put a
servo<00:00:23.369> right<00:00:23.430> there<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> regular

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
servo right there and do a regular

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.630 
servo right there and do a regular
that's<00:00:24.930> fine<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.529> works<00:00:25.619> fine<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.340> looks

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
that's fine it works fine it just looks

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.040 
that's fine it works fine it just looks
a<00:00:26.670> little<00:00:26.730> weird<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.449> all<00:00:27.570> depends<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:27.900> your

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
a little weird it all depends on your

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.080 
a little weird it all depends on your
build<00:00:28.230> ability<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> first<00:00:28.980> one<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.970> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
build ability the first one you do do it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.279 
build ability the first one you do do it
ugly<00:00:30.240> because<00:00:30.570> you're<00:00:30.689> probably<00:00:30.779> gonna<00:00:31.019> crash

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
ugly because you're probably gonna crash

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.930 
ugly because you're probably gonna crash
anyways<00:00:31.710> don't<00:00:32.070> waste<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.399> lot<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.520> build<00:00:32.730> time

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
anyways don't waste a lot of build time

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.639 
anyways don't waste a lot of build time
do<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.329> ugly<00:00:33.570> setup<00:00:33.870> then<00:00:34.200> once<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
do one ugly setup then once you get it

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.020 
do one ugly setup then once you get it
dialed<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.010> didn't<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> nice<00:00:35.610> thing<00:00:35.820> right

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
dialed in didn't do the nice thing right

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.150 
dialed in didn't do the nice thing right
one<00:00:36.300> thing<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> time<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> V<00:00:37.469> tails

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
one thing at a time now then the V tails

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.940 
one thing at a time now then the V tails
notice<00:00:38.670> how<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> push<00:00:39.719> rod<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.110> dog<00:00:40.350> legging

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
notice how the push rod is dog legging

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.400 
notice how the push rod is dog legging
so<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.940> push<00:00:42.120> rod<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.570> hitting<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> servo

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
so as the push rod is hitting the servo

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.200 
so as the push rod is hitting the servo
that's<00:00:43.739> hitting<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> straight<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.850> servo<00:00:45.120> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that's hitting it straight the servo is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.209 
that's hitting it straight the servo is
not<00:00:45.390> binding<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.620> when<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> push<00:00:46.980> rod

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
not binding and then when the push rod

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.610 
not binding and then when the push rod
is<00:00:47.370> hitting<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.270> control<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.840> straight<00:00:49.170> you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
is hitting the control is straight you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.900 
is hitting the control is straight you
can<00:00:49.739> hear<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> serval<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.370> working<00:00:50.670> free

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
can hear the serval is working free

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
can hear the serval is working free
works<00:00:51.270> great<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> other

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
works great and then one for the other

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.189 
works great and then one for the other
side<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.399> course<00:00:53.670> total<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.059> four<00:00:54.239> servos<00:00:54.660> ok

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
side of course total of four servos ok

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.709 
side of course total of four servos ok
build<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.190> six<00:00:56.489> millimeter<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.539> one

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
build this is all six millimeter the one

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.010 
build this is all six millimeter the one
thing<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.989> didn't<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.899> we

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
thing I didn't like is like this so we

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.110 
thing I didn't like is like this so we
have<00:01:01.050> carbon<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.070> here<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.760> carbon

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
have carbon going here we have carbon

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.609 
have carbon going here we have carbon
going<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> instructions<00:01:04.290> this

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
going here like on the instructions this

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.910 
going here like on the instructions this
no-man's<00:01:05.189> land<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.540> was<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:06.810> weak<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
no-man's land it just was very weak and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.649 
no-man's land it just was very weak and
what<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.220> can't<00:01:08.610> put<00:01:08.850> carbon<00:01:09.330> everywhere

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
what do you can't put carbon everywhere

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.570 
what do you can't put carbon everywhere
cuz<00:01:10.020> then<00:01:10.200> wherever<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:10.830> fingers<00:01:11.159> go<00:01:11.369> it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
cuz then wherever your fingers go it's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.789 
cuz then wherever your fingers go it's
just<00:01:11.729> too<00:01:11.850> thin<00:01:12.119> yeah<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.500> six

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
just too thin yeah so I have six

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.920 
just too thin yeah so I have six
millimeter<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.640> three<00:01:14.939> millimeter<00:01:15.390> glued

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
millimeter with three millimeter glued

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.749 
millimeter with three millimeter glued
on<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> bottom<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.070> had<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.729> over

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
on the bottom if I had it to do over

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.469 
on the bottom if I had it to do over
again<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> would<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.549> go<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> Grayson

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
again what I would do is go to Grayson

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.260 
again what I would do is go to Grayson
and<00:01:21.780> order<00:01:22.530> nine<00:01:23.159> millimeter<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.119> he's

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and order nine millimeter and if he's

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.120 
and order nine millimeter and if he's
out<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.540> stock<00:01:24.720> our<00:01:24.990> sea<00:01:25.170> foam<00:01:25.409> wherever<00:01:25.860> or

thickness the plane doesn't mind the
thickness<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.500> sand<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.100> down<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.549> not

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
thickness you can sand that down or not

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.890 
thickness you can sand that down or not
sand<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> down<00:01:36.090> into<00:01:36.210> angles<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> doesn't

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
sand it down into angles it doesn't

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.020 
sand it down into angles it doesn't
matter<00:01:37.159> yes<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.520> get<00:01:38.640> away<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:39.000> just

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
matter yes you can get away with just

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.510 
matter yes you can get away with just
six<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.409> gonna<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.100> feel<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> little

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
six it's just gonna be a feel a little

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760 
six it's just gonna be a feel a little
bit<00:01:41.670> light<00:01:41.909> here's<00:01:42.720> another<00:01:43.049> tip<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.649> do

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
bit light here's another tip that I do

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.160 
bit light here's another tip that I do
on<00:01:44.040> all<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.549> planes<00:01:44.850> especially<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.960> one

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
on all my planes especially this one

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.850 
on all my planes especially this one
that's<00:01:46.380> needed

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that's needed

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.889 
that's needed
these<00:01:47.100> parts<00:01:47.579> are<00:01:47.729> notched<00:01:48.000> together<00:01:48.450> they

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
these parts are notched together they

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.389 
these parts are notched together they
notch<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.829> don't<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> measure

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
notch in so you don't have to measure

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.920 
notch in so you don't have to measure
anything<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.970> shows<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.240> where<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.360> go<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
anything it shows you where to go the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.960 
anything it shows you where to go the
problem<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> when<00:01:52.829> you're<00:01:53.009> grabbing<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.820> like

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
problem is when you're grabbing it like

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.060 
problem is when you're grabbing it like
that<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.659> eventually<00:01:55.229> gonna<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.829> pull

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
that it's eventually gonna just pull

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.770 
that it's eventually gonna just pull
that<00:01:56.250> glue<00:01:56.460> joint<00:01:56.729> out<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.090> doesn't<00:01:57.390> matter<00:01:57.540> if

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that glue joint out it doesn't matter if

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690 
that glue joint out it doesn't matter if
you<00:01:57.869> use<00:01:57.930> epoxy<00:01:58.380> super<00:01:58.860> glue<00:01:59.009> hot<00:01:59.219> glue<00:01:59.250> or<00:01:59.549> all

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you use epoxy super glue hot glue or all

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.240 
you use epoxy super glue hot glue or all
three<00:02:00.210> which<00:02:00.990> we've<00:02:01.170> been<00:02:01.259> using<00:02:01.500> or<00:02:01.799> epoxy

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
three which we've been using or epoxy

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.190 
three which we've been using or epoxy
and<00:02:02.430> hot<00:02:02.520> glue<00:02:02.670> anyways<00:02:03.049> eventually<00:02:04.049> gonna

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and hot glue anyways eventually gonna

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.289 
and hot glue anyways eventually gonna
pull<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.579> want<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> take<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> time<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
pull out if you want to take the time to

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:06.810 
pull out if you want to take the time to
stand

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
stand

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.940 
stand
that<00:02:06.909> angle<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.480> flat<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:07.780> can<00:02:08.289> but<00:02:08.770> we

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
that angle so it's flat you can but we

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
that angle so it's flat you can but we
don't<00:02:09.280> what<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.210> do<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.539> this<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:12.100> take<00:02:12.490> some

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
don't what I do is this is I take some

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.949 
don't what I do is this is I take some
epoxy<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:14.770> touch<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.790> tip<00:02:16.120> with

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
epoxy and I just touch the tip with

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.400 
epoxy and I just touch the tip with
epoxy<00:02:17.230> break<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:18.480> get<00:02:19.480> about<00:02:19.600> half<00:02:20.080> and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
epoxy break it up get about half and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.760 
epoxy break it up get about half and
that's<00:02:21.340> acting<00:02:21.760> as<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.910> rivet<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.630> every<00:02:23.380> three

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
that's acting as a rivet and every three

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.949 
that's acting as a rivet and every three
inches<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.310> do<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.520> rivet<00:02:24.970> especially<00:02:25.780> at<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
inches I do a rivet especially at the

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.120 
inches I do a rivet especially at the
end<00:02:26.080> here<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.290> watch<00:02:26.560> how<00:02:26.709> I'm<00:02:26.800> gonna<00:02:26.890> do<00:02:27.100> it

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
end here so watch how I'm gonna do it

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.840 
end here so watch how I'm gonna do it
little<00:02:27.700> twisty<00:02:28.330> twist<00:02:28.600> take<00:02:29.050> this<00:02:29.350> thing<00:02:29.850> yes

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
little twisty twist take this thing yes

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.570 
little twisty twist take this thing yes
with<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.120> just<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.690> micro<00:02:32.350> drop<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.830> epoxy<00:02:33.160> and

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
with the just a micro drop of epoxy and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.449 
with the just a micro drop of epoxy and
then<00:02:34.300> that's<00:02:34.630> gonna<00:02:34.840> follow<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.650> hole<00:02:35.920> well

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
then that's gonna follow that hole well

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.000 
then that's gonna follow that hole well
it's<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.820> little<00:02:37.000> bit<00:02:37.090> sticking<00:02:37.900> out<00:02:38.020> then<00:02:38.650> you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
it's a little bit sticking out then you

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.010 
it's a little bit sticking out then you
take<00:02:39.190> your<00:02:39.220> little<00:02:39.430> dykes<00:02:39.730> clip<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.360> off<00:02:40.510> then

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
take your little dykes clip it off then

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.170 
take your little dykes clip it off then
take<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.290> screwdriver<00:02:41.770> or<00:02:42.070> whatever<00:02:42.310> recess<00:02:43.000> it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
take a screwdriver or whatever recess it

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.210 
take a screwdriver or whatever recess it
in<00:02:43.300> take<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.020> little<00:02:44.380> dab<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.739> paper<00:02:44.920> towel

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
in take a little dab of a paper towel

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.820 
in take a little dab of a paper towel
maybe<00:02:45.550> some<00:02:45.989> hand<00:02:46.989> sanitizer<00:02:47.230> rubbing

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
maybe some hand sanitizer rubbing

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.410 
maybe some hand sanitizer rubbing
alcohol<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.370> takes<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.670> epoxy<00:02:49.090> off<00:02:49.209> and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
alcohol that takes the epoxy off and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.110 
alcohol that takes the epoxy off and
then<00:02:49.870> do<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.230> about<00:02:50.500> every<00:02:50.860> three<00:02:51.190> inches<00:02:51.220> do

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
then do that about every three inches do

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.430 
then do that about every three inches do
this<00:02:52.300> before<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.790> yeah<00:02:54.790> well<00:02:55.480> yeah<00:02:55.810> if<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.200> do

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
this before you yeah well yeah if you do

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.620 
this before you yeah well yeah if you do
the<00:02:56.620> skin<00:02:56.980> see<00:02:57.160> that's<00:02:57.340> what<00:02:58.090> if<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.330> skin

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
the skin see that's what if this skin

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.540 
the skin see that's what if this skin
was<00:02:58.810> off<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.260> looks<00:02:59.590> terrible<00:02:59.950> underneath

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
was off it looks terrible underneath

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.490 
was off it looks terrible underneath
because<00:03:00.700> there's<00:03:00.970> rivets<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.690> carbon<00:03:02.230> and

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
because there's rivets and carbon and

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.410 
because there's rivets and carbon and
it's<00:03:02.620> just<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.860> mess<00:03:03.070> that<00:03:03.640> was<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.970> plus<00:03:04.180> side

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
it's just a mess that was the plus side

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.690 
it's just a mess that was the plus side
of<00:03:04.570> putting<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> skin<00:03:05.200> second<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.580> it

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
of putting the skin second is that it

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.660 
of putting the skin second is that it
cleaned<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.120> up<00:03:07.239> ideally<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.380> don't<00:03:08.709> care<00:03:09.010> if<00:03:09.459> I

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
cleaned it up ideally I don't care if I

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.310 
cleaned it up ideally I don't care if I
do<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:09.970> over<00:03:10.209> again<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.540> would<00:03:10.690> get<00:03:10.840> just<00:03:11.049> one

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
do this over again I would get just one

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.680 
do this over again I would get just one
thick<00:03:11.890> nine<00:03:12.310> millimeter<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:13.060> some<00:03:13.390> kind<00:03:13.630> of

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
thick nine millimeter of some kind of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.199 
thick nine millimeter of some kind of
foam<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.320> would<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:14.620> rivet<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.190> carbon<00:03:16.060> it

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
foam and I would just rivet it carbon it

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.210 
foam and I would just rivet it carbon it
and<00:03:16.420> then<00:03:16.600> just<00:03:16.810> give<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.590> an<00:03:17.680> extra<00:03:17.860> slather

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
and then just give it an extra slather

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.530 
and then just give it an extra slather
of<00:03:18.400> paint<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.790> then<00:03:18.880> just<00:03:19.030> don't<00:03:19.209> show<00:03:19.390> the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
of paint and then just don't show the

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.930 
of paint and then just don't show the
camera<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.930> bottom<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.350> don't<00:03:20.530> care<00:03:20.680> but<00:03:21.370> but

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
camera the bottom I don't care but but

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.069 
camera the bottom I don't care but but
you<00:03:22.060> know<00:03:22.180> what<00:03:22.329> I<00:03:22.360> care<00:03:22.600> about<00:03:22.630> is<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
you know what I care about is the

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.569 
you know what I care about is the
strength<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:23.799> don't<00:03:24.010> want<00:03:24.250> this<00:03:24.370> coming

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
strength I just don't want this coming

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.069 
strength I just don't want this coming
off<00:03:24.850> over<00:03:25.120> time<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.510> don't<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.720> just<00:03:25.870> don't<00:03:25.989> like

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
off over time I don't I just don't like

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.069 
off over time I don't I just don't like
that<00:03:26.140> I<00:03:26.440> did<00:03:27.340> add<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.700> little<00:03:28.060> extra<00:03:28.239> foam<00:03:28.690> on

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
that I did add a little extra foam on

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.750 
that I did add a little extra foam on
the<00:03:29.230> bottom<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:29.739> because<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.400> was<00:03:30.519> so

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
the bottom of this because it was so

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.360 
the bottom of this because it was so
long<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.390> thin<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:32.650> can<00:03:32.799> put<00:03:32.920> carbon<00:03:33.280> if

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
long and so thin you can put carbon if

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.340 
long and so thin you can put carbon if
you<00:03:33.459> want<00:03:33.670> whatever<00:03:33.880> three<00:03:34.630> sets<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.930> magnets

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
you want whatever three sets of magnets

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.009 
you want whatever three sets of magnets
which<00:03:35.590> are<00:03:35.769> already<00:03:36.760> coming<00:03:36.940> off<00:03:39.870> fly<00:03:40.870> out

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
which are already coming off fly out

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.150 
which are already coming off fly out
five<00:03:42.660> that's<00:03:43.660> about<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.260> right<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.530> do<00:03:44.739> have<00:03:45.010> an

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
five that's about it right I do have an

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.150 
five that's about it right I do have an
extra<00:03:45.430> carbon<00:03:45.850> here<00:03:46.209> on<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:47.019> tails<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.829> I

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
extra carbon here on the tails and I

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.910 
extra carbon here on the tails and I
just<00:03:48.430> glued<00:03:48.910> them<00:03:49.120> on<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:49.660> put<00:03:50.620> some<00:03:50.769> tape

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
just glued them on and put some tape

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.970 
just glued them on and put some tape
over<00:03:51.100> it<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.549> did<00:03:51.910> bevel<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.540> props<00:03:52.930> lot<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.530> cut

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
over it I did bevel the props lot I cut

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.130 
over it I did bevel the props lot I cut
it<00:03:54.070> out<00:03:54.190> slightly<00:03:54.579> larger<00:03:55.000> than<00:03:55.030> stock<00:03:55.420> we

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
it out slightly larger than stock we

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.140 
it out slightly larger than stock we
make<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.470> props<00:03:56.680> lots<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:57.010> small<00:03:57.280> on<00:03:57.760> all<00:03:58.030> of

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
make the props lots of small on all of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.850 
make the props lots of small on all of
these<00:03:58.299> because<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.930> can<00:03:59.049> cut<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.230> fit<00:03:59.470> you<00:03:59.769> can

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
these because you can cut to fit you can

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.650 
these because you can cut to fit you can
always<00:04:00.250> cut<00:04:00.489> more<00:04:00.730> out<00:04:00.970> if<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.269> need<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.570> or

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
always cut more out if you need it or

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.810 
always cut more out if you need it or
want<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.320> more<00:04:02.560> prop<00:04:03.070> slot<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.489> cut<00:04:03.670> out

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
want it the more prop slot you cut out

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.580 
want it the more prop slot you cut out
the<00:04:03.850> more<00:04:04.239> power<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.630> plane<00:04:04.810> has<00:04:05.019> the<00:04:05.049> quiet

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
the more power the plane has the quiet

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.120 
the more power the plane has the quiet
it<00:04:05.950> is

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
it is

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.880 
it is
but<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.730> dorkier<00:04:07.239> it<00:04:07.390> looks<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.560> weaker

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
but the dorkier it looks and the weaker

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.280 
but the dorkier it looks and the weaker
it<00:04:08.920> gets<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.430> also<00:04:09.760> have<00:04:10.120> carbon<00:04:10.630> underneath

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
it gets I also have carbon underneath

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.770 
it gets I also have carbon underneath
here<00:04:11.739> as<00:04:11.920> well<00:04:12.160> there's<00:04:12.730> quite<00:04:13.120> a<00:04:13.299> bit<00:04:13.630> more

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
here as well there's quite a bit more

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.110 
here as well there's quite a bit more
carbon<00:04:14.260> on<00:04:14.410> this<00:04:14.590> one<00:04:14.829> than<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.579> smaller<00:04:15.880> one

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
carbon on this one than the smaller one

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.420 
carbon on this one than the smaller one
yes<00:04:16.540> it's<00:04:16.959> not<00:04:17.169> any<00:04:17.380> more<00:04:17.530> skill<00:04:17.980> to<00:04:18.010> build

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
yes it's not any more skill to build

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.750 
yes it's not any more skill to build
it's<00:04:18.820> just<00:04:19.090> more<00:04:19.449> fun

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
it's just more fun

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.240 
it's just more fun
more<00:04:20.240> carbon<00:04:20.750> more<00:04:21.110> glue<00:04:21.380> more<00:04:21.560> time<00:04:21.800> that's

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
more carbon more glue more time that's

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.480 
more carbon more glue more time that's
it<00:04:22.460> but<00:04:22.970> when<00:04:23.840> you're<00:04:23.960> done<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:24.980> flight

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
it but when you're done the flight

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.360 
it but when you're done the flight
performance<00:04:25.970> is<00:04:26.360> also<00:04:26.690> way<00:04:27.290> more<00:04:27.620> so<00:04:28.190> it's

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
performance is also way more so it's

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.840 
performance is also way more so it's
worth<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.760> yes<00:04:31.840> sure
