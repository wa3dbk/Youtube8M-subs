00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
like it probably will do for quite a

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.810 
like it probably will do for quite a
while<00:03:50.370> now<00:03:50.430> but<00:03:51.500> when<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.620> render<00:03:52.830> out<00:03:53.130> there

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
while now but when you render out there

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.880 
while now but when you render out there
will<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.480> reference<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.140> will<00:03:55.530> like<00:03:55.709> your
