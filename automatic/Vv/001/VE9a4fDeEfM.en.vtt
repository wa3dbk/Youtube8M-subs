00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
early in the race I must say that is one

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.810 
early in the race I must say that is one
of<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:12.850> stage<00:01:13.119> down<00:01:13.659> in<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.200> far<00:01:14.439> south<00:01:14.860> east

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.609 
of France on the Swiss on the Spanish
borders<00:01:18.399> which<00:01:18.969> is<00:01:19.119> about<00:01:19.329> five<00:01:19.990> miles<00:01:20.320> or

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
borders which is about five miles or

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.730 
borders which is about five miles or
seven<00:01:20.979> kilometres<00:01:21.369> shorter<00:01:22.329> that's<00:01:22.780> all<00:01:23.079> so

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
seven kilometres shorter that's all so

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.109 
seven kilometres shorter that's all so
that'll<00:01:24.009> be<00:01:24.070> another<00:01:24.310> tough<00:01:24.579> day<00:01:24.609> and<00:01:25.030> that's

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
that'll be another tough day and that's

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.849 
that'll be another tough day and that's
after<00:01:25.509> we've<00:01:25.659> been<00:01:25.689> through<00:01:26.109> the<00:01:26.289> Alps<00:01:26.680> and

after we've been through the Alps and

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.069 
after we've been through the Alps and

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
then we won't have such a big peloton I

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.760 
then we won't have such a big peloton I
suspect<00:01:29.560> we'll<00:01:29.740> lose<00:01:29.920> a<00:01:30.280> few<00:01:30.729> guys<00:01:31.409> Takia<00:01:32.409> now
