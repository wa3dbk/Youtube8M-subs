00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
unfortunately my understanding is a

unfortunately my understanding is a

deleted item they no longer in
production<00:00:40.520> but<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:44.660> do<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:48.469> printed

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
production but I do have the printed

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.830 
production but I do have the printed
circuit<00:00:49.620> board<00:00:50.420> pattern<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:53.510> most<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
circuit board pattern and most of the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.099 
circuit board pattern and most of the
patterns<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.350> pretty<00:00:55.530> much<00:00:55.590> everything<00:00:55.949> else

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
patterns for pretty much everything else

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.389 
patterns for pretty much everything else
it's<00:00:58.109> fairly<00:00:58.320> simple<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.770> build<00:00:59.329> and<00:01:00.530> as<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:02.160> say

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it's fairly simple to build and as I say

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.190 
it's fairly simple to build and as I say
here's<00:01:02.820> one<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> prepared<00:01:03.239> earlier<00:01:05.990> it's<00:01:06.990> got<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
here's one I prepared earlier it's got a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.850 
here's one I prepared earlier it's got a
crystal<00:01:07.920> oscillator<00:01:08.520> instead<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
crystal oscillator instead of a

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.630 
crystal oscillator instead of a
capacitor<00:01:10.860> off<00:01:10.979> later<00:01:12.950> yeah<00:01:13.950> pretty<00:01:14.340> basic

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
capacitor off later yeah pretty basic

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.399 
capacitor off later yeah pretty basic
we'll<00:01:15.090> connect<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.570> power<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.259> what

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
we'll connect up the power and see what

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.530 
we'll connect up the power and see what
happens<00:01:16.680> should<00:01:17.580> work<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:22.220> couple<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
happens should work just a couple of

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.120 
happens should work just a couple of
wires<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> battery<00:01:25.080> there<00:01:27.080> yeah<00:01:28.080> got<00:01:29.009> on

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
wires off a battery there yeah got on

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.020 
wires off a battery there yeah got on
your<00:01:29.490> 2k<00:01:30.150> monitor<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.780> which<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.030> what

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
your 2k monitor on which is what

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.929 
your 2k monitor on which is what
controls<00:01:33.390> everything<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> board<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.939> 2k

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
controls everything on the board and 2k

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.280 
controls everything on the board and 2k
RAM<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:37.970> essentially<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> another<00:01:39.540> ram<00:01:39.810> socket

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
RAM and essentially a another ram socket

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.800 
RAM and essentially a another ram socket
that's<00:01:40.439> used<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.829> an<00:01:40.979> expansion<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.759> whole<00:01:42.630> lot

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
that's used as an expansion a whole lot

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.170 
that's used as an expansion a whole lot
of<00:01:42.840> bits<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.140> wires<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.670> other

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
of bits of wires here to go for other

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
of bits of wires here to go for other
address<00:01:45.600> lines<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.290> control<00:01:46.680> lines<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
address lines and control lines that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.789 
address lines and control lines that
I've<00:01:47.280> put<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:49.729> it's<00:01:50.729> quite<00:01:51.270> simple<00:01:51.799> it's

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
I've put on there it's quite simple it's

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.219 
I've put on there it's quite simple it's
got<00:01:53.040> some<00:01:53.280> software<00:01:53.939> already<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> that

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
got some software already in it that

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:05.149 
got some software already in it that
comes<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> monitor<00:02:03.469> it<00:02:04.469> plays<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
comes as it is in the monitor it plays a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.660 
comes as it is in the monitor it plays a
little<00:02:05.610> tune<00:02:06.290> its<00:02:07.290> way<00:02:07.530> way<00:02:07.770> too<00:02:07.799> fast<00:02:08.369> because

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
little tune its way way too fast because

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.010 
little tune its way way too fast because
of<00:02:08.970> course<00:02:09.149> what's<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.479> on

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
of course what's going on

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.410 
of course what's going on
lost<00:02:10.260> later<00:02:11.630> that's<00:02:12.630> enough<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.960> that<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:15.300> can

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
lost later that's enough of that you can

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.870 
lost later that's enough of that you can
develop<00:02:15.570> programs<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.710> in<00:02:16.860> machine<00:02:17.850> code

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
develop programs on it in machine code

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.950 
develop programs on it in machine code
and<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.980> course<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.090> then<00:02:21.270> put<00:02:21.660> them<00:02:21.810> onto

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
and of course you can then put them onto

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.290 
and of course you can then put them onto
a<00:02:22.410> standalone<00:02:23.250> board<00:02:24.770> which<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:27.440> coming<00:02:28.440> up

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
a standalone board which is coming up

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.980 
a standalone board which is coming up
there<00:02:30.300> we<00:02:30.420> go<00:02:31.580> stand<00:02:32.580> alone<00:02:32.700> bored<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.810> got<00:02:33.960> a

there we go stand alone bored it's got a

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.870 
there we go stand alone bored it's got a
its<00:02:34.580> got<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:36.330> little<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:37.020> outboard<00:02:37.800> such<00:02:38.670> some

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
its got a little in outboard such some

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.780 
its got a little in outboard such some
inputs<00:02:39.270> outputs<00:02:39.540> here<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.620> couple<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.400> relays

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
inputs outputs here a couple of relays

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.080 
inputs outputs here a couple of relays
and<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.510> little<00:02:42.750> speaker<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:44.430> years<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.850> make

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
and a little speaker in years to make

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.990 
and a little speaker in years to make
tones<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.440> that's<00:02:47.220> got<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
tones and the like and that's got the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 
tones and the like and that's got the
program<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.140> actually<00:02:49.260> came<00:02:49.680> with<00:02:49.740> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
program that actually came with the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.480 
program that actually came with the
board<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:51.410> which<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.830> set<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.220> traffic

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
board in it which is a set of traffic

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.530 
board in it which is a set of traffic
lights<00:02:54.710> for<00:02:55.710> model<00:02:56.490> railway<00:02:56.850> now<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.510> course

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
lights for model railway now of course

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.080 
lights for model railway now of course
the<00:02:57.960> all<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.470> wrong<00:02:58.650> colors<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.280> again<00:02:59.640> going

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
the all the wrong colors and again going

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.850 
the all the wrong colors and again going
on<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.330> crystal<00:03:00.660> oscillator<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.320> it's<00:03:01.470> done

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
on the crystal oscillator so it's done

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.910 
on the crystal oscillator so it's done
way<00:03:02.040> too<00:03:02.070> fast<00:03:02.960> there<00:03:03.960> you<00:03:04.050> go<00:03:06.620> but<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.740> quite

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
way too fast there you go but it's quite

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.900 
way too fast there you go but it's quite
nicely<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.970> board<00:03:09.210> itself<00:03:09.540> there's<00:03:10.350> got<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.910> a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
nicely the board itself there's got I a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.690 
nicely the board itself there's got I a
ports<00:03:12.570> up<00:03:12.750> here<00:03:12.990> or<00:03:13.290> output<00:03:13.980> ports<00:03:14.280> up<00:03:14.459> here

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
lines or data lines here yeah you can

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.830 
lines or data lines here yeah you can
actually<00:03:23.010> make<00:03:23.300> quite<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.360> neat<00:03:24.630> little

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
actually make quite a neat little

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.810 
actually make quite a neat little
control<00:03:25.800> system<00:03:26.250> out<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:28.610> some<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
other stuff that the company sells still

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.150 
other stuff that the company sells still
is<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:35.840> simple<00:03:36.840> logic<00:03:37.140> probe<00:03:37.410> it's<00:03:38.160> based<00:03:38.459> on<00:03:38.760> a

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
is a simple logic probe it's based on a

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.120 
is a simple logic probe it's based on a
pic<00:03:41.930> chip<00:03:42.930> they're<00:03:45.500> meant<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.560> have<00:03:46.680> batteries

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
pic chip they're meant to have batteries

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.699 
pic chip they're meant to have batteries
here<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:47.550> I've<00:03:47.640> run<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.820> couple<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.209> wires

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
here but I've run a couple of wires

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.620 
here but I've run a couple of wires
because<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:50.100> tech<00:03:50.700> bullets<00:03:51.090> got<00:03:51.270> a<00:03:51.300> spare

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
because the tech bullets got a spare

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.600 
because the tech bullets got a spare
spot<00:03:52.050> two<00:03:52.230> plugs<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.650> wires<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.220> get<00:03:53.400> 5

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
spot two plugs and wires in to get 5

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.970 
spot two plugs and wires in to get 5
volts<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.209> plugged<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.660> in<00:03:54.750> there<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.830> also

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
volts so plugged it in there it's also

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.930 
volts so plugged it in there it's also
capable<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.820> having<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.570> secondary<00:03:58.080> probe<00:03:58.470> here

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
capable of having a secondary probe here

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.060 
capable of having a secondary probe here
that<00:03:59.940> works<00:04:00.209> as<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> logic<00:04:00.959> pulsar<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:01.830> you<00:04:01.920> can

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
that works as a logic pulsar so you can

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.460 
that works as a logic pulsar so you can
inject<00:04:02.490> logic<00:04:03.090> signals<00:04:03.630> into<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.900> circuit<00:04:04.320> to

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
inject logic signals into a circuit to

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.490 
inject logic signals into a circuit to
try<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.740> test<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.180> only<00:04:06.180> drawback<00:04:07.170> with<00:04:07.350> that

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
try and test it only drawback with that

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.400 
try and test it only drawback with that
I<00:04:07.530> guess<00:04:07.830> is<00:04:08.060> if<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.239> put<00:04:09.420> something<00:04:09.630> in<00:04:09.810> you

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
I guess is if you put something in you

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.830 
I guess is if you put something in you
want<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.650> measure<00:04:10.739> what's<00:04:11.010> coming<00:04:11.310> out<00:04:11.840> when

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
want to measure what's coming out when

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.800 
want to measure what's coming out when
they're<00:04:12.959> on<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.200> same<00:04:13.380> board<00:04:13.709> well<00:04:14.600> it's<00:04:15.600> got

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
they're on the same board well it's got

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.080 
they're on the same board well it's got
its<00:04:15.930> uses<00:04:16.320> but<00:04:16.350> probably<00:04:17.310> not<00:04:17.459> as<00:04:17.520> useful<00:04:17.820> as

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
its uses but probably not as useful as

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.380 
its uses but probably not as useful as
it<00:04:18.150> could<00:04:18.390> be

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
it could be

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.340 
it could be
probably<00:04:21.390> better<00:04:21.570> off<00:04:21.660> with<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.989> separate

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
probably better off with a separate

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.470 
probably better off with a separate
logic<00:04:22.860> probe<00:04:23.100> into<00:04:23.400> separate<00:04:23.790> logic<00:04:24.060> pulser

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
logic probe into separate logic pulser

logic probe into separate logic pulser
but<00:04:24.660> hey<00:04:24.810> for<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.740> few<00:04:25.950> bucks<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.370> good<00:04:27.240> fun<00:04:27.390> to

speaker and you can move you can use the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.690 
speaker and you can move you can use the

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
connect it up to different and you can

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.840 
connect it up to different and you can
hear<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.710> different<00:05:14.130> signals<00:05:14.460> around<00:05:14.730> the

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
hear the different signals around the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:22.190 
hear the different signals around the
computer<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:20.180> it's<00:05:21.180> all<00:05:21.300> been<00:05:21.510> a<00:05:21.540> lot<00:05:21.810> of<00:05:21.840> fun

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
computer and it's all been a lot of fun

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.290 
computer and it's all been a lot of fun
since<00:05:22.560> I<00:05:22.710> was<00:05:22.860> 14<00:05:23.310> years<00:05:23.460> old<00:05:23.760> and<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.030> thought<00:05:24.270> I

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
since I was 14 years old and I thought I

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.250 
since I was 14 years old and I thought I
might<00:05:24.390> share<00:05:24.840> in<00:05:25.169> case<00:05:25.410> anyone<00:05:25.800> else<00:05:26.010> wants<00:05:26.280> to

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
might share in case anyone else wants to

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.470 
might share in case anyone else wants to
find<00:05:28.260> out<00:05:28.470> some<00:05:28.680> information<00:05:28.940> I'm<00:05:29.940> happy<00:05:30.360> to

find out some information I'm happy to
share<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:33.860> like<00:05:34.860> I<00:05:34.890> said<00:05:35.190> I've<00:05:35.400> got<00:05:36.620> different

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
share it like I said I've got different

talking<00:06:17.640> electronics<00:06:18.120> design<00:06:18.300> I<00:06:18.450> think<00:06:18.780> it's

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
talking electronics design I think it's

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.300 
talking electronics design I think it's
a<00:06:18.990> silicon<00:06:19.500> chip<00:06:19.530> or<00:06:19.830> something<00:06:19.860> like<00:06:20.130> that<00:06:20.190> a

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
a silicon chip or something like that a

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.679 
a silicon chip or something like that a
long<00:06:20.490> time<00:06:20.550> ago<00:06:22.220> and<00:06:23.220> yeah<00:06:24.000> that's<00:06:24.330> about<00:06:24.540> it

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
long time ago and yeah that's about it

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.229 
long time ago and yeah that's about it
no<00:06:25.779> you<00:06:26.499> never<00:06:26.709> make<00:06:27.339> an<00:06:27.489> eeprom<00:06:27.819> programmer

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:28.239 
no you never make an eeprom programmer

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:35.699 
no you never make an eeprom programmer
with<00:06:28.479> it<00:06:30.569> John<00:06:31.569> volatile<00:06:32.080> RAM<00:06:33.119> and<00:06:34.589> there's<00:06:35.589> a

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:35.709 
with it John volatile RAM and there's a

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:39.839 
with it John volatile RAM and there's a
few<00:06:36.009> bits<00:06:36.909> and<00:06:37.089> pieces<00:06:37.479> here<00:06:37.509> a<00:06:38.519> simple<00:06:39.519> board

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
few bits and pieces here a simple board

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:42.659 
few bits and pieces here a simple board
that's<00:06:40.059> got<00:06:40.469> driven<00:06:41.469> transistors<00:06:42.279> and<00:06:42.549> a

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
that's got driven transistors and a

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.029 
that's got driven transistors and a
couple<00:06:43.269> of<00:06:43.419> times<00:06:43.659> and<00:06:44.019> bit<00:06:44.259> of<00:06:44.349> logic<00:06:44.499> so<00:06:44.889> that

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 
couple of times and bit of logic so that

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.419 
couple of times and bit of logic so that
you<00:06:45.099> can<00:06:45.219> have<00:06:45.249> a<00:06:45.399> fiddle<00:06:46.949> and<00:06:47.949> that's<00:06:48.309> about

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:48.429 
you can have a fiddle and that's about

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:52.769 
you can have a fiddle and that's about
it<00:06:48.610> if<00:06:49.179> anyone's<00:06:49.899> interested<00:06:50.969> in<00:06:51.969> finding<00:06:52.569> out

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:52.779 
it if anyone's interested in finding out

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:55.889 
it if anyone's interested in finding out
more<00:06:52.989> information<00:06:53.259> is<00:06:54.389> some<00:06:55.389> of<00:06:55.479> the<00:06:55.569> boards

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:55.899 
more information is some of the boards

00:06:55.899 --> 00:07:05.659 
more information is some of the boards
you<00:06:56.079> can<00:06:56.139> make<00:06:56.469> a<00:06:58.439> standalone<00:06:59.439> little<00:06:59.919> unit

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.889 

have<00:07:06.669> a<00:07:06.699> bit<00:07:06.879> of<00:07:06.969> a<00:07:07.059> fiddle<00:07:07.389> with<00:07:07.539> a<00:07:07.569> lot<00:07:07.749> of

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:07.899 
have a bit of a fiddle with a lot of

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:10.619 
have a bit of a fiddle with a lot of
things<00:07:08.110> so<00:07:08.550> if<00:07:09.550> there's<00:07:09.789> any<00:07:09.969> information

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:10.629 
things so if there's any information

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:14.779 
things so if there's any information
that<00:07:10.949> I<00:07:11.949> can<00:07:12.189> provide<00:07:12.579> I'll<00:07:12.819> be<00:07:12.939> happy<00:07:13.119> to<00:07:13.739> and

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:17.219 
that I can provide I'll be happy to and
maybe<00:07:15.789> I'll<00:07:16.029> develop<00:07:16.329> some<00:07:16.629> more<00:07:16.749> programs

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
maybe I'll develop some more programs

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:21.179 
maybe I'll develop some more programs
and<00:07:17.529> get<00:07:18.039> to<00:07:18.159> show<00:07:18.309> them<00:07:18.929> don't<00:07:19.929> worry<00:07:20.099> see<00:07:21.099> you

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:21.189 
and get to show them don't worry see you

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:24.179 
and get to show them don't worry see you
later<00:07:21.369> thank<00:07:21.849> you<00:07:21.909> very<00:07:21.969> much
