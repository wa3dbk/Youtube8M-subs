00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.180
 Well, let's do the test now 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.390
 deficiency and power 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.000
 jbl amplifier at 1.201 we are going to 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.130
 submit it to real test with a load 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.530
 lesson with a simple coil 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.970
 coil of a speaker that I have what 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.480
 quite powerful that is twice as 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.270
 coil 0.75m 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.190
 in this case it would be 15 real years in 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.050
 series since we have all the ropes 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.310
 of the other one's other coil each other 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.339
 so let's do the test and go 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.219
 to see amperage of continuous voltage of 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:39.829
 Continuous output voltage alternating 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.960
 of amplifier and alternating current 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.420
 output of the amplifier with this 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.550
 we will do the power test 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.920
 actual amplifier in this case the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.370
 amplifies the cd radio we will use 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.460
 a shirt that at 45 volume and in the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.160
 gain adjusted already in the amplifier 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.629
 the volume that you clipping maximum is 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.420
 45 volume and 40 40 forty and peak 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.790
 volts of reaching the clipping of 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.130
 real amplifier so the des of 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.050
 power will be exactly as it should 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.250
 be or knowing that that impedance 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.570
 puts samper amperage and tension then we 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.159
 will tell exactly the power that 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.040
 is really giving the amplifier to 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.830
 up to 50 hertz of frequency since 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.890
 we use a hubei ams test cd 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.179
 well let's start with the test 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.020
 we see that this volume is third we are going 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.020
 to start the amplifier 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.030
 now let's see the amperage of 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.950
 Continuous voltage source voltage 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.480
 output and output amperage with this already 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.060
 we will know exactly 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.160
 what efficiency and power is going to us 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.250
 deliver the amplifier to X pedra 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.650
 in this case it would be 15 years good we're going to 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.010
 start to give volume up to 45 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:04.320
 let's see the volume 45 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:07.860
 we see 26 amps 42 volts 112 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.479
 amps in source and 11 with 115 volts 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.659
 in source 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.319
 let's see and do the formula and now 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.319
 we comment
