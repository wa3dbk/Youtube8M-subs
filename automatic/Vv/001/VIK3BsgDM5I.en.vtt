cup so I have two tablespoons so I'm

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.509 
cup so I have two tablespoons so I'm
just<00:00:52.499> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.649> add<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.249> I'm<00:00:53.370> going<00:00:53.489> to

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
just going to add that and I'm going to

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.430 
just going to add that and I'm going to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
cream it with my butter the way that I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.669 
cream it with my butter the way that I
normally<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:56.159> and<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:57.269> will<00:00:57.539> keep<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.499> the

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
normally would and this will keep so the

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.439 
normally would and this will keep so the
molasses<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.789> any<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.120> these<00:01:00.239> other

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
molasses and or any of these other

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.450 
molasses and or any of these other
inverted<00:01:00.929> sugars<00:01:01.260> they're<00:01:02.129> they're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
inverted sugars they're they're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.690 
inverted sugars they're they're
basically<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.329> texture<00:01:03.749> they<00:01:04.460> keep<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
basically for texture they keep the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.570 
basically for texture they keep the
cookie<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.210> bit<00:01:06.600> softer<00:01:07.310> they<00:01:08.310> keep<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
cookie a little bit softer they keep it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.070 
cookie a little bit softer they keep it
from<00:01:08.670> drying<00:01:08.850> out<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.510> kind<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
from drying out so that's kind of the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.840 
from drying out so that's kind of the
purpose<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.410> it<00:01:10.620> serves<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.040> recipe<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
purpose that it serves in the recipe and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.640 
purpose that it serves in the recipe and
so<00:01:12.510> we're<00:01:12.720> still<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.260> ahead<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
so we're still going to go ahead and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.440 
so we're still going to go ahead and
proceed<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.310> still<00:01:14.790> sometimes<00:01:15.180> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
proceed because you still sometimes you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.420 
proceed because you still sometimes you
just<00:01:15.480> you<00:01:15.780> want<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.170> cookie<00:01:16.290> we're<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.370> to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
just you want a cookie we're going to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.130 
just you want a cookie we're going to
cream<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> butter<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.410> sugar

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.630 

and<00:01:24.290> when<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.410> fluffy<00:01:25.830> we're<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and when that's fluffy we're going to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.550 
and when that's fluffy we're going to
add<00:01:26.790> an<00:01:26.910> egg<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.210> here<00:01:30.210> I've<00:01:30.330> combined<00:01:30.840> all<00:01:31.200> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
add an egg and here I've combined all of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.200 
add an egg and here I've combined all of
my<00:01:31.770> dry<00:01:31.980> ingredients<00:01:32.160> I've<00:01:32.640> salt<00:01:32.910> baking

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
my dry ingredients I've salt baking

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.920 
my dry ingredients I've salt baking
powder<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.870> flour<00:01:35.360> let's<00:01:36.360> scrape<00:01:36.660> this<00:01:36.870> down

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
powder and flour let's scrape this down

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.469 
powder and flour let's scrape this down
once<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.250> pretty<00:01:38.550> much<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.970> process

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
once and really pretty much the process

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.300 
once and really pretty much the process
is<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> same<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.020> making<00:01:40.590> your<00:01:40.800> cookies<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
is the same for making your cookies you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.800 
is the same for making your cookies you
could<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.550> this<00:01:41.670> by<00:01:41.850> hand<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.330> well<00:01:42.510> with<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
could do this by hand as well with a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.830 
could do this by hand as well with a
wooden<00:01:43.140> spoon<00:01:43.550> but<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:46.200> takes<00:01:46.380> longer

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.670 

just<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.900> little<00:01:52.080> bit<00:01:52.170> longer<00:01:52.350> when<00:01:52.590> you're

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
just a little bit longer when you're

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.020 
just a little bit longer when you're
mixing<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.190> want<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> make<00:01:53.520> sure<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.790> don't

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
mixing you want to make sure you don't

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.700 
mixing you want to make sure you don't
