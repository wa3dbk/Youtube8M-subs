all<00:00:04.569> air<00:00:04.810> conditioners<00:00:05.380> have<00:00:05.590> a<00:00:05.620> drain<00:00:05.950> line

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.250 
all air conditioners have a drain line

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.150 
all air conditioners have a drain line
as<00:00:06.490> you<00:00:06.880> can<00:00:07.060> see<00:00:07.299> here<00:00:07.830> most<00:00:08.830> of<00:00:09.040> our

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
as you can see here most of our

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.650 
as you can see here most of our
homeowners<00:00:09.700> don't<00:00:09.910> even<00:00:10.180> know<00:00:10.330> where<00:00:10.510> they

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
homeowners don't even know where they

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.430 
homeowners don't even know where they
drain<00:00:10.990> out<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:12.460> this<00:00:12.639> particular<00:00:13.030> drain<00:00:13.630> it's

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
drain out in this particular drain it's

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.970 
drain out in this particular drain it's
heavily<00:00:15.360> covered<00:00:16.360> up<00:00:16.689> with<00:00:16.930> vegetation<00:00:17.560> and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
heavily covered up with vegetation and

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.670 
heavily covered up with vegetation and
flowers<00:00:18.700> so<00:00:19.450> it's<00:00:19.599> actually<00:00:19.779> difficult<00:00:20.200> to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
flowers so it's actually difficult to

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.999 
flowers so it's actually difficult to
find<00:00:21.599> we<00:00:22.599> typically<00:00:23.050> know<00:00:23.320> where<00:00:23.529> all<00:00:23.739> of<00:00:23.919> them

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
find we typically know where all of them

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.400 
find we typically know where all of them
are<00:00:24.250> and<00:00:24.550> if<00:00:24.669> we<00:00:24.910> don't<00:00:25.090> we<00:00:25.360> will<00:00:25.390> find<00:00:25.869> it<00:00:26.050> we

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
are and if we don't we will find it we

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.710 
are and if we don't we will find it we
have<00:00:26.590> our<00:00:26.800> ways<00:00:26.829> at<00:00:27.610> this<00:00:27.910> point<00:00:28.239> in<00:00:28.480> the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
have our ways at this point in the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.810 
have our ways at this point in the
checkup<00:00:29.169> what<00:00:29.380> we<00:00:29.500> like<00:00:29.710> to<00:00:29.739> do<00:00:30.009> is<00:00:30.220> vacuum<00:00:30.460> out

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
checkup what we like to do is vacuum out

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.240 
checkup what we like to do is vacuum out
the<00:00:30.849> drain<00:00:31.270> lines<00:00:31.540> this<00:00:32.110> helps<00:00:32.529> us<00:00:32.649> clear<00:00:33.070> your

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
the drain lines this helps us clear your

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
we will be careful okay at this point

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.140 
we will be careful okay at this point
we'll<00:01:32.080> hook<00:01:32.320> our<00:01:32.530> vacuum<00:01:32.799> up<00:01:33.220> on<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.729> suction

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
we'll hook our vacuum up on the suction

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.020 
we'll hook our vacuum up on the suction
side<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:35.080> we<00:01:35.440> will<00:01:35.619> turn<00:01:35.799> our<00:01:35.860> vacuums<00:01:36.460> on<00:01:36.670> and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
side and we will turn our vacuums on and

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.660 
side and we will turn our vacuums on and
suck<00:01:37.420> out<00:01:37.600> this<00:01:37.840> drain<00:01:38.140> line<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.680> see<00:01:39.430> what's

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
suck out this drain line and see what's

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.649 
suck out this drain line and see what's
growing<00:01:39.850> inside<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.090> touch<00:01:43.299> base<00:01:43.360> a

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
growing inside it just to touch base a

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.990 
growing inside it just to touch base a
little<00:01:44.049> bit<00:01:44.290> though<00:01:44.500> if<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:45.220> have<00:01:45.430> thick

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
little bit though if you have thick

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.690 
little bit though if you have thick
vegetation<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:47.590> actually<00:01:48.130> growing<00:01:48.369> up

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
vegetation that's actually growing up

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.550 
vegetation that's actually growing up
around<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.540> drain<00:01:49.900> line<00:01:50.140> because<00:01:50.380> it's

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
around this drain line because it's

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.500 
around this drain line because it's
producing<00:01:51.070> water<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:51.700> attracting<00:01:52.330> those

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
producing water and attracting those

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.310 
producing water and attracting those
plants<00:01:53.159> they<00:01:54.159> can<00:01:54.580> actually<00:01:54.939> clog<00:01:55.689> this<00:01:55.990> drain

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
plants they can actually clog this drain

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.530 
plants they can actually clog this drain
line<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:57.400> if<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.700> have<00:01:57.970> those<00:01:58.210> type<00:01:58.510> of

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
line so if you have those type of

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.780 
line so if you have those type of
gardens<00:01:59.140> make<00:01:59.439> sure<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.770> periodically<00:02:00.400> check

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
gardens make sure you periodically check

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.050 
gardens make sure you periodically check
and<00:02:01.060> clip<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.330> gardening<00:02:02.020> away<00:02:02.320> from<00:02:02.530> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and clip the gardening away from it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.280 
and clip the gardening away from it
alright<00:02:04.060> I'm<00:02:04.210> going<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:04.390> turn<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:04.659> vacuum<00:02:04.930> on

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
alright I'm going to turn this vacuum on

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.990
