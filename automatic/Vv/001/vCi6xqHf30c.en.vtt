see<00:00:41.610> twist<00:00:41.969> batteries<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.260> vision

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
see twist batteries and the vision

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
see twist batteries and the vision
spinner<00:00:43.800> batteries<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.640> there<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
spinner batteries out there on the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.350 
spinner batteries out there on the
market<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:46.020> would<00:00:46.710> say<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.190> those<00:00:47.430> two<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.149> is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
market I would say of those two this is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.150 
market I would say of those two this is
more<00:00:48.660> similar<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.469> vision<00:00:49.829> spinner

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
more similar to the vision spinner

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.819 
more similar to the vision spinner
batteries<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.780> larger<00:00:52.170> 1300

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
batteries because it is that larger 1300

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.549 
batteries because it is that larger 1300
mah<00:00:52.949> size<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.629> little<00:00:54.930> bit<00:00:55.079> larger<00:00:55.440> in

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
mah size it is a little bit larger in

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.760 
mah size it is a little bit larger in
diameter<00:00:55.800> than<00:00:56.219> your<00:00:56.550> standard<00:00:56.760> ego<00:00:57.149> battery

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
diameter than your standard ego battery

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.229 
diameter than your standard ego battery
it<00:00:58.770> does<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> same<00:00:59.370> ego<00:00:59.699> threads<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> is

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it does have the same ego threads it is

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.700 
it does have the same ego threads it is
actually<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> same<00:01:00.840> size<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> vision

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
actually the same size as the vision

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.219 
actually the same size as the vision
spinner<00:01:01.949> batteries<00:01:02.719> because<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> same

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
spinner batteries because it is the same

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.740 
spinner batteries because it is the same
capacity<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.549> smoke<00:01:06.150> tech<00:01:06.360> took<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.720> step

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
capacity but smoke tech took it a step

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.840 
capacity but smoke tech took it a step
further<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> said<00:01:07.830> hey<00:01:07.979> guys<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.670> just

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
further and said hey guys we're not just

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.310 
further and said hey guys we're not just
gonna<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.210> variable<00:01:09.600> voltage<00:01:09.720> we're<00:01:10.229> gonna

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
gonna do variable voltage we're gonna

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.010 
gonna do variable voltage we're gonna
add<00:01:10.590> variable<00:01:11.040> wattage<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> big

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
add variable wattage and that is a big

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.770 
add variable wattage and that is a big
deal<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.560> I'll<00:01:14.189> tell<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.520> kind<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.939> why<00:01:15.150> if

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
deal and I'll tell you kind of why if

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.910 
deal and I'll tell you kind of why if
you<00:01:15.900> haven't<00:01:16.170> heard<00:01:16.229> me<00:01:16.409> explain<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
you haven't heard me explain the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.679 
you haven't heard me explain the
difference<00:01:16.950> between<00:01:17.369> variable<00:01:18.090> voltage<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
difference between variable voltage and

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.830 
difference between variable voltage and
variable<00:01:19.020> wattage<00:01:19.140> before<00:01:20.240> voltage<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.540> kind

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
variable wattage before voltage is kind

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.280 
variable wattage before voltage is kind
of<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.020> constant<00:01:22.619> output<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.750> voltage<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.020> gonna

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
of a constant output so voltage is gonna

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.649 
of a constant output so voltage is gonna
going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> change<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.460> experience<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.509> you

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
going to change the experience that you

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.200 
going to change the experience that you
get<00:01:27.900> depending<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.189> resistance<00:01:29.939> your

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
get depending on what resistance your

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.810 
get depending on what resistance your
atomizer<00:01:30.840> you're<00:01:31.140> using<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.040> device<00:01:32.400> so

fairly decent us the kind of your normal
normal<00:01:46.350> hit<00:01:46.590> now<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.700> change<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
normal hit now if you change that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.510 
normal hit now if you change that
atomizer<00:01:48.689> up<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.140> put<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> 1.8<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.280> mattah

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
atomizer up and put a 1.8 on mattah

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.609 
atomizer up and put a 1.8 on mattah
miser<00:01:50.790> or<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.210> lower<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.780> resistance<00:01:52.439> down

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
miser or you lower that resistance down

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.560 
miser or you lower that resistance down
then<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> hit<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:54.119> harder<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
then it's going to hit a lot harder a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.590 
then it's going to hit a lot harder a
lot<00:01:54.780> warmer<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.640> same<00:01:56.909> power

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
lot warmer because that same power

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.030 
lot warmer because that same power
output<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.259> going<00:01:58.560> through<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> lower

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
output is going through a lower

side<00:02:01.299> so<00:02:01.990> it's<00:02:02.140> going<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.350> allow<00:02:02.530> a<00:02:02.560> lot<00:02:02.890> more

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
side so it's going to allow a lot more

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.760 
side so it's going to allow a lot more
power<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.820> come<00:02:04.060> through<00:02:04.510> and<00:02:04.869> going<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.590> heat

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
power to come through and going to heat

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.559 
power to come through and going to heat
up<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.979> lot<00:02:06.190> hotter<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.720> what<00:02:07.960> wattage<00:02:08.259> does<00:02:08.800> is

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
up a lot hotter so what wattage does is

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.330 
up a lot hotter so what wattage does is
basically<00:02:10.569> turns<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.200> into<00:02:11.319> an<00:02:11.800> automatic

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
basically turns it into an automatic

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.420 
basically turns it into an automatic
setting<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.959> once<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.319> set<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.620> wattage<00:02:15.220> on

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
setting so once you set the wattage on

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.699 
setting so once you set the wattage on
the<00:02:15.580> device<00:02:15.940> regardless<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:17.020> what<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.319> change

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
the device regardless of what you change

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.610 
the device regardless of what you change
the<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.550> ohms<00:02:18.850> or<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.540> resistance<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.470> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
the the ohms or the resistance of the

whatever<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.140> sit<00:02:23.319> on<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.500> no<00:02:24.310> matter<00:02:24.489> what

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
whatever you sit on it no matter what

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.059 
whatever you sit on it no matter what
the<00:02:24.880> resistance<00:02:25.209> changes<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.170> it's<00:02:26.800> gonna

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
the resistance changes to it's gonna

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.430 
the resistance changes to it's gonna
automatically<00:02:27.850> adjust<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.480> voltage<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.410> you

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
automatically adjust the voltage so you

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.680 
automatically adjust the voltage so you
get<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.920> same<00:02:30.130> power<00:02:30.459> output<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.270> get<00:02:31.569> the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
get the same power output so you get the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.830 
get the same power output so you get the
same<00:02:31.959> experience<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.830> same<00:02:33.310> level<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:34.480> hit

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
same experience the same level of hit

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.130 
same experience the same level of hit
out<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.980> device<00:02:36.280> regardless<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.540> what<00:02:37.959> you

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
out of the device regardless of what you

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.470 
out of the device regardless of what you
have<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.380> top<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.010> battery<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:40.239> kind

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
have on top of that battery so it kind

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.120 
have on top of that battery so it kind
of<00:02:40.540> turns<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.870> into<00:02:40.989> automatic<00:02:41.440> where<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.950> can

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
of turns it into automatic where you can

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.370 
of turns it into automatic where you can
set<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.670> forget<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:43.060> if<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:44.019> know<00:02:44.170> that

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
set it and forget it if you know that

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.520 
set it and forget it if you know that
term<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.940> know<00:02:46.030> if<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.690> find<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.290> power

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
term you know if you find the power

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.790 
term you know if you find the power
output<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.959> then<00:02:50.260> no<00:02:50.650> matter

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
output that you like and then no matter

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.650 
output that you like and then no matter
if<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.160> change<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.700> different<00:02:51.819> flavor<00:02:52.269> or

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
if you change to a different flavor or

automatically<00:02:54.850> adjust<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.569> power<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.200> you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
automatically adjust that power so you

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.620 
automatically adjust that power so you
get<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.739> same<00:02:57.010> exact<00:02:57.400> experience<00:02:57.700> out<00:02:58.269> of<00:02:58.300> it

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
get the same exact experience out of it

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.300 
get the same exact experience out of it
and<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.290> don't<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.680> fiddle<00:02:59.890> with<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.220> all

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
and you don't have to fiddle with it all

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.150 
and you don't have to fiddle with it all
the<00:03:00.430> time<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:00.670> that's<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.720> big<00:03:01.900> deal<00:03:02.140> for<00:03:03.069> a<00:03:03.100> lot

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
the time so that's a big deal for a lot

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.130 
the time so that's a big deal for a lot
of<00:03:03.310> users<00:03:03.580> out<00:03:04.000> there<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.480> makes<00:03:04.630> it<00:03:04.810> really

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
of users out there it makes it really

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.420 
of users out there it makes it really
easy<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.680> operate<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:07.110> smoke<00:03:08.110> tech<00:03:08.350> is<00:03:08.530> as<00:03:08.860> far

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
easy to operate and smoke tech is as far

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.420 
easy to operate and smoke tech is as far
as<00:03:09.549> I<00:03:09.670> know<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:10.060> first<00:03:10.269> one<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.600> add<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:11.049> to

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
as I know the first one to add that to

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.550 
as I know the first one to add that to
to<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.459> battery<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.030> as<00:03:13.600> far<00:03:13.870> as<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.110> big<00:03:14.290> brand

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
to a battery and as far as the big brand

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.940 
to a battery and as far as the big brand
names<00:03:14.829> go<00:03:15.100> so<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:16.570> is<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.780> real<00:03:17.019> big<00:03:17.170> deal<00:03:17.200> and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
names go so it is a real big deal and

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.680 
names go so it is a real big deal and
they<00:03:18.160> are<00:03:18.310> really<00:03:18.549> nice-looking<00:03:18.850> batteries

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
they are really nice-looking batteries

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.900 
they are really nice-looking batteries
they<00:03:19.780> have<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> good<00:03:20.079> feel<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.380> them<00:03:20.910> they

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
they have a good feel to them they

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.910 
they have a good feel to them they
they're<00:03:22.299> they're<00:03:22.600> all<00:03:22.630> painted<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.440> glossy

they're they're all painted in a glossy
paint<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:25.150> rather<00:03:25.420> than<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.810> rubberized

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
paint and rather than the rubberized

paint and rather than the rubberized
paint<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.980> lot<00:03:27.579> of<00:03:27.700> people<00:03:27.910> like<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.120> because

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
paint a lot of people like that because

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.590 
paint a lot of people like that because
it<00:03:28.930> gives<00:03:29.200> you<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.410> metallic<00:03:30.250> look<00:03:30.579> and<00:03:31.120> we

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
it gives you that metallic look and we

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.420 
it gives you that metallic look and we

goes<00:03:48.190> it's<00:03:49.060> really<00:03:49.540> easy<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:50.019> adjust<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.760> can

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
goes it's really easy to adjust you can

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.039 
goes it's really easy to adjust you can
see<00:03:52.150> their<00:03:53.310> 3.2<00:03:54.310> volts<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.540> lowest

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
see their 3.2 volts is the lowest

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.240 
see their 3.2 volts is the lowest
voltage<00:03:56.579> their<00:03:57.579> go<00:03:58.239> focus<00:03:58.720> in<00:03:59.019> and<00:03:59.230> it<00:04:00.100> goes

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
voltage their go focus in and it goes

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.360 
voltage their go focus in and it goes
all<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.609> way<00:04:00.790> up<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:02.590> four<00:04:02.799> point<00:04:03.040> eight<00:04:03.130> volts

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
all the way up to four point eight volts

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.400 
all the way up to four point eight volts
now<00:04:03.910> when<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.120> comes<00:04:04.269> to<00:04:04.390> wattage<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:05.170> goes

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
now when it comes to wattage it goes

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.979 
now when it comes to wattage it goes
from<00:04:05.590> four<00:04:06.010> four<00:04:06.670> Watts<00:04:06.940> four<00:04:07.690> point<00:04:07.930> zero

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
from four four Watts four point zero

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.320 
from four four Watts four point zero
Watts<00:04:08.440> goes<00:04:09.400> all<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.640> way<00:04:09.730> up<00:04:09.909> to<00:04:10.060> twelve

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
Watts goes all the way up to twelve

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.110 
Watts goes all the way up to twelve
watts<00:04:10.680> which<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.709> really<00:04:12.250> really<00:04:12.370> high<00:04:12.640> so<00:04:13.060> you

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
watts which is really really high so you

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.340 
watts which is really really high so you
can<00:04:13.569> use<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.720> really

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
can use a really

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.949 
can use a really
lomé<00:04:14.830> atomizer<00:04:15.670> on<00:04:15.910> top<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.240> this<00:04:16.300> battery<00:04:16.780> and

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
lomé atomizer on top of this battery and

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.060 
lomé atomizer on top of this battery and
it's<00:04:17.080> still<00:04:17.200> going<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.410> be<00:04:17.500> able<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.800> put<00:04:17.950> out

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
it's still going to be able to put out

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.060 
it's still going to be able to put out
the<00:04:18.190> wattage<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:19.780> this<00:04:20.020> you<00:04:20.170> need<00:04:20.350> for<00:04:20.680> it<00:04:20.830> so

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
the wattage that this you need for it so

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.880 
the wattage that this you need for it so
it's<00:04:21.940> really<00:04:22.300> cool<00:04:22.630> device<00:04:22.780> now<00:04:23.350> as<00:04:23.560> far<00:04:23.800> as

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
it's really cool device now as far as

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.590 
it's really cool device now as far as
how<00:04:24.040> it<00:04:24.070> functions<00:04:24.640> you<00:04:25.030> can<00:04:25.180> see<00:04:25.330> right<00:04:25.570> now

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
how it functions you can see right now

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.380 
how it functions you can see right now
it<00:04:26.140> does<00:04:26.440> have<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.550> 5<00:04:27.730> click<00:04:28.030> safety

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
it does have the the 5 click safety

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.420 
it does have the the 5 click safety
functions<00:04:28.840> so<00:04:28.990> let<00:04:29.110> me<00:04:29.200> show<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.890> it

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
functions so let me show that to you it

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.360 
functions so let me show that to you it
at<00:04:30.580> 5<00:04:30.790> times<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.480> you<00:04:31.570> see<00:04:31.780> it<00:04:31.930> changed<00:04:32.350> 3<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.280> 4

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
at 5 times and you see it changed 3 to 4

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.880 
at 5 times and you see it changed 3 to 4
colors<00:04:33.490> here<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.850> had<00:04:33.970> red<00:04:34.240> white<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:34.630> blue

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
colors here it had red white and blue

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.050 
colors here it had red white and blue
let<00:04:35.890> me<00:04:35.980> turn<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.160> back<00:04:36.280> on<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.670> you'll<00:04:36.820> see<00:04:36.970> it

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
let me turn it back on and you'll see it

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.360 
let me turn it back on and you'll see it
again<00:04:37.800> red<00:04:38.800> white<00:04:39.280> blue<00:04:40.560> very<00:04:41.560> patriotic<00:04:42.070> of

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
again red white blue very patriotic of

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.180 
again red white blue very patriotic of
my<00:04:42.610> team<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.500> right<00:04:44.500> now<00:04:44.680> is<00:04:44.860> set<00:04:45.070> on<00:04:45.160> the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
my team but right now is set on the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.950 
my team but right now is set on the
white<00:04:45.490> setting<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.150> that<00:04:46.420> is<00:04:46.570> actually<00:04:46.780> the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
white setting and that is actually the

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.840 
white setting and that is actually the
voltage<00:04:47.530> setting<00:04:48.010> so<00:04:48.250> if<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.460> want<00:04:48.640> to<00:04:48.700> change

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
voltage setting so if I want to change

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.120 
voltage setting so if I want to change
that<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.510> wattage<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.290> simply<00:04:50.740> click<00:04:50.980> it

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
that to the wattage I simply click it

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.760 
that to the wattage I simply click it
three<00:04:51.370> times<00:04:51.670> and<00:04:52.030> then<00:04:52.960> it<00:04:53.080> lights<00:04:53.260> up<00:04:53.470> blue

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
three times and then it lights up blue

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.710 
three times and then it lights up blue
and<00:04:54.070> that's<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.610> wattage<00:04:55.000> setting<00:04:55.030> so<00:04:55.600> now

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
and that's the wattage setting so now

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.090 
and that's the wattage setting so now
every<00:04:55.960> time<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.200> press<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.560> button<00:04:56.590> it's<00:04:56.980> going

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
every time I press the button it's going

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.980 
every time I press the button it's going
to<00:04:57.160> light<00:04:57.310> up<00:04:57.460> blue<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:57.970> I'm<00:04:58.390> on<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.600> wattage

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
to light up blue and I'm on the wattage

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.840 
to light up blue and I'm on the wattage
and<00:04:59.230> these<00:04:59.380> are<00:04:59.560> completely<00:05:00.100> separate<00:05:00.820> from

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
and these are completely separate from

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.940 
and these are completely separate from
one<00:05:01.090> another<00:05:01.120> in<00:05:01.540> terms<00:05:01.570> I<00:05:02.260> know<00:05:02.320> they<00:05:02.590> use<00:05:02.800> the

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
one another in terms I know they use the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.740 
one another in terms I know they use the
same<00:05:03.190> graph<00:05:03.460> on<00:05:03.730> the<00:05:03.820> bottom<00:05:03.850> just<00:05:04.390> because<00:05:04.630> it

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
same graph on the bottom just because it

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.260 
same graph on the bottom just because it
was<00:05:04.870> easy<00:05:05.170> but<00:05:06.100> whenever<00:05:06.310> it's<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.850> wattage

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
was easy but whenever it's and wattage

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.330 
was easy but whenever it's and wattage
setting<00:05:07.690> is<00:05:07.840> going<00:05:08.170> by<00:05:08.320> that<00:05:08.350> wattage<00:05:08.980> number

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
setting is going by that wattage number

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.580 
setting is going by that wattage number
down<00:05:09.550> there<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:10.120> not<00:05:10.420> the<00:05:10.600> voltage<00:05:10.840> number<00:05:11.380> so

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
down there and not the voltage number so

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.590 
down there and not the voltage number so
the<00:05:11.740> voltage<00:05:12.400> number<00:05:12.700> has<00:05:12.880> nothing<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.360> do

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
the voltage number has nothing to do

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.120 
the voltage number has nothing to do
with<00:05:13.630> it<00:05:13.990> whenever<00:05:14.260> it's<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:14.710> wattage<00:05:15.100> mode

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
with it whenever it's in wattage mode

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.640 
with it whenever it's in wattage mode
and<00:05:15.610> vice-versa<00:05:16.450> if<00:05:16.720> it's<00:05:16.990> if<00:05:17.230> it's<00:05:17.410> in

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
and vice-versa if it's if it's in

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.910 
and vice-versa if it's if it's in
portage<00:05:18.010> mode<00:05:18.250> if<00:05:18.490> I<00:05:18.580> change<00:05:18.850> it<00:05:18.970> back<00:05:19.150> over<00:05:19.420> to

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
portage mode if I change it back over to

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.430 
portage mode if I change it back over to
voltage<00:05:20.920> mode<00:05:21.210> now<00:05:22.210> I'm<00:05:22.480> only<00:05:22.690> looking<00:05:22.960> at<00:05:23.320> the

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
voltage mode now I'm only looking at the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.200 
voltage mode now I'm only looking at the
voltage<00:05:23.710> number<00:05:24.220> down<00:05:24.430> at<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.670> bottom<00:05:24.850> and

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
voltage number down at the bottom and

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.300 
voltage number down at the bottom and
not<00:05:25.420> that<00:05:25.660> wattage<00:05:26.050> number<00:05:26.500> because<00:05:26.800> that

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
not that wattage number because that

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.050 
not that wattage number because that
means<00:05:27.520> nothing

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
means nothing

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.030 
means nothing
based<00:05:28.840> on<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.140> setting<00:05:29.440> that<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.620> have<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:29.920> on

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
based on the setting that I have it on

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.420 
based on the setting that I have it on
right<00:05:30.220> now<00:05:30.840> but<00:05:31.840> really<00:05:32.170> cool<00:05:32.530> idea<00:05:32.920> now<00:05:33.220> that

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
right now but really cool idea now that
