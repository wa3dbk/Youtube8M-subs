00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
assaults the German ships were very good

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.070 
assaults the German ships were very good
at<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:52.710> time<00:03:53.090> they<00:03:54.090> were<00:03:54.240> competing<00:03:54.660> with

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080

at this time they were competing with
the<00:03:55.320> British<00:03:56.310> ones<00:03:56.990> so<00:03:57.990> the<00:03:58.200> whole<00:03:58.350> fleet<00:03:58.709> I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
the British ones so the whole fleet I

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.980 
the British ones so the whole fleet I
think<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.370> more<00:03:59.550> than<00:03:59.959> 120<00:04:01.700> more<00:04:02.700> than<00:04:02.990> 120
