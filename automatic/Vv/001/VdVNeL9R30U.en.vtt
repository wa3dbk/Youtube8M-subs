standpoint has really trickled down to

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.220 
standpoint has really trickled down to
the<00:06:54.730> guys<00:06:54.910> in<00:06:55.060> my<00:06:55.090> opinion<00:06:55.420> from<00:06:55.930> that<00:06:56.080> from

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
the guys in my opinion from that from

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.930 
the guys in my opinion from that from
that<00:06:56.260> standpoint<00:06:56.650> how<00:06:57.220> happy<00:06:57.670> are<00:06:57.760> you<00:06:57.910> with

that standpoint how happy are you with
the<00:06:58.630> way<00:06:58.810> he<00:06:58.990> handles<00:06:59.440> this<00:06:59.740> he<00:07:00.250> seems<00:07:00.520> to<00:07:00.640> say

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790 
the way he handles this he seems to say

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.280 
the way he handles this he seems to say
all<00:07:01.000> the<00:07:01.150> right<00:07:01.270> things<00:07:01.330> when<00:07:01.810> he's<00:07:01.960> asked

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.290 
all the right things when he's asked

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.900 
all the right things when he's asked
about<00:07:02.410> himself<00:07:02.650> he<00:07:03.010> always<00:07:03.430> because<00:07:03.670> that's

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
about himself he always because that's

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.580 
about himself he always because that's
the<00:07:03.970> key<00:07:04.210> here's<00:07:04.660> why<00:07:04.810> I<00:07:04.840> think<00:07:04.930> he<00:07:05.230> does<00:07:05.410> that

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
the key here's why I think he does that

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:06.480 
the key here's why I think he does that
because<00:07:05.680> I<00:07:05.830> think<00:07:05.890> it's<00:07:06.100> really<00:07:06.220> believes

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
because I think it's really believes

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.300 
because I think it's really believes
right<00:07:06.760> and<00:07:07.060> it's<00:07:07.870> easy<00:07:08.080> to<00:07:08.380> be<00:07:08.560> genuine<00:07:09.070> and

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
right and it's easy to be genuine and

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.860 
right and it's easy to be genuine and
say<00:07:09.520> things<00:07:09.580> that<00:07:09.880> you<00:07:10.030> truly<00:07:10.210> believe<00:07:10.510> you

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
say things that you truly believe you

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.270 
say things that you truly believe you
know<00:07:10.960> I<00:07:10.990> mean<00:07:11.170> and<00:07:11.530> I<00:07:11.590> think<00:07:11.650> that's<00:07:11.860> where<00:07:12.130> his

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
know I mean and I think that's where his

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.680 
know I mean and I think that's where his
sincerity<00:07:12.610> comes<00:07:12.940> from<00:07:13.120> because<00:07:13.360> I<00:07:13.480> think

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
sincerity comes from because I think

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.330 
sincerity comes from because I think
that's<00:07:13.810> the<00:07:13.870> way<00:07:13.960> he<00:07:14.080> looks<00:07:14.290> at<00:07:14.380> the<00:07:14.500> game<00:07:14.680> any

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340 
that's the way he looks at the game any

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.150 
that's the way he looks at the game any
understand<00:07:15.820> he<00:07:16.150> understands<00:07:16.810> the<00:07:17.110> game<00:07:17.320> that

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 
understand he understands the game that

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.980 
understand he understands the game that
he<00:07:18.190> can't<00:07:18.640> do<00:07:18.820> what<00:07:18.970> he<00:07:19.060> does<00:07:19.270> without

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
he can't do what he does without

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.900 
he can't do what he does without
everybody<00:07:20.320> else<00:07:20.650> and<00:07:21.250> I<00:07:21.340> think<00:07:21.550> that's<00:07:21.730> what

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:21.910 
everybody else and I think that's what

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.640 
everybody else and I think that's what
the<00:07:22.300> guys<00:07:22.510> who<00:07:22.720> make<00:07:22.900> an<00:07:23.020> impact<00:07:23.320> on<00:07:23.440> this<00:07:23.560> game

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.650 
the guys who make an impact on this game

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 
and last for a long time truly grasp it

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.350 
and last for a long time truly grasp it
seems<00:07:27.070> like<00:07:27.190> his<00:07:27.340> teammates<00:07:27.730> understand<00:07:28.240> that
