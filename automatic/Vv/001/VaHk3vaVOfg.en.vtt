 time saying is that I'm going to upload it and 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.360
 the truth is that I recorded it and I had a 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.140
 problem with the sound so do not 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.390
 I could put it on but I'm going to 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.789
 re -record and that's my routine 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.039
 I told you that lately I had the 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.820
 phenomenal skin today I'm going to show you my 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.529
 daily routine in the morning but if 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.620
 you are interested in knowing what is my 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.100
 Make-up removing routine of treatment 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.839
 night special treatments 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.180
 during the week then exfoliation so 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.739
 tell me to ask me if you want me 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.140

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.629
 information box or also through 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.570
 of the comments on the blog me when 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.420
 I get up in the morning the first thing 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.820
 All I do is wash and wash my 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.960
 face and for this I am using this 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.650
 shows but I have it practically 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.449
 finished and I will replace the one that the 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.549
 gave away next to the tonic that now 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.110
 I will teach is from mario valdez that I 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.670
 gave away in some order I made to 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.450
 beauty very 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.420
 this cleaner is a cleaner 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.080
 with a cream-like texture do not wait 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.360
 a lot of foam but nevertheless clean very 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.310
 well the face without dehydrating it and without 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.070
 eliminate the entire lipid layer which is what 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.039
 that make the soaps that make foams 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.909
 The truth is that I really like it 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.770
 done the sample I have it practically 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.550
 just the buoy I'm going to buy him the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.010
 large size 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.890
 once I 've cleaned my face 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:47.420
 I use this 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.610
 a tonic that is actually a spray 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.820
 facial I use it as a tonic because 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.070
 in general the tonics dry me a 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.979
 little skin and this one however that 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.810
 is in what is composed leads to then 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.040
 He was carrying rose water and he also smells 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.909
 delicious you apply it on the skin and 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.310
 accelerates notes as the skin is not the 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.739
 you feel so tight the note is bright 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.270
 the truth is that I love it once 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:21.590
 I have absorbed the water I proceeded to 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.940
 apply a zero during the winter I 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.050
 I'm using the one that I'm going to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.090
 Now that I teach just 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.880
 finish and I'll show you what I'm 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.620
 using right at this moment is 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.290
 using the hydra bio 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.489
 bioderma serum that the truth is that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.549
 for all those who have to 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.010
 you have sensitive skin you can 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.769
 work quite well brings a lot 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.720
 hydration many times the problem of 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.909
 dehydration what it causes is all 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.290
 the area open deposits I will leave you 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.540
 also in the information box the 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.890
 link to a post I made about skin is 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.140
 difference brings dry skin and skin 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.540
 dehydrated I have dry skin and 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.400
 also dehydrated this product by 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.260
 this for what I tell you is not only useful 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.640
 for dry skin like mine but that 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.650
 It is super useful for all those who 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.730
 simply have dehydrated skin 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.250
 although you have fat 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.080
 the product that I am using after 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.920
 of having read many reviews about 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:19.049
 him and also on the recommendation of 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.250
 my sister kris is of flow and the serum 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.569
 they alter the estuary s the truth is that 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.030
 I think that the function he performs goes up 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.580
 similar to that of bio darma just that 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.200
 contributes a bit more hydration is of 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.099
 have applied the serum in which I was 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.110
 I have absorbed well produced apply 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.879
 the proteoglycans that I think is already what 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.950
 they teach some video in favorites in the 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.480
 of February I create these projects 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.950
 published are the specials for 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.980
 normal and dry skins and provide 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.980
 vitamin C 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.950
 but they do not dry anything the skin is a 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.380
 movie that looks very oily in the 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.240
 first moment of application but that 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.890
 once absorbed is a tad in 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.690
 absorb then what I do is 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.940
 apply melo and while I was 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.770
 absorbing then I finished dressing 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.720
 then once it has already been 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.940
 absorbed you see this supports normally 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.740
 you see the blister 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.200
 and usually with the ampule I have for 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.400
 two or three times do not try to sink the 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.890
 more because he loses the vitamin c test 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.230
 it is deactivated loses the properties 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.090
 so then well that two or three times 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.210
 I applied it for the face and also for 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.550
 the neck once I have been absorbed 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.910
 and I have already completely dry skin me 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.860
 applied my facial the truth 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.010
 is that I'm using look now what 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.380
 I have practically finished is the extra 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:48.110
 repair teacher and see this plugin 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:51.320
 bobby braun is a balm but really 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.590
 is that it's a wonder it 's expensive I think 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.090
 It costs around 100 euros 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.740
 how do i have the discount the card 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.040
 bobby braun professional I think that 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.660
 it costs me around 70 in it's expensive 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.630
 but it really deserves a lot 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.850
 It's worth it, I think I'll replace it because 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.220
 moisturizes a lot and leaves the skin 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.050
 great and also if you do not want it 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.970
 use with a treatment but the 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.650
 you want to use as a preliminary cream 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.569
 makeup you can not imagine what 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.240
 comes 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.249
 with this cream applied before and after 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.199
 as eye contour as I teach but 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.240
 you already know from what memory because that 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.309
 face of one hundred thousand videos is the only one 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.899
 I like I've used a lot of 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:30.819
 a lot of signatures are enough for me 

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:32.229
 money with lathes and this one finally is 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:36.240
 which I like the most and is the extra and 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.240
 bobby brown reaper cream 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.250
 I know that lasts a lot the truth is that a 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.680
 I do not last so long but in the morning 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.870
 at night before putting on makeup I'm 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.910
 continuously applying me contour and 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.560

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.570

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.270
 finally what you can explain to me 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.830
 a lip balm and I use the lip 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.010
