the<00:01:44.420> first<00:01:44.690> I<00:01:45.110> think<00:01:45.800> it<00:01:46.070> is<00:01:46.220> more

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
the first I think it is more

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.469 
the first I think it is more
commercially<00:01:47.000> yeah<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:47.330> is<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:49.190> song<00:01:49.429> I<00:01:50.030> don't

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
know what it's doing better business so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.350 
know what it's doing better business so
we<00:01:54.679> must<00:01:54.830> be<00:01:54.920> more<00:01:55.130> commercial<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:58.490> age<00:01:58.670> when

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
we must be more commercial of age when

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.090 
we must be more commercial of age when
things<00:01:59.569> get<00:01:59.780> old<00:01:59.840> of<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.289> I<00:02:00.470> think<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.890> lot<00:02:01.009> of
