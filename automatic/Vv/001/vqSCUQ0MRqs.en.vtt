like that missed a guy who's in

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.420 
like that missed a guy who's in
point-blank<00:00:38.579> range<00:00:39.090> yeah<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.410> uh<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:41.250> this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
point-blank range yeah but uh for this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.190 
point-blank range yeah but uh for this
series<00:00:41.670> i<00:00:41.760> think<00:00:41.790> since<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> row<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
series i think since it is like a row to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.229 
series i think since it is like a row to
eclipse<00:00:43.680> Ariza<00:00:44.040> point<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:45.000> try<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
eclipse Ariza point is to like try to

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.080 
eclipse Ariza point is to like try to
hit<00:00:45.390> clips<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> stuff<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.289> probably<00:00:46.500> gonna
