00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.380
 mortals have their games 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.680
 the gods have ours but the 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.220
 game has rules 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.220
 or 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.030
 and everything has its rules in the games 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.470
 that the truth is who the kids 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.520
 Well now let's put a small 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.180
 video of what is the end of the game 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.939
 rice he said of rome because then good 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.829
 he had not finished it but 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.690
 I decided to finish it and upload it there 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.609
 also for this video is going to be for 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.829
 how can you say to help us 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.649
 because then you have to help people 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.510
 that helps you and I think this video is going to 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.809
 be more seen by people who are 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.519
 on the demos private server and that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.170
 Well, they've been seeing my 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.060
 videos not on what is the official page 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 this 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.650
 Well, as the principle says, not everything 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.720
 has all all the games have their 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.810
 rules and then this time we're going to do them 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.550
 a little game with a few rules 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.100
 so you can win something I think that 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.330
 in mozilla I had anticipated that 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.790
 they were going to give the 33 skins 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.000
 which will be the color the kick and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.250
 refrito as those they will win because 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.780
 Well, the only thing that will be very simple 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.800
 have to do is to put me in the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.130
 comment box 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.130
 your player haiti on the server 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.870
 music and a word to be able 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.920
 participate the word that I have to 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.920
 put is going to be mosquito musician that the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.330
 music mascot if you do not know what 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.230
 word is I'm going to leave you in the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.390
 screen 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.250
 I think that later I will put it on the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.440
 screen so you can look at it in the 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.210
 additional life and the only thing they have to 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.910
 to do is that is, they put their 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.670
 comment that is going to be a little boy leave me 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.040
 his player Haitian and that way they go 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.650
 to be participating to be able to win 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.380
 all they have to do is then 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.679
 tell them your friends you do not know who sees 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.690
 this to this video and my comment then 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.900
 let me like the comment you have 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.540
 more light is going to be the winner of the skin 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.310
 of color and comments that have 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.980
 the consequent comments that they have 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.900
 less like they are going to be the winners of what 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.210
 that is going to be the kick skin and the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.590
 clear reference the color is much more 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.970
 that's why a lot of people are going to 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.990
 want so that the comment that 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.870
 have more likes will be the winner s 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.960
 is going to do this in the description of 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.140
 video I'm going to leave the link of the 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.300
 mobile page where I'm going to leave you 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.230
 the link is going to be a comment and what 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.450
 only thing they have to do is 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.630

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.540

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.940
 exactly the same in the link that gives them 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.400
 I'm going to let you down go to the page 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.250
 masters and and there they are going to do exactly what 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.400
 it is done like this so that people 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.500

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.480
 who is going to be an audio is going to be 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.340
 randomly it was going to be by likes this the 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.590
 The person who wins is going to be contacted by 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.210
 facebook is not going to be contacted because 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.460
 youtube because if it's done on youtube 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.600
 would be 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.600
 would be suspicious 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.620
 your friends is not for you 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.570
 transparency and for people to look at 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.210
 that this is doing well so 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.310
 well I 'm not a player to give for me 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.040
 obvious I am a console player of 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.080
 360 I'm a music friend but I decided 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.490
 give him some support and this support 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.590
 is going to be in general not just anyone 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.260
 you can win it does not necessarily have 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.450
 to be friends with more like that but it's about 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.190
 to do with transparency so that 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.560
 you can doubt anything what is being 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.240
 doing so you already know in the box 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.500

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.830
 they will go directly to the demos page 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.700
 and where there is already a comment with a 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.260
