00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.009 
really don't know what order they're
paying<00:03:09.239> these<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.690> if<00:03:09.750> they're<00:03:09.930> just

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
paying these and if they're just

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.270 
paying these and if they're just
randomizing<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:11.480> but<00:03:12.480> when<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:13.250> play<00:03:14.250> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.780 
randomizing it but when you do play a
song<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:16.950> go<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.280> options<00:03:19.730> try<00:03:20.730> to

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
song you can go to options try to

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.400 
song you can go to options try to
remember<00:03:21.000> how<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.299> did<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:24.230> really<00:03:25.230> don't

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410

remember

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.509 

but<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.269> can<00:03:31.450> make<00:03:31.599> it<00:03:31.810> shuffle<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.769> repeat

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519
