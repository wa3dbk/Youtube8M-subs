that's on 64-bit or some computers are
windows<00:02:33.080> 32-bit<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:34.130> need<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.400> find<00:02:34.640> out<00:02:34.850> what

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
windows 32-bit you need to find out what

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.470 
windows 32-bit you need to find out what
your<00:02:35.270> computer<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.610> then<00:02:37.610> if<00:02:37.940> your

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
your computer is and then if your

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.350 
your computer is and then if your
windows<00:02:38.870> 32-bit<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.860> go<00:02:40.010> program<00:02:40.580> files<00:02:40.940> and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
windows 32-bit you go program files and

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.950 
windows 32-bit you go program files and
if<00:02:41.960> your<00:02:42.170> windows<00:02:42.560> 64-bit<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:44.060> go<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.360> program

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
if your windows 64-bit you go to program

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.280 
if your windows 64-bit you go to program
files<00:02:44.990> 86<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:47.150> once<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.450> go<00:02:47.630> into<00:02:47.810> Program

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
files 86 so once you go into Program

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.890

Files<00:02:48.560> our<00:02:48.890> program<00:02:49.310> files<00:02:49.610> 86<00:02:49.850> you<00:02:50.630> need<00:02:50.780> to

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
Files our program files 86 you need to

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.190 
Files our program files 86 you need to
scroll<00:02:51.230> down<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.710> where<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.400> says<00:02:52.460> Val<00:02:53.200> let's

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
scroll down to where it says Val let's

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.010 
scroll down to where it says Val let's
say<00:02:54.410> portal<00:02:54.770> to<00:02:54.920> go<00:02:55.040> say<00:02:55.250> Val<00:02:55.490> click<00:02:56.330> Val<00:02:56.600> and
