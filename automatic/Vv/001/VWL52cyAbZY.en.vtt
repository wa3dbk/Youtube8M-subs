00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.390 
this is the kind of thing that Delvin
Miller<00:04:54.930> was<00:04:55.140> thinking<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.680> below<00:04:55.920> those<00:04:56.160> many

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
Miller was thinking of below those many

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.980 
Miller was thinking of below those many
years<00:04:56.490> ago<00:04:56.760> when<00:04:57.510> he<00:04:57.600> built<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.900> original

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
years ago when he built the original

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.260 
years ago when he built the original
racetrack<00:04:58.800> on<00:04:59.040> this<00:04:59.280> property<00:04:59.700> but<00:04:59.910> I<00:04:59.940> think

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
racetrack on this property but I think

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.050 
racetrack on this property but I think
he<00:05:00.450> would<00:05:00.660> approve<00:05:01.350> you'll<00:05:02.160> prove<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.790> it<00:05:02.940> how

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
he would approve you'll prove to it how

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.420 
he would approve you'll prove to it how
they've<00:05:03.270> integrated<00:05:03.860> casino<00:05:04.860> gaming<00:05:05.100> and

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
they've integrated casino gaming and

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.330 
they've integrated casino gaming and
harness<00:05:06.180> racing<00:05:06.630> under<00:05:07.020> one<00:05:07.470> roof<00:05:07.740> right<00:05:08.280> here

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
harness racing under one roof right here

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.630 
harness racing under one roof right here
at<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.360> meadows
