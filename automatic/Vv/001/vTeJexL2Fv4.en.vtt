perfect<00:02:41.200> cup<00:02:41.440> figure<00:02:41.680> dis<00:02:41.830> or<00:02:42.610> what<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.420> ideal

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
perfect cup figure dis or what the ideal

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.330 
perfect cup figure dis or what the ideal
situation<00:02:43.840> would<00:02:44.170> be<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.530> would<00:02:44.770> run<00:02:45.070> shadow

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
situation would be I would run shadow

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.740 
situation would be I would run shadow
ball<00:02:45.460> over<00:02:45.700> hex<00:02:45.940> because<00:02:46.210> you<00:02:46.330> don't<00:02:46.480> want<00:02:46.540> to

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
ball over hex because you don't want to

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.720 
ball over hex because you don't want to
rely<00:02:46.990> on<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.350> fact<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.740> burning<00:02:48.640> your

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
rely on the fact of burning your

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.760 
rely on the fact of burning your
opponents<00:02:49.150> first<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.660> then<00:02:50.080> hoping<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.530> go

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
opponents first and then hoping to go

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.850 
opponents first and then hoping to go
for<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.160> hex<00:02:52.260> because<00:02:53.260> what<00:02:53.410> if<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.590> want<00:02:53.770> to

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
for a hex because what if you want to

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.020 
for a hex because what if you want to
just<00:02:53.980> what<00:02:54.160> if<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.430> want<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:54.910> go

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
just what if you want to just go

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.100 
just what if you want to just go
straight<00:02:55.240> away<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.570> shadow<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:55.930> what<00:02:56.020> if

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
straight away for a shadow but what if

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.840 
straight away for a shadow but what if
your<00:02:56.230> opponent<00:02:56.380> has<00:02:56.680> only<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.400> fire<00:02:57.610> pokemon

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
your opponent has only to fire pokemon

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.650 
your opponent has only to fire pokemon
left<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.270> know<00:02:58.330> what<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.450> mean<00:02:58.480> they're

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
left you know what I mean they're

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.790 
left you know what I mean they're
situations<00:02:59.140> where<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.380> know<00:02:59.530> they're<00:02:59.680> not

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
situations where you know they're not

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.160 
situations where you know they're not

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170

15<00:03:03.160> power<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.990> know<00:03:05.080> now<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.320> I'm<00:03:05.530> thinking

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
15 power you know now that I'm thinking

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.910 
15 power you know now that I'm thinking
about<00:03:06.010> it<00:03:06.490> because<00:03:07.210> hex<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.660> base<00:03:07.870> 65<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.800> it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
about it because hex is base 65 and it

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.340 
about it because hex is base 65 and it
doubles<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.700> doubles<00:03:10.660> when<00:03:10.810> your<00:03:10.930> opponent<00:03:11.290> is

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
doubles it doubles when your opponent is

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.710 
doubles it doubles when your opponent is
status<00:03:11.740> so<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:11.980> goes<00:03:12.100> from<00:03:12.220> 65<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.760> 130<00:03:13.420> and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
status so it goes from 65 to 130 and

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.690 
status so it goes from 65 to 130 and
then<00:03:14.350> it<00:03:14.470> gets<00:03:14.530> stabbed<00:03:14.830> so<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:15.280> goes<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.670> a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
then it gets stabbed so it goes to a

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.170 
then it gets stabbed so it goes to a
ridiculous<00:03:16.360> amount<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.720> goes<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.930> 195<00:03:17.470> arm

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
ridiculous amount it goes to 195 arm

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.500 
ridiculous amount it goes to 195 arm
whereas<00:03:19.180> Shadow<00:03:19.540> Ball<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.200> base<00:03:20.920> 80<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.670> it

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
whereas Shadow Ball is base 80 and it

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.390 
whereas Shadow Ball is base 80 and it
goes<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:23.489> 120<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:24.760> without<00:03:25.270> the<00:03:26.170> status<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.250> do

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
goes to 120 so without the status you do

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.800 
goes to 120 so without the status you do
lose<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.580> lot<00:03:27.850> of<00:03:27.880> pack<00:03:28.180> behind<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.630> if<00:03:28.720> you're

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
lose a lot of pack behind it if you're

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.690 
lose a lot of pack behind it if you're
running<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.140> hex<00:03:29.350> on<00:03:29.560> but<00:03:30.160> if<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.340> feel<00:03:30.670> like

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
running a hex on but if you feel like

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.210 
running a hex on but if you feel like
you<00:03:31.180> want<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.450> run<00:03:31.570> hex<00:03:31.810> instead<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:33.100> know

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
you want to run hex instead you know

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.010 
you want to run hex instead you know
what<00:03:33.400> go<00:03:33.640> for<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:34.030> i'm<00:03:34.150> actually<00:03:34.360> i<00:03:34.570> think<00:03:34.690> i

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
what go for it i'm actually i think i

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.570 
what go for it i'm actually i think i
might<00:03:35.170> have<00:03:35.320> just<00:03:35.410> convinced<00:03:35.620> myself<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:36.340> run

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
might have just convinced myself to run

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.810 
might have just convinced myself to run
hex<00:03:36.820> over<00:03:37.270> arm<00:03:37.890> Shadow<00:03:38.890> Ball<00:03:39.010> just<00:03:39.580> for<00:03:39.760> the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
hex over arm Shadow Ball just for the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.940 
hex over arm Shadow Ball just for the
simple<00:03:40.180> fact<00:03:40.209> that<00:03:40.750> that's<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.410> lot<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.650> power

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
simple fact that that's a lot of power

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.100 
simple fact that that's a lot of power
to<00:03:42.100> get<00:03:42.430> when<00:03:42.790> their<00:03:42.970> status<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.840> otherwise

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
to get when their status and otherwise

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.420 
to get when their status and otherwise
you<00:03:44.290> don't<00:03:44.410> use<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.830> just<00:03:44.950> don't<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.340> know

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
you don't use it you just don't you know

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.380 
you don't use it you just don't you know
you're<00:03:45.610> not<00:03:45.700> going<00:03:45.880> to<00:03:45.940> go<00:03:46.030> for<00:03:46.239> it<00:03:46.300> you're

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
you're not going to go for it you're

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.509 
you're not going to go for it you're

going to status them first if he has an
Arcanine<00:03:48.850> out<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.209> shouldn't<00:03:49.390> even<00:03:49.540> be<00:03:49.690> in

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
Arcanine out you shouldn't even be in

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.910 
Arcanine out you shouldn't even be in
there<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.080> going<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.320> knock<00:03:50.440> off<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:50.800> paint

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
my videos I've had infestation I don't

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.500 
my videos I've had infestation I don't
really<00:03:58.690> think<00:03:58.780> it's<00:03:59.019> been<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.530> um<00:04:00.510> hasn't

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
really think it's been that um hasn't

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.759 
really think it's been that um hasn't
had<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.660> payoff<00:04:01.959> really<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.620> I<00:04:02.650> would

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
had a payoff really so I would

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.199 
had a payoff really so I would
definitely<00:04:02.800> run<00:04:03.160> pain<00:04:03.400> slit<00:04:03.670> split<00:04:04.060> because

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
definitely run pain slit split because

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.390 
definitely run pain slit split because
um<00:04:04.709> configure<00:04:05.709> gates<00:04:05.860> doesn't<00:04:05.980> have<00:04:06.280> that

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
um configure gates doesn't have that

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.970 
um configure gates doesn't have that

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.990 
its base 58 like he doesn't have a lot
so<00:04:11.080> we'll<00:04:11.200> be<00:04:11.320> able<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.680> own<00:04:12.430> t<00:04:12.550> able<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.760> take

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
so we'll be able to own t able to take

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.820 
so we'll be able to own t able to take
as<00:04:13.150> much<00:04:13.420> as<00:04:13.480> he<00:04:13.690> could<00:04:14.019> that's<00:04:14.620> why<00:04:14.769> it

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
as much as he could that's why it

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.930 
as much as he could that's why it
doesn't<00:04:15.070> fully<00:04:15.220> take<00:04:15.400> advantage<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.760> pains

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
doesn't fully take advantage of pains

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.640 
doesn't fully take advantage of pains
but<00:04:16.060> like<00:04:16.209> other<00:04:16.330> ghosts<00:04:16.570> but<00:04:16.750> other<00:04:17.049> users<00:04:17.410> do

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
but like other ghosts but other users do

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.400 
but like other ghosts but other users do
but<00:04:18.370> um<00:04:18.630> it's<00:04:19.630> still<00:04:19.810> pretty<00:04:19.900> much<00:04:20.080> worth<00:04:20.260> it

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
but um it's still pretty much worth it

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.630 
but um it's still pretty much worth it
it's<00:04:20.500> another<00:04:20.650> form<00:04:20.890> of<00:04:20.950> recovery<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.460> you

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
it's another form of recovery and you

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.550 
it's another form of recovery and you
can<00:04:21.760> take<00:04:21.910> a<00:04:21.940> hit<00:04:22.150> really<00:04:22.300> well<00:04:22.419> so<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:23.410> can

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
can take a hit really well so you can

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.600 
can take a hit really well so you can
feel<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.770> out<00:04:24.010> that's<00:04:24.250> up<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.490> you

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
feel it out that's up to you

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.920

really<00:04:24.819> do<00:04:24.909> our<00:04:25.030> own<00:04:25.060> pain<00:04:25.330> split<00:04:25.569> I<00:04:25.689> probably

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
really do our own pain split I probably

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.719 
really do our own pain split I probably
would<00:04:26.319> it<00:04:26.439> better<00:04:26.620> than<00:04:26.770> infestation<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.490> think

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
would it better than infestation I think

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.700 
would it better than infestation I think
or<00:04:28.090> what<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.139> can<00:04:29.289> do<00:04:29.409> is<00:04:29.500> if<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.680> don't

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
or what you can do is if you don't

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.020 
or what you can do is if you don't
remember<00:04:29.949> in<00:04:30.099> pain<00:04:30.280> split<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.669> can<00:04:30.819> throw<00:04:31.000> a

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
remember in pain split you can throw a

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.429 
remember in pain split you can throw a
shadow<00:04:31.240> ball<00:04:31.539> right<00:04:31.750> here<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.050> can<00:04:32.199> pack
