of<00:01:27.390> recent<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:28.560> sure<00:01:28.680> what<00:01:28.799> Harvey<00:01:29.159> LaRussa

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
of recent not sure what Harvey LaRussa

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.679 
of recent not sure what Harvey LaRussa
is<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.880> whatever<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> case<00:01:30.240> here's<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
is but whatever the case here's the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.380 
is but whatever the case here's the
equation<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.170> basically<00:01:31.460> 1200<00:01:32.460> +<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
equation it's basically 1200 + the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
equation it's basically 1200 + the
equation<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.409> evo<00:01:34.680> minus<00:01:35.130> twelve

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
equation of your evo minus twelve

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.410 
equation of your evo minus twelve
hundred<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> divide<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.180> by<00:01:36.360> two

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
hundred and then you divide that by two

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120 
hundred and then you divide that by two
so<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.500> didn't<00:01:37.710> understand<00:01:38.040> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
so if you didn't understand that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.469 
so if you didn't understand that
nevermind<00:01:38.490> they've<00:01:38.759> got<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> few<00:01:39.090> examples

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
nevermind they've got a few examples

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.380 
nevermind they've got a few examples
here<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.070> but<00:01:41.070> y<00:01:41.100> end<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.909> that's<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
here and but y end so that's that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.090 
here and but y end so that's that
basically<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.500> an<00:01:43.619> equation<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
basically just an equation for you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.109 
basically just an equation for you
either<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.470> finally<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.619> third<00:01:46.770> article<00:01:47.130> is

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
either and finally the third article is

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.719 
either and finally the third article is

jungle for season 3 acid it for season
two<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:55.470> going<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> lot<00:01:55.920> more

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
two and and it's going to be a lot more

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.590 
two and and it's going to be a lot more
similar<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> season<00:01:56.790> one<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.119> any<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> were

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
similar to season one if any of you were

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
similar to season one if any of you were
playing<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> lower<00:01:58.680> em<00:01:58.950> season<00:01:59.399> one<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.759> I

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
playing it lower em season one I know I

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.719 
playing it lower em season one I know I
was<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:02.070> know<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.250> prefer<00:02:02.520> I

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
was and I don't know if I prefer I

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.940 
was and I don't know if I prefer I
definitely<00:02:03.420> was<00:02:03.780> him<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.229> didn't<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.770> going

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
definitely was him I didn't like going

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.260 
definitely was him I didn't like going
in<00:02:05.159> season<00:02:05.460> two<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.670> i<00:02:05.700> prefer<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> old

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
in season two you i prefer the old

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.819 
in season two you i prefer the old
jungle<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.659> almost<00:02:07.229> thought<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.619> was<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> bit

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
jungle I almost thought it was a bit

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.040 
jungle I almost thought it was a bit
more<00:02:07.979> skillful<00:02:08.429> real<00:02:08.550> jungle<00:02:08.789> but<00:02:09.420> maybe<00:02:09.929> it

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
more skillful real jungle but maybe it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.690 
more skillful real jungle but maybe it
wasn't<00:02:10.229> either<00:02:10.440> way<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:11.009> gonna<00:02:11.099> be<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
wasn't either way it's gonna be the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.430 
wasn't either way it's gonna be the
camps<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.300> only<00:02:12.420> facing<00:02:12.810> arts

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
camps that you only facing arts

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.530 
camps that you only facing arts
gonna<00:02:13.710> be<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.800> lot<00:02:13.890> harder<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:15.030> also<00:02:15.360> am

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
gonna be a lot harder and if also am

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.940 
gonna be a lot harder and if also am
specified<00:02:16.110> there<00:02:16.320> it's<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.770> be<00:02:16.830> better

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
specified there it's going to be better

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.270 
specified there it's going to be better
for<00:02:17.130> single<00:02:17.670> target<00:02:17.940> junglers<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:19.100> I've<00:02:20.100> also

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
for single target junglers and I've also

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.350 
for single target junglers and I've also
had<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.490> mouth<00:02:20.670> guys<00:02:20.850> can<00:02:20.970> be<00:02:21.060> quite<00:02:21.180> good

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
had that mouth guys can be quite good

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.430 
had that mouth guys can be quite good
for<00:02:21.540> whatever<00:02:21.720> reason<00:02:22.050> even<00:02:22.200> though<00:02:22.290> he's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
for whatever reason even though he's

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.230 
for whatever reason even though he's
more<00:02:22.650> than<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.830> wee<00:02:23.040> bit<00:02:23.100> either<00:02:23.850> way<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.150> give

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
more than a wee bit either way it's give

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.990 
more than a wee bit either way it's give
me<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.330> lot<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.570> season<00:02:24.870> one<00:02:24.900> jungle<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:26.000> so

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
me a lot like season one jungle and so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.340 
me a lot like season one jungle and so
we'll<00:02:27.360> see<00:02:27.510> how<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.600> occurs<00:02:28.020> but<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.260> going

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
we'll see how that occurs but it's going

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.040 
we'll see how that occurs but it's going
to<00:02:28.410> be<00:02:28.500> more<00:02:28.770> difficult<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.280> more<00:02:30.050> favorable

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
to be more difficult and more favorable

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.780 
to be more difficult and more favorable
it's<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.560> single<00:02:31.830> target<00:02:31.950> junglist<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.580> suppose

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
it's a single target junglist I suppose

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.900 
it's a single target junglist I suppose
but<00:02:33.540> um<00:02:33.720> yeah<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.290> those<00:02:34.740> are<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:34.980> three<00:02:35.340> or

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
but um yeah so those are the three or

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.340 
but um yeah so those are the three or
some<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> changes<00:02:36.690> are<00:02:36.990> going<00:02:37.110> be<00:02:37.170> going

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
some of the changes are going be going

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.620 
some of the changes are going be going
into<00:02:37.530> season<00:02:37.710> three<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.330> like<00:02:39.330> i<00:02:39.360> said<00:02:39.480> i'm

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
into season three and like i said i'm

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.690 
into season three and like i said i'm
going<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.780> leave<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.020> articles<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.700> lift

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
going to leave the articles to lift

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.250 
going to leave the articles to lift
here's<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.910> more<00:02:42.270> in<00:02:42.390> detailed<00:02:42.750> season<00:02:43.140> through
