bottom of my left foot I thought it was

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.150 
bottom of my left foot I thought it was
a<00:03:49.180> scab<00:03:49.690> but<00:03:50.050> then<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.260> look<00:03:50.440> closer<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.950> it's

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
a scab but then I look closer and it's

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:59.880 
a scab but then I look closer and it's
actually<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.610> mole<00:03:52.680> yep<00:03:54.060> um<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:58.480> think<00:03:59.470> the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
actually a mole yep um I think the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.050 
actually a mole yep um I think the
sexiest<00:04:00.490> part<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.480> person's<00:04:02.230> foot<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.220> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
sexiest part of a person's foot is the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.380 
sexiest part of a person's foot is the
arch<00:04:04.330> right<00:04:04.810> here<00:04:06.030> because<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.150> know<00:04:07.270> how

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
arch right here because you know how

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.390 
arch right here because you know how
wanted<00:04:07.690> girls<00:04:07.960> walking<00:04:08.350> down<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.740> street<00:04:09.100> and

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
wanted girls walking down the street and

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.470 
wanted girls walking down the street and
she<00:04:10.030> has<00:04:10.209> like<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.570> high-heeled<00:04:11.050> shoe<00:04:11.380> on<00:04:11.590> and

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
she has like a high-heeled shoe on and

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.120 
she has like a high-heeled shoe on and
then<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.600> can<00:04:13.780> see<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.110> arch<00:04:14.350> in<00:04:14.620> her<00:04:14.709> foot<00:04:14.980> I

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
then you can see the arch in her foot I

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.610 
then you can see the arch in her foot I
think<00:04:15.400> that's<00:04:15.580> really<00:04:15.880> hot<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:18.930> my<00:04:19.930> ankles

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
think that's really hot and my ankles

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.050 
think that's really hot and my ankles
are<00:04:21.010> pretty<00:04:21.459> flexible<00:04:23.040> because<00:04:24.040> I<00:04:24.520> used<00:04:24.730> to<00:04:24.910> be

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
are pretty flexible because I used to be

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.690 
are pretty flexible because I used to be
in<00:04:25.090> ballet<00:04:25.540> and<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.560> used<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.800> do<00:04:26.920> tap<00:04:27.160> dancing

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
in ballet and I used to do tap dancing

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.910 
in ballet and I used to do tap dancing
so<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:27.970> can<00:04:28.270> go<00:04:28.390> like<00:04:28.540> that<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.200> like<00:04:29.380> point

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
so I can go like that and like point

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.500 
so I can go like that and like point
with<00:04:30.070> my<00:04:30.190> feet<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.550> sometimes<00:04:30.970> I<00:04:31.120> can<00:04:31.300> grab

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
with my feet and sometimes I can grab

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.920 
with my feet and sometimes I can grab
stuff<00:04:31.810> with<00:04:32.050> my<00:04:32.230> feet<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:33.060> really<00:04:34.060> long<00:04:34.300> toes<00:04:34.630> I

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
stuff with my feet I really long toes I

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:44.730 
stuff with my feet I really long toes I
think<00:04:35.790> um<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:42.990> haven't<00:04:43.990> broken<00:04:44.230> any<00:04:44.530> bones

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
think um and I haven't broken any bones

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.670 
think um and I haven't broken any bones
