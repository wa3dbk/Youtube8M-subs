had during the time I've been watching
as<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.590> said<00:00:55.739> I've<00:00:55.860> gone<00:00:55.980> back<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> past<00:00:56.640> but

as I said I've gone back in the past but
isn't<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.360> anything<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:57.930> you're<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
isn't it like anything when you're a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.760 
isn't it like anything when you're a
little<00:00:58.890> bit<00:00:59.010> younger<00:01:00.050> then<00:01:01.050> perhaps<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
little bit younger then perhaps the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.410 
little bit younger then perhaps the
people<00:01:01.980> who<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.160> watching<00:01:02.250> at<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.579> time<00:01:02.910> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
people who are watching at the time you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.729 
people who are watching at the time you
can<00:01:03.570> go<00:01:03.660> back<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.899> listen<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.409> old<00:01:04.559> records

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
can go back and listen to old records

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.980

and watch old movies and stuff but they

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.359 
and watch old movies and stuff but they
never<00:01:07.140> end<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.619> being<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:07.950> good<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> movies

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
never end up being as good as the movies

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.730 
never end up being as good as the movies
of<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.909> childhood<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.930> cuz<00:01:10.530> things

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
of your childhood because the cuz things

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.109 
of your childhood because the cuz things
have<00:01:10.860> moved<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.490> because<00:01:11.760> they've<00:01:11.909> much

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
have moved on and because they've much

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.899 
have moved on and because they've much
difficult<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.430> value<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.670> their

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
difficult to see the value of their

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.480 
difficult to see the value of their
performances<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> past<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:17.460> all

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
performances in the past so really all

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370 
performances in the past so really all
you've<00:01:17.700> got<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.180> kind<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.509> older

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
you've got is these kind of older

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.359 
you've got is these kind of older
matches<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.460> maybe<00:01:20.909> potentially

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
matches that you can maybe potentially

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.850 
matches that you can maybe potentially
acknowledged<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.610> their<00:01:23.640> quality<00:01:24.600> back<00:01:25.500> then

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
acknowledged for their quality back then

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.370 
acknowledged for their quality back then
but<00:01:26.490> they're<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:26.790> perhaps<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.540> impressive<00:01:28.290> as

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
but they're not perhaps as impressive as

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
but they're not perhaps as impressive as
they<00:01:28.530> would<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.340> took<00:01:29.850> to

they were younger and I like one of us
alright<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.890> suppose<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.700> know<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.060> an

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
alright I suppose you know and it's an

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.700 
alright I suppose you know and it's an
hour<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.229> perhaps<00:01:52.409> almost

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
hour I know that perhaps almost

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350 
hour I know that perhaps almost
sacrilege<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.399> say<00:01:53.579> about<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.790> Ric<00:01:53.970> Flair<00:01:54.180> match

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
sacrilege to say about a Ric Flair match

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.940 
sacrilege to say about a Ric Flair match
because<00:01:54.540> they're<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.020> there<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.500> quality

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
because they're just there the quality

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.469 
because they're just there the quality
of<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.460> high<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.360> like

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
of them is so high but it's like

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.940 
of them is so high but it's like
anything<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.020> watch<00:01:58.229> something<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.710> was<00:01:58.860> in

anything you watch something that was in

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
what else and they're just perhaps not

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.540 
what else and they're just perhaps not
as<00:02:07.110> impressive<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:08.099> those<00:02:08.220> people<00:02:08.399> who

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
as impressive for those people who

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.100 
as impressive for those people who
hadn't<00:02:08.849> seen<00:02:09.030> them<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.629> were<00:02:09.690> before<00:02:09.899> as

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
hadn't seen them as they were before as

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.780 
hadn't seen them as they were before as
you<00:02:10.229> did<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.950> all<00:02:11.099> you're<00:02:11.220> left<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.580> this

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
you did so all you're left with is this

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.890 
you did so all you're left with is this
old<00:02:11.849> guy<00:02:12.390> who<00:02:12.870> goes<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.440> tell<00:02:13.560> her

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
old guy who goes on to tell her

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.539 
old guy who goes on to tell her
shouts<00:02:14.349> wet<00:02:14.799> and<00:02:15.189> bleeds<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.189> that

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
shouts wet and bleeds and and so in that

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.250 
shouts wet and bleeds and and so in that
respect<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:19.060> think<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.480> definitely<00:02:19.659> to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
respect I think that you definitely to

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.229 
respect I think that you definitely to
an<00:02:20.349> extent<00:02:20.650> has<00:02:20.860> if<00:02:21.340> not<00:02:21.610> with<00:02:21.790> those<00:02:21.879> people

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
an extent has if not with those people

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.399 
an extent has if not with those people
that<00:02:22.269> loved<00:02:22.540> him<00:02:22.689> when<00:02:22.780> he<00:02:22.900> was<00:02:22.989> around<00:02:23.230> at<00:02:23.379> the

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
that loved him when he was around at the

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.259 
that loved him when he was around at the
time<00:02:23.500> with<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.280> generation<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:24.879> people<00:02:25.000> that

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
time with the generation of people that

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.309 
time with the generation of people that
didn't<00:02:25.480> know<00:02:25.569> what<00:02:25.750> he<00:02:25.810> was<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.049> in<00:02:26.110> his

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
didn't know what he was like in his

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.250 
didn't know what he was like in his
prime<00:02:26.760> well<00:02:27.760> considering<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.599> Ric<00:02:28.900> Flair's<00:02:29.140> a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
prime well considering it Ric Flair's a

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.990 
prime well considering it Ric Flair's a
legend<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.890> so<00:02:30.250> we've<00:02:30.459> had<00:02:30.609> a<00:02:30.640> Goonies

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
legend and so we've had a Goonies

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.280 
legend and so we've had a Goonies
reference<00:02:31.359> I<00:02:31.480> think<00:02:31.659> I'm<00:02:31.780> gonna<00:02:31.900> have<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.140> say

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
reference I think I'm gonna have to say

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.069 
reference I think I'm gonna have to say
Ben<00:02:32.530> spingler<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.310> burn<00:02:33.670> burn<00:02:34.079> because

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
Ben spingler you burn burn because

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.770 
Ben spingler you burn burn because
because<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.760> have<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.239> slightly<00:02:37.510> different

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
because I I have a slightly different

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.470 
because I I have a slightly different
view<00:02:38.140> on<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.680> situation<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.849> I<00:02:40.060> think<00:02:40.359> that

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
view on the situation and I think that

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.630 
view on the situation and I think that
sometimes<00:02:40.629> people<00:02:41.290> confuse<00:02:41.500> legacy<00:02:42.340> with

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
sometimes people confuse legacy with

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.610 
sometimes people confuse legacy with
current<00:02:43.030> reputation<00:02:43.329> I<00:02:43.959> think<00:02:44.409> it's<00:02:44.560> very

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
current reputation I think it's very

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.589 
current reputation I think it's very
difficult<00:02:45.099> for<00:02:45.519> anybody<00:02:45.879> to<00:02:46.120> assess<00:02:46.569> a

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
difficult for anybody to assess a

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.449 
difficult for anybody to assess a
person's<00:02:46.870> legacy<00:02:47.590> while<00:02:47.980> they're<00:02:48.250> still

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
person's legacy while they're still

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.330 
person's legacy while they're still
alive<00:02:48.629> because<00:02:49.739> really<00:02:50.739> we're<00:02:50.920> talking<00:02:51.250> about

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
alive because really we're talking about

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.670 
alive because really we're talking about
legacy<00:02:52.120> from<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:52.659> current<00:02:52.959> perspective<00:02:53.500> of

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
legacy from the current perspective of

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.289 
legacy from the current perspective of
we<00:02:53.859> look<00:02:53.980> at<00:02:54.129> Ric<00:02:54.250> Flair<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.670> we<00:02:54.730> say<00:02:54.879> damage

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
we look at Ric Flair and we say damage

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.539 
we look at Ric Flair and we say damage
these<00:02:55.450> legacy<00:02:55.930> but<00:02:56.049> actually<00:02:56.500> i<00:02:56.680> think<00:02:57.010> what

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
these legacy but actually i think what

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.509 
these legacy but actually i think what
what<00:02:57.879> Flair's<00:02:58.540> might<00:02:59.319> be<00:02:59.680> not<00:02:59.889> a<00:02:59.920> managed<00:03:00.310> to

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
what Flair's might be not a managed to

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.250 
what Flair's might be not a managed to
do<00:03:00.670> it's<00:03:00.879> happened<00:03:01.180> by<00:03:01.269> accident<00:03:01.299> but<00:03:01.959> in<00:03:02.079> some

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
do it's happened by accident but in some

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.449 
do it's happened by accident but in some
ways<00:03:02.409> it<00:03:02.590> might<00:03:02.739> leave<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:02.980> much<00:03:03.220> greater

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
ways it might leave a much greater

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.300 
ways it might leave a much greater
legacy<00:03:03.819> is<00:03:04.269> Flair<00:03:05.139> really<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.799> going<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.159> go

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
legacy is Flair really is going to go

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.729 
legacy is Flair really is going to go
until<00:03:06.790> he<00:03:06.849> drops<00:03:07.120> whether<00:03:08.019> it's<00:03:08.230> def<00:03:08.470> or

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
until he drops whether it's def or
