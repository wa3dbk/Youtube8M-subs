00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
 so now we are standing in front of the wg front door 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.110
 Let's see who receives us here 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.660
 Let's wait 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:25.490
 hello channel 21 team yes we send 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:28.000
 now your ways i feel now 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.710
 first a part in our region around 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.890
 here in front of this corner is a 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.649
 luxury room lives here she has one 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.200
 beautiful high quality built 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:43.399
 also one of our larger rooms a 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.410
 get more beautiful 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:50.350
 the director of the track is set 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.000
 Personally liked very much 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:58.090
 that's part number one say 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.880
 so to speak, also come in here 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.260
 that is with a bathtub 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.509
 that's great to give even a toilet 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.890
 in the bathroom that is spectacular 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.810
 a shower that is not right 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.390
 works because the woman was missing 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.180
 but as number one mean to bad 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.829
 number two is wait two times 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.840
 right in the back there is also 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.560
 our washing machine also a loo again 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.520
 a working shower this time the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.890
 is a miracle 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.450
 and here is no bath in it 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.220
 but otherwise everything you need 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.680
 a bathroom that here is alex 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.070
 always that is very big and very 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.640
 spacious you can move freely here 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.229
 as you want 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.170
 he also has a great 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.689
 outlook on cinemaxx and co on the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.299
 Bielefeld we come to the kitchen 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:49.369
 this is our only one or the one 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.780
 lounge for all the glorious ones 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.060
 I would say to the portrait 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.310
 our unique cleaning plan how to 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.869
 sees he is changed several times 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.880
 I think that is just in the 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.520
 nature 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.869
 Men wg I would rather have three 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.770
 this will definitely be the wish of women 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.649
 but it runs more consistently 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.269
 difficult this is the tower room one 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.200
 He looks at the unique pieces 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.410
 rider so that alone here 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.550
 the round that this format had the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.430
 is 1a contests always stop here 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.019
 social games are played here 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.360
 so I am now sitting with the boys in the 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.450
 wg provides you times shortly before who you are 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.019
 yes i am can i am mom and i 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.410
 Something is for your wg to 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.790
 Trademark typical cliche in the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.799
 wg is that we cleaned up the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.330
 children to other wgs the conclusion 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.769
 have lifted even a putz plan to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.150
 We also try to follow it and stuff 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.079
 you have to pay two euros penalty 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.489
 there are no young ones 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.970
 Say no hard sleep protection 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.260
 here you still have loud music at 23 o'clock 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.650
 a clichÃ© that we also have one 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.030
 typical guys wg are because of that too 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.980
 media play it's just too 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.910
 accordingly little decorations in 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.910
 to the general premises 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.440
 Einstellungsstests certain so that for 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.480
 critics praised these wg 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.840
 coming in okay you have to Male 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.489
 his 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.190
 point number one no, why much like 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.510
 his men wg and the problem is when 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.130
 nationwide person there is then must 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.359
 maybe you can clean that up , too 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.889
 be good but that might be too 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:32.200
 not bad you thought you were from 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:33.069
 ground up properly, we are also on 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.260
 every case of ease 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.209
 you have to see that he is a bit 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.940
 Self-reliant self-esteem has 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.010
 and easy in the wg comes and family 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.049
 is that he himself also a family 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.359
 wg wg we have no purpose that we 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.530
 It is only possible for companies to do this 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.030
 advantage for example that you have many 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.859
 Things have that means you also have many 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.480
 a possibility in the kitchen to do something 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.430
 if against the cause of others are there 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.660
 because if you could live alone 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.940
 you might not be in sandwich 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.489
 maker or something like that 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.739
 course in a wg predestined 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.940
 you want to do something and you can do it 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.440
 quickly take things from others though 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.699
 you can shop there while 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.540
 things I had then you take something from 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.819
 I'll tell others shortly tomorrow 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.230
 and because it's not there again but you 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.069
 says that at least you have yes 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.409
 somehow an interpersonal 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.389
 relationship someday you clearly go that 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.030
 another or the other one goes up 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.360
 the sack and he's just so times 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.389
 Honestly, then it will stop sometimes 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.070
 loud sometimes easy in dialogue 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.600
 clarified and good it is yes I would say 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.400
 that's it then this place 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.840
 then we want to see you soon 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.030
 to look at a single apartment 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.289
 yes so now we are facing a single 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:46.120
 flat and look because he's here for us 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:46.120
 We open the door and wait 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.990
 hello we want it now yours 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.810
 Apartment you look at us 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:00.160
 really good then we'll have a look 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.880
 unfortunately also very small I mean big 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.310
 kitchen knives learned head lately 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.600
 the pretty but enough to cook 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.960
 still human coming home quickly 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.420
 you almost always correct then 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.920
 Here we have my living room here 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.530
 I spend most of the time actually 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.030
 come home just once briefly 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.070
 sit down do nothing and then sleep 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.270
 comes to my favorite topic 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.250
 highlighter apartment I find now 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.740
 every case here is spent on 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.980
 dearest time knows Libyan 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.770
 unfortunately only too little my own 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.390
 roommates always faithful so it is 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.900
 now on the sofa of the single 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.130
 flat 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.120
 we wanted you alone I can find it 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.710
 just better or better 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.780
 so if I always had someone now 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.340
 I do not care about me so I need it 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.370
 a bit where for me are what 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.630
 I can live the advantages alone 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.940
 make my flat as I do 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.770
 I would like to have no rules on it 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.540
 I have to pay much more time for it 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.580
 I'm allowed naked by the apartment 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.300
 someone is running with me 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.760
 tackle 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.110
 I've talked about my own principles 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.060
 nobody will between what I do and 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.960
 can let that has disadvantages that 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.970
 you live alone so I will 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.950
 I never cooked alone 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.990
 I always have to clean up by myself 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.570
 you have to pay everything by yourself 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.470
 in the wg it is yes you share it 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:25.060
 what you get, for example, electricity rent 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.950
 everything remains hanging one on yourself 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.320
 I miss the biggest disadvantage too 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.970
 very much that my mother made my bread 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.500
 smears with it next to today needs 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.050
 do it all himself always we come 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.669
 To sum up the whole one wg very much 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.280
 Recommended for people who like 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.800
 other people around 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.970
 do not want to be alone and on the 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.230
 the hustle and bustle of a wg is a single 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.450
 Apartment is highly recommended for 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.450
 people who want to develop freely
