00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.560
 hello then me it's gold or pseudo 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.490
 six students and I play counter strike 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.680
 global offensive 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.450
 so me it's nazim ingenious 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.989
 players in the katrina team on 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:36.830
 facebook so kÃ©vin that this dragon's 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.670
 hunt it's funny voices that's it 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:47.090
 play football between friends council 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:51.560
 anthony pseudo like this goes month and a half a 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:58.310
 very pure players player 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:01:03.710
 counter-strike of the timone for the 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:06.309
 war the book and shox book of 16 goals 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.309
 of the team does not drop 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.080
 so grabbing two parts that's true 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.330
 that lan on paris is not much 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.180
 and it was one of the most 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.860
 close to home so direct it 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.049
 got known pretty quickly by friends 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.380
 we said go we'll do the voice 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.619
 loiter we wait for earth and it's like that 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.940
 we are here 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.040
 so I'm going to spend my fear is 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.290
 that he is known against yes yes actually 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.479
 there is a valve on paris and I know 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.990
 we talked on facebook and that's 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.210
 like that he is known to me I have them 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.399
 known over a year thanks to the map the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.190
 Above I spoke with the other one 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.490
 was all these crafts for the dance 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.490
 with a 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.520
 so our impressions already is reindeer 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.100
 located in paris 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.729
 so it's for us capital to 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.540
 proximity is pretty easy access 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.580
 then good it's a little lan so 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.610
 compared to rooms even though one is 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.540
 rather 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.010
 well installed her heroes heat that does not 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.090
 could be nothing but we know enough 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.950
 difficult and then otherwise not good 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.100
 atmosphere and some not delay 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.350
 to go like that that too is not it 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.450
 if it's your fault may option more of 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.680
 people who have withdrawn but if we have 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:42.959
 sells of course it is very well 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.760
 years love it so we have already done 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.500
 our first match was pretty good 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.480
 past we had some minor problems 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.950
 servers but what comes here is that 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.760
 the amines is quite reactive 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.540
 so here the tournament will resume here that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.100
 I knew otherwise overall 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.540
 lack infinitely air conditioners ski yes 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.600
 it was very hot 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.060
 it's true in everything and is not good 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.220
 so impression is a little bit of 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.950
 delay due to a server problem on 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.950
 the game but that's enough 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.600
 it's settled quickly even in Iran 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.269
 one hour we started the matches and 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.519
 it's all funny it's the place 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:28.380
 himself even if it's hot beautiful we have 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.780
 also inserted so that's okay there's 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.160
 the space to play I find everything is 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.030
 nickel 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:40.790
 the admins are there are present it's 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.790
 there are coverages everything is fine 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.660
 if these very large computer trunks 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.180
 it really inspires me something 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.160
 solid 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.770
 I have the chance to participate in China 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.270
 that with the team verygames and at least 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.870
 of last November if I say no 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.430
 nonsense at a Beijing and I was lucky 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.560
 to finish first to win 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:14.470
 especially to their laptop does not me 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:16.690
 more accurately reminds of the brand 's 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.430
 product of dance and frankly that's 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.380
 end is an excellent quality after 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.120
 that's what's a shame is that 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.480
 either they will give everything in his neck to 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.500
 a big competition and suddenly he goes 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.970
 during big jackpots just like 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.580
 pc all in one for each person 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.940
 be low and small lots that goes the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.140
 ps 20 30 euros and it's his own thing 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.760
 that I could their own rock because 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.600
 that it is marc really given two 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.940
 references in the middle of 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.380
 IT at in any case 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.630
 rings paul chodas maybe it 's 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.550
 to mix a little the thing in this direction 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:51.340
 to find a middle between middle right 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.300
 to satisfy everyone then it inspires me 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.340
 is already going and is making components 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.530
 for children what is beneficial and 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.490
 electronic components so I believe 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.050
 that it's a good thing because I 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.919
 know that they will be present which they 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.910
 have already been present and they are 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.510
 still present on several events 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.560
 especially the lan party launched 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.690
 a good thing for knowing players 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.280
 that they make devices liked 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.479
 value ie the keyboards of 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.800
 aprons of mice in this good 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.710
 thing to see them soon in 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.230
 several events in France 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.580
 messi 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.010
 it's the skill in the big 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.790
 events thanks to his big ones like that 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:30.140
 therefore see james full as it is 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:33.100
 his estate 30 but also to access 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.100
 develops everywhere 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.740
 it's true that it's a lot of talk 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.900
 we can go product overview 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.530
 it's great to have sponsors who 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.530
 get involved like that 

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:54.399
 so I knew about 

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:56.199
 my research studies since I was 

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:57.099
 oriented information systems of 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.659
 computing 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:02.729
 so that's how I knew 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:07.209
 school when he was still in paris 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:09.669
 ok and I knew the same gie as 

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:11.049
 she but more precisely as a 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.239
 event organizers including 

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:14.709
 during the gods I made the first 

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:17.739
 edition that went very well 

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:20.319
 by the way we won in mix with 

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:22.360
 that's where we are, we're beyond 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.019
 went back to do this time of 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.449
 the year currently 

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:32.709
 thank you very much thank you to you then me 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:38.379
 not at all ok thanks but now we 

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:42.279
 know thanks to you and I'm not 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:44.769
 also that normally it's me I 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:47.200
 did not know what from my 

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:51.700
 studies I do not care that tests here 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:55.230
