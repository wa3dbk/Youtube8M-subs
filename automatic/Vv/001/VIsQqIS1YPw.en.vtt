00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
hit my window and actually scratched my

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.400 
hit my window and actually scratched my
tint<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.149> took<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> chunk<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.750> chunk<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.320> my

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
tint and took a chunk on chunk out of my

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.970 
tint and took a chunk on chunk out of my
tin<00:00:47.960> which<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.170> fine<00:00:49.410> because<00:00:49.559> I'm<00:00:49.829> gonna

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
tin which is fine because I'm gonna

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.500 
tin which is fine because I'm gonna
reach<00:00:50.219> int<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> window<00:00:50.760> anyway<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.149> I'm<00:00:51.420> gonna

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
reach int the window anyway so I'm gonna

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.590 
reach int the window anyway so I'm gonna
put<00:00:51.750> probably<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> 5%<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:53.670> darker<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> rear

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
put probably a 5% or darker on the rear

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.130 
put probably a 5% or darker on the rear
window<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.600> gives<00:00:57.809> me<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.960> little

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
window so that kind of gives me a little

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920 
window so that kind of gives me a little
incentive<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.010> anyways<00:00:59.719> shave<00:01:00.719> down

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
incentive to do that anyways shave down
