00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to everyone this new video for the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.600
 pen the academy in this video first 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.490
 of all I will show you the new colors 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.250
 from the verbeke mafia collection that is not 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.990
 other than a collection of opaques 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.549
 components from nine colors and how you are 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.550
 seeing in this wheel these are 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.850
 all the colors vary a lot because there 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.000
 black is gray and blue is cream 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 in red then to a very collection 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 low this is the interpretation of 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.780
 mine and in the arc therefore a matte effect e 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.059
 with a contrast of shiny effect and is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.810
 beautiful to do precisely this contrast 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.480
 with the mate 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.610
 and in detail I made polka dots where 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.340
 on the ring finger on the index I am on all 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.940
 the nail instead on the little finger and the middle finger 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.720
 let's say a contrasting lunette 1 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.760
 with the other one, follow the tutorial if you like 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.160
 as a used material taken a base 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.880
 ultra reinforcing then I chose this 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.630
 dark gray they have 007 that is 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.320
 exactly that a fixer for 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.920
 fix all the drops that help 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.640
 drying the glaze a spot e 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.640
 of aluminum foil 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.150
 first we put the high base 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.979
 reinforcer on all nails 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.390
 I had already applied it on the other vi 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.250
 I show how it comes anyway 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.470
 once the base has been applied, it must always be placed at 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.750
 nail protection to last longer 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.640
 polish and dry very quickly 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.940
 every base to its function this the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.320
 function to reinforce the nails 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.300
 Now let's take our color 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.250
 I want to help slightly 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.440
 see that it has a wide brush then 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.240
 still facilitates the application and the it 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.700
 we spread monocolor on all nails 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.039
 a single color means to spread one 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.289
 been very very thin wait for that 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.789
 dry and give the second pass la 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.899
 second pass always serves for 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.069
 outline defining the best the whole 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.500
 you simply have to wait for that 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.840
 dry to speed up the time 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.270
 we use the drops that help 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.520
 speed up the drying of the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.710
 nail polish are drops that don't 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.230
 compromise the earhart even 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.750
 durability of the enamel and also have inside 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.710
 of the oils that still hydrate the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.060
 I read skin and the area with cuticles 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.709
 as you see I show you that one 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.319
 once I'm dry, I still do the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.530
 second pass and as you can see is a 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.810
 much fuller and very full-bodied color 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.880
 however, respect to before then for 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.140
 what I always recommend layers 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.450
 thin but to make two 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.400
 if we make mistakes 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.050
 just take the pen correct polish 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.319
 to correct these errors precisely 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.319
 we have done 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.710
 also in this case 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.560
 let's help with the drops to speed up 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.910
 drying now we take ours 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.890
 we fix it a little on the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.630
 foil positioned little because 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.330
 in any case being dry enamels 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.140
 quickly you have to put several of them 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
 drops 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.730
 let's start with the stop with the pro tip a 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.950
 these are just a bit bigger deal 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.750
 in vertical where a row a row e 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.560
 higher than the other, that is, we put them 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.090
 at chess and we make four rows 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.770
 obviously it depends a bit on the length 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.990
 of your bunga and size 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.240
 understand if you make two three four rows 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.770
 second note of your nail dates 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.910
 that should stand out a lot when you do 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.190
 these can 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.740
 take a lot of fixer ie 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.080
 leave a drop on the nail 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.670
 because at least they will stand out very much 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.750
 more 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.690
 let's make this decoration 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.780
 on the ring finger and then on the ring 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.720
 medium we make a kind of arc 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.970
 on one side with more dots 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.620
 large and sideways on one side and 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.600
 on the other hand we do them a little more 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.430
 little ones anyway in the video 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.040
 you are seeing what i am anyway 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.960
 explaining how I told you by taking more 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.030
 product you will have to wait much longer 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.220
 that your your nail art 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.350
 however dry as we can always 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.780
 help us with the drops to speed up the 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.900
 everything is among other things being 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.450
 however we should not opaque contrast 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.910
 then put the fixer to fix 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.660
 all because they are obviously opaque 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.330
 will go away 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.140
 so one thing for me to relax is 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.010
 much much faster to do e 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.890
 fun among other things the 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.620
 contrast as I said between gloss and it 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.470
 little can you really wander doing a 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.930
 lots of decor a lot of ideas and me 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.750
 not one of the many that were chosen 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.540
 come to mind as I told you about the medium 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:44.120
 I do this on the index I do the 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:46.880
 same thing as the ring finger and finally 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.820
 on the little finger I always do the wave that has 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.650
 done on the medium but in tablet in the 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.300
 meaning that I do it on one side and 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.610
 the other I do it 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.810
 on the other hand that together they make one 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.970
 Crescent moon 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.919
 I hope to have been clear and 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.129
 the same procedure is always the same 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.500
 which as I told you put a voice 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:09.830
 really small on tinfoil 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.009
 because besides it is hot too 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.569
 however inside a house it is warmer and 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.520
 will tend to dry faster 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.470
 so put some small drops 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.919
 rather, you put them on paper 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.470
 tinfoil 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.050
 at least you'll never enamel is 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.819
 dry or who is going to dry who 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.680
 makes those ugly threads that are minimal 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.879
 can position on the nail 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.719
 and it is a very very important thing 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.719
 this 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.590
 this is the final result in the photo 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.240
 final I really hope the video 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.410
 you like the next a big kiss a 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.410
 all bye
