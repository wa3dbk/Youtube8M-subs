 certainly the local authorities have imposed 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.550
 a large number of measures throughout 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.280
 including security level of security 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.500

 for several years of course 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.710
 virga youth people in shock is important to say 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.869
 that now the situation in boston is not clear 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.280
 the end of what goes investigation power 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.659
 argue that enough is enough 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.009
 specific information

 explosions say that now it's a 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.610
 considered criminal as far as

 was a terrorist act of power 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.140
 yet afraid to argue specifically on 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.690
 this stage the most basic question 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.510
 which people are created was this act 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.750
 done by one of the Americans or is it 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:12.990
 something that came to america from outside
