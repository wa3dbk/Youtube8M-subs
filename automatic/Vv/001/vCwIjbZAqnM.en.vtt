look for the code that displays the

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.330 
look for the code that displays the
empty<00:04:19.350> packs<00:04:20.350> lot<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:20.920> I'm<00:04:21.070> just<00:04:21.160> going<00:04:21.250> to

empty packs lot and I'm just going to

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.150 
empty packs lot and I'm just going to
cut<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.610> paste<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:21.880> in<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:23.500> we're<00:04:23.710> checking

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
cut and paste that in so we're checking

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.370 
cut and paste that in so we're checking
to<00:04:24.250> see<00:04:24.430> if<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:25.030> inventory<00:04:25.480> count<00:04:25.780> was<00:04:25.990> there

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
to see if the inventory count was there

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.570 
to see if the inventory count was there
so<00:04:26.710> that<00:04:26.740> means<00:04:27.100> else<00:04:27.400> is<00:04:27.640> down<00:04:27.790> here<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:29.580> here

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
so that means else is down here and here

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.390 
so that means else is down here and here
it<00:04:30.670> is<00:04:30.730> right<00:04:30.790> here<00:04:31.770> let's<00:04:32.770> cut<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.190> paste

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
it is right here let's cut and paste

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.780 
it is right here let's cut and paste
that<00:04:33.520> in

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.790 

I'll<00:04:41.300> leave<00:04:41.660> an<00:04:41.810> empty<00:04:41.990> string<00:04:42.410> there<00:04:42.620> so

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
I'll leave an empty string there so

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.940 
I'll leave an empty string there so
nothing<00:04:43.100> is<00:04:43.190> displayed<00:04:43.670> and<00:04:44.000> then<00:04:44.780> I'll<00:04:44.990> put

be needed to be honest let's go check to

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.810 
be needed to be honest let's go check to
make<00:05:33.200> sure<00:05:33.260> I'll<00:05:34.160> go<00:05:34.340> back<00:05:34.460> into<00:05:34.670> unity<00:05:36.820> I'm

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
make sure I'll go back into unity I'm

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.510 
make sure I'll go back into unity I'm
going<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.150> clear<00:05:38.510> let's<00:05:39.170> start<00:05:39.440> it<00:05:39.560> up<00:05:42.460> let<00:05:43.460> me

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
going to clear let's start it up let me

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.800 
going to clear let's start it up let me
take<00:05:43.700> a<00:05:43.760> look<00:05:43.820> at<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.030> character<00:05:44.390> yeah<00:05:44.630> that

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
take a look at the character yeah that

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.510 
take a look at the character yeah that
lines<00:05:45.020> not<00:05:45.290> even<00:05:45.560> needed<00:05:45.800> so<00:05:45.980> if<00:05:46.070> you<00:05:46.160> have<00:05:46.340> it

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
lines not even needed so if you have it

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.990 
lines not even needed so if you have it
get<00:05:47.090> rid<00:05:47.240> of<00:05:47.300> it<00:05:48.280> since<00:05:49.280> i<00:05:49.370> already<00:05:49.430> have<00:05:49.850> the

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
get rid of it since i already have the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.210 
get rid of it since i already have the
style<00:05:50.270> may<00:05:50.480> time<00:05:50.660> i<00:05:50.810> might<00:05:51.290> as<00:05:51.440> well<00:05:51.470> use<00:05:51.770> it<00:05:51.800> it

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
style may time i might as well use it it

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.560 
style may time i might as well use it it
seems<00:05:52.670> that<00:05:52.790> i<00:05:52.880> am<00:05:53.000> getting<00:05:53.180> a<00:05:53.330> bit<00:05:53.480> of

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
seems that i am getting a bit of

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.530 
seems that i am getting a bit of
artifact<00:05:54.110> here<00:05:54.320> around<00:05:54.440> the<00:05:54.620> edges<00:05:54.830> and<00:05:55.540> I

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
artifact here around the edges and I

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.370 
artifact here around the edges and I
think<00:05:56.750> that's<00:05:56.900> because<00:05:56.990> of<00:05:57.320> the

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
think that's because of the

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.320 
think that's because of the
anti-aliasing<00:05:58.100> I<00:05:58.370> set<00:05:58.610> up<00:05:58.760> on<00:05:58.910> it<00:05:59.180> in

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
anti-aliasing I set up on it in

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.880 
anti-aliasing I set up on it in
photoshop<00:06:01.540> but<00:06:02.540> i'll<00:06:03.110> have<00:06:03.380> to<00:06:03.500> check<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:03.830> make

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
photoshop but i'll have to check to make

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.380 
photoshop but i'll have to check to make
sure<00:06:03.980> it<00:06:04.250> could<00:06:04.400> also<00:06:04.520> be<00:06:04.670> the<00:06:04.820> compression

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
sure it could also be the compression

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.480 
sure it could also be the compression
sometimes<00:06:06.200> you<00:06:06.350> just<00:06:06.470> can't<00:06:06.560> compress<00:06:07.070> gy

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
sometimes you just can't compress gy

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.540 
sometimes you just can't compress gy
textures<00:06:08.200> but<00:06:09.200> now<00:06:09.380> when<00:06:09.500> i<00:06:09.590> click<00:06:09.620> it<00:06:09.830> it<00:06:10.250> goes

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
textures but now when i click it it goes

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.280 
textures but now when i click it it goes
back<00:06:10.730> into<00:06:10.910> mandatory<00:06:11.420> so<00:06:11.750> let's<00:06:11.930> grab<00:06:12.140> the

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
back into mandatory so let's grab the

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:18.160 
back into mandatory so let's grab the
sax<00:06:13.420> and<00:06:14.420> i'll<00:06:15.140> put<00:06:15.260> the<00:06:15.350> axe<00:06:15.530> back<00:06:16.660> edge<00:06:17.660> just

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.170 
sax and i'll put the axe back edge just

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.470 
sax and i'll put the axe back edge just
gets<00:06:18.320> out<00:06:18.440> it<00:06:18.590> to<00:06:18.680> the<00:06:18.800> end<00:06:19.330> so<00:06:20.330> we'll<00:06:20.450> just

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
gets out it to the end so we'll just

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.650 
gets out it to the end so we'll just
stop<00:06:20.840> unity<00:06:21.290> and<00:06:22.030> that<00:06:23.030> should<00:06:23.210> wrap<00:06:23.390> it<00:06:23.540> up

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
stop unity and that should wrap it up

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.780 
stop unity and that should wrap it up
for<00:06:23.930> this<00:06:24.290> tutorial<00:06:24.620> and<00:06:25.040> I'll<00:06:25.250> see<00:06:25.610> in<00:06:25.700> the

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
for this tutorial and I'll see in the

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.870 
for this tutorial and I'll see in the
next<00:06:25.820> one<00:06:26.210> bye<00:06:26.690> bye
