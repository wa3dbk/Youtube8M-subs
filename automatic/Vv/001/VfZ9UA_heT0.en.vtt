my<00:00:33.649> ears<00:00:33.920> personally<00:00:34.489> they<00:00:34.699> fall<00:00:34.879> out<00:00:34.910> they're

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300

not<00:00:35.329> comfortable<00:00:35.750> they<00:00:36.140> stay<00:00:36.320> in<00:00:36.350> mind<00:00:36.710> but<00:00:36.920> I

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
not comfortable they stay in mind but I

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.380 
not comfortable they stay in mind but I
agree<00:00:37.370> they're<00:00:37.579> not<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.850> best<00:00:38.030> sound<00:00:38.300> quality

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
agree they're not the best sound quality

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.300 
agree they're not the best sound quality
so<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:39.320> what<00:00:39.440> can<00:00:39.560> you<00:00:39.680> get<00:00:39.770> from<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.130> those

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
so so what can you get from that those

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.350 
so so what can you get from that those
by<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.520> way<00:00:40.670> if<00:00:40.760> you<00:00:40.820> were<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.000> replace<00:00:41.239> him

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
by the way if you were to replace him

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.910 
by the way if you were to replace him
costs<00:00:41.570> about<00:00:41.720> twenty<00:00:42.079> dollars<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:42.829> we're

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
costs about twenty dollars so we're

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.680 
costs about twenty dollars so we're
gonna<00:00:43.010> take<00:00:43.220> a<00:00:43.250> look<00:00:43.430> here<00:00:43.730> at<00:00:43.880> some<00:00:44.480> fairly

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
gonna take a look here at some fairly

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.050 
gonna take a look here at some fairly
expensive<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.410> not<00:00:45.920> real<00:00:46.399> expensive<00:00:46.670> models

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
expensive and not real expensive models

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.400 
expensive and not real expensive models
as<00:00:47.120> well<00:00:47.149> but<00:00:47.750> if<00:00:47.840> you're<00:00:47.960> gonna<00:00:48.140> buy

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
as well but if you're gonna buy

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.500 
as well but if you're gonna buy
headphones<00:00:48.710> like<00:00:49.220> this<00:00:49.520> you<00:00:49.880> care<00:00:50.149> about<00:00:50.270> the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
headphones like this you care about the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.270 
headphones like this you care about the
sound<00:00:50.690> quality<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.320> probably<00:00:51.739> it<00:00:51.980> might<00:00:52.190> not

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
sound quality so probably it might not

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.560 
sound quality so probably it might not
be<00:00:52.340> that<00:00:52.460> expensive<00:00:52.760> for<00:00:53.090> people<00:00:53.120> who<00:00:53.360> care

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
be that expensive for people who care

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.690 
be that expensive for people who care
about<00:00:53.600> that<00:00:53.899> stuff<00:00:54.140> right<00:00:54.350> right<00:00:54.590> um<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:55.579> we'll

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
about that stuff right right um so we'll

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.130 
about that stuff right right um so we'll
start<00:00:55.880> here<00:00:55.940> on<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.120> left<00:00:56.270> side<00:00:56.420> these<00:00:56.930> are

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
start here on the left side these are

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.950 
start here on the left side these are
made<00:00:57.649> by<00:00:57.770> sennheiser<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:59.000> they<00:00:59.480> are<00:00:59.660> noise

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
made by sennheiser and they are noise

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.810 
made by sennheiser and they are noise
cancelling<00:01:00.530> headphones<00:01:00.559> they<00:01:01.010> run<00:01:01.280> about<00:01:01.610> a

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
cancelling headphones they run about a

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.889 
cancelling headphones they run about a
hundred<00:01:02.000> dollars<00:01:02.360> what<00:01:02.629> is<00:01:02.719> noise

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
hundred dollars what is noise

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.630 
hundred dollars what is noise
cancellation<00:01:03.530> what<00:01:03.710> noise<00:01:03.860> cancelling<00:01:04.430> does

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
cancellation what noise cancelling does

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.459 
cancellation what noise cancelling does
is<00:01:04.850> it's<00:01:05.089> gonna<00:01:05.269> listen<00:01:05.689> to<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.810> sound<00:01:06.110> around

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:06.469 
is it's gonna listen to the sound around

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:08.559 
is it's gonna listen to the sound around
you<00:01:06.680> it's<00:01:07.250> gonna<00:01:07.430> recreate<00:01:07.909> that<00:01:08.090> sound<00:01:08.359> and

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:08.569 
you it's gonna recreate that sound and

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.209 
you it's gonna recreate that sound and
cancel<00:01:08.959> out<00:01:09.079> the<00:01:09.229> wave<00:01:09.350> like<00:01:09.560> two<00:01:09.829> waves<00:01:10.069> to

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
cancel out the wave like two waves to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.770 
cancel out the wave like two waves to
hit<00:01:10.340> each<00:01:10.429> other<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.759> water<00:01:10.969> yeah<00:01:11.299> just

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
hit each other in the water yeah just

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.209 
hit each other in the water yeah just
like<00:01:11.840> that<00:01:12.049> like<00:01:12.229> sound<00:01:12.469> waves<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.069> it's

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
like that like sound waves and so it's

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:14.739 
like that like sound waves and so it's
healthy<00:01:13.759> else<00:01:13.880> I'd<00:01:13.999> know<00:01:14.119> it's<00:01:14.240> really<00:01:14.479> cool

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:14.749 
healthy else I'd know it's really cool

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:16.690 
healthy else I'd know it's really cool
when<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:15.259> turn<00:01:15.409> them<00:01:15.530> on<00:01:15.649> like<00:01:15.859> on<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.039> jet<00:01:16.369> that

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
when you turn them on like on a jet that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.090 
when you turn them on like on a jet that
does<00:01:16.999> hum<00:01:17.869> sound<00:01:18.170> just<00:01:18.499> goes<00:01:18.619> away<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:18.889> was<00:01:19.039> a
