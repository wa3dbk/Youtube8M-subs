even though his hit points were red one
single<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> bullet<00:01:25.320> punch<00:01:25.500> wouldn't<00:01:25.890> be

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
single but the bullet punch wouldn't be

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.920 
single but the bullet punch wouldn't be
able<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.370> finish<00:01:26.549> him<00:01:26.790> off<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.510> really

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
able to finish him off so I really

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.070

needed<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> create<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:29.030> now<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> expect<00:01:30.690> the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
needed to create there now I expect the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.960 
needed to create there now I expect the
scissor<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.490> something<00:01:32.640> like<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
scissor to go for something like a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.789 
scissor to go for something like a
bullet<00:01:33.299> punch<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.960> turn<00:01:34.229> which<00:01:34.619> my

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
bullet punch of you turn which my

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.490 
bullet punch of you turn which my
skarmory<00:01:35.250> can't<00:01:35.700> take<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.900> their<00:01:37.049> first<00:01:37.320> which

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
skarmory can't take so their first which

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.710 
skarmory can't take so their first which
I'd<00:01:37.740> into<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> go<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.940> layer<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.150> spikes

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
I'd into it and go for a layer of spikes

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.980 
I'd into it and go for a layer of spikes
and<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:41.010> he<00:01:41.070> goes<00:01:41.250> into<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.580> gengar<00:01:41.909> um<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and now he goes into a gengar um I

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.539 
and now he goes into a gengar um I
thought<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.500> could<00:01:43.740> live<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> Thunderbolt

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
thought I could live the Thunderbolt

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.550 
thought I could live the Thunderbolt
because<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.330> skarmory<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.930> actually

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
because this skarmory is actually

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.940 
because this skarmory is actually
especially<00:01:47.400> defensively<00:01:48.049> e-vite<00:01:49.049> but

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
especially defensively e-vite but

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.730 
especially defensively e-vite but
apparently<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.580> can't<00:01:51.150> so<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:52.380> me<00:01:52.409> kind

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
apparently I can't so that got me kind

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.420 
apparently I can't so that got me kind
of<00:01:52.799> puzzled<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.930> now<00:01:54.930> he<00:01:54.990> goes<00:01:55.229> into<00:01:55.290> now<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.220> go

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
of puzzled and now he goes into now I go

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.330 
of puzzled and now he goes into now I go
into<00:01:56.580> my<00:01:56.790> tyranitar<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.840> get<00:01:58.020> off<00:01:58.140> stab<00:01:58.920> crunch

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
into my tyranitar to get off stab crunch

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.820 
into my tyranitar to get off stab crunch
but<00:02:00.030> he<00:02:00.119> sends<00:02:00.479> out<00:02:00.630> his<00:02:02.270> Swampert<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.830> I

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
but he sends out his Swampert and I

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.100 
but he sends out his Swampert and I
thought<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:06.150> I<00:02:06.180> would<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.750> able<00:02:06.900> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
thought that here I would be able to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.679 
thought that here I would be able to
outspeed<00:02:08.099> swampert<00:02:08.700> with<00:02:08.849> my<00:02:09.000> Machamp<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
off a step earthquake and that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.190 
off a step earthquake and that
earthquake<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.790> nearly<00:02:21.299> going<00:02:21.659> to<00:02:21.780> finish<00:02:21.959> me

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
earthquake is nearly going to finish me

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.830 
earthquake is nearly going to finish me
off<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.560> here<00:02:23.099> i<00:02:23.239> expected<00:02:24.239> i<00:02:24.360> throughly

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
off and here i expected i throughly

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.839 
off and here i expected i throughly
expected<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.680> switch<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.160> gengar<00:02:26.610> and

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
expected to switch it to the gengar and

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:27.480 
expected to switch it to the gengar and
there

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
there

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.890 
there
for<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.640> went<00:02:27.940> for<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.240> payback<00:02:28.690> because

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
for I went for the payback because

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.750 
for I went for the payback because
dynamic<00:02:29.500> punch<00:02:29.740> would<00:02:29.980> have<00:02:30.100> done<00:02:30.280> nothing<00:02:30.490> to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
dynamic punch would have done nothing to

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.420 
dynamic punch would have done nothing to
Ganga<00:02:31.180> but<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.140> was<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.380> wrong<00:02:32.770> prediction<00:02:32.980> on

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
Ganga but that was a wrong prediction on

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.470 
Ganga but that was a wrong prediction on
my<00:02:33.670> fault<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:35.440> now<00:02:36.040> i<00:02:36.070> go<00:02:36.340> into<00:02:36.490> my<00:02:36.580> Celebi<00:02:37.120> and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
my fault so now i go into my Celebi and

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.950 
my fault so now i go into my Celebi and
basically<00:02:37.990> he<00:02:38.200> has<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.800> switch<00:02:39.100> out<00:02:39.370> here<00:02:39.960> but

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
basically he has to switch out here but

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.810 
basically he has to switch out here but
i<00:02:40.990> just<00:02:41.410> went<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> safe<00:02:42.160> leaf<00:02:42.490> storm

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
i just went for a safe leaf storm

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.900 
i just went for a safe leaf storm
because<00:02:43.240> i<00:02:43.510> wasn't<00:02:44.260> really<00:02:44.650> playing<00:02:45.190> well<00:02:45.370> and

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
because i wasn't really playing well and

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.660 
because i wasn't really playing well and
I<00:02:46.570> really<00:02:46.600> had<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.020> do<00:02:47.230> something<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.400> get<00:02:48.520> that

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
I really had to do something to get that

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.160 
I really had to do something to get that
Swampert<00:02:49.180> out<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.510> way<00:02:49.660> in<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.900> first

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
Swampert out of the way in the first

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.550 
Swampert out of the way in the first
place<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:51.060> here<00:02:52.060> we<00:02:52.090> have<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.660> asa<00:02:52.930> train

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
place and here we have the asa train

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.400 
place and here we have the asa train
glitch<00:02:53.920> yeah<00:02:54.490> I<00:02:54.910> decide<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.600> switch<00:02:55.780> out<00:02:56.140> and

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
glitch yeah I decide to switch out and

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.010 
glitch yeah I decide to switch out and
he<00:02:56.500> goes<00:02:56.710> for<00:02:56.950> pursuit<00:02:57.460> not<00:02:58.090> many<00:02:58.510> scissors

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
he goes for pursuit not many scissors

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.620 
he goes for pursuit not many scissors
still<00:02:59.380> use<00:02:59.620> pursuit<00:03:00.130> but<00:03:00.820> this<00:03:01.150> one<00:03:01.360> does<00:03:01.600> and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
still use pursuit but this one does and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.680 
still use pursuit but this one does and
it<00:03:01.990> really<00:03:02.230> pays<00:03:02.500> off<00:03:02.740> this<00:03:02.950> match<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.660> now<00:03:04.660> I

the acid rain and this acid rain is just
simply<00:03:34.690> going<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:35.050> bring<00:03:35.260> my<00:03:35.410> hit<00:03:35.620> points<00:03:35.980> down

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
snap hydro pump after call mind will be

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.490 
snap hydro pump after call mind will be
able<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.460> finish<00:03:45.730> off<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.180> Swampert<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:47.230> I<00:03:47.260> go

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500

sweep<00:04:29.140> I<00:04:29.440> don't<00:04:30.070> know<00:04:30.160> so<00:04:30.970> he<00:04:31.570> withdraws<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.320> I

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
sweep I don't know so he withdraws and I

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.590 
sweep I don't know so he withdraws and I
decided<00:04:32.980> to<00:04:33.100> go<00:04:33.250> for<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.580> step<00:04:33.970> stone<00:04:34.390> edge

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
decided to go for a step stone edge

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.360 
decided to go for a step stone edge
because<00:04:35.080> it's<00:04:35.290> basically<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.800> best<00:04:36.040> thing<00:04:36.280> I

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
because it's basically the best thing I

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.940 
because it's basically the best thing I
can<00:04:36.430> do<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.030> since<00:04:37.750> one<00:04:38.050> port<00:04:38.290> is<00:04:38.410> gone<00:04:38.680> a

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
can do and since one port is gone a

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.800 
can do and since one port is gone a
stone<00:04:39.370> edge<00:04:39.580> will<00:04:39.850> hit<00:04:40.030> anything

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
stone edge will hit anything

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.930

yippee ai-yay and I ni finish off this
tyranitar<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:11.490> was<00:05:12.490> left<00:05:12.669> with<00:05:12.790> two<00:05:13.060> Pokemon

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
tyranitar I was left with two Pokemon

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.570 
tyranitar I was left with two Pokemon
and<00:05:13.870> things<00:05:14.229> are<00:05:14.410> looking<00:05:14.440> better<00:05:14.979> for<00:05:15.310> me<00:05:15.460> at

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
and things are looking better for me at

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.900 
and things are looking better for me at
this<00:05:15.700> point<00:05:16.169> I<00:05:17.169> was<00:05:17.919> hoping<00:05:18.160> that<00:05:18.430> this

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
this point I was hoping that this

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.060 
this point I was hoping that this
infernape<00:05:19.660> wasn't<00:05:19.990> scarfed<00:05:20.440> or<00:05:20.620> something

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
infernape wasn't scarfed or something

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.250 
infernape wasn't scarfed or something
but<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.820> because<00:05:22.419> it<00:05:22.570> out<00:05:22.720> speeds<00:05:23.080> my

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
but it is because it out speeds my

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.580 
but it is because it out speeds my
tyranitar<00:05:23.950> which<00:05:24.550> sucked<00:05:24.910> balls<00:05:25.270> for<00:05:25.600> me<00:05:25.780> so

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
tyranitar which sucked balls for me so

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.379 
tyranitar which sucked balls for me so
now<00:05:26.740> I'm<00:05:26.889> left<00:05:27.100> it<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.400> my<00:05:27.550> loss<00:05:27.790> and<00:05:28.120> this<00:05:28.270> is

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389
