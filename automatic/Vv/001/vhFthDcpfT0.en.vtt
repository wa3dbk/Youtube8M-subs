out<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.149> big<00:00:40.070> magnet<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> very

out to be a big magnet in a very
confined<00:00:42.690> space<00:00:43.440> now<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.219> lot<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.789> people

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
confined space now for a lot of people

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
confined space now for a lot of people
that's<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.719> problem<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
that's a problem because you have to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.200 
that's a problem because you have to
stay<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.100> there<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> stay<00:00:48.030> quiet

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
stay in there you have to stay quiet

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.360 
stay in there you have to stay quiet
motionless<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> relatively<00:00:49.710> long<00:00:49.829> period

of<00:00:50.399> time<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.180> second<00:00:51.570> generation<00:00:51.840> was

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
of time the second generation was

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.170 
of time the second generation was
something<00:00:52.440> called<00:00:52.590> an<00:00:52.800> open<00:00:53.039> MRI<00:00:53.579> which<00:00:53.940> was

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
something called an open MRI which was

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.260 
something called an open MRI which was
much<00:00:54.480> more<00:00:54.510> open<00:00:54.870> much<00:00:55.530> less<00:00:55.829> confined<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:57.239> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
much more open much less confined now I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.610 
much more open much less confined now I
guess<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:57.629> down<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.960> sort<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> third

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
guess we're down to sort of the third

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
guess we're down to sort of the third
generation<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.760> device<00:01:00.359> where<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.629> can

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
generation here a device where you can

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.770 
generation here a device where you can
literally<00:01:01.289> stand<00:01:01.949> up<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.300> sort

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
literally stand up you are there in sort

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
literally stand up you are there in sort
of<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.930> normal<00:01:04.170> standing<00:01:04.860> position<00:01:05.369> all<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
MRI has just acquired we've been seeing

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.179 
MRI has just acquired we've been seeing
patients<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.119> about<00:02:00.329> four<00:02:00.600> weeks<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:01.200> can

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
patients for about four weeks now can

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.310 
patients for about four weeks now can
image<00:02:02.759> patients<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.719> fully<00:02:03.990> upright

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
image patients in a fully upright

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.130 
image patients in a fully upright
position<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.759> image<00:02:06.060> patients<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.810> seated

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
position can image patients in a seated

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.070 
position can image patients in a seated
position<00:02:07.580> can<00:02:08.580> also<00:02:09.060> image<00:02:09.330> them<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.840> what's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
position can also image them in what's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.410 
position can also image them in what's
called<00:02:10.259> Trendelenburg<00:02:11.250> where<00:02:11.670> your<00:02:11.910> head<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
called Trendelenburg where your head is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.780 
called Trendelenburg where your head is
lower<00:02:12.720> than<00:02:12.989> your<00:02:13.110> heart

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
lower than your heart

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.130 
lower than your heart
neurologists<00:02:14.790> like<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.240> for<00:02:15.450> flow<00:02:15.660> studies

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
neurologists like that for flow studies

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.620 
neurologists like that for flow studies
and<00:02:16.380> also<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> standard<00:02:18.060> recumbent

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
and also in a standard recumbent

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.930 
and also in a standard recumbent
position<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.740> advantage<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.760> course

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
position the advantage to that of course

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.270 
position the advantage to that of course
is<00:02:21.180> if<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> back<00:02:21.930> problem<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.470> you

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
is if you have a back problem and you

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.950 
is if you have a back problem and you
are<00:02:23.400> traditionally<00:02:24.180> told<00:02:24.420> by<00:02:24.600> your<00:02:24.750> physician

are traditionally told by your physician
you<00:02:25.740> got<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.980> go<00:02:26.070> lie<00:02:26.220> down<00:02:26.490> when<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:26.820> back

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
you got to go lie down when your back

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.320 
you got to go lie down when your back
hurts<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.630> with<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.650> machine<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.610> can<00:02:29.880> image

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
hurts so with this machine we can image

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.120 
hurts so with this machine we can image
you<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.750> recumbent<00:02:31.260> position<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.860> also

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
you in the recumbent position and also

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.610 
you in the recumbent position and also
image<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.850> in<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.060> position<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.600> pain<00:02:33.930> that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
image you in the position of pain that

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.470 
image you in the position of pain that
would<00:02:34.770> be<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.070> standing<00:02:35.550> position<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
would be in a standing position the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.300 
would be in a standing position the
physician<00:02:36.930> gets<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.290> put<00:02:37.470> those<00:02:37.590> images<00:02:37.800> side

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
physician gets to put those images side

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.630 
physician gets to put those images side
by<00:02:38.580> side<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.240> do<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> compare<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.500> contrast

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
by side and do a compare and contrast

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.890 
by side and do a compare and contrast
why<00:02:41.640> are<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.850> having<00:02:42.060> more<00:02:42.390> pain<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
why are you having more pain in the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.510 
why are you having more pain in the
standing<00:02:43.320> position<00:02:43.470> now<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:44.370> an

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
standing position now that's an

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.490 
standing position now that's an
interesting<00:02:44.870> thing<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.140> bring<00:02:46.320> up

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
interesting thing that you bring up

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.630 
interesting thing that you bring up
there<00:02:46.650> because<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:47.010> do<00:02:47.130> have<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.460> option

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
there because you do have the option

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.080 
there because you do have the option
here<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.270> can<00:02:48.510> show<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.940> situation<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.060> can

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
here you can show this situation you can

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.450 
here you can show this situation you can
show<00:02:51.360> whatever<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.440> organ<00:02:52.830> system<00:02:53.280> or

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
show whatever the the organ system or

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.880 
show whatever the the organ system or
the<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.990> thing<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.020> you're<00:02:55.290> looking<00:02:55.620> for

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the the thing that you're looking for

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.770 
the the thing that you're looking for
from<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.460> couple<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.880> different<00:02:57.210> ways<00:02:57.330> if<00:02:57.660> you

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
from a couple of different ways if you

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.390 
from a couple of different ways if you
want<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.110> see<00:02:58.260> someone<00:02:58.500> lying<00:02:58.830> down<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.280> can

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
want to see someone lying down you can

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.710 
want to see someone lying down you can
do<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.700> but<00:02:59.850> then<00:03:00.030> if<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.210> want<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.420> see<00:03:00.570> them

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
do that but then if you want to see them

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.180 
do that but then if you want to see them
standing<00:03:01.080> up<00:03:01.200> we<00:03:01.410> never<00:03:01.530> could<00:03:01.830> do<00:03:01.980> that

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
standing up we never could do that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.310 
standing up we never could do that
before<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.120> do<00:03:03.360> have<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.690> opportunity<00:03:04.200> to

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
before so you do have the opportunity to

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.290 
before so you do have the opportunity to
do<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.590> sort<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.370> B<00:03:05.520> comparison

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
do that sort of a and B comparison

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.140 
do that sort of a and B comparison
absolutely<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.430> imaging<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.550> a<00:03:08.640> position<00:03:08.910> of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
absolutely and imaging in a position of

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.730 
absolutely and imaging in a position of
pain<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.570> something<00:03:09.960> that<00:03:10.110> physicians<00:03:10.590> have

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
pain is something that physicians have

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.050 
pain is something that physicians have
never<00:03:10.950> really<00:03:11.310> been<00:03:11.460> able<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.760> see<00:03:12.030> before

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
never really been able to see before

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.890 
never really been able to see before
it's<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.590> makes<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.130> lot<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.310> sense<00:03:14.720> runners<00:03:15.720> for

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
it's it makes a lot of sense runners for

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.810 
it's it makes a lot of sense runners for
example<00:03:16.440> they<00:03:16.740> have<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.920> lot<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.130> any<00:03:17.430> injuries

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
example they have a lot of any injuries

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.040 
example they have a lot of any injuries
and<00:03:18.000> what<00:03:18.120> does<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.300> doctor<00:03:18.510> tell<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.930> when

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
and what does the doctor tell you when

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.670 
and what does the doctor tell you when
you<00:03:19.170> need<00:03:19.200> hurts<00:03:19.620> put<00:03:20.010> your<00:03:20.130> foot<00:03:20.280> up<00:03:20.480> lie<00:03:21.480> down

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
you need hurts put your foot up lie down

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.590 
you need hurts put your foot up lie down
same<00:03:22.680> with<00:03:22.830> your<00:03:23.010> back<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:23.820> does<00:03:24.300> make<00:03:24.570> a

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
same with your back so this does make a

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.479 
same with your back so this does make a
lot<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.870> sense<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.380> think<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.770> a<00:03:25.800> lot<00:03:26.100> more

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
lot of sense I think that a lot more

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.770 
lot of sense I think that a lot more
physicians<00:03:27.180> are<00:03:27.330> going<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.510> see<00:03:27.660> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
physicians are going to see the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.930 
physicians are going to see the
advantage<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.620> as<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:29.400> becomes<00:03:29.790> more

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
advantage of it as it becomes more

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.270 
advantage of it as it becomes more
available<00:03:30.630> as<00:03:30.870> people<00:03:31.560> are<00:03:31.650> able<00:03:31.770> to<00:03:31.950> see<00:03:32.130> the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
available as people are able to see the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.510 
available as people are able to see the
images<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:33.800> bring<00:03:34.800> up<00:03:34.920> another<00:03:35.010> point<00:03:35.370> here

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
images you bring up another point here

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.890 
images you bring up another point here
as<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.820> becomes<00:03:36.030> more<00:03:36.150> available<00:03:36.600> you've<00:03:36.750> got

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
as it becomes more available you've got

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.310 
as it becomes more available you've got
the<00:03:37.020> only<00:03:37.290> one<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.680> these<00:03:37.860> in<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.640> whole<00:03:38.670> world

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
the only one of these in the whole world

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.780 
the only one of these in the whole world
I<00:03:40.320> suspect<00:03:40.770> an<00:03:40.890> awful<00:03:41.130> lot<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.250> people<00:03:41.430> who<00:03:41.610> are

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
I suspect an awful lot of people who are

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.070 
I suspect an awful lot of people who are
looking<00:03:42.090> over<00:03:42.300> your<00:03:42.390> shoulder<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.900> see

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
looking over your shoulder to see

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.930 
looking over your shoulder to see
exactly<00:03:43.500> what<00:03:43.680> you're<00:03:44.100> seeing<00:03:44.430> from<00:03:44.790> these

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
exactly what you're seeing from these

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.620 
exactly what you're seeing from these
things<00:03:45.239> too

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
things too

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.449 
things too
to<00:03:45.810> try<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.080> I<00:03:46.290> guess<00:03:46.500> gauge<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.980> value<00:03:47.010> of

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
to try and I guess gauge the value of

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.300 
to try and I guess gauge the value of
this<00:03:47.610> device<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.269> imagine<00:03:48.810> that's<00:03:48.989> true<00:03:49.110> it's<00:03:49.980> a

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
this device I imagine that's true it's a

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.000 
this device I imagine that's true it's a
bit<00:03:50.519> around<00:03:50.760> for<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> while<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.709> we<00:03:52.709> were<00:03:52.739> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
bit around for a while and we were the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.280 
bit around for a while and we were the
first<00:03:53.040> ones<00:03:53.519> at<00:03:53.700> Washington<00:03:54.150> open<00:03:54.480> MRI<00:03:54.840> to

first ones at Washington open MRI to

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.400 
first ones at Washington open MRI to
make<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.860> available<00:03:56.600> we're<00:03:57.600> seeing<00:03:57.900> an<00:03:57.989> awful

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
make it available we're seeing an awful

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.890 
make it available we're seeing an awful
lot<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:58.560> interest<00:03:58.800> from<00:03:59.340> patients<00:04:00.269> as<00:04:00.390> well<00:04:00.840> as

request different kinds of MRIs and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.430 
request different kinds of MRIs and
frankly<00:04:12.120> can<00:04:12.360> date<00:04:12.630> because<00:04:12.900> perhaps<00:04:13.110> that's

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
frankly can date because perhaps that's

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.370 
frankly can date because perhaps that's
a<00:04:13.670> an<00:04:14.670> important<00:04:15.209> thing<00:04:15.330> for<00:04:15.390> people<00:04:16.140> watching

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
a an important thing for people watching

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.949 
a an important thing for people watching
if<00:04:17.130> they<00:04:17.400> are<00:04:17.549> told<00:04:17.820> they<00:04:17.970> need<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.359> get<00:04:18.510> an<00:04:18.660> MRI

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
if they are told they need to get an MRI

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.650 
if they are told they need to get an MRI
and<00:04:19.470> people<00:04:20.220> understand<00:04:20.700> what<00:04:20.940> that<00:04:21.090> means<00:04:21.330> I

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
and people understand what that means I

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.150 
and people understand what that means I

to when there was a time if you had gone

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.510 
to when there was a time if you had gone
to<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.229> open<00:05:00.349> MRI<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.889> might<00:05:01.189> not<00:05:01.400> have

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
to the open MRI you might not have

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.339 
to the open MRI you might not have
gotten<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:02.060> best<00:05:02.240> possible<00:05:02.960> diagnostic

gotten the best possible diagnostic

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.529 
gotten the best possible diagnostic
image<00:05:03.919> but<00:05:04.129> we<00:05:04.279> seem<00:05:04.969> to<00:05:05.000> have<00:05:05.120> clear<00:05:05.330> that

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
image but we seem to have clear that

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.140 
image but we seem to have clear that
hurdle<00:05:05.719> and<00:05:06.020> I<00:05:06.319> absolutely<00:05:07.279> think<00:05:07.969> we've

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
hurdle and I absolutely think we've

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.029 
hurdle and I absolutely think we've
cleared<00:05:08.389> that<00:05:08.539> hurdle<00:05:08.810> and<00:05:09.020> that's<00:05:09.259> you<00:05:10.009> know

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
cleared that hurdle and that's you know

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:11.769 
cleared that hurdle and that's you know
that's<00:05:10.279> a<00:05:10.460> misconception<00:05:10.639> that's<00:05:11.330> been<00:05:11.569> held

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
that's a misconception that's been held

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.629 
that's a misconception that's been held
on<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:12.199> for<00:05:12.229> a<00:05:12.439> number<00:05:12.710> of<00:05:12.740> years<00:05:13.129> the<00:05:13.430> image

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
on to for a number of years the image

all there's a lot of body imaging being
done<00:05:54.560> a<00:05:54.800> lot<00:05:54.919> of<00:05:55.039> flow<00:05:55.219> studies<00:05:55.610> it's<00:05:55.939> really

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
done a lot of flow studies it's really

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.749 
done a lot of flow studies it's really
amazing<00:05:56.629> how<00:05:57.020> much<00:05:57.529> this<00:05:57.770> machine<00:05:58.219> has<00:05:58.460> been

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
amazing how much this machine has been

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.170 
amazing how much this machine has been
evolved<00:05:59.569> even<00:05:59.899> in<00:06:00.199> the<00:06:00.409> last<00:06:00.649> 20<00:06:01.009> years<00:06:01.180> what

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
evolved even in the last 20 years what

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.700 
evolved even in the last 20 years what
you<00:06:02.330> can<00:06:02.479> do<00:06:02.599> on<00:06:02.719> this<00:06:02.839> machine<00:06:03.199> versus<00:06:03.560> what

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
you can do on this machine versus what

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.439 
you can do on this machine versus what
you<00:06:03.830> could<00:06:03.979> do<00:06:04.069> 20<00:06:04.370> years<00:06:04.399> ago<00:06:04.639> it's<00:06:05.000> amazing

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
you could do 20 years ago it's amazing

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.839 
you could do 20 years ago it's amazing
it<00:06:05.569> really<00:06:05.599> is<00:06:05.839> a<00:06:05.990> very<00:06:06.169> very<00:06:06.849> useful

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
it really is a very very useful

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:09.969 
it really is a very very useful
diagnostic<00:06:08.270> tool<00:06:09.020> you<00:06:09.319> talked<00:06:09.560> about<00:06:09.620> flow

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
diagnostic tool you talked about flow

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:11.439 
diagnostic tool you talked about flow
studies<00:06:10.339> and<00:06:10.460> that<00:06:10.550> is<00:06:10.669> a<00:06:10.699> subject<00:06:11.240> that<00:06:11.270> we

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
studies and that is a subject that we

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.029 
studies and that is a subject that we
have<00:06:11.599> brought<00:06:11.779> up<00:06:11.899> on<00:06:12.050> this<00:06:12.169> program<00:06:12.529> before<00:06:12.649> -

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
have brought up on this program before -

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.939 
have brought up on this program before -
is<00:06:13.250> it<00:06:13.399> used<00:06:13.610> to<00:06:13.669> be<00:06:13.759> MRIs<00:06:14.240> and<00:06:14.270> and<00:06:14.990> cat-scans

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
is it used to be MRIs and and cat-scans

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.980 
is it used to be MRIs and and cat-scans
things<00:06:16.189> like<00:06:16.339> that<00:06:16.520> we're<00:06:16.669> sort<00:06:16.879> of<00:06:16.990> moments

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
things like that we're sort of moments

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.809 
things like that we're sort of moments
in<00:06:18.080> time<00:06:18.379> we<00:06:18.680> can<00:06:18.830> now<00:06:18.979> sort<00:06:19.310> of<00:06:19.339> take<00:06:19.610> these

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:19.819 
in time we can now sort of take these

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.029 
in time we can now sort of take these
images<00:06:20.149> together<00:06:20.930> and<00:06:21.259> particularly<00:06:21.830> when<00:06:21.919> it

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
images together and particularly when it

through organs and that kinds of things
correctly<00:06:27.319> done<00:06:27.649> you<00:06:27.919> can<00:06:28.129> see<00:06:28.399> these<00:06:28.610> things

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
correctly done you can see these things

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.510 
correctly done you can see these things
over<00:06:29.419> a<00:06:29.449> period<00:06:29.750> of<00:06:29.930> time<00:06:30.169> you<00:06:30.469> literally<00:06:31.069> can
