00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
now this may or may not work of course

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.730 
now this may or may not work of course
now<00:05:17.100> when<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.370> initially<00:05:18.169> do<00:05:19.169> it<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:19.590> know

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
now when you initially do it you know

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.360 
now when you initially do it you know
when<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.270> first<00:05:21.590> diagnosed<00:05:22.590> that<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:23.160> is<00:05:23.340> a

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
when you first diagnosed that it is a

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.220 
when you first diagnosed that it is a
problem<00:05:23.940> in<00:05:24.030> is<00:05:24.150> not<00:05:24.360> turning<00:05:24.720> on<00:05:24.840> that<00:05:24.870> would

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
problem in is not turning on that would

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.550 
problem in is not turning on that would
definitely<00:05:25.830> hit<00:05:26.040> this<00:05:26.400> power<00:05:26.760> button<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.560> the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
definitely hit this power button and the

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.270 
definitely hit this power button and the
volume<00:05:28.590> up<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:30.290> hold<00:05:31.290> that<00:05:31.410> down<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:32.070> know<00:05:32.190> at

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
volume up and hold that down you know at

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.310 
volume up and hold that down you know at
the<00:05:32.370> same<00:05:32.520> time<00:05:32.850> and<00:05:33.060> see<00:05:33.270> if<00:05:33.480> that<00:05:34.080> does

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
the same time and see if that does

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.110 
the same time and see if that does
anything<00:05:34.350> that<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:35.070> think<00:05:35.669> that<00:05:35.790> brings<00:05:35.970> up

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
anything that I think that brings up

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.370 
anything that I think that brings up
recovery<00:05:36.390> I<00:05:36.630> don't<00:05:36.780> know<00:05:36.900> but<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.200> does

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
recovery I don't know but that does

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.060 
recovery I don't know but that does
something<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:38.010> that<00:05:38.580> usually<00:05:38.790> works<00:05:39.890> but<00:05:40.890> if

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
something and that usually works but if

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.550 
something and that usually works but if
not<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:42.390> know<00:05:42.660> for<00:05:42.930> sure<00:05:42.960> is<00:05:43.290> water

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
not and you know for sure is water

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.430 
not and you know for sure is water
damage<00:05:43.830> like<00:05:44.729> for<00:05:44.910> instance<00:05:45.210> if<00:05:45.360> you<00:05:45.630> if<00:05:45.960> it's

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
damage like for instance if you if it's

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.219 
damage like for instance if you if it's
not<00:05:46.530> turning<00:05:46.919> on<00:05:47.040> and<00:05:47.250> you<00:05:47.310> see<00:05:47.520> water

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
not turning on and you see water

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.409 
not turning on and you see water
anywhere<00:05:49.229> that<00:05:50.190> probably<00:05:50.580> is<00:05:50.790> what<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.210> case

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
anywhere that probably is what the case

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.620 
anywhere that probably is what the case
is<00:05:51.630> sometimes<00:05:52.380> stuff<00:05:52.950> spills<00:05:53.460> on<00:05:53.760> it<00:05:53.910> or<00:05:54.060> might

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
is sometimes stuff spills on it or might
