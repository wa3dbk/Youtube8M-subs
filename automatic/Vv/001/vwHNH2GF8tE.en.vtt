the<00:02:07.990> idea<00:02:08.990> is<00:02:10.240> I'm<00:02:11.240> assuming<00:02:11.780> it's<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.080> idea

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
the idea is I'm assuming it's the idea

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.940 
the idea is I'm assuming it's the idea
since<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.860> this<00:02:13.430> has<00:02:13.610> not<00:02:13.760> come<00:02:14.000> from

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
since it this has not come from

since it this has not come from
Johnson's<00:02:15.950> memoirs<00:02:16.550> or<00:02:16.760> anything<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:18.650> the

Johnson's memoirs or anything but the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.150 
Johnson's memoirs or anything but the
idea<00:02:19.250> would<00:02:19.550> be<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:20.600> not<00:02:20.630> only<00:02:21.170> have<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
idea would be to not only have the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.980 
idea would be to not only have the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
take over a section of the melody and

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.510 
take over a section of the melody and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
have the melody transfer back and forth

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.130
