00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the best doing the method I just showed

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.030 
the best doing the method I just showed
you<00:01:42.060> allows<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> direct<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> heat<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
you allows you to direct the heat to the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800 
you allows you to direct the heat to the
soles<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.060> easier<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.570> less

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
soles and it's much easier and less

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.719 
soles and it's much easier and less
messy<00:01:45.869> than<00:01:46.439> pouring<00:01:46.710> boiling<00:01:46.950> water<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
messy than pouring boiling water and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.760 
messy than pouring boiling water and
also<00:01:48.149> something<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.600> may<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.780> asking<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
also something you may be asking can I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.499 
also something you may be asking can I
just<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.280> method<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.909> separate<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
just do this method to separate the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.969 
just do this method to separate the
whole<00:01:51.659> shoe<00:01:51.930> instead<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> pouring<00:01:52.649> water

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
whole shoe instead of pouring water

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.440 
whole shoe instead of pouring water
inside<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.670> well<00:01:53.939> yeah<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.149> can

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
inside of them well yeah you can

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.330 
inside of them well yeah you can
obviously<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.530> won't<00:01:55.680> always<00:01:55.860> work<00:01:56.130> out

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
obviously but it won't always work out

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
obviously but it won't always work out
this<00:01:56.549> well<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:57.030> separating<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> uppers

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
this well for separating the uppers

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.810 
this well for separating the uppers
especially<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> shoes<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.219> much<00:01:59.460> newer

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
especially if the shoes are much newer

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.760 
especially if the shoes are much newer
so<00:02:00.329> yeah<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.509> hope<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.960> video<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:01.380> helpful<00:02:01.409> to
