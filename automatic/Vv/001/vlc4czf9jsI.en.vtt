00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
bigger for one mana i don't think i ever

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.380 
bigger for one mana i don't think i ever
pumped<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.040> once<00:02:32.280> i<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.760> used<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.239> as<00:02:33.360> a

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
pumped it once i just used it as a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.020 
pumped it once i just used it as a
normal<00:02:34.080> pump<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.440> make<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.710> bigger<00:02:35.030> not

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
normal pump to make it bigger not

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.340 
normal pump to make it bigger not
necessarily<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.540> save<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.320> a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
necessarily to save it just to have a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.090 
necessarily to save it just to have a
really<00:02:37.590> big<00:02:37.710> creature<00:02:37.980> after<00:02:38.490> something

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
really big creature after something

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.310 
really big creature after something

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
and then the faith shield did a lot of

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.170 
and then the faith shield did a lot of
work<00:02:41.530> because<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.950> was<00:02:42.130> able<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.520> get<00:02:43.030> my

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
work because I was able to get my

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.790

creatures protection and save them and
kind<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.130> use<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.430> as<00:02:45.550> removal<00:02:46.000> subject<00:02:46.780> my

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
creatures and swing it for the wind when

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.640 
creatures and swing it for the wind when
it<00:02:54.220> wasn't<00:02:54.400> lethal<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:56.110> those<00:02:56.290> were<00:02:56.410> some<00:02:56.590> of

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
it wasn't lethal but those were some of

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.230 
it wasn't lethal but those were some of
the<00:02:56.800> more<00:02:56.980> interesting<00:02:57.250> interactions<00:02:58.150> that

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
the more interesting interactions that

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.720 
the more interesting interactions that
actually<00:02:58.570> had<00:02:58.720> in<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.900> game<00:02:59.460> just<00:03:00.460> a<00:03:00.520> little

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
actually had in the game just a little

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.070 
actually had in the game just a little
bit<00:03:00.850> about<00:03:01.000> what<00:03:01.180> i<00:03:01.210> could<00:03:01.300> do<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.900> deck

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
bit about what i could do with the deck

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.840 
bit about what i could do with the deck
if<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.680> worked<00:03:02.860> out<00:03:02.980> like<00:03:03.160> i<00:03:03.250> said<00:03:03.430> i<00:03:03.460> have<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
if it worked out like i said i have the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.640 
if it worked out like i said i have the
angel<00:03:04.270> flight<00:03:04.480> alabaster<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.260> then<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.470> five

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
angel flight alabaster and then the five

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.440 
angel flight alabaster and then the five
spirits<00:03:06.130> I<00:03:06.340> was<00:03:06.940> originally<00:03:07.180> thinking

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
spirits I was originally thinking

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.480 
spirits I was originally thinking
running<00:03:07.990> blue<00:03:08.620> white<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:08.890> actually<00:03:09.280> played

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
running blue white and actually played

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.090 
running blue white and actually played
blue<00:03:09.730> white<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.180> first<00:03:10.450> game<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.890> did

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
blue white in the first game and I did

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.770 
blue white in the first game and I did
win<00:03:12.340> but<00:03:12.700> my<00:03:12.790> friend<00:03:13.030> convinced<00:03:13.390> me<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.540> run

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
win but my friend convinced me to run

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.780 
win but my friend convinced me to run
the<00:03:13.810> green<00:03:14.080> instead<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:15.130> may<00:03:15.520> have<00:03:15.640> been

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
the green instead it may have been

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.370 
the green instead it may have been
better<00:03:16.000> if<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.270> played<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.690> blue<00:03:16.870> because<00:03:17.320> I

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
better if I played the blue because I

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.400 
better if I played the blue because I
had<00:03:17.830> lots<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.370> little<00:03:18.760> spirits<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.300> flying<00:03:19.600> and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
had lots of little spirits of flying and

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.660 
had lots of little spirits of flying and
those<00:03:20.530> would<00:03:20.650> have<00:03:20.710> all<00:03:20.890> works<00:03:21.340> really<00:03:21.520> well

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
those would have all works really well

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.910 
those would have all works really well
with<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.000> Angels<00:03:22.990> Flight<00:03:23.170> alabaster<00:03:23.740> and

with the Angels Flight alabaster and
flying<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:24.790> general<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.270> really<00:03:25.510> good<00:03:25.720> or<00:03:26.500> any

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
flying in general is really good or any

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.280 
flying in general is really good or any
sort<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.100> evasion<00:03:27.370> is<00:03:27.760> really<00:03:28.000> good<00:03:28.200> can<00:03:29.200> this

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
sort of evasion is really good can this

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.140 
sort of evasion is really good can this

they were able to pump and get bigger to
attack<00:03:58.120> early<00:03:58.510> on<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:59.170> those<00:03:59.320> were<00:03:59.560> probably

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
attack early on so those were probably

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.570

some<00:04:00.040> some<00:04:00.550> of<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.330> more<00:04:01.540> interesting<00:04:01.870> cards

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
some some of the more interesting cards

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.010 
some some of the more interesting cards
the<00:04:03.580> alch<00:04:03.730> one<00:04:03.910> time<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.120> had<00:04:04.240> them<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:04.750> i<00:04:04.810> had

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
the alch one time I had them and i had

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.440 
the alch one time I had them and i had
to<00:04:05.380> forests<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.070> kept<00:04:06.250> them<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.670> then<00:04:07.390> i

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
to forests and kept them and then i

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.610 
to forests and kept them and then i
missed<00:04:07.630> like<00:04:07.720> three<00:04:07.780> land<00:04:08.170> drops<00:04:08.440> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
missed like three land drops and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.650 
missed like three land drops and
eventually<00:04:08.980> got<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.280> planes<00:04:09.550> with<00:04:09.790> them<00:04:09.970> but

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
eventually got the planes with them but

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.880 
eventually got the planes with them but
it<00:04:10.900> was<00:04:10.990> a<00:04:11.020> little<00:04:11.140> bit<00:04:11.290> too<00:04:11.500> little<00:04:11.740> too<00:04:11.860> late

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
it was a little bit too little too late

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.930 
it was a little bit too little too late
for<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:15.250> that's<00:04:15.370> pretty<00:04:15.550> much<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:15.760> for

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
for that so that's pretty much it for

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.760 
for that so that's pretty much it for
