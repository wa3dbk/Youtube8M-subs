because right now I mean it's 5,000 watt
says<00:04:20.299> yes<00:04:20.690> it's<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:20.989> biggest<00:04:21.410> day<00:04:21.560> 5,000<00:04:22.550> watts

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
says yes it's a biggest day 5,000 watts

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.090 
says yes it's a biggest day 5,000 watts
but<00:04:22.940> we<00:04:23.030> are<00:04:23.180> no<00:04:23.360> boss<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:24.320> true<00:04:24.500> 5,000

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
but we are no boss and a true 5,000

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.850 
but we are no boss and a true 5,000
watts

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
watts

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.200 
watts
it's<00:04:27.860> not<00:04:28.010> all<00:04:28.160> about<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.400> max<00:04:28.730> peak<00:04:28.970> it's<00:04:29.120> all

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
it's not all about the max peak it's all

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.920 
it's not all about the max peak it's all
about<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.450> rms<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.200> rms<00:04:30.770> on<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.310> mofos<00:04:31.790> 15<00:04:32.690> i

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
about the rms and rms on the mofos 15 i

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.629 
about the rms and rms on the mofos 15 i
think<00:04:33.230> is<00:04:34.900> if<00:04:35.900> this<00:04:36.080> is<00:04:36.230> 3000<00:04:36.770> watts<00:04:37.010> then<00:04:37.490> I'm

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
think is if this is 3000 watts then I'm

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.770 
think is if this is 3000 watts then I'm
pretty<00:04:38.000> sure<00:04:38.090> this<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.270> probably<00:04:38.570> gonna<00:04:38.720> be

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
pretty sure this is probably gonna be

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.629 
pretty sure this is probably gonna be
like<00:04:38.900> 1500<00:04:40.180> rms<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.450> this<00:04:42.260> our<00:04:42.889> master<00:04:43.430> here

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
like 1500 rms and this our master here

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.640 
like 1500 rms and this our master here
is<00:04:43.730> probably<00:04:43.970> like<00:04:45.100> 1700<00:04:46.100> or<00:04:47.440> because<00:04:48.440> that's

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
is probably like 1700 or because that's

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.460 
is probably like 1700 or because that's
not<00:04:48.770> 5000<00:04:49.370> Watts<00:04:49.520> times<00:04:49.700> like<00:04:49.940> 1700<00:04:50.840> something

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
not 5000 Watts times like 1700 something

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.490 
not 5000 Watts times like 1700 something
