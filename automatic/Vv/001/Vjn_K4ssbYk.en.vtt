good<00:04:25.860> tactic<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.430> an<00:04:26.520> elementalist<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.270> have

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
good tactic is an elementalist you have

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.080 
good tactic is an elementalist you have
a<00:04:27.390> lot<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.600> abilities<00:04:28.200> that<00:04:28.350> can<00:04:28.730> slow<00:04:29.730> people

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
a lot of abilities that can slow people

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.150 
a lot of abilities that can slow people
down<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.690> get<00:04:30.990> you<00:04:31.140> out<00:04:31.170> of<00:04:31.260> combat<00:04:31.560> so<00:04:32.010> it's

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
down and get you out of combat so it's

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.520 
down and get you out of combat so it's
definitely<00:04:32.490> not<00:04:32.700> a<00:04:32.970> bad<00:04:33.270> idea<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.720> back<00:04:34.080> off<00:04:34.320> to

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
definitely not a bad idea to back off to

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.230 
definitely not a bad idea to back off to
regen<00:04:34.920> if<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.250> really<00:04:35.670> do<00:04:35.820> need<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.060> I

regen if you really do need to I

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.300 
regen if you really do need to I
probably<00:04:36.540> would<00:04:36.780> have<00:04:36.840> died<00:04:37.160> pretty<00:04:38.160> quickly

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310

is<00:05:07.470> a<00:05:07.620> I've<00:05:08.280> really<00:05:08.640> got<00:05:08.790> had<00:05:08.940> much<00:05:09.150> time<00:05:09.390> to<00:05:09.450> do

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
is a I've really got had much time to do

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.530 
is a I've really got had much time to do
much<00:05:10.020> structured<00:05:10.560> pvp<00:05:11.000> so<00:05:12.000> these<00:05:12.210> players

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
much structured pvp so these players

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.820 
much structured pvp so these players
probably<00:05:12.780> aren't<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.460> top<00:05:14.460> notch<00:05:15.650> but<00:05:16.650> it's

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
probably aren't the top notch but it's

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.470 
probably aren't the top notch but it's
definitely<00:05:17.040> a<00:05:17.220> work<00:05:17.370> in<00:05:17.550> progress<00:05:17.760> eventually

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
definitely a work in progress eventually

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.940 
definitely a work in progress eventually
I'll<00:05:18.570> be<00:05:18.720> up<00:05:18.870> in<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.740> higher<00:05:19.980> ranks<00:05:20.310> higher

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
I'll be up in the higher ranks higher

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.270 
I'll be up in the higher ranks higher
levels<00:05:22.950> of<00:05:23.100> glory<00:05:23.520> whatnot<00:05:24.920> but<00:05:25.920> I<00:05:25.980> mean<00:05:26.160> it's

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
levels of glory whatnot but I mean it's

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.980 
levels of glory whatnot but I mean it's
still<00:05:26.340> definitely<00:05:26.700> a<00:05:27.000> good<00:05:27.420> start<00:05:27.570> for<00:05:27.900> an

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
still definitely a good start for an

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.520 
still definitely a good start for an
elementalist<00:05:28.500> i<00:05:28.770> would<00:05:29.370> consider<00:05:29.580> them<00:05:30.530> one

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
elementalist i would consider them one

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.640 
elementalist i would consider them one
of<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.740> weaker<00:05:32.130> classes<00:05:32.610> for<00:05:32.790> structured<00:05:33.180> pvp

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
of the weaker classes for structured pvp

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.890 
of the weaker classes for structured pvp
just<00:05:34.650> because<00:05:35.010> they<00:05:35.270> they<00:05:36.270> really<00:05:36.510> don't<00:05:36.720> have

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
just because they they really don't have

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.080 
just because they they really don't have
all<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.140> much<00:05:37.320> to<00:05:37.580> mitigate<00:05:38.580> burst<00:05:38.850> damage

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
all that much to mitigate burst damage

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.960 
all that much to mitigate burst damage
and<00:05:39.480> everyone<00:05:39.930> knows<00:05:40.140> just<00:05:40.740> burst<00:05:41.070> damage<00:05:41.370> so

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
and everyone knows just burst damage so

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.500 
and everyone knows just burst damage so
it's<00:05:42.690> very<00:05:42.900> challenging<00:05:43.230> to<00:05:43.740> find<00:05:43.770> a<00:05:44.220> build

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
it's very challenging to find a build

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.170 
it's very challenging to find a build
that<00:05:45.510> is<00:05:45.720> good<00:05:46.050> that<00:05:46.830> you<00:05:46.860> like<00:05:47.280> that<00:05:47.310> you<00:05:47.610> you

that<00:06:13.830> out<00:06:13.980> yet<00:06:14.630> dogs<00:06:15.630> but<00:06:15.870> it's<00:06:15.990> a<00:06:16.080> pretty

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
that out yet dogs but it's a pretty

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.960 
that out yet dogs but it's a pretty
basic<00:06:16.590> why<00:06:17.160> i<00:06:17.760> mean<00:06:18.030> it's<00:06:18.210> its<00:06:18.870> basic<00:06:19.440> in<00:06:19.620> that

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
basic why i mean it's its basic in that

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.610 
basic why i mean it's its basic in that
it<00:06:21.620> the<00:06:22.620> idea<00:06:22.950> is<00:06:23.040> simple<00:06:24.020> but<00:06:25.020> it's<00:06:25.230> it's<00:06:25.530> a

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
it the idea is simple but it's it's a

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.160 
it the idea is simple but it's it's a
build<00:06:25.860> that<00:06:25.980> you<00:06:26.100> really<00:06:26.460> wouldn't<00:06:26.850> expect<00:06:27.570> to

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
build that you really wouldn't expect to

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.420 
build that you really wouldn't expect to
be<00:06:28.470> as<00:06:28.740> powerful<00:06:29.040> as<00:06:29.580> it<00:06:29.640> is<00:06:30.120> in<00:06:30.390> my<00:06:30.510> opinion

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
be as powerful as it is in my opinion

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.340 
be as powerful as it is in my opinion
just<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:32.610> fact<00:06:32.970> that<00:06:33.090> it's<00:06:33.330> so<00:06:33.570> survivable

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
just the fact that it's so survivable

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.310 
just the fact that it's so survivable
it's

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
it's

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.390

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 
match i think it showed off this build

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.770 
match i think it showed off this build
the<00:07:26.140> durability<00:07:26.800> of<00:07:26.830> the<00:07:27.220> build<00:07:27.460> the<00:07:27.820> killing

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780 
the durability of the build the killing

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.290 
the durability of the build the killing
potential<00:07:29.170> and<00:07:29.620> if<00:07:30.280> you<00:07:30.430> look<00:07:30.460> at<00:07:30.790> the<00:07:30.970> build

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
potential and if you look at the build

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.850 
potential and if you look at the build
in<00:07:31.450> the<00:07:31.480> description<00:07:32.050> you<00:07:32.170> will<00:07:32.260> see<00:07:32.560> that

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:32.860 
in the description you will see that

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.460 
in the description you will see that
it's<00:07:33.670> not<00:07:33.910> a<00:07:33.970> build<00:07:34.330> that<00:07:34.480> focuses<00:07:35.140> too<00:07:35.170> much

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:35.470 
it's not a build that focuses too much

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.550 
it's not a build that focuses too much
on<00:07:35.950> burst<00:07:36.250> damage<00:07:36.520> but<00:07:37.000> you<00:07:37.660> saw<00:07:37.870> some<00:07:38.200> pretty

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 
on burst damage but you saw some pretty

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.120
