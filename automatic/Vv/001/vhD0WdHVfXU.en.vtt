since I got a few pick dude just as well
clean<00:01:28.070> them<00:01:28.190> up<00:01:28.280> then<00:01:28.630> poke<00:01:29.630> them<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.840> guess<00:01:30.730> and

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
clean them up then poke them I guess and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.010 
clean them up then poke them I guess and
cool<00:01:31.970> come<00:01:32.120> out<00:01:32.270> on<00:01:32.360> one<00:01:32.390> who's<00:01:32.570> just<00:01:32.750> here<00:01:32.930> to

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
cool come out on one who's just here to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.220

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.480 

I<00:01:46.930> would<00:01:47.500> think<00:01:47.650> that<00:01:47.770> these<00:01:48.040> are<00:01:48.250> pretty

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
I would think that these are pretty

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.700 
I would think that these are pretty
similar<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:49.120> an<00:01:49.300> order<00:01:49.540> Pines<00:01:49.810> region<00:01:50.410> I<00:01:50.530> never

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
similar to an order Pines region I never

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.610 
similar to an order Pines region I never
really<00:01:50.890> picked<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.100> movie<00:01:51.250> this<00:01:51.640> before

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.380 

just<00:01:58.040> well<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.370> team<00:01:58.580> needs<00:01:58.850> an<00:01:59.060> order

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
just well the team needs an order

just well the team needs an order
implants<00:01:59.690> as<00:01:59.930> well<00:01:59.960> I<00:02:00.170> guess<00:02:00.790> I'm<00:02:01.790> just

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
implants as well I guess I'm just

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.000 
implants as well I guess I'm just
putting<00:02:02.330> in<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.870> separate<00:02:03.320> Bowl<00:02:03.500> than<00:02:03.710> Finnell
