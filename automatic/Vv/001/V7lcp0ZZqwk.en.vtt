 amendments per hour on modern devices 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.950
 such 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.210
 but actually if you look like 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.080
 you will see like thousands of years ago 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.090
 percent 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.340

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.740
 much deeper knowledge about our device 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.010
 of our body than even modern 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.320
 textbooks anatoly because except 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.450
 usually they prepared to 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.030
 energy centers that have 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.960

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.570
 n base for for example and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.339
 probably Tibetan medicine in psychology 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.100
 underlies medicine because 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.870
 the ancients knew that health depended 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.310
 our future 1 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.659
 the system really is 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.479
 that a person’s life begins when he 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.399
 asks himself a question that is what is the meaning of life 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.369
 why books 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.100
 but sit question anyway starting 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.959
 with the administration hope that 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.240
 special seminars 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.750
 I confirm the verdict 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.570
 health consists of four components 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.600
 physical and psychological 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.920

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.050
 550 wife of harmony in all these areas 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.940
 This may mean identification parts.

 meaning of life happiness finding 6 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.830
 this is the level of health he is 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.900
 thresholds something that in Sanskrit without when u 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.610
 we have no pain no suffering physics 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.060
 this is what we basically have to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.160
 build ours that our body hurts we don't 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.360
 we can illegal migrants 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.229
 second level is social 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.060
 this is the first turn it is that 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.389
 everyone should be in his place 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.549
 but each has its own purpose 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.969
 talent cards will have to 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.509
 align with that one 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:16.729
 if a person here for example 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:17.989
 introduce myself 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.959
 or in the case of stross kan station salute girl

 City Council I am a game programmer 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.989
 In general, this is not an easy victory for you 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.819
 hate work wages said 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.920
 first must return victory there 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.189
 this did not always work in the attack 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.109
 of this element of creativity but somehow 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.069
 money I do not know the euro you have not 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.200

 observers Viktor osipov when we do not 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.429
 I use my 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.729
 it is worth it to be he will face ours 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.719
 intended it starts well as 5 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.340
 percent 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.629
 will not vibrate from nature 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.499
 that is, if a person has 3 units of life in 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.499
 according to quantity 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.299
 Muscovites phone 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.299
 these words belong to the target 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.059
 such a promising question itself 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:02.009
 purpose 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.240
 is key 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.650
 maximum of its realization of its 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.509
 internal potential of the nation 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.739
 this is a very important point for five 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.809
 seconds in the world called power 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:14.969
 due to inconsistencies in recent years 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.359
 does not bring benefit to others 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.899
 can not be happy and successful 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:21.319
 develop spiritually and physically 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.589
 and of course I have such a harmony of speech 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:27.019
 it can not be 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.029
 election speaks to 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:31.669
 in the police that occurred in the field 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.060
 medicine tibetan chinese when 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.550
 yana talk than man further 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.540
 retreat from your harman your way 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.040
 the greater the fund the pain will hurt cymbalyuk 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.229
 will be miserable 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.119
 Here and in this way this you can see 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:44.829
 on all issues of contemporary culture 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.989
 where it is absolutely not appreciated this yes 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.389
 because in Afghanistan but we have 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.269
 privately, we have a grandmother doctor 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.389
 shopkeepers should be like this but I very often 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.099
 people standing now in front of the rest 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.659
 they are born another sample another 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.579
 place and when they break anything 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:03:59.849
 no good from this 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.090
 and there is no fact that people are not surprised 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.409
 why such a personal check is successful 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.370
 for example such a miserable disease 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.739
 at least a good part and so on 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.159
 but in this way one of the important system 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.689
 conditions of the social level that person 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.170
 must be cheese 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.310
 in its place let's say the creator 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.139
 the site 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.639
 unfortunately today is not enough 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.819
 such people who live the economy 200 thousand 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.240
 our life depends on the values ​​of which 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.659
 we stick to our ideals basis 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.259
 our behavior and lifestyle what we 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:31.969
 strive to earn as much as possible 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:33.650
 money by any means 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.520
 reach career heights by the way 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.550
 known somewhere then if 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:38.389
 respect 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.159
 however, with such a mood is difficult 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:41.740
 realize the more 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.900
 in the end, the union 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.419
 in order to determine your 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.599
 purpose 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.189
 we must first get rid of 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:49.349
 greed 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.339
 and from attachment which means that she 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:53.259
 will fall there where he gets paid more 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.110
 go where his heart is calling or 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.869
 when a person has karmic tasks 

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:58.999
 what are the problems of greece there men 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.729
 or frame become a woman loan for 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:01.400
 soap 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.520
 there is no direct example in the menu 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.469
 civilian 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:05.869
 he is simple is low 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:08.099
 vibrations i.e. your mission need to be 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.039
 ready if we can not and harmonious 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.120
 heart will tell 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.699
 first need to think a 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.669
 what do we like in general what is a check from 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.339
 project to do here if 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.389
 for example, even we would be money 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.270
 all 100 million people so you 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.930
 did for example then 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.620
 no need to earn from imagine that you 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.139
 did this one of such and certain 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.490
 frame open 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.930
 Krasnodar 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.090
 proper imperfection 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.719
 human being 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.879
 his ability to live constantly happiness and 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.900
 as far as possible in number 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.650
 these peasant wisdom we are today 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.320
 ending our conversations about secrets 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.759
 happiness was left without hormones
