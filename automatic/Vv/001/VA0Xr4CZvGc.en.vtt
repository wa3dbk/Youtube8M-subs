 A personal drawing video 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.780

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.490

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.160
 a friend named pilet he has a 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.430
 channel along with his wife and the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.769

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.960
 it's a lot of fun and then you get it and you come to talk 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.369
 With me, he is a very old friend and he 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.949
 Come and tell me that I had a headset. 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.890

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.930
 even if it 's well outside it 's the laser is the black 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.540

 I said now it can be 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.420
 and then we decided to draw lots 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.070

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.440
 to participate in the truth is a video bug 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 very quick even just to warn you and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.000
