00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.930
 our babies the sheep 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:29.390
 let's see the ingredients and accessories 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:33.450

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.149
 different shaped cookie cutters 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.149
 of flowers and stars 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.039

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.239
 star shape of different sizes 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.239
 we cut the cheese 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.650
 we cut the ham forming some 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.050
 slightly rounded and different triangles 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.620
 measures that will be the faces of ours 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.620
 sheep 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.220
 cut the olives into slices 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.350
 some we cut in half and others in 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.350
 four parts 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.800
 we rent celery 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.429
 after we cooked the rice in water 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.209
 we change it with a bit of salt 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.209
 grated cheese 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.110
 now that we have all done 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.730
 elements we prepare the dish 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.310
 place a small mold in the middle a 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:35.260
 larger flower shape is to the side 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.260
 two more smaller we pour the rice 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:46.280
 we push it a little so that it takes it 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:52.730
 the form and when it is well behaved 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.590
 we remove the molds we put the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.980
 ham triangle in the center of the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.980
 rice 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.650
 place the pieces of olives more 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.800
 small on the ham to create the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.780
 eyes and bigger ones 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.780
 at the bottom to create the legs 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.180
 our sheep is ready we make the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.010
 same thing with the other two molds 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:32.320
 smaller we complete the dish with a 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.210
 meadow of celery slices with 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.130
