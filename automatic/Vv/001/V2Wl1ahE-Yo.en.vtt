so<00:02:24.950> what<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.160> initially<00:02:25.700> did<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.540> I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
so what I initially did is that I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.960 
so what I initially did is that I
started<00:02:27.050> giving<00:02:27.410> $10<00:02:27.890> credits<00:02:28.400> on<00:02:28.580> their<00:02:28.790> bill

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
started giving $10 credits on their bill

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.580 
started giving $10 credits on their bill
on<00:02:29.270> their<00:02:29.390> on<00:02:29.569> their<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:29.870> their<00:02:30.020> account<00:02:30.380> and

on their on their on their account and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.530 
on their on their on their account and
we<00:02:31.010> had<00:02:31.100> our<00:02:31.130> computer<00:02:31.640> management<00:02:32.000> system<00:02:32.420> up

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
we had our computer management system up

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.180 
we had our computer management system up
and<00:02:32.600> running<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.650> girls<00:02:33.890> would<00:02:34.040> just

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and running and so the girls would just

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.679 
and running and so the girls would just
know<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.550> when<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> referral<00:02:35.150> came<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:35.510> we'd

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
know that when a referral came in we'd

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.170 
know that when a referral came in we'd
ask<00:02:35.870> well<00:02:36.080> who<00:02:36.200> referred<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.590> in<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.790> then<00:02:37.970> we

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
ask well who referred you in and then we

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.580 
ask well who referred you in and then we
would<00:02:38.360> then<00:02:38.540> go<00:02:38.569> and<00:02:38.989> we<00:02:39.110> would<00:02:39.200> find<00:02:39.409> that

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
would then go and we would find that

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.880 
would then go and we would find that
client<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.220> type<00:02:40.459> in

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.230 
client and we type in
you<00:02:41.040> know<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> name<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.610> referral<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.120> we

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
you know the name of the referral and we

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.050 
you know the name of the referral and we

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.690 
thing happened
is<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:46.680> felt<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.220> referrals

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
is that we felt that the referrals

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.100 
is that we felt that the referrals
backed<00:02:48.030> off<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.660> people<00:02:48.959> were<00:02:49.080> very
