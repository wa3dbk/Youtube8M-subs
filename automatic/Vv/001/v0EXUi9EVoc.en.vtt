 Do not forget to evaluate when I rested. 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.730
 because this will help a lot. 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.170
 The people's channel is as follows. 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.760
 Talk about the map here is not my videos. 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.890
 I recently made a video for you. 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.680
 showing and making some comparisons, right? 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.110
 with note 2 with the current map at last we 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.879
 we have other new information about 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.950
 these changes is that I will move to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.480
 you now the images that you are 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.000
 background and it was a live stream 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.039
 recently transmitted Spanish 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.079
 The Brazilian live stream is going to be Friday 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.620
 I'll leave the link for you there later. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.870
 under the inscription in case you want 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.610
 From Friday at 5 o'clock click on the link 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.649
 that you will follow the transmission 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.390
 on the map, okay, come on. 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.609
 staff followed the aspects that I am not 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.979
 more technical now are some birds 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.860
 bizarre there the caps that I am not anymore 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.869
 goals are flat beings of stone the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.939
 towers the inhibitors of next them 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.400
 have different animations or explosion 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.650
 attack / defense animations are much more 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.630
 visible the life bar of structures 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.030
 for you to actually identify more 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.460
 easily how much you need to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.439
 beating this structure is including the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.750
 towers when they are destroyed now lets 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.939
 a void where they were in the house 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.740
 sense of depth within the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.600
 own map of your books is very 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.130
 cool the dragon noise when they 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.829
 die now leaves its shadow for 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.970
 for a few seconds and 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.229
 it were okay 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.329
 and besides, I'm going to move on now to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.130
 you other information is 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.590
 You can not be the base before 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.939
 of fifteen seconds because he said 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.460
 this will happen because some 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.899
 people who have a slower computer 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.729
 end up taking longer to restore 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.710
 and how many other people who have 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.360
 a faster tone are already in the middle of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.799
 diana then it'll be a way for you 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.049
 and balance it there 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.850
 the dragon has new attacks the first 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.710
 person who received the dragon attack will 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.229
 be pushed back from the attacks 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.239
 dragon will be in area an attack is a 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.400
 laser in another attack is a good failure 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.720
 that would be a fireball and both 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.030
 damage area 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.980
 You can not deviate from the English. 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.060
 but you can, if you deviate from these 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.650
 firewalls 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.170
 a curious fact is that they will create a 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.820
 topic in the Spanish forum for people 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.280
 decide what the names of the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.030
 jungle monsters that are very cool by 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.550
 so to say 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.160
 areas of the map are different from the areas 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.590
 of the baron in china are more damaged 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.080
 are more scratched are with less 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.150
 body than the rest of the map so 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.310
 also with the other sides advanced 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.200
 on both sides of the blue side and also the 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.900
 red side where it is part of the map 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.060
 next blue booth both down 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.770
 on top is a bit darker because the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.170
 darker because more damaged 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.600
 as the red part both down 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.630
 How much upstairs part of the red buffet is 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.890
 more florida is more colorful, are you going? 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.470
 to be able to actually identify now where 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.090
 You're exactly on the music map. 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.220
 theme within the game will also be 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.470
 altered did not put it in the moment anymore 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.150
 future be the super scorer Corn 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.640
 greater life bar for you to 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.890
 can actually see that it is more 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.690
 tank than normal boys 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.280
 the baron as well as the dragon also 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.410
 has new attacks 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.970
 the image the layout of victory and also 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.820
 defeat that appears when the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.160
 match will also be changed has not been 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.260
 still we do not have the pictures but it goes 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.660
 to be in the future as well and now some 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.190
 questions and answers that were also 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.470
 asked and were answered is 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.450
 starting with the most frequent 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.160
 common of everyone that is and I will need 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.930
 of a better pc to play 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.540
 no you wont regret the best pc 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.540
 is currently building more memory 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.489
 this new map but the roche game is 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.430
 working to make sure you have the 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.140
 same pc and rod a new map ok you do not 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.090
 need to make any kind of upgrade 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.100
 look for no part of your computer 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.739
 if your pc running league today it will 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.110
 also turn on the 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.060
 that they will implement this map not 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.950
 has a date still certain 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.720
 probably after the World Cup and if 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.549
 Get ready before the world cup 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.049
 even so it will not be implemented in the 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.209
 competitive scenario 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.220
 the bushes have changed not the males are 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.180
 different but the information is 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.209
 same 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.789
 the music will change yes the music goes 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.669
 change in the future they will change the map 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:26.490
 of x3 not the x3 map will stay the 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.960
 Even you'll be able to jump, I stopped. 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.050
 that you jumped with relief 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.410
 Yesterday, yes, the walls will continue 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.020
 exactly the tables on the current map and 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.449
 how many climate interactions are there about 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.880
 this so far forward of the times 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.460
 jungle will be changed not they will be 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.860
 exactly the same only the animations 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.470
 are going to be different but the time 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.840
 Neutral jungle monsters are born 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.000
 You're exactly the same 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.250
 while the new attacks of the monsters 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.620
 beat the dragon will be more difficult 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.110
 since it goes giving in area the baron owns 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.419
 two pitches to a poisonous attack 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.940
 the distance that a squirrel 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.669
 You attack by the back he will play 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.780
 behind the lessons of the red and 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.550
 blue will change 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.830
 I will not continue the same as they are 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.949
 currently we will be able to play the map 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.900
 when the new map was launched does not 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.610
 when the new pope was released he will 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.949
 be the only playable map 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.199
 the client interface will change the 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.360
 the in-game client interface will 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.550
 remain the same then these are the 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.590
 new information about the map is 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.630
 I hope you understood more 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.190
 Finally, we also had changes 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.930
 to search the canopy for a 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.810
 little more worked the fifth 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.610
 tfsi going lucia and also short of evil 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.139
 falls that even had a change of 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.120
 uniform're 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.889
 we also have six new icons for 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.080
 to invoke the pain of laws 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.669
 killer tank and finally it was not 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.680
 yet disclosed how do you go to 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.419
 get 200 you'll have to buy 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.680
 or if you're going to have to do some 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.419
 special thing 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.219
 we also have new sentinel schin 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.530
 referring to the world cup, which together 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.909
 with the ball as if it were the cup a lot 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.190
 I liked it a lot, I liked it a lot 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.710
 we had changes in the thumbnails 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.020
 of the champion's spells had merit and 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.729
 also from the champion and henceforth 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.240
 will make a special video showing 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.370
 just changes made in the military champion 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.110
 But people , I think this is it for now. 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.819
 It's for you to enjoy more 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.860
 news I will soon bring to you 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.509
 do not worry about it of course if 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.520
 Do you like to forget to evaluate by clicking? 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.319
 I liked the bottom to fry comments 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.940
 share sign up if you're not 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.430
 Enrolled yet I'll stop by 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.599
 here thank you very much until the next wave 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.599
 Arm went
