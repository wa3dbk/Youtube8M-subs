00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.630
 and I started playing at age 34 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.190
 I am from reynosa tamaulipas in fact not 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.480
 had my age at that time I started to 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.300
 play with a bigger brother who is 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.090
 two years older this and since then 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.100
 after playing I already have here in 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.100
 Guadalajara 5 years 14 years 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.810
 it came to me 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.970
 in fact, I was on the bench as 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.760
 ten matches in a row and I'm so anxious 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.960
 and desperate to get in and my family does not 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.160
 va has the opportunity to be in 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.190
 no matches of those that already 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.860
 raise then we play against tigress 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.449
 and at university level and there was the 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.750
 family present and went where I 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.750
 it touched to debut 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.820
 and I think that every time I go better than I have 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.890
 learned a lot but anyway I 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.960
 there is a lot to learn and I think I'm going 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.140
 on the right track I have to continue in that 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.570
 tuning in the same channel and then not 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.400
 to stay with the things that I have done but 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.400
 keep working to win 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.560
 at this moment we fight many 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.270
 things and if the situation is so difficult 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.520
 but one has to take the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.920
 responsibility and responsibility is 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.470
 equal for all then the moment 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.960
 it is in the whole field to do what I know 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.560
 regain confidence is not doing the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.890
 things 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.659
 what I have been doing and continue learning 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.610
 how do I have to continue working that 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.610
 is the base of 21 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.049
 I wish I believe that my biggest wish in 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.239
 this moment would be to get a title 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.239
 in the first division by me at all 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.480
 I think that the greatest aspiration of 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.880
 all players is in the selection there 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.670
 you can represent your country is a 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.520
 very big and good pride I think that 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.680
 also in playing a world cup I never 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.810
 I imagined that at such a young age 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.520
 gave the opportunity and the first the 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.740
 first world to be champion very many 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.130
 people 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.920
 but I say do not stay with that and then 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.900
 good are experiences that are going 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.760
 leaving but good also I had to play 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.130
 mean the sub-20 now follows the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.390
 process of the Olympians 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.250
 Central Americans and things are coming 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.870
 ahead and you have to keep working and 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.870
 keep improving day by day 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.660
 it depends on a combative one not to stay 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.220
 with that in that time we do not stay with 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.959
 the poster of the world do not stay with 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.550
 put it already says 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.920
 you have to keep working there are many 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.319
 things to learn I think that was 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.540
 It affects a lot to stay with the 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.019
 collective and well then they are things that 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.310
 they happen and good and to leave this past that 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.440
 that it is like a nice experience and 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.709
 to be able to repeat it if it is that in some 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.709
 future 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.080
 rent Gonzalez during the left 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.080
