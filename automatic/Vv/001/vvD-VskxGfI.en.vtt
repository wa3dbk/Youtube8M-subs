00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello dear viewers my name is 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.509
 Oleg and in this series we will go with you 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.269
 to the Skyrim Museum to go there 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.530
 move you have to click 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:19.230
 write a console in it as a space 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:20.580
 Kvass could have registered pressed enter and now 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.330
 you will see that we are fast with you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.449
 let's move 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.699
 such a shitty cave this cave and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.650
 there is actually a skyrim museum here 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.340
 Absolutely all the items that are collected 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.809
 is in this game all armor all weapons 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.969
 all the staffs of the book all the keys all the scrolls 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.520
 absolutely all all all items collected 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.980
 Here in this such a small look 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.800
 cave but what friends let's go for a run 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.660
 by looking at the expense you ask where everything 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.280
 items date and here like a museum he 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.210
 implies that under 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.539
 glass somewhere before 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.469
 there will be no items 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.050
 the developers did a little differently 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.329
 all items if here decomposed under 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.820
 glasses here I do not know kilometers probably 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.140
 everyone will be put in such here 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.260
 Dwemer boxes 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.080
 each box is signed mainly signed 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.450
 in English to each box 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.490
 corresponds to some particular kind 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.830
 weapon items like or 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.950
 any other things see here 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.740
 he began to be seen here with us 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.070
 are all the staff and the rod and which 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.200
 can be found throughout the game from 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.130
 skyrim museum you can take your 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.259
 inventory 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.210
 absolutely any thing that you 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.799
 like it but it will be considered 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.450
 cheating so I warned friends 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.350
 so mean the following boxes of us 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.340
 there are pebbles all the stones shower all 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.750
 all kinds of cards that you could 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.590
 find on the process of passing 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.649
 toys 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.360
 let's see what we have here here 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.200
 we live and not even transferred from to 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.689
 English language 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.229
 It looks like a chest. 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.159
 cups all kinds of flawless 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:06.259
 diamonds and emeralds rubies and sapphires 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.649
 decorative items glen mari head 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.150
 Apparently weight 4 and I do not know why friends this 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.830
 I must honestly never in the game 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.190
 saw the head of the boat the head broken 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.810
 iron mace pots 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.900
 I think that you will find here what you want. 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.280
 It will be interesting what you like 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.140
 the most interesting thing is attention 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.590
 for some reason they gave it to these three 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.209
 Herb points do not even know why for them 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.010
 select a separate table apparently they do not 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.480
 fall into none of the categories that 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.040
 here is that category here is very 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.599
 lot 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.750
 look here there is another such joke 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.549
 that is, if you get here and see 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.310
 that the game is frozen don't be afraid so it and 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.260
 there is where all weapons are written for example 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.110
 that is, it is absolutely assembled here 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.849
 all weapons from all drawers here when 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.769
 Iâ€™ll click now what happens 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.859
 hang i mean you will that toy 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.370
 hung up and on processes in the manager 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.680
 tasks, too, and so look click 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.630
 click to see that the game is hung but 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.170
 no less fraps continues to write therefore 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.299
 not everything is as bad as I would like to average 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.220
 5-7 seconds have to wait because there 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.349
 really a lot of things a lot 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.160
 wait for interesting things don't be afraid 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.440
 turn off 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.780
 don't restart well i'm the first time 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.810
 when I got here at first I thought that 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.700
 the toy just hung just 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.480
 just wait a little wait 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:35.269
 here and now you see that opened with 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.380
 the menu and here we have these descending 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.220
 the most expensive 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.750
 the top of the bottom of the cheapest 68 8000 damage 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.579
 daedric war hammer elimination 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.370
 can take it all see read 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.430
 very interesting here apparently all that 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.090
 concerns the daedra not only yes that's it i 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.090
 there saw bonita a battle hammer very 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.740
 beautiful it all looks you can watch 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.000
 can twist 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.760
 I honestly don't take anything from here. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.130
 I will because I am already on this principle 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.690
 series finished all cycles in general 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.000
 skyrim because i have a lot 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.520
 video and storyline fully traversed and 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.750
 many additional quests and 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.180
 almost all guilds passed except 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.930
 supporters of comrades I do not pass 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.600
 because there is a glitch related prospector 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.090
 so unfortunately without them we will be thieves 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.230
 passed the imperial legion passed all 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.900
 dark brotherhood all this you can 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.330
 look on the channel checks a lot a lot 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.240
 jobs and I think that we need Skyrim 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.010
 leave as they say alone though if 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.710
 there will be something interesting you can always 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.460
 come see so look here u 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.340
 us to narik such an interesting thing 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.570
 such a mask you can find it by 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.430
 the passage of a certain quest where 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.490
 need to collect all the same gloom and 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.740
 all sorts of masks i won't get you here 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.169
 to tell exactly because it is already 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.710
 Will go as a spoiler in general to the narik this 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.450
 worth it friends armor 72 with low 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.169
 health level gives you a chance to heal 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.419
 carrier and inflict damage to nearby enemies 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:12.290
 okay, then we have all the clothes, all 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:16.340
 uniform weapon 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:19.050
 point scrolls look at these ingredients 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.660
 there are drawers in which there will be 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:26.880
 upload 57 seconds they usually go 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.890
 The first here is the floor scrolls such here 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.910
 boxes so grinding stone can 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.940
 use all the books absolutely everything 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:40.290
 books that are in this game notes 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:43.229
 look even nameless face absolutely 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.270
 everything here is a huge amount if you 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.870
 something somewhere you don't know how to get or 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.169
 think that everything is collected is not 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.729
 all a lot of interesting things 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.250
 most 90 percent translated to 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.570
 Russian can read all the diaries with 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.080
 ron here 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:03.510
 there was a task where it was necessary to collect them 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.310
 so see friends very convenient but 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.810
 This is the most extreme case 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.430
 enjoy it that is so in 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.740
 introductory purposes, I'm telling you 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.139
 what is the skyrim museum 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.840
 all the spell volumes that are in the game 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:19.360
 also located next to the books can 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:24.740
 take so here with us tanning machine 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.180
 pentagram shower anvil means 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.280
 whetstone ie if you want 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.289
 take can take immediately ready and weapons 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.479
 and if you want to make your improve already 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.150
 what is there 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:38.030
 can use all these side 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.280
 Alchemical shower program tools 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:44.479
 the lab here you can cook yourself 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:47.389
 and navernie food workbench absolutely everything 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:50.360
 what an ordinary soldier needs in Skyrim and and 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.970
 only a fighter by me can mean too 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.009
 blacksmith 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.830
 melted another half 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:00.050
 and everything on this museum skyrim 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.560
 ends here nothing more 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.030
 No, but what I think already causes 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.250
 positive emotions mean now 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.860
 The question is how to go back to 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.620
 the game if I'm already tired of walking and 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.810
 look i took what i need i click 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.229
 again console and register here 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.990
 The following is also the same as 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.610
 write here as a space and now 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.909
 you need to specify the city in which we want 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.320
 move in english i want 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:32.060

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:40.699
 and moving to riverwood in this city i 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:42.830
 I can not continue to play will be nothing 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:44.419
 scared hit the skyrim museum 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.580
 nothing bad but it is considered 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:49.130
 cheating friends so these are the cases 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.139
