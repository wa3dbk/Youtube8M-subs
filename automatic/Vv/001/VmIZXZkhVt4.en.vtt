00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello friends without seeing my entretiempo 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.519
 name is andré iraquí and I am here with 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.690
 the htc one group from the cell phones more 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.309
 expected of the year 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.350
 then join me while we are 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.680
 So a little tour unpacking this 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.680
 mobile 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.140
 so then nothing is very normal 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.840
 here we are going to stop a long time 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.150
 because there are better things to see 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.789
 when we open we see immediately 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.070
 the jewel in the crown of htc its new 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.220
 cellular than with what hope to return to 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.780
 make a profitable company and a 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.330
 description of the existence of 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.980
 advantage program that is an incentive 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.900
 that has htc to adapt the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.110
 buyers and has some benefits like 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.390
 50 giant google drive and that if you 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.159
 Break the screen, do not delay the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.930
 screen once question will be if the 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.159
 google version was going to have this and then 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.049
 obviously if I'm sorry 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.369
 So here is this phone right now 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.180
 we go in a little bit in detail a lot 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:01.180
 look what's in the box 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.850
 stickers with cereals and other 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.200
 phone things because after the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.000
 phone comes completely peeled no 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.620
 have a mailing before they need 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.480
 some manual side cited nothing implied 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.820
 to remove them and 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.100
 the guarantee 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.710
 a song where part decals the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.310
 which I have two offers to the community 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.150
 for brand lovers 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.210
 a charger 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.400
 time they generate it since before 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.790
 be just a little bit extensive has its 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.990
 fans and pérez million twitter 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.440
 with more iva to the normal usb the usb cable and 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.440
 the headphones 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.469
 this year last year they were 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.600
 victims of the victim mass does not have 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.600
 presence but we continue after 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.980
 nothing special we will end up like 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.200
 dreams sounds is what comes next 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.479
 cellular now let's look 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.880
 above and the first thing that must be highlighted 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.340
 is that if it's big it 's pretty big 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.300
 for many people it's going to be too much 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.640
 great is how we see the big ones come back 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.260
 htc speakers is part of the reason 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.440
 why the saying is so big 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.120
 We will hear judgment is justified or not and 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.830
 then have the cell phone in your hand 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.480
 Immediate feels in my humble 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.700
 opinion as the best cell phone 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.040
 in manufacturing that I have had in my 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.840
 life far exceeds the iPhone exceeds 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.920
 the samsung offers from nokia 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.550
 etcetera aluminum is very very very very 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.370
 it's good before it 's very good 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.989
 brushed and curve so have it 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.200
 feel much better compared to the year 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.850
 passed then then after itself is perhaps 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.140
 in the family love 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.390
 making of doing here I have 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.160
 had in pressure and hands one of the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.530
 great questions we had about the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.910
 google cell version was if you go 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.790
 include some of the functionalities 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.040
 specials that 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.739
 that has the non- ruben version that is 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.629
 the normal htc version between them then 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.069
 the first was if he used both 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.170
 cameras that have phones that have 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.670
 you have two cameras to have some things 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.959
 very interesting avoids going to look if 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.489
 does not achieve no and the other was some 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.280
 Smart functionalities of 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.220
 phone that gives me great joy 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.109
 tell you whether or not they work 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.239
 in its entirety compared to what 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.209
 that htc offers in the version of del 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.889
 normal cell phone but if enough 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.480
 if the functionalities of the 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.129
 phone then for example the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.959
 phone like this is quiet and not for 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.879
 wake him up does not have to go here to 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.680
 annoying power button pick up is 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.810
 up it's hard to get to but 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.810
 that counted carlos times or malfunction 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.930
 it is not working well but if not well 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.849
 Well then we'll look at how that works 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.769
 but as they see it wakes up from a 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.960
 simple way too if yes yes no what 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.480
 move go of a something 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.850
 it's not just seeing notification but 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.270
 go to the bottom and finally if one does not 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.550
 lift and put it in in landscape and 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.740
 listen to the volume button of a va 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.230
 to the camera then it's very interesting 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.590
 and a lot of air see then that hpc yes yes 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.930
 included those those functionalities in the 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.190
 bread on the phone and since we're in 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.900
 the camera 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.760
 let's look at one of the other functionalities 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.010
 what is the possibility of using both 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.780
 cameras that are back here and if you can 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.790
 do what happens is that one has to 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.960
 to put edit 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.520
 choose if photo r no no art photos 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.320
 google standard 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.270
 I want it only once for 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.130
 show you guys then here we have 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.320
 the photo and here we have how you can see 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.990
 the different advantages of the camera 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.310
 among them on youtube there is a focus that 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.380
 is what allows us what allows 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.640
 do that is precisely the reason why 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.710
 which there are two cameras in the part 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.030
 back and is that the phone can 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.440
 detect depth called 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.420
 different as we see open we are 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.770
 focused here in the foreground but 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.000
 if I wanted to focus on the part of 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.610
 back I play it and I'm going to vote for the 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.240
 backward image 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.090
 it is a function not very exhausting 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.639
 but it is cool and another is this 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.580
 what is the 3d that allows one 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.439
 move in one and when moving cell it 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.659
 move an effect as well as 3d with 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.060
 they were able to see the photo is 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.830
 different perspectives then well if 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.199
 Several of the functionalities are included 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.389
 of the htc camera but for example not 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.550
 you have robert that is a tool 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.849
 for data to do moment diaz and 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.069
 covered topics but in general in general 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.990
 included several of the things that they see with 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:43.979
 the girls is normal then nothing 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.379
 this is the htc of one n 8 as as then 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.520
 as I tell you, they include many of the 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.039
 things that came with the version of 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.659
 google and then wait for an evaluation to 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.669
 depth of this cell next 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:56.529
 weeks the dotcom entity thanks as 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.129

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.129
