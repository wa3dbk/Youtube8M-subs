00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.760 

once<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.329> have<00:01:41.450> set<00:01:41.630> your<00:01:41.810> film<00:01:42.079> speed<00:01:42.140> the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.410 

you<00:01:55.250> need<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.550> use<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.730> combination<00:01:56.030> of

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
you need to use a combination of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.150 
you need to use a combination of
aperture<00:01:56.930> setting<00:01:57.230> and<00:01:57.410> shutter<00:01:57.710> speed<00:01:58.010> to

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
aperture setting and shutter speed to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.310 
aperture setting and shutter speed to
get<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.490> correct<00:01:58.790> exposure<00:01:59.110> they<00:02:00.110> work

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
get the correct exposure they work

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.500 
get the correct exposure they work
together<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.160> if<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.370> adjust<00:02:01.760> one<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.300> should

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
together so if you adjust one you should

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.360 
together so if you adjust one you should
check<00:02:02.810> your<00:02:02.960> light<00:02:03.170> meter<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.590> maybe<00:02:03.980> adjust

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
check your light meter and maybe adjust

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.650 
check your light meter and maybe adjust
