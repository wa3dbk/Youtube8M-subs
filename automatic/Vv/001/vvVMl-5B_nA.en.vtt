00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.139
 and then guys I'm here in daraya 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.910
 island is perennial and in this video I will show 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.969
 how to get that mascot that is the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.850
 messy lion tooth and mascot 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.820
 possible only 0.10 percent of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.640
 chance of dropping the so-called furniture 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.529
 sick nice then to find 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.539
 these furniture you need to come here in 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.650
 the area more accurately 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.920
 first perennial right here and around 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.660
 this tree is where the sick are. 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.180
 nice but these patients are 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.010
 friendly and there is only one way you use 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 attack by clicking on some hospitals 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.289
 purples that appear nearby 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.230
 tree them such as the one you are 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.539
 seeing and he always appears in these hills 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.100
 around the tree it's no use you 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.110
 look very far 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.059
 if you are a fan so that these 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.109
 I just got here and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.809
 wait 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.809
 so clicking on one of these ice 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.390
 patients will become hostile and they 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.360
 were the teams just for you only 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.220
 your character but only for one 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.439
 However, they will continue to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.450
 back up very quickly 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.939
 every time you kill another 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.740
 then you have practically one 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.920
 minute to kill the largest amount of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.409
 patients you are capable of and each 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.530
 they have the same chance to drop the pet 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.020
 so the more you kill the bigger the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.700
 your chances of getting the mascot and 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.159
 besides the chance to see the mascot you 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.950
 will also draw perennial coins between 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.930
 other common items of them are also worth 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.829
 you can only use 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.990
 these crystals once a day despite 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.750
 they have a response time between 10 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.610
 within 15 minutes you will not be able to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.509
 green if you have already clicked on a crystal 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.460
 on the same day and recommend a friend 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.770
 can heal you for you 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.820
 the grid will kill the largest amount of 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.350
 possible real estate but if you are 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.470
 alone and poorly equipped must 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.390
 Be careful with many of these furniture polis 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.020
 on you and they will give a lot 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 damage 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.330
 so in this case avoid getting too 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.700
 near the tree for those not one in 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.530
 Spanish already on top of you and then 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.840
 try to use all banks that 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.670
 you have your display here as well 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.500
 near the tree having this sanctuary 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.709
 if you can pick up the buffets 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.410
 heavenly things that help 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.690
 and here I drove the pet and in case you 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.100
 I wish vendelino law I will not give 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.530
 a friend of yours 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.450
 just open your list of pets 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.820
 look for a messy lion's tooth 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.340
 click the right button and select 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.290
 put in the cage and ready 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.900
 now the Fed is no longer tied and 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.730
 You can trade it and that's it. 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.030
