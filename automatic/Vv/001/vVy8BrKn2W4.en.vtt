about<00:00:47.670> half<00:00:48.670> a<00:00:48.850> million<00:00:49.030> placements<00:00:49.720> and<00:00:50.050> I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
about half a million placements and I

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.100 
about half a million placements and I
also<00:00:50.710> do<00:00:51.460> research<00:00:51.490> so<00:00:52.180> I<00:00:52.329> have<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.510> very<00:00:52.750> broad

there<00:02:14.210> made<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:14.630> transition<00:02:15.470> from<00:02:15.890> water<00:02:16.160> to

there made this transition from water to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.540 
there made this transition from water to
land<00:02:17.950> something<00:02:18.950> they<00:02:19.070> would<00:02:19.190> have<00:02:19.310> four

hundred and fifty million years ago

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.710

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and this was the most significant event

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.650 
and this was the most significant event

collecting these plants it's quite

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.420 
collecting these plants it's quite

lay them all out and just dry them what

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.120 
lay them all out and just dry them what

happens is when specimens arrive at the
