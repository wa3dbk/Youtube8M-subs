what's going on YouTube Josh here with

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.570 
what's going on YouTube Josh here with
another<00:00:07.500> episode<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.069> research<00:00:08.340> review

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
another episode of the research review

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.169 
another episode of the research review
series

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
series

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.180 
series
so<00:00:09.750> today's<00:00:10.290> article<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.740> gonna<00:00:10.830> be<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.160> a

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
so today's article is gonna be on a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.770 
so today's article is gonna be on a
pretty<00:00:11.460> interesting<00:00:11.639> topic<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.330> think<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.750> a

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
pretty interesting topic I think that a

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.450 
pretty interesting topic I think that a
lot<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.170> us<00:00:13.320> have<00:00:13.440> heard<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.710> lot<00:00:13.860> about<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
lot of us have heard a lot about the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.390 
lot of us have heard a lot about the
topic<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.179> anabolic<00:00:15.630> window<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.400> you

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
topic is the anabolic window and you

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.590 
topic is the anabolic window and you
know<00:00:17.520> if<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.760> guys<00:00:17.910> have<00:00:18.090> read<00:00:18.210> any<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
know if you guys have read any of the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.420 
know if you guys have read any of the
muscle<00:00:18.900> magazines<00:00:19.320> or<00:00:19.590> bodybuilding<00:00:20.100> calm

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
muscle magazines or bodybuilding calm

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.340 
muscle magazines or bodybuilding calm
and<00:00:20.730> things<00:00:20.880> like<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.900> years<00:00:22.109> they've

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
and things like that for years they've

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.540 
and things like that for years they've
been<00:00:22.470> preaching<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.100> need<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.340> have

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
been preaching that you need to have

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.460 
been preaching that you need to have
protein<00:00:23.850> within<00:00:24.359> 30<00:00:24.570> minutes<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.960> working<00:00:25.350> out

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
protein within 30 minutes of working out

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.310 
protein within 30 minutes of working out
or<00:00:25.680> your<00:00:25.830> games<00:00:26.070> let<00:00:26.279> go<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
or your games let go to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.589 
or your games let go to
that's<00:00:28.320> pretty<00:00:28.529> much<00:00:29.189> all<00:00:29.760> right<00:00:29.820> so

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
that's pretty much all right so

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.330 
that's pretty much all right so
I'm<00:00:31.170> gonna<00:00:31.380> show<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> guys<00:00:31.710> some<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
I'm gonna show you guys some of the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.250 
I'm gonna show you guys some of the
science<00:00:32.700> behind<00:00:32.820> how<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.809> complete

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
science behind how that is complete

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.420 
science behind how that is complete
bogus

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
bogus

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.130 
bogus
so<00:00:35.700> today's<00:00:36.030> article<00:00:36.360> comes<00:00:36.840> from<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
so today's article comes from the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.750 
so today's article comes from the
Journal<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.469> International<00:00:38.219> Society<00:00:38.460> of

Journal of International Society of

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
Journal of International Society of
Sports<00:00:39.120> Nutrition<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.320> actually<00:00:40.620> just

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
Sports Nutrition it was actually just

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.830 
Sports Nutrition it was actually just
published<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.340> December<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.760> 2013<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.600> title

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
published in December of 2013 the title

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.110 
published in December of 2013 the title
of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.960> article<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.530> called<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.700> effect<00:00:45.000> of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
of the article is called the effect of

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.540 
of the article is called the effect of
protein<00:00:45.480> timing<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.110> muscle<00:00:46.500> strength<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
protein timing on muscle strength and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.020 
protein timing on muscle strength and
hypertrophy<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.710> meta-analysis<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:50.550> this

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
hypertrophy a meta-analysis now this

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.869 
hypertrophy a meta-analysis now this
research<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:52.050> done<00:00:52.079> by<00:00:52.530> three<00:00:52.949> big<00:00:53.370> names<00:00:53.610> in

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
research was done by three big names in

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.850 
research was done by three big names in
the<00:00:53.969> game<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.079> was<00:00:55.170> done<00:00:55.320> by<00:00:55.500> Brad

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the game so it was done by Brad

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.459 
the game so it was done by Brad
Schoenfeld<00:00:56.489> Alan<00:00:57.090> Aragon<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.780> James<00:00:58.079> Krieger

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
Schoenfeld Alan Aragon and James Krieger

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
Schoenfeld Alan Aragon and James Krieger
so<00:00:59.039> let's<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.059> right<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> research

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
so let's get right to the research

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
so let's get right to the research
basically<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:03.090> know<00:01:03.210> up<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:03.750> there's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
basically you know up to now there's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 
basically you know up to now there's
been<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> quiet<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.769> mix<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.220> research<00:01:05.610> where

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
been the quiet a mix of research where

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
been the quiet a mix of research where
some<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.990> research<00:01:07.260> shows<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.590> protein

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
some of the research shows that protein

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.429 
some of the research shows that protein
timing<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.180> important<00:01:09.600> some<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.229> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
timing is really important some of it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.390 
timing is really important some of it
shows<00:01:10.619> no<00:01:10.830> effect

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
shows no effect

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.390 
shows no effect
so<00:01:11.880> essentially<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:13.140> these<00:01:13.799> guys<00:01:13.979> trying<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
so essentially what these guys trying to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.999 
so essentially what these guys trying to
do<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.790> compile<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.020> data<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.890> they

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
do is compile all the data that they

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.969 
do is compile all the data that they
currently<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.850> protein<00:01:18.360> timing<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.979> see

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
currently have on protein timing and see

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.530 
currently have on protein timing and see
what<00:01:20.580> happens<00:01:20.909> when<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.180> put<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.450> all

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
what happens when they put it all

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.570 
what happens when they put it all
together<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.680> all<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.070> these<00:01:23.189> studies

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
together what do all of these studies

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.580 
together what do all of these studies
really<00:01:23.820> show<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.140> inclusion<00:01:25.350> criteria

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
really show so the inclusion criteria

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.890 
really show so the inclusion criteria
that<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.340> use<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.820> select<00:01:26.970> studies<00:01:27.689> that

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that they use to select studies that

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
that they use to select studies that
they<00:01:28.020> were<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> look<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.670> essentially

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
they were going to look at essentially

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.480 
they were going to look at essentially
the<00:01:29.850> studies<00:01:30.270> had<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.490> randomized

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the studies had to be a randomized

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
the studies had to be a randomized
control<00:01:32.880> trial<00:01:33.180> or<00:01:33.479> randomized<00:01:34.020> crossover

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
control trial or randomized crossover

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.039 
control trial or randomized crossover
trial<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.460> involves<00:01:36.150> protein<00:01:36.329> timing<00:01:36.869> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
trial that involves protein timing and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.840 
trial that involves protein timing and
the<00:01:37.680> endpoint<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.130> they<00:01:38.310> measured<00:01:38.670> were

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the endpoint that they measured were

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.760 
the endpoint that they measured were
some<00:01:39.180> degree<00:01:39.450> some<00:01:39.750> measure<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.200> strength<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
some degree some measure of strength and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.830 
some degree some measure of strength and
some<00:01:41.340> measure<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.640> hypertrophy<00:01:42.390> what

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
some measure of hypertrophy what

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
some measure of hypertrophy what
essentially<00:01:43.439> they<00:01:43.770> required<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.579> each<00:01:44.670> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
essentially they required for each of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.300 
essentially they required for each of
these<00:01:44.939> studies<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.470> group<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.189> was

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
these studies is that the group that was

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.889 
these studies is that the group that was
receiving<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.820> protein<00:01:48.210> within<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> certain

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
period of time was receiving a minimum

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.740 
period of time was receiving a minimum

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
within one hour pre and/or post

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.719 
within one hour pre and/or post
resistance<00:01:57.570> exercise<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:59.310> control

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
resistance exercise and the control

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.149 
resistance exercise and the control
group<00:01:59.759> did<00:02:00.210> not<00:02:00.420> consume<00:02:00.899> protein<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.829> under

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
group did not consume protein in under

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.520 
group did not consume protein in under

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
two hours pre and/or post exercise all

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.260 
two hours pre and/or post exercise all
right<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.950> that's<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.399> time<00:02:05.579> frame<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:05.909> your

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
right so that's your time frame so your

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.779 
right so that's your time frame so your
treatment<00:02:06.840> group<00:02:06.990> got<00:02:07.259> protein<00:02:07.680> within<00:02:08.369> one

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
treatment group got protein within one

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.590 
treatment group got protein within one
hour<00:02:08.819> before<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.660> after<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:11.190> you

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
hour before and after and you

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.130 
hour before and after and you
a<00:02:11.630> control<00:02:12.560> group<00:02:12.590> did<00:02:13.370> not<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.730> any<00:02:13.880> protein

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
a control group did not have any protein

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.320 
a control group did not have any protein
within<00:02:15.140> two<00:02:15.380> hours<00:02:15.410> before<00:02:16.160> two<00:02:16.640> hours<00:02:16.670> after

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
within two hours before two hours after

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.120 
within two hours before two hours after
all<00:02:17.720> right<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.200> essentially<00:02:18.770> they<00:02:18.920> were<00:02:18.950> able

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
all right so essentially they were able

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.010 
all right so essentially they were able
to<00:02:19.280> find<00:02:19.550> 23<00:02:20.090> studies<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.600> fit<00:02:20.870> their

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
to find 23 studies that fit their

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.630 
to find 23 studies that fit their
criteria<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.680> had<00:02:21.860> enough<00:02:22.070> data<00:02:22.250> for<00:02:22.490> them

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
criteria that had enough data for them

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.880 
criteria that had enough data for them
to<00:02:22.910> pull<00:02:23.570> together<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.140> look<00:02:24.260> at<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.440> results

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
to pull together and look at the results

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.220 
to pull together and look at the results
now<00:02:25.580> I'm<00:02:25.880> not<00:02:26.060> gonna<00:02:26.210> have<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.840> guys<00:02:26.990> go

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
now I'm not gonna have you guys go

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.990 
now I'm not gonna have you guys go
through<00:02:27.470> all<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.830> studies<00:02:28.130> but<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:28.880> think

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
through all the studies but I just think

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.180 
through all the studies but I just think
it's<00:02:29.180> important<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.690> note<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.140> there<00:02:30.950> was

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
it's important to note that there was

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.920 
it's important to note that there was
quite<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.550> bit<00:02:31.820> of<00:02:31.850> variability<00:02:32.150> between<00:02:32.630> the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
quite a bit of variability between the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.110 
quite a bit of variability between the
studies<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:34.010> for<00:02:34.250> instance<00:02:34.580> some<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:34.940> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
studies so for instance some of the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.000 
studies so for instance some of the
studies<00:02:35.420> included<00:02:35.870> people<00:02:36.200> who<00:02:36.410> were<00:02:36.560> males

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
studies included people who were males

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.210 
studies included people who were males
some<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.880> were<00:02:38.000> only<00:02:38.210> females<00:02:38.960> many<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.130> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
some that were only females many of the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.040 
some that were only females many of the
studies<00:02:40.540> included<00:02:41.540> people<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.960> were

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
studies included people that were

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.590 
studies included people that were
untrained<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.610> know<00:02:43.730> had<00:02:44.240> not<00:02:44.450> been

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
untrained so you know had not been

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.910 
untrained so you know had not been
lifting<00:02:44.900> weights<00:02:44.930> before<00:02:45.230> we're<00:02:45.620> new<00:02:45.800> to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
lifting weights before we're new to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.860 
lifting weights before we're new to
resistance<00:02:46.370> exercise<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.240> that's<00:02:47.780> an

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
resistance exercise and that's an

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.210 
resistance exercise and that's an
important<00:02:48.200> note<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.470> I'll<00:02:48.530> discuss<00:02:48.890> later

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
important note that I'll discuss later

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.280 
important note that I'll discuss later
additionally<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.330> protein<00:02:51.050> that<00:02:51.080> they

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
additionally the protein that they

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.220 
additionally the protein that they
received<00:02:51.650> was<00:02:51.860> also<00:02:52.280> quite<00:02:53.090> different<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.080> it

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
received was also quite different so it

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.830 
received was also quite different so it
ranged<00:02:54.590> from<00:02:54.740> things<00:02:55.490> like<00:02:55.730> protein<00:02:56.360> powders

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
ranged from things like protein powders

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.900 
ranged from things like protein powders
to<00:02:57.490> chocolate<00:02:58.490> milk

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
to chocolate milk

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.420 
to chocolate milk
to<00:02:59.360> you<00:03:00.260> know<00:03:00.410> other<00:03:00.710> different<00:03:01.190> kinds<00:03:01.400> of

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
to you know other different kinds of

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.130 
to you know other different kinds of
protein<00:03:01.790> some<00:03:02.090> was<00:03:02.240> whey<00:03:02.390> protein<00:03:02.840> some<00:03:03.050> was

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
protein some was whey protein some was

protein some was whey protein some was
casein<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:04.130> key<00:03:04.310> here<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.700> they<00:03:05.060> all<00:03:05.210> had

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
casein the key here is that they all had

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.030 
casein the key here is that they all had
at<00:03:05.600> least<00:03:05.720> six<00:03:05.990> grams<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.500> essential<00:03:06.890> amino

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
at least six grams of essential amino

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.890 
at least six grams of essential amino
acids<00:03:07.520> so<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.820> was<00:03:07.970> kind<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.630> way<00:03:08.750> that

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
acids so that was kind of the way that

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.870 
acids so that was kind of the way that
they<00:03:09.080> were<00:03:09.680> able<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:10.100> sort<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.370> equalize<00:03:10.850> and

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
they were able to sort of equalize and

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.990 
they were able to sort of equalize and
look<00:03:11.510> at<00:03:11.600> this<00:03:11.750> all<00:03:11.900> together<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:12.950> what<00:03:13.910> are

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
look at this all together so what are

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.060 
look at this all together so what are
the<00:03:14.090> results<00:03:14.240> of<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.630> study<00:03:15.070> essentially

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
the results of the study essentially

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.220 
the results of the study essentially
they<00:03:16.160> were<00:03:16.190> able<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.520> do<00:03:16.670> some<00:03:16.850> fancy

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
they were able to do some fancy

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.900 
they were able to do some fancy
statistical<00:03:18.230> analysis<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:19.070> compile<00:03:19.670> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
statistical analysis to compile the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.640 
statistical analysis to compile the
results<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.450> find<00:03:20.840> some<00:03:21.020> meaningful<00:03:21.320> data

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
results and find some meaningful data

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.440 
results and find some meaningful data
from<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:22.010> essentially<00:03:22.910> once<00:03:23.210> they<00:03:23.330> were

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
from this essentially once they were

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.390 
from this essentially once they were
able<00:03:23.570> to<00:03:23.690> control<00:03:24.500> for<00:03:24.680> any<00:03:24.800> confounding

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
able to control for any confounding

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.160 
able to control for any confounding
variables<00:03:25.910> they<00:03:26.480> found<00:03:26.750> that<00:03:26.930> there<00:03:27.080> was

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
variables they found that there was

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.920 
variables they found that there was
absolutely<00:03:27.890> no<00:03:28.370> difference<00:03:28.910> between<00:03:29.570> the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
far as protein timing goes in this study

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.660 
far as protein timing goes in this study
all<00:03:34.370> right<00:03:34.580> so<00:03:35.270> that<00:03:35.570> is<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.840> say<00:03:35.870> that<00:03:36.670> there

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
all right so that is to say that there

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.030 
all right so that is to say that there
was<00:03:37.700> there's<00:03:38.600> no<00:03:38.780> difference<00:03:39.290> if<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.530> consume

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
was there's no difference if you consume

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.030 
was there's no difference if you consume
protein<00:03:40.480> within<00:03:41.480> an<00:03:41.840> hour<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.530> know<00:03:42.740> around

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
protein within an hour you know around

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.420 
protein within an hour you know around
your<00:03:43.250> workout<00:03:43.610> or<00:03:44.050> you<00:03:45.050> know<00:03:45.170> two<00:03:45.590> hours<00:03:45.620> it

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
your workout or you know two hours it

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.920 
your workout or you know two hours it
makes<00:03:46.610> no<00:03:46.790> difference<00:03:46.820> that's<00:03:47.360> essentially

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
makes no difference that's essentially

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.690 
makes no difference that's essentially
what<00:03:48.170> they're<00:03:48.290> saying<00:03:48.560> here<00:03:48.800> so<00:03:49.280> what<00:03:49.520> was

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
what they're saying here so what was

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.950 
what they're saying here so what was
interesting<00:03:49.910> was<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.480> fact<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:50.750> for

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
interesting was the fact that for

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.720 
interesting was the fact that for
hypertrophy<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.650> most<00:03:51.800> important<00:03:52.280> indicator

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
hypertrophy the most important indicator

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.330 
hypertrophy the most important indicator
of<00:03:52.970> success<00:03:53.600> causing<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.470> most<00:03:54.650> hypertrophy

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
of success causing the most hypertrophy

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.250 
of success causing the most hypertrophy
was<00:03:55.820> total<00:03:56.150> protein<00:03:56.480> intake<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:57.050> they

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
was total protein intake and they

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.230 
was total protein intake and they
actually<00:03:57.410> found<00:03:57.740> where<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.880> have<00:03:59.090> an

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
actually found where you have an

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.690 
actually found where you have an
increased<00:03:59.990> effect<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.890> greater<00:04:01.130> protein<00:04:01.610> you

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
increased effect the greater protein you

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.610 
increased effect the greater protein you
had<00:04:01.880> obviously<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:02.630> was<00:04:02.750> up<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.020> a<00:04:03.050> limit<00:04:03.320> and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
had obviously that was up to a limit and

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.990 
had obviously that was up to a limit and
they<00:04:03.950> didn't<00:04:04.130> really<00:04:04.280> discussed<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.790> top

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
they didn't really discussed that top

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.600 
they didn't really discussed that top
limit<00:04:05.240> but<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.930> seems<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.830> total

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
limit but it seems that the total

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.460 
limit but it seems that the total
protein<00:04:07.790> intake<00:04:07.940> was<00:04:08.450> more<00:04:09.020> important<00:04:09.410> for

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
protein intake was more important for

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.800 
protein intake was more important for
hypertrophy<00:04:10.280> because<00:04:11.000> actually<00:04:11.450> total

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
hypertrophy because actually total

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.310 
hypertrophy because actually total
protein<00:04:12.110> intake<00:04:12.200> was<00:04:12.920> not<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.940> key<00:04:14.630> factor<00:04:15.110> in

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
protein intake was not a key factor in

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.010 
protein intake was not a key factor in
determining<00:04:15.790> increases<00:04:16.790> in<00:04:16.940> strength<00:04:17.180> so

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
determining increases in strength so

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.200 
determining increases in strength so
what's<00:04:18.290> also<00:04:18.500> interesting<00:04:18.950> I<00:04:19.790> think<00:04:19.850> in<00:04:20.120> a

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.210 
what's also interesting I think in a

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.390 
what's also interesting I think in a
study<00:04:20.419> is<00:04:20.660> that<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.320> average<00:04:21.500> protein<00:04:22.160> intake

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
study is that the average protein intake

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.160 
study is that the average protein intake
in<00:04:22.640> the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
in the

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.750 
in the
in<00:04:23.350> groups<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.800> groups<00:04:24.010> that<00:04:24.070> were<00:04:24.250> receiving

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
in groups the groups that were receiving

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.630 
in groups the groups that were receiving
the<00:04:24.880> protein<00:04:25.860> supplementation<00:04:26.860> before<00:04:27.520> or

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
the protein supplementation before or

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.850 
the protein supplementation before or
after<00:04:27.880> workout<00:04:28.270> they<00:04:28.780> were<00:04:28.840> only<00:04:29.170> receiving<00:04:29.530> a

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
after workout they were only receiving a

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.520 
after workout they were only receiving a
daily<00:04:30.340> amount<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:30.940> around<00:04:31.270> one<00:04:31.690> point<00:04:31.870> six<00:04:32.320> six

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
daily amount of around one point six six

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.920 
daily amount of around one point six six
grams<00:04:32.980> per<00:04:33.250> kilogram<00:04:33.640> of<00:04:33.760> body<00:04:33.820> weight<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.840> to

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
grams per kilogram of body weight so to

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.960 
grams per kilogram of body weight so to
put<00:04:35.110> things<00:04:35.200> in<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.410> perspective<00:04:35.560> I<00:04:36.190> weigh

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
put things in a perspective I weigh

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.320 
put things in a perspective I weigh
around<00:04:37.120> 80<00:04:37.570> kilograms<00:04:37.960> so<00:04:38.800> for<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.520> guy<00:04:39.850> my<00:04:40.060> size

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
around 80 kilograms so for a guy my size

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.850 
around 80 kilograms so for a guy my size
80<00:04:41.170> kilograms<00:04:41.470> like<00:04:41.920> 170<00:04:42.730> 576<00:04:43.660> pounds<00:04:44.230> that

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
80 kilograms like 170 576 pounds that

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.530 
80 kilograms like 170 576 pounds that
would<00:04:44.950> only<00:04:45.040> be<00:04:45.160> around<00:04:45.430> 130<00:04:46.180> grams<00:04:46.390> of

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
would only be around 130 grams of

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.120 
would only be around 130 grams of
protein<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.200> I'm<00:04:47.530> sure<00:04:47.680> most<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:47.980> you<00:04:48.070> guys

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
protein and I'm sure most of you guys

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.650 
protein and I'm sure most of you guys
are<00:04:48.250> probably<00:04:48.400> consuming<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.120> lot<00:04:49.300> more<00:04:49.330> than

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
are probably consuming a lot more than

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.260 
are probably consuming a lot more than
that<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:50.580> what<00:04:51.580> do<00:04:51.640> we<00:04:51.700> take<00:04:51.910> from<00:04:51.970> these

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
that so what do we take from these

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.940 
that so what do we take from these
results<00:04:52.450> you<00:04:52.810> know<00:04:53.050> was<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:53.500> study<00:04:53.770> done

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
results you know was it study done

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.040 
results you know was it study done
perfectly<00:04:54.400> no<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.420> course<00:04:55.630> not<00:04:55.780> there's

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
perfectly no of course not there's

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.500 
perfectly no of course not there's
there's<00:04:56.320> flaws<00:04:56.590> in<00:04:56.800> every<00:04:56.950> study<00:04:57.400> so<00:04:58.030> what<00:04:58.420> are

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
there's flaws in every study so what are

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.090 
there's flaws in every study so what are
some<00:04:58.540> of<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.780> limitations<00:04:58.870> of<00:04:59.380> this<00:04:59.470> study<00:04:59.650> in

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
some of the limitations of this study in

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.850 
some of the limitations of this study in
particular<00:05:00.280> well<00:05:01.270> firstly<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:02.380> control

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
particular well firstly the control

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.300 
particular well firstly the control
groups<00:05:03.160> had<00:05:03.550> very<00:05:04.000> variable<00:05:04.630> timing<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:05.310> their

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
groups had very variable timing of their

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.250 
groups had very variable timing of their
protein<00:05:06.850> meals<00:05:07.180> or<00:05:07.450> whenever<00:05:07.690> they<00:05:07.930> received

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
protein meals or whenever they received

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.080 
protein meals or whenever they received
their<00:05:08.380> protein<00:05:08.770> right<00:05:09.370> so<00:05:09.610> in<00:05:09.790> this<00:05:09.910> study

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
their protein right so in this study

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.060 
their protein right so in this study
they<00:05:10.300> only<00:05:10.660> required<00:05:11.080> that<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.650> control

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
they only required that the control

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.340 
they only required that the control
groups<00:05:12.310> had<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:12.670> have<00:05:12.820> not<00:05:13.450> consumed<00:05:13.990> protein

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
groups had to have not consumed protein

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.290 
groups had to have not consumed protein
two<00:05:14.500> hours<00:05:14.740> before<00:05:15.130> and<00:05:15.250> after<00:05:15.550> but<00:05:16.030> there<00:05:16.180> was

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
two hours before and after but there was

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.690 
two hours before and after but there was
a<00:05:16.330> wide<00:05:16.600> range<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:17.650> could<00:05:17.860> you<00:05:18.550> know

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
a wide range so that could you know

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.960 
a wide range so that could you know
caused<00:05:19.450> some<00:05:19.990> variability<00:05:20.560> in<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.550> in<00:05:21.850> the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
caused some variability in the in the

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.000 
caused some variability in the in the
data<00:05:22.180> and<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:23.350> could<00:05:23.530> have<00:05:23.650> skewed<00:05:23.950> the

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
data and that could have skewed the

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.100 
data and that could have skewed the
results<00:05:24.070> potentially<00:05:24.910> secondly<00:05:25.540> in<00:05:25.960> the

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110

majority<00:05:26.560> of<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.710> studies<00:05:27.040> so<00:05:27.640> pretty<00:05:27.970> much

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
majority of the studies so pretty much

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.420 
majority of the studies so pretty much
like<00:05:28.270> 20<00:05:28.660> out<00:05:28.750> of<00:05:28.780> 23<00:05:29.230> of<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.410> studies<00:05:29.740> there

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
like 20 out of 23 of the studies there

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.920 
like 20 out of 23 of the studies there
were<00:05:30.780> untrained<00:05:31.830> participants<00:05:32.850> so<00:05:33.850> we<00:05:34.690> know

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
were untrained participants so we know

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.530 
were untrained participants so we know
that<00:05:35.070> you<00:05:36.070> know<00:05:36.190> trained<00:05:36.670> participants<00:05:37.390> and

that you know trained participants and

that you know trained participants and

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
untrained are actually quite different

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.260 
untrained are actually quite different
in<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.050> way<00:05:41.140> that<00:05:41.170> they<00:05:41.380> handle

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670 
hour is baloney what's important to note

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.880 
hour is baloney what's important to note
is<00:07:00.850> that<00:07:00.880> there<00:07:01.870> is<00:07:02.080> certainly<00:07:02.440> still<00:07:02.770> the

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
is that there is certainly still the

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.410 
is that there is certainly still the

anabolic window but that was not

addressed<00:07:06.130> in<00:07:06.490> this<00:07:06.640> study<00:07:06.880> so<00:07:07.180> keep<00:07:07.450> that<00:07:07.600> in

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
addressed in this study so keep that in

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.990 
addressed in this study so keep that in
mind<00:07:07.780> also<00:07:08.320> keep<00:07:08.800> in<00:07:08.950> mind<00:07:08.980> what's<00:07:09.580> important

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
mind also keep in mind what's important

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.400 
mind also keep in mind what's important
from<00:07:10.060> this<00:07:10.270> is<00:07:10.420> that<00:07:10.450> total<00:07:10.870> protein<00:07:11.050> intake

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.410 
from this is that total protein intake

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.160 
from this is that total protein intake
is<00:07:11.470> probably<00:07:11.950> the<00:07:12.070> most<00:07:12.190> important<00:07:12.730> so<00:07:13.300> if<00:07:13.750> you

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.170 
is probably the most important so if you

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.230 
is probably the most important so if you
workout<00:07:14.530> and<00:07:14.860> you<00:07:15.070> can't<00:07:15.460> have<00:07:15.760> any<00:07:15.790> protein

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
workout and you can't have any protein
