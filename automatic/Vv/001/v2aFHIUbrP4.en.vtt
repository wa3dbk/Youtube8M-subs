00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.640
 Good time of day today even though I 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.360
 because the review of new 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.360
 Riga 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:24.230
 it comes with such a box 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.290
 certainly not a gift but to 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.150
 transport player country 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.259
 manufacturer 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.829
 where I think enough 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.730
 immediately and throw out empty buy in 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.219
 let's see what we have inside 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.219
 boxes open the box and see 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.180
 sneakers beat 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.840
 he also 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.230
 beds is your player power adapter 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.200
 on one side, the whole white cat on the other 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.090
 Soviet plug 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.090
 but for Russian as you wish 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.049
 for and whisper kit 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.049
 standard headphones 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.260
 and above 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.660
 the study I checked and the worst thing 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.930
 have them you can use i would even 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.640
 would recommend using you here 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:31.320
 Of course not very much but not all the same 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:34.830
 and the player itself is packed in such a rustling 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.830
 teeming bag 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.799
 the conclusion is 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:47.610
 We do not know instruction mp4 player why 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:51.180
 written 3 wheeler manual 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.020
 I mean the instruction 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.720
 left instruction in English 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.990
 so familiar 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.580
 you can not look through skinte risk should 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.370
 back in the box I walk the box 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.970
 consider the player itself 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.970
 carved out of the bag 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:17.900
 makes player he has special 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:20.420
 memory card supports up to 16 gigabytes 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.920
 but I would not recommend installing on 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.630
 16 gigabyte 8 over who will 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.030
 to slow down the thought 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.650
 mean headphone input three with 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.650
 half millimeter mini jack connector 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.670
 yusb mini 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.670
 and also serves to charge 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.550
 also 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.420
 lever 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.420
 inclusion read 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:00.260
 which you will acquire here on the night of 6 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:05.920

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.920
 such a cut on the lace hang our 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.610
 there some buttons 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.730
 play pallada button works fine 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.060
 composition 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:26.150
 back composition forward loud less 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:30.220
 more beautiful flash player so when 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.220
 work on cheat than player 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.410

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.090
 installed when pair plays it flashes 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.280
 I would say this is not very interesting but 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.860
 It is not as bright as it can be seen on 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.440
 video is on the player and is not visible at all 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.500
 that is, the indicator just lights when your 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.880
