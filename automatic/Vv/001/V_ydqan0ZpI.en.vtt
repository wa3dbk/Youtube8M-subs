00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
right because pleading is actually it's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.560 
right because pleading is actually it's
extra<00:01:43.050> room<00:01:43.830> that's<00:01:44.130> been<00:01:44.310> added<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.940> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
extra room that's been added to the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.469 
extra room that's been added to the
fabric<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.250> whatever<00:01:47.549> your<00:01:47.790> sewing<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
fabric so whatever your sewing it to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.060 
fabric so whatever your sewing it to
needs<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:51.320> amount<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> space<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.710> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
needs to be the amount of space that is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.550 
needs to be the amount of space that is
going<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.759> after<00:01:54.330> it's<00:01:54.509> been<00:01:54.720> pleated<00:01:55.259> or

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.410 

without<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.890> pleat<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> basically<00:02:03.560> so

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
without the pleat in it basically so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.910 
without the pleat in it basically so
