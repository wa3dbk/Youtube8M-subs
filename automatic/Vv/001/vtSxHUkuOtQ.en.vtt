shocking<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:39.270> anyways<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.500> had<00:00:40.680> these

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
shocking but anyways you had these

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.790 
shocking but anyways you had these
massive<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.120> floating<00:00:42.660> air<00:00:43.140> vehicles

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
massive like floating air vehicles

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
massive like floating air vehicles
essentially<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.820> basically<00:00:45.239> aircraft

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
essentially like basically aircraft

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
essentially like basically aircraft
carriers<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.469> very<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:47.520> similar<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
carriers it very very similar to the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.569 
carriers it very very similar to the
things<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.079> Avengers<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.860> flying

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
things from the Avengers the flying

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.189 
things from the Avengers the flying
aircraft<00:00:50.820> carrier<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> kind<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:51.960> those

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
aircraft carrier is kind of like those

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.310 
aircraft carrier is kind of like those
would<00:00:52.860> fly<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> air<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.809> could<00:00:54.989> pilot

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
would fly in the air and you could pilot

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.180 
would fly in the air and you could pilot
them<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.949> commander<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.940> game<00:00:57.210> could

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
them the commander of the game could

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.580 
them the commander of the game could
direct<00:00:59.190> hit<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.030> Titan<00:01:00.420> closer<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.410> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
direct hit at the Titan closer like so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.319 
direct hit at the Titan closer like so
Titans<00:01:01.980> would<00:01:02.070> either<00:01:02.280> stay<00:01:02.730> where<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.300> were

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
Titans would either stay where they were

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.030 
Titans would either stay where they were
maybe<00:01:03.840> one<00:01:04.199> would<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.439> avoiding<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.920> other

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
maybe one would be avoiding the other

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.950 
maybe one would be avoiding the other
but<00:01:05.489> often<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.030> would<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.210> go<00:01:06.540> towards

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
but often they would just go towards

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
but often they would just go towards
each<00:01:07.049> other<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> eventually<00:01:07.439> get<00:01:07.890> very<00:01:08.189> very

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
each other and eventually get very very

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.250 
each other and eventually get very very
close<00:01:08.630> there<00:01:09.630> was<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> point<00:01:09.960> where<00:01:10.170> they

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
close there was a point where they

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.300 
close there was a point where they
couldn't<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.619> any<00:01:10.740> closer<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.189> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
couldn't get any closer like you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.770 
couldn't get any closer like you
couldn't<00:01:11.580> add<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.060> two<00:01:12.180> Titans<00:01:12.479> couldn't

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
couldn't add the two Titans couldn't

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.469 
couldn't add the two Titans couldn't
ever<00:01:12.990> touch<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.820> sweet<00:01:15.210> thing<00:01:15.360> about

really<00:01:42.899> interesting<00:01:43.350> an<00:01:43.500> awesome<00:01:44.310> part<00:01:44.490> of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
really interesting an awesome part of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.819 
really interesting an awesome part of
titan<00:01:44.909> mode<00:01:45.090> was<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.350> missile<00:01:46.649> sales

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
titan mode was that the missile sales

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.319 
titan mode was that the missile sales
would<00:01:47.040> shoot<00:01:47.250> shoot<00:01:47.430> shoot<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> titans

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
would shoot shoot shoot and the titans

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.889 
would shoot shoot shoot and the titans
would<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:49.369> shield<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.610> eventually<00:01:51.540> so

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
would have a shield and eventually so

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.810 
would have a shield and eventually so
you<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> play<00:01:52.439> conquest<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.189> first<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
you have to play conquest at first and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.450 
you have to play conquest at first and
then<00:01:54.509> eventually<00:01:54.960> enough<00:01:55.770> missiles<00:01:56.159> will<00:01:56.280> hit

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
then eventually enough missiles will hit

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.160 
then eventually enough missiles will hit
the<00:01:56.579> enemy<00:01:56.700> Titan<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.390> were<00:01:57.540> doing<00:01:57.960> well

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the enemy Titan if you were doing well

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.139 
the enemy Titan if you were doing well
and<00:01:58.439> controlling<00:01:59.219> enough<00:01:59.369> points<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and controlling enough points that the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
and controlling enough points that the
shield<00:02:00.450> would<00:02:00.659> go<00:02:00.840> down<00:02:01.020> now<00:02:01.560> once<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.009> Titan

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
shield would go down now once the Titan

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.370 
shield would go down now once the Titan
shield<00:02:02.640> went<00:02:02.909> down<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.630> could<00:02:03.810> actually<00:02:03.960> go

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
shield went down you could actually go

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.479 
shield went down you could actually go
aboard<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.189> enemy<00:02:05.759> Titan<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:07.110> 2142<00:02:07.860> since

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
aboard the enemy Titan so in 2142 since

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.979 
aboard the enemy Titan so in 2142 since
it<00:02:08.580> was<00:02:08.670> futuristic<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.239> vehicles<00:02:09.599> had<00:02:09.780> like

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
it was futuristic the vehicles had like

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.440 
it was futuristic the vehicles had like
basically

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
basically

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.059 
basically
capsules<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.660> would<00:02:12.810> launch<00:02:13.260> upwards<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
capsules that would launch upwards and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.250 
capsules that would launch upwards and
would<00:02:14.610> launch<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.120> all<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.540> way<00:02:15.660> into<00:02:15.930> their

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
would launch you all the way into their

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.360 
would launch you all the way into their
like<00:02:16.500> hundreds<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.860> feet<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.220> air<00:02:17.250> and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
like hundreds of feet in the air and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.070 
like hundreds of feet in the air and
then<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.730> would<00:02:17.849> be<00:02:18.030> able<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.330> land<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
then you would be able to land on the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.449 
then you would be able to land on the
enemy<00:02:19.319> Titan<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.920> could<00:02:20.069> also<00:02:20.250> use

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
enemy Titan you could also use

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.960 
enemy Titan you could also use
helicopters<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.950> air<00:02:22.950> vehicles<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.670> land<00:02:23.879> on

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
helicopters and air vehicles to land on

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.640 
helicopters and air vehicles to land on
the<00:02:24.090> enemy<00:02:24.209> Titan<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> times

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
the enemy Titan and you if the times

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.839 
the enemy Titan and you if the times
were<00:02:25.800> close<00:02:26.010> enough<00:02:26.040> like<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.489> mentioned<00:02:26.670> you

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
were close enough like I mentioned you

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.250 
were close enough like I mentioned you
can<00:02:26.879> move<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.269> titans<00:02:27.599> you<00:02:27.930> could<00:02:28.110> actually

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
can move the titans you could actually

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.979 
can move the titans you could actually
launch<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.069> capsule<00:02:29.580> from<00:02:29.730> one<00:02:30.060> Titan<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.660> land

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
launch a capsule from one Titan and land

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.630 
launch a capsule from one Titan and land
on<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> other<00:02:31.379> so<00:02:31.650> you're<00:02:31.769> constantly<00:02:32.160> back

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
on the other so you're constantly back

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.160 
on the other so you're constantly back
and<00:02:32.670> forth<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.420> storming<00:02:33.870> each<00:02:33.959> other's

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
and forth like storming each other's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.869 
and forth like storming each other's
Titans<00:02:34.590> now<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.310> important<00:02:35.760> thing<00:02:35.849> about

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
Titans now the important thing about

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.910 
Titans now the important thing about
storming<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.660> enemy<00:02:36.870> Titan<00:02:37.049> was<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.799> would

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
storming the enemy Titan was you would

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.680 
storming the enemy Titan was you would
go<00:02:38.040> through<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.340> set<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.090> different<00:02:39.510> like

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
go through a set of different like

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390 
go through a set of different like
objectives<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.349> would<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.920> you

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
objectives like you would have to you

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.770 
objectives like you would have to you
get<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.790> enemy<00:02:41.910> Titan<00:02:42.150> you'd<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.599> to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
get on the enemy Titan you'd have to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.380 
get on the enemy Titan you'd have to
disable<00:02:43.380> these<00:02:43.709> like<00:02:44.640> keys<00:02:44.940> or<00:02:45.150> whatever

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
disable these like keys or whatever

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.210 
disable these like keys or whatever
would<00:02:45.569> be<00:02:45.810> then<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.590> unlock<00:02:46.890> a

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
would be then that would unlock a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.220 
would be then that would unlock a
secondary<00:02:47.970> bathroom<00:02:48.450> you'd<00:02:48.599> have<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.840> destroy

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
secondary bathroom you'd have to destroy

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.569 
secondary bathroom you'd have to destroy
the<00:02:49.380> shield<00:02:49.590> there<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.099> then<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> would

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
the shield there and then it would

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.699 
the shield there and then it would
eventually<00:02:50.730> unlock<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.420> Titan<00:02:51.780> core<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.380> if

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
eventually unlock the Titan core and if

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.160 
eventually unlock the Titan core and if
you<00:02:52.799> killed<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.400> enemy<00:02:53.549> Titan<00:02:53.970> core<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.900> won

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
you killed the enemy Titan core you won

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.259 
you killed the enemy Titan core you won
the<00:02:55.200> game<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:56.610> was<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:56.940> sweet<00:02:57.000> because

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
the game and it was so sweet because

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.759 
the game and it was so sweet because
once<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.780> killed<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.170> core<00:02:58.410> you'd<00:02:58.590> actually

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
once you killed the core you'd actually

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.369 
once you killed the core you'd actually
have<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.129> timer<00:02:59.849> and<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.239> could<00:03:00.390> actually<00:03:00.810> run

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
have a timer and you could actually run

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.199 
have a timer and you could actually run
off<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.829> Titan<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.220> jump<00:03:02.549> off<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.819> Titan<00:03:03.090> and

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
off the Titan and jump off the Titan and

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.449 
off the Titan and jump off the Titan and
get<00:03:03.420> out<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.440> were<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:04.980> really<00:03:05.220> good

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
get out and if you were like really good

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.309 
get out and if you were like really good
timing<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:06.150> had<00:03:06.269> enough<00:03:06.299> time<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.840> destroy

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
timing you had enough time to destroy

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.750 
timing you had enough time to destroy
the<00:03:07.470> core<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.709> run<00:03:08.010> out<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.310> Titan<00:03:08.640> and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the core and run out of the Titan and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.670 
the core and run out of the Titan and
land<00:03:09.239> back<00:03:09.420> on<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.720> ground<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.200> then<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
land back on the ground and then the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.949 
land back on the ground and then the
game<00:03:10.890> would<00:03:11.099> end<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:12.090> you'd<00:03:12.420> be<00:03:12.540> looking<00:03:12.720> up

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
game would end and you'd be looking up

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.569 
game would end and you'd be looking up
at<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.260> exploding<00:03:13.860> Titan<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.459> was

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
at the exploding Titan and it was

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.080 
at the exploding Titan and it was
absolutely<00:03:15.510> epic<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.139> so<00:03:16.829> naval<00:03:17.609> strike<00:03:17.880> is

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
absolutely epic and so naval strike is

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.879 
absolutely epic and so naval strike is
bringing<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:18.750> back<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.380> bringing<00:03:19.620> a

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
bringing this back it is bringing a

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.000 
bringing this back it is bringing a
reformed<00:03:20.579> titan<00:03:21.030> mode<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.739> obviously<00:03:22.739> we're

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
reformed titan mode so obviously we're

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.640 
reformed titan mode so obviously we're
gonna<00:03:23.100> have<00:03:23.340> titan<00:03:23.730> mode<00:03:23.880> with<00:03:24.420> two<00:03:24.660> aircraft

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
gonna have titan mode with two aircraft

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.370 
gonna have titan mode with two aircraft
carriers<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.370> whether<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.329> can<00:03:27.630> actually

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
carriers and whether you can actually

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.839 
carriers and whether you can actually
steer<00:03:28.680> them<00:03:28.889> like<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.160> old<00:03:29.280> tight<00:03:29.519> mode<00:03:29.700> i

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
steer them like the old tight mode i

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.759 
steer them like the old tight mode i
really<00:03:30.269> hope<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:30.720> but<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.620> would<00:03:31.739> be

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
really hope so but it would be

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.289 
really hope so but it would be
absolutely<00:03:32.130> incredible<00:03:32.609> if<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.790> could<00:03:33.090> and

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
absolutely incredible if you could and

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.900 
absolutely incredible if you could and
the<00:03:33.989> same<00:03:34.290> thing<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:35.010> probably<00:03:35.280> going<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.819> be

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
the same thing is probably going to be

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.990 
the same thing is probably going to be
in<00:03:36.209> effect<00:03:36.569> where<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:38.069> can<00:03:38.220> either<00:03:38.430> win<00:03:38.700> via

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
in effect where you can either win via

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.080 
in effect where you can either win via
conquest<00:03:39.690> or<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:41.160> can<00:03:41.340> storm<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.849> enemy

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
conquest or you can storm the enemy

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.360 
conquest or you can storm the enemy
Titan<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.660> just<00:03:43.109> if<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.500> blow<00:03:43.829> up<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.099> enemy

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
Titan and just if you blow up the enemy

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.129 
Titan and just if you blow up the enemy
aircraft<00:03:44.760> carry<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.209> would<00:03:45.359> win<00:03:45.599> from<00:03:45.900> that

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
aircraft carry you would win from that

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.170 
aircraft carry you would win from that
so<00:03:46.349> there's<00:03:46.530> basically<00:03:46.709> two<00:03:47.040> wind<00:03:47.669> conditions

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
so there's basically two wind conditions

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.659 
so there's basically two wind conditions
and<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:49.019> makes<00:03:49.230> titan<00:03:49.560> mode<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.010> fun<00:03:50.280> like<00:03:50.310> i

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
and it makes titan mode so fun like i

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.289 
and it makes titan mode so fun like i
played<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.510> much<00:03:51.630> 2142<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.799> definitely<00:03:53.790> by

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
played so much 2142 and definitely by

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.360 
played so much 2142 and definitely by
far<00:03:54.329> my<00:03:54.989> favorite<00:03:55.169> game<00:03:55.380> type<00:03:55.620> was<00:03:55.829> tight<00:03:56.130> mode

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
far my favorite game type was tight mode

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.520 
far my favorite game type was tight mode
just<00:03:56.609> being<00:03:56.940> able<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.239> storm<00:03:57.690> an<00:03:57.870> enemy

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
just being able to storm an enemy

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.220 
just being able to storm an enemy
schleich<00:03:58.919> giant<00:03:59.639> enemy<00:03:59.790> ship<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.540> was

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
schleich giant enemy ship it was

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.509 
schleich giant enemy ship it was
essentially<00:04:01.739> like<00:04:01.859> something<00:04:02.160> out<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.310> Star

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
essentially like something out of Star

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.729 
essentially like something out of Star
Wars<00:04:02.880> like<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.090> was<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.450> crazy<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.470> course

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
Wars like it was so crazy and of course

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.759 
Wars like it was so crazy and of course
having<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.579> be<00:04:05.819> in<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.870> titan<00:04:07.200> defending<00:04:07.680> it

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
having to be in the titan defending it

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.500 
having to be in the titan defending it
like<00:04:07.889> it<00:04:08.040> was<00:04:08.069> really<00:04:08.700> really<00:04:08.880> sweet<00:04:09.150> because

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
like it was really really sweet because

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.180 
like it was really really sweet because
there<00:04:09.630> was<00:04:09.720> two<00:04:09.930> different<00:04:10.109> styles<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.739> combat

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.839 
vehicles and it would be long distance
combat<00:04:22.590> but<00:04:22.919> if<00:04:23.039> you<00:04:23.190> were<00:04:23.310> sticking<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.760> the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
hacking or defending your Titan it would

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.439 
hacking or defending your Titan it would
be<00:04:27.169> extremely<00:04:27.860> cramped<00:04:28.460> close<00:04:28.880> quarters<00:04:29.300> like

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
be extremely cramped close quarters like

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.300 
be extremely cramped close quarters like
shotgun<00:04:30.020> gameplay<00:04:30.470> so<00:04:30.889> you<00:04:30.949> could<00:04:31.130> basically

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310
