00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.050 
phase two which is an Honors Program and
deals<00:02:11.500> with<00:02:11.770> advanced<00:02:12.340> techniques<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.910> stuff

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
deals with advanced techniques and stuff

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.510 
deals with advanced techniques and stuff
like<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.350> people<00:02:14.350> ask<00:02:14.590> me<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:15.010> teach<00:02:15.220> them

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520

and<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.600> started<00:02:16.870> teaching<00:02:17.530> and

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and so I just started teaching and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.000 
and so I just started teaching and
realized<00:02:18.880> how<00:02:19.240> satisfying<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.290> was<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.800> help

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
realized how satisfying it was to help

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.920 
realized how satisfying it was to help
somebody<00:02:22.440> pursue<00:02:23.440> their<00:02:23.680> career<00:02:24.040> goals<00:02:24.070> and

somebody pursue their career goals and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.690 
somebody pursue their career goals and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700

it's really quite a privilege to be
involved<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.420> someone's<00:02:28.900> life<00:02:29.850> intimately
