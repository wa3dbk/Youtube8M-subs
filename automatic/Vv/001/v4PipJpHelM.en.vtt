 and so here we are back for this new one 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.069
 frank's episode me what we will talk about 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:18.050
 there seem to be problems in the 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.900
 strange to say that today we could 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.310
 talk about something that always happens 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.369
 often in video games I would almost say 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.770
 with a frequency equal to how many times I 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.739
 I go to the bathroom so much today 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.860
 we'll talk about the bars all those mistakes 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.360
 of the video games that we find space 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.960
 we often find them always in 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.120
 any game especially 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.510
 in the first days of release of the 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.510
 video games 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.310
 hello to all guys as usual 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.620
 frankie and today I am right in this 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.080
 new episode of frank but this episode 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.170
 we'll talk about the bugs in all those errors 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.540
 that always take more aim in 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.550
 video games that we practically find 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.920
 always of themes now a game in which 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.930
 there is not even a force bug 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.950
 we will write write it in the comments if 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.220
 you have the courage 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.500
 look, then check already 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.870
 looking on google games that they don't have 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.150
 bugs, and yet not all of them remain 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.580
 been but in today's episode instead of 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.680
 adopt the classic style of the talk 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.270
 of the problem of the day I decided to 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.479
 go instead to draw up a real e 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.210
 own top undefined number of bugs 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.360
 which afflict video games but which ones 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.180
 but which are the best direct ones 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.950
 worst manger in video games but for 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.660
 do it i think they want us to do something 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.820
 of different in different clothing 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.560
 because there is look at me but one can 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.660
 submit an episode of frank remains 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.640
 so good that we usually do now 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.619
 we have a lot of fun with editing 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.180
 safely invest a bit of 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.180
 seconds sent a lot of change for me 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.409
 let's start with the first bug with the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.619
 largest and most beautiful first barber 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.590
 all ok many often when they have to do 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.849
 of the top ten lists tend 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.340
 starting with the ugliest one 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.500
 no don't do these things I want to know 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.239
 immediately which is the most important one is 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.540
 the juicier one I decided then to 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.580
 I really think that starting with the game 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.170
 have everyone more calm and above all 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.480
 game that they also appreciated very much 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.080
 what on server what i am 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.690
 speaking 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.340
 but from what you understand from the give 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.850
 I leave a few seconds to understand in 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.440
 strength stability to understand skyrim 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.420
 many of you definitely play us there 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.970
 had played they will know this 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.220
 game which is the most beautiful bug as it is 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.650
 that bayern said oh my god we do 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.620
 I'm fables and videos you have ever seen a 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.810
 soldier in the area because it was the game 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.019
 not knowing him well, I know he is there anyway 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.989
 they are soldiers from the barrels anyway 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.850
 whether they fight at your side 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.380
 here 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.260
 but so pure chance I never jumped in 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.070
 mind to make him fight gods 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.130
 giants 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.940
 no because so the case where you 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.220
 he could have done it and I only say 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.540
 something could have happened 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.540
 very similar to this 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:45.010
 faces of felix bon gaber or cabbage 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:47.200
 it's called and now we move on to another 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.730
 great title that surely has 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.439
 also this is a good deal 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.780
 success all this games for 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:55.689
 talk have had their success 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.849
 rightly more successful the more p 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.829
 no not good because if a game 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.609
 need not be successful 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.579
 steve bug 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:07.750
 the bug I'm about to introduce you I think 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:09.599
 are the most beautiful bikers ever seen up 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.549
 now not the face of the earth 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:17.739
 gentlemen you have present 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:19.690
 assassin's creed iii and if you don't have it 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.880
 present something dangerous but col 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.740
 funny guy from connor every now and then 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.780
 while killing the other e 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.520
 while trying to hide in the bushes 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.180
 and I've always wondered why 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.720
 people do not go in with a pitchfork known e 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:39.110
 I enjoy doing some stuff you have 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:05:02.130
 understood common connor yet with alfano 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:05:03.930
 but it must also be done with good well well 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.820
 now we're going to talk about a 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.970
 another big bar of another big one 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.980
 title indeed I must say that maybe here 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.140
 is just something I have to do to 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.070
 strength prepared for another change 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.340
 dress or another change from so obvious 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.060
 dredd shirts that is and that they see then 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.919
 let's miss it 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.810
 apart from the jokes the game of berlin 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.780
 instead of talking he lost euros maybe 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.240
 forefather of so many bugs have tried 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.220
 to try to make this bar people that 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.440
 they managed to do it but they are not 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.730
 you can tell it why not 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.490
 they've come back more 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.470
 once this bug is done it is said that 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.750
 something mysterious happens 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.210
 people start to get sick and 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.840
 even die of what I am vague 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.200
 speaking 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:55.290
 the bug of the gta iv swing of the pac 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.180
 more spectacular I would say because certain 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.710
 saints who really when I am 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.010
 went to watch videos on youtube 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:05.130
 yes I laughed it sounds strange but I laughed 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:09.260
 certain majestic flights things never seen before 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.260
 from now and all thanks to a swing 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.310
 and often when you can 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:28.450
 playing in multiplayer things are born 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.310
 that really are out of the ordinary 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.910
 ordinariness if I succeeded in this 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.950
 phrase 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.440
 let me know in a comment below 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.360
 which was in your opinion the bayern more 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.490
 sensational of all not only those 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.380
 I listed neither my video but also the 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.140
 others you know, so take your time 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.880
 that let me know why maybe 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.100
 I could make another similar bet 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.470
 telling other bugs or other curiosities 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.000
 always on the video world and this was it 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.160
 frank canteen video you liked that 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.080
 remember to leave you bomber like and 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:00.030
 we will meet again at a future video 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.030
 as always straight for straight
