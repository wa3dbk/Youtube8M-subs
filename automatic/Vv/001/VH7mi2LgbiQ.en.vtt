00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.120 
exactly going to explain how you get
custom<00:00:18.630> firmware<00:00:19.080> because<00:00:19.500> that's<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.859> little

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
custom firmware because that's a little

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.939 
custom firmware because that's a little
more<00:00:20.310> difficult<00:00:21.300> process<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.500> I'm<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.859> to

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
more difficult process that I'm going to

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.390 
more difficult process that I'm going to
explain<00:00:23.460> now<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.150> um

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.979 

basically<00:00:28.400> what<00:00:29.210> a<00:00:30.850> custom<00:00:31.850> firmware<00:00:32.419> is<00:00:32.780> is

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
basically what a custom firmware is is

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.070 
basically what a custom firmware is is
what<00:00:35.989> a<00:00:36.700> PSP<00:00:37.700> normally<00:00:38.090> comes<00:00:38.330> as<00:00:38.540> as<00:00:38.720> you<00:00:38.750> buy

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
what a PSP normally comes as as you buy

it<00:00:39.140> is<00:00:39.560> a<00:00:40.180> official<00:00:41.180> firmware<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:42.320> can

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
it is a official firmware and you can

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.640 
it is a official firmware and you can
see<00:00:42.710> your<00:00:42.890> official<00:00:43.280> firmware<00:00:43.629> by<00:00:44.629> you<00:00:45.170> going

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
see your official firmware by you going

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.110 
see your official firmware by you going
over<00:00:46.520> to<00:00:46.550> your<00:00:47.059> system<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:48.640> you<00:00:49.640> go<00:00:49.910> down<00:00:50.090> to

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
system settings you go into that and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.570 
system settings you go into that and
then<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:54.650> just<00:00:54.860> go<00:00:54.980> all<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.250> way<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.430> the

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
then you just go all the way to the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.280 
then you just go all the way to the
bottom<00:00:55.699> is<00:00:56.090> second<00:00:56.629> from<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.780> bottom<00:00:57.020> it's

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
bottom is second from the bottom it's

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.240 
bottom is second from the bottom it's
called<00:00:57.440> system<00:00:58.129> information<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:59.979> the<00:01:00.979> first

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
called system information and the first

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.829 
called system information and the first
thing<00:01:01.400> on<00:01:01.550> they<00:01:01.699> will<00:01:01.850> say<00:01:02.030> system<00:01:02.570> software

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
thing on they will say system software

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.380 
thing on they will say system software
and<00:01:03.409> that<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.710> your<00:01:04.040> firmware<00:01:04.580> that<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.120> have

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
and that is your firmware that you have

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.910 
and that is your firmware that you have
mine<00:01:06.229> currently<00:01:06.580> 3.9<00:01:07.580> oh<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.360> 33<00:01:08.960> dash<00:01:09.229> 3<00:01:09.710> and

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
mine currently 3.9 oh and 33 dash 3 and

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.670 
mine currently 3.9 oh and 33 dash 3 and
um<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:16.390> that<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.659> where<00:01:17.990> it<00:01:18.140> shows<00:01:18.409> your

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
um so that is where it shows your

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.360 
um so that is where it shows your
Christian<00:01:19.130> custom<00:01:20.770> firmware<00:01:21.770> or<00:01:21.799> your

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
Christian custom firmware or your

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
firmware if it's official and custom

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.940 
firmware if it's official and custom
firmware<00:01:26.510> what<00:01:26.690> it<00:01:26.780> does<00:01:26.990> for<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:27.409> is<00:01:27.440> you<00:01:27.770> can

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
firmware what it does for you is you can

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.330 
firmware what it does for you is you can
get<00:01:28.630> iso<00:01:29.630> games<00:01:29.869> off<00:01:30.260> of<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.710> internet<00:01:31.100> like

normal PTF file theme um so a PDF file
he<00:02:14.610> looks<00:02:15.610> like<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.910> original

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
he looks like this it's the original

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.320 
he looks like this it's the original
thing<00:02:19.570> in<00:02:19.750> its<00:02:20.170> not<00:02:20.410> these<00:02:20.620> exact<00:02:21.040> icons<00:02:21.550> but

more fun um I might make a video of how
to<00:05:28.190> get<00:05:28.970> it<00:05:29.180> but<00:05:30.190> it's<00:05:31.190> gonna<00:05:31.370> be<00:05:31.430> in<00:05:31.670> a<00:05:31.850> lot<00:05:32.240> of

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
to get it but it's gonna be in a lot of

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.400 
to get it but it's gonna be in a lot of
parts<00:05:32.720> cuz<00:05:32.960> it<00:05:33.140> takes<00:05:33.170> a<00:05:33.620> while<00:05:34.930> actually<00:05:35.930> do

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
parts cuz it takes a while actually do
