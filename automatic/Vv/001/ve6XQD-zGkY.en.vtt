as<00:02:57.700> well<00:02:58.060> as<00:02:58.240> on<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.510> back<00:02:58.720> and<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:01.450> shape<00:03:01.750> is

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
as well as on the back and the shape is

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.630 
as well as on the back and the shape is
very<00:03:02.280> unique<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.880> can<00:03:04.330> say<00:03:05.460> this<00:03:06.460> is<00:03:06.610> a

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
very unique I can say this is a

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.310 
very unique I can say this is a
prototype<00:03:07.570> version<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:09.780> that's<00:03:10.780> why<00:03:10.990> it

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
prototype version and that's why it

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.800 
prototype version and that's why it
didn't<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.770> a<00:03:11.800> remote<00:03:12.130> inside<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:13.480> retail

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
didn't have a remote inside the retail

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.470 
didn't have a remote inside the retail
version<00:03:14.050> we<00:03:14.410> have<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.650> will<00:03:15.460> have<00:03:15.670> an<00:03:15.790> IR<00:03:16.060> remote

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.930 

so<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.840> can<00:03:20.020> control<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.620> okay<00:03:21.280> see<00:03:21.880> you

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
so that you can control it okay see you

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.660 
so that you can control it okay see you
on<00:03:22.060> my<00:03:22.210> next<00:03:22.240> video<00:03:23.220> which<00:03:24.220> will<00:03:24.430> be<00:03:24.550> the
