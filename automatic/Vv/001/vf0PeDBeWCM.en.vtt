00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.509
 hello welcome to my last video 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.430
 want with the iphone 5s today though 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.040
 we just quilt it because it is 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.670
 is not still done on two videos 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.470
 which have actually become good say 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.869
 me now 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:23.119
 Now we're back with metal 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:28.070
 as in the beginning and measure nothing 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:49.280
 Use is easy scratching us 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:51.800
 Just spend money on it all 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.019
 aluminum is also starting to have been good 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.019
 able to see 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:59.410
 we can see that well 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.410
 ours again 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:23.100
 so 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.970
 has now been fully you realize that the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.689
 aluminum because there are many dents in there 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.479
 here at the apple logo too 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:40.920
 scratched so I want to buy 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:43.860
 no longer would be customer already 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.640
 pretty broken so I would too 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.619
 do not want to use my mobile phone at the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:02:00.479
 sides can recognize here 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:03.299
 because of the fair before very close 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.890
 you can destroy everything broken 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:11.819
 actually you can not do it anymore 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.440
 actually do and you can hear it too 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.890
 I do not know implemented at the camera 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:24.109
 that the parts are loose processor 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.109
 parts or whatever are all loose 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.730
