hey guys in this tutorial I show you how
to<00:00:06.529> hide<00:00:06.920> seams<00:00:07.430> using<00:00:08.240> the<00:00:08.360> new<00:00:08.600> patch<00:00:08.960> layer

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:09.379 
to hide seams using the new patch layer

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.170 
to hide seams using the new patch layer
in<00:00:09.650> anime<00:00:10.100> studio<00:00:10.129> 8

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.210 

the<00:00:15.180> patch<00:00:15.450> layer<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.139> probably<00:00:16.860> the<00:00:17.040> most

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the patch layer is probably the most

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.420 
the patch layer is probably the most
useful<00:00:17.610> addition<00:00:18.450> for<00:00:18.750> me<00:00:18.990> when<00:00:19.950> it<00:00:20.100> comes<00:00:20.310> to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
useful addition for me when it comes to

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.150 
useful addition for me when it comes to
anime<00:00:20.820> studio<00:00:21.060> version<00:00:21.570> 8<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.740> kind<00:00:23.070> of

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
anime studio version 8 this is kind of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.100 
anime studio version 8 this is kind of
funny<00:00:23.460> because<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:24.480> such<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.020> simple

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
funny because it's such a simple

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.400 
funny because it's such a simple
addition<00:00:25.890> yet<00:00:26.700> it's<00:00:27.300> probably<00:00:27.540> my<00:00:28.110> favorite

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
addition yet it's probably my favorite

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.710 
addition yet it's probably my favorite

seams that might be brought on between
two<00:00:40.140> objects<00:00:40.830> this<00:00:41.699> is<00:00:41.879> especially<00:00:42.390> true<00:00:42.720> if

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
two objects this is especially true if

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.010 
two objects this is especially true if
you<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:44.040> let's<00:00:44.400> say<00:00:44.640> different<00:00:44.970> parts<00:00:45.720> of<00:00:45.840> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
you have let's say different parts of a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.530 
you have let's say different parts of a
limb<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.250> demonstrate<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.940> I'll<00:00:48.149> zoom

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
limb and to demonstrate this I'll zoom

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.810 
limb and to demonstrate this I'll zoom
in<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:48.960> character<00:00:49.290> so<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.700> what

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
in on my character so you can see what

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.120 
in on my character so you can see what
I'm<00:00:50.910> talking<00:00:50.940> about<00:00:51.620> you'll<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.950> I<00:00:53.010> have

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
I'm talking about you'll see that I have

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.510 
I'm talking about you'll see that I have
an<00:00:53.579> arm<00:00:53.850> made<00:00:54.720> up<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.410> few<00:00:55.710> different<00:00:55.920> parts

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
an arm made up of a few different parts

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.880 
an arm made up of a few different parts
but<00:00:56.760> you'll<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.110> the<00:00:58.320> hand<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
but you'll see that with the hand and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.270 
but you'll see that with the hand and
with<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.640> elbow<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.710> seams<00:01:02.010> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
with the elbow I have the seams that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
with the elbow I have the seams that
close<00:01:02.550> off<00:01:02.820> those<00:01:03.120> objects<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.020> I<00:01:04.170> can

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
close off those objects so that I can

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.160 
close off those objects so that I can
fill<00:01:04.830> them<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.660> complete<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
fill them and so that I can complete the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.950 
fill them and so that I can complete the
object<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.910> past<00:01:09.149> what<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.600> could<00:01:09.780> do

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
object now in the past what I could do

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.010 
object now in the past what I could do
is<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> could<00:01:10.380> take<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.100> remove<00:01:12.030> point<00:01:12.360> tool<00:01:12.690> or

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
is I could take the remove point tool or

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.770 
is I could take the remove point tool or
the<00:01:13.170> hide<00:01:13.380> edge<00:01:13.649> tool<00:01:14.009> or<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:15.210> line<00:01:15.509> width

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the hide edge tool or the line width

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.990 
the hide edge tool or the line width
tool<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.440> slowly<00:01:16.800> just<00:01:17.190> try<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> whittle<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
tool and slowly just try to whittle that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.950 
tool and slowly just try to whittle that
down<00:01:18.260> but<00:01:19.260> with<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.830> patch<00:01:20.670> layer<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.750> now

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
down but with the patch layer we can now

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.390 
down but with the patch layer we can now
simply<00:01:22.590> put<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.979> patch<00:01:23.310> over<00:01:23.670> these<00:01:24.150> lines<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
simply put a patch over these lines and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.600 
simply put a patch over these lines and
that's<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:27.000> move<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:27.900> our<00:01:27.990> lives<00:01:28.610> so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that's it and move on with our lives so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.840 
that's it and move on with our lives so
let's<00:01:30.060> demonstrate<00:01:30.330> this<00:01:31.100> let's<00:01:32.100> put<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> patch

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
let's demonstrate this let's put a patch

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.100 
let's demonstrate this let's put a patch
over<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.900> hand<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:34.920> hide<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.460> seam

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
over the hand so that we hide this seam

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.990 
over the hand so that we hide this seam
the<00:01:37.110> first<00:01:37.409> thing<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.799> need<00:01:38.010> to<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.670> locate

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the first thing we need to do is locate

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.520 
the first thing we need to do is locate
the<00:01:39.330> hand<00:01:39.869> layer<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.890> our<00:01:41.610> layers<00:01:42.060> box<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the hand layer on our layers box so I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.039 
the hand layer on our layers box so I
have<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.189> right<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.270> let's<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.780> click

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
have it right here so let's just click

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.590 
have it right here so let's just click
that<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.710> yes<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that and yes as you can see it is a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.120 
that and yes as you can see it is a
switch<00:01:48.869> layer<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.530> does<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.860> matter

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
switch layer but that does not matter

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.330 
switch layer but that does not matter
now<00:01:51.020> let's<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> new<00:01:52.590> layer<00:01:52.860> button<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
now let's go to the new layer button and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.039 
now let's go to the new layer button and
choose<00:01:53.750> patch<00:01:55.939> what<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.090> will<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
choose patch what this will do is it

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.020 
choose patch what this will do is it
will<00:01:58.110> put<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> patch<00:01:58.710> above<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> hand<00:01:59.579> which

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
will put the patch above the hand which

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.230 
will put the patch above the hand which
is<00:02:00.060> what<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.570> want<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> next<00:02:02.189> step<00:02:02.400> is<00:02:02.610> we

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
is what we want now the next step is we

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.950 
is what we want now the next step is we
need<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.750> define<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.829> target<00:02:05.400> for<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.329> hand

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
need to define the target for this hand

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.100 
need to define the target for this hand
what<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.829> linked<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.540> where<00:02:09.540> do<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:09.810> want<00:02:10.019> to

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
what is it linked to where do we want to

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
what is it linked to where do we want to
hide<00:02:10.380> this<00:02:10.649> well<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:13.049> hand<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:13.620> connected<00:02:14.100> to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
hide this well the hand is connected to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.460 
hide this well the hand is connected to
this<00:02:14.579> portion<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.420> arm<00:02:15.660> which<00:02:16.049> I<00:02:16.200> have

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
this portion of the arm which I have

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.699 
this portion of the arm which I have
named<00:02:16.829> arm<00:02:17.160> bottom<00:02:17.880> one<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.350> see<00:02:19.530> on

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
named arm bottom one as you can see on

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.729 
named arm bottom one as you can see on
my<00:02:19.739> layers<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.120> that's<00:02:21.389> the<00:02:21.690> target<00:02:22.019> I<00:02:22.320> want<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
my layers so that's the target I want to

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.660 
my layers so that's the target I want to
choose<00:02:23.100> for<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.299> particular<00:02:24.780> patch

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
choose for this particular patch

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.070 
choose for this particular patch
and<00:02:27.670> once<00:02:28.629> I've<00:02:28.810> done<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.019> click<00:02:29.709> OK<00:02:31.080> now

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
and once I've done that click OK now

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.399 
and once I've done that click OK now
you'll<00:02:32.590> see<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.400> new<00:02:33.909> layer<00:02:34.659> has<00:02:34.930> appeared

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
you'll see that a new layer has appeared

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.860 
you'll see that a new layer has appeared
and<00:02:35.590> when<00:02:36.340> you're<00:02:36.489> on<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:36.849> layer<00:02:37.150> you'll

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
and when you're on this layer you'll

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.420 
and when you're on this layer you'll
have<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.440> circle<00:02:38.980> appear<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.709> patch

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
have a circle appear this is the patch

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.300 
have a circle appear this is the patch
that<00:02:42.970> we<00:02:43.090> just<00:02:43.269> created<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.680> what<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.129> do

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
that we just created so what we can do

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.440 
that we just created so what we can do
is<00:02:45.640> take<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:47.190> translate<00:02:48.190> layer<00:02:48.489> tool<00:02:49.090> and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
is take the translate layer tool and

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.869 
is take the translate layer tool and
move<00:02:50.379> this<00:02:50.620> around<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.220> move<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:51.670> over

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
move this around and move this over

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.270 
move this around and move this over
where<00:02:52.269> we<00:02:52.299> need<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.659> to<00:02:52.780> be<00:02:52.959> you'll<00:02:53.709> notice<00:02:54.040> as

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
where we need it to be you'll notice as

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.720 
where we need it to be you'll notice as
I<00:02:54.610> move<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:55.150> over<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.930> area<00:02:56.159> that<00:02:57.159> that<00:02:57.370> line

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
I move it over the area that that line

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.920 
I move it over the area that that line
that<00:02:58.269> separates<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.260> hand<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.010> arm

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
that separates the hand and the arm

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.860 
that separates the hand and the arm
disappear

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
disappear

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.990 
disappear
so<00:03:04.870> once<00:03:05.109> you<00:03:05.440> have<00:03:05.769> placed<00:03:06.430> it

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
so once you have placed it

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.809 
so once you have placed it
you<00:03:07.540> can<00:03:07.870> also<00:03:08.109> readjust<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.040> size<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.640> as

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
you can also readjust the size of it as

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.910 
you can also readjust the size of it as
well<00:03:10.060> as<00:03:10.329> you<00:03:10.690> can<00:03:10.930> see<00:03:11.109> right<00:03:11.319> now<00:03:11.349> it's<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.769> bit

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
well as you can see right now it's a bit

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.250 
well as you can see right now it's a bit
too<00:03:12.099> big<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:12.640> we<00:03:12.670> can<00:03:12.970> just<00:03:13.180> tweak<00:03:13.599> that<00:03:13.840> by

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
too big so we can just tweak that by

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.399 
too big so we can just tweak that by
taking<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:15.040> scale<00:03:15.340> layer<00:03:15.700> tool<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.420> just

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
taking the scale layer tool and just

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.559 
taking the scale layer tool and just
squishing<00:03:18.400> this<00:03:18.609> down<00:03:18.849> a<00:03:18.879> little<00:03:19.180> bit

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
squishing this down a little bit

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.099 
squishing this down a little bit
so<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:20.049> it<00:03:20.260> just<00:03:21.420> surrounds<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.540> wrist<00:03:22.780> and

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
so that it just surrounds the wrist and

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:24.569 
so that it just surrounds the wrist and
you<00:03:23.170> probably<00:03:23.769> want<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.069> just<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.340> little<00:03:24.430> bit

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
you probably want it just a little bit

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.809 
you probably want it just a little bit
bigger<00:03:24.790> than<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.269> actual<00:03:25.980> portion<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.430> that

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
bigger than the actual portion of that

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.879 
bigger than the actual portion of that
layer<00:03:28.120> just<00:03:28.569> so<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.840> make<00:03:29.260> sure<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.680> you

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
layer just so you make sure that you

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.610 
layer just so you make sure that you
cover<00:03:30.130> everything<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.900> once<00:03:32.079> you<00:03:32.200> have<00:03:32.410> that

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
cover everything but once you have that

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.089 
cover everything but once you have that
you<00:03:33.519> are<00:03:33.790> good<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.690> go

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
you are good to go

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.400 
you are good to go
the<00:03:36.099> final<00:03:36.430> step<00:03:36.760> would<00:03:37.120> be<00:03:37.180> of<00:03:37.630> course<00:03:37.959> to

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
the final step would be of course to

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
the final step would be of course to
link<00:03:38.859> this<00:03:39.160> patch<00:03:39.459> then<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:40.329> your<00:03:41.430> bone

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
link this patch then to your bone

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.720 
link this patch then to your bone
structure<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.419> I'll<00:03:43.840> just<00:03:44.019> take<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:45.340> bind

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
structure so I'll just take the bind

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
structure so I'll just take the bind
layer<00:03:46.379> option<00:03:47.379> here<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.389> connect<00:03:49.389> it<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.599> that

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
layer option here and connect it to that

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.420 
layer option here and connect it to that
bone<00:03:49.989> so<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.889> way<00:03:51.069> now<00:03:51.720> when<00:03:52.720> I<00:03:52.750> try<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.430> move

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
bone so that way now when I try to move

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.659 
bone so that way now when I try to move
this<00:03:54.669> character<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.299> test<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.780> out<00:03:56.489> by<00:03:57.489> taking

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
this character and test it out by taking

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.839 
this character and test it out by taking
my<00:03:57.940> manipulate<00:03:58.449> bones<00:03:58.750> tool<00:03:59.489> you<00:04:00.489> can<00:04:00.609> see

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
my manipulate bones tool you can see

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.890 
my manipulate bones tool you can see
that<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.239> works<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.840> that<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.590> patch<00:04:02.829> moves

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
that it works and that the patch moves

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.210 
that it works and that the patch moves
with<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:06.549> movement<00:04:06.959> basically<00:04:07.959> now<00:04:08.889> you'll

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
with the movement basically now you'll

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.610 
with the movement basically now you'll
want<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.639> do<00:04:09.849> this<00:04:10.030> for<00:04:10.359> other<00:04:10.510> portions<00:04:11.349> of

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
want to do this for other portions of

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.250 
want to do this for other portions of
your<00:04:11.799> character<00:04:12.220> they<00:04:12.459> have<00:04:12.489> those<00:04:13.000> scenes<00:04:13.359> so

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
your character they have those scenes so

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.560 
your character they have those scenes so
for<00:04:14.470> instance<00:04:14.829> my<00:04:15.040> arm<00:04:15.280> bottom<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.180> my<00:04:16.329> arm

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
for instance my arm bottom and my arm

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.879 
for instance my arm bottom and my arm
top<00:04:16.959> layers<00:04:17.799> are<00:04:18.669> clashing<00:04:19.329> here<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:20.410> I<00:04:20.680> will

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
top layers are clashing here so I will

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.920 
top layers are clashing here so I will
go<00:04:21.039> down<00:04:21.220> here<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.729> then<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.090> my<00:04:22.240> layers<00:04:22.539> and

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
go down here and then to my layers and

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.650 
go down here and then to my layers and
find<00:04:23.349> those<00:04:23.860> two<00:04:24.160> layers<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.940> as<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.510> can<00:04:25.599> see

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
find those two layers and as you can see

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.219 
find those two layers and as you can see
my<00:04:26.020> arm<00:04:26.260> bottom<00:04:26.740> is<00:04:27.210> over<00:04:28.210> my<00:04:28.360> arm<00:04:28.599> top<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.199> I

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
my arm bottom is over my arm top so I

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
behind the layer as well so again it's

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.750 
behind the layer as well so again it's
pretty<00:05:04.930> it's<00:05:05.350> pretty<00:05:05.620> simple<00:05:06.040> now<00:05:06.550> there's

pretty it's pretty simple now there's

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.570 
pretty it's pretty simple now there's
one<00:05:07.030> more<00:05:07.060> thing<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:07.600> can<00:05:07.870> do<00:05:08.380> just<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:09.340> show

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
accidentally link the torso and then you

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.730 
accidentally link the torso and then you
take<00:05:30.850> your<00:05:30.900> patch<00:05:31.900> layer<00:05:32.230> and<00:05:32.410> you<00:05:32.470> bring<00:05:32.650> it

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
take your patch layer and you bring it

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.380 
take your patch layer and you bring it
down<00:05:32.920> and<00:05:33.280> it's<00:05:33.520> not<00:05:33.610> working<00:05:33.940> and<00:05:34.240> you<00:05:34.360> can

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
down and it's not working and you can

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.840 
down and it's not working and you can
see<00:05:34.720> it's<00:05:34.840> not<00:05:35.020> working<00:05:35.310> well<00:05:36.310> you<00:05:36.340> need<00:05:36.670> to<00:05:36.760> go

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
see it's not working well you need to go

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.090 
see it's not working well you need to go
back<00:05:37.030> and<00:05:37.210> redefine<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.780> target<00:05:38.260> you<00:05:38.920> can

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
back and redefine the target you can

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.880 
back and redefine the target you can
easily<00:05:39.370> do<00:05:39.730> this<00:05:39.940> by<00:05:40.270> double<00:05:40.660> clicking<00:05:41.170> on<00:05:41.410> the

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
easily do this by double clicking on the

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.100 
easily do this by double clicking on the
patch<00:05:42.130> layer<00:05:44.400> choosing<00:05:45.400> patch<00:05:45.700> in<00:05:46.210> your<00:05:46.810> layer

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
patch layer choosing patch in your layer

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.060 
patch layer choosing patch in your layer
properties<00:05:47.800> in<00:05:48.930> redefining<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.350> target<00:05:50.860> in

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
properties in redefining the target in

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.310 
properties in redefining the target in
this<00:05:51.430> case<00:05:51.490> we<00:05:51.970> would<00:05:52.060> choose<00:05:52.360> the<00:05:52.690> leg<00:05:52.900> top

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
this case we would choose the leg top

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.930 
this case we would choose the leg top
one<00:05:53.880> target<00:05:54.880> and<00:05:55.180> click<00:05:55.960> OK<00:05:56.290> and<00:05:56.670> as<00:05:57.670> you<00:05:57.820> can

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
one target and click OK and as you can

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.480 
one target and click OK and as you can
see<00:05:58.210> it<00:05:58.750> now<00:05:58.990> works<00:06:01.200> so<00:06:02.200> anyway<00:06:02.500> to<00:06:03.190> wrap<00:06:03.310> this

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
see it now works so anyway to wrap this

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.790 
see it now works so anyway to wrap this
up<00:06:03.670> the<00:06:04.480> patch<00:06:04.690> layer<00:06:05.050> is<00:06:05.260> great<00:06:05.560> especially

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
up the patch layer is great especially

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.310 
up the patch layer is great especially
if<00:06:06.490> you're<00:06:06.670> doing<00:06:06.790> character<00:06:07.270> animation<00:06:07.900> it

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
if you're doing character animation it

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.140 
if you're doing character animation it
allows<00:06:08.590> you<00:06:08.830> to<00:06:08.980> easily<00:06:09.130> close<00:06:09.580> those<00:06:09.820> seams

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
allows you to easily close those seams

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.150 
allows you to easily close those seams
off<00:06:10.390> without<00:06:10.660> having<00:06:11.200> you<00:06:11.290> to<00:06:11.500> manually<00:06:11.830> go<00:06:12.130> in

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
off without having you to manually go in

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.570 
off without having you to manually go in
and<00:06:12.670> tweak<00:06:13.540> the<00:06:13.720> lines<00:06:13.930> and<00:06:14.320> that<00:06:14.380> still<00:06:15.370> might

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
and tweak the lines and that still might

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.000 
and tweak the lines and that still might
be<00:06:15.640> required<00:06:16.180> in<00:06:16.390> some<00:06:16.420> cases<00:06:17.140> this<00:06:17.410> isn't<00:06:17.860> a

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
be required in some cases this isn't a

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.210 
be required in some cases this isn't a
complete<00:06:18.640> fix<00:06:19.030> or<00:06:19.420> that<00:06:19.660> problem<00:06:19.990> but<00:06:20.860> it<00:06:20.980> does

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220 
complete fix or that problem but it does

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.580 
complete fix or that problem but it does
greatly<00:06:21.730> help<00:06:22.030> as<00:06:22.240> you<00:06:22.480> can<00:06:22.660> see<00:06:22.900> as<00:06:23.200> I<00:06:23.260> was

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
greatly help as you can see as I was

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.890 
greatly help as you can see as I was
manipulating<00:06:24.190> my<00:06:24.310> bones<00:06:24.550> earlier<00:06:25.000> and<00:06:25.780> I'll

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
manipulating my bones earlier and I'll

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.050 
manipulating my bones earlier and I'll
do<00:06:26.080> it<00:06:26.170> again<00:06:26.440> just<00:06:26.470> to<00:06:26.770> demonstrate

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
do it again just to demonstrate

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.340 
do it again just to demonstrate
especially<00:06:28.060> with<00:06:28.150> the<00:06:28.240> arm<00:06:28.390> that<00:06:29.050> it<00:06:29.140> does

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
especially with the arm that it does

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.900 
especially with the arm that it does
patch<00:06:29.680> it<00:06:29.860> up<00:06:29.980> really<00:06:30.160> well<00:06:30.250> and<00:06:30.430> the<00:06:30.760> arm

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
patch it up really well and the arm

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.830 
patch it up really well and the arm
seems<00:06:31.270> to<00:06:31.450> work<00:06:31.630> pretty<00:06:31.900> well<00:06:33.810> so<00:06:34.810> I

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
seems to work pretty well so I

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.600 
seems to work pretty well so I
definitely<00:06:35.110> recommend<00:06:35.710> you<00:06:36.070> check<00:06:36.280> out<00:06:36.430> this

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
definitely recommend you check out this

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.750 
definitely recommend you check out this
feature<00:06:36.850> if<00:06:37.210> you<00:06:37.390> have<00:06:37.600> the
