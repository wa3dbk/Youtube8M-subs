00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.670
 with the little bottles of good natural yogurt 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.340
 when they are already in a regime, they are going to 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.230
 have several little boats like this one or the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.930
 people who buy snow are going to have 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.630
 little pots of honey or any pot that 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.260
 you have good what I do with 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.040

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.530
 nails and every night except as 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.809
 twice a week but almost all 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.690
 nights the boat was full of fruits 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.979

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.190
 this boat because it is leaking this we 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.430

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.940
 as half, let's say how are the 11 of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.129

 half call it as they are the 1 and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.720
 mean in the morning and I drink my glass of 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.920
 water and I come to my house 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.259

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.110
 vain loading a boat with me from the 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.560
