00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.349
 if you are thinking of producing seedlings 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.449
 and ornamental plants 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.509
 therefore 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.689
 It's fruits, you're going to need two things. 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.070
 next year 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.820
 was a substrate 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.930
 substrate 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.990
 nothing is more than the substance that goes inside the bag 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.750
 the melting of the substrate 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.750
 seed germination is allowed 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.390
 let me know food 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.960
 during the formation of the fine 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 the kind of substrate we're going to teach you to do 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.770
 receives for the production of quick seedlings 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.670
 but if it's not true 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.110
 the most used container 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.560
 it's the polyethylene bag 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.160
 He already comes with the little holes down here. 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.720
 another container also used 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.120
 are they home 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.830
 or milk sachets in these for example 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.580
 it cost nothing 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.830
 the important 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.990
 they recognized the size of the bag 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.320
 especially at the time 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.320
 because the plants need to have enough space 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.860
 to develop its roots 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.700
 some plants such as passion fruit can not tolerate when their 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.070
 roots are folded 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.370
 so it frightens those who were small 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.390
 change will die 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.470
 are two of the ingredients that we will deliver 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.970
 up to 30/1 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.770
 because she will be the delegate 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.010
 the cattle dung 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.260
 that should be completed oriented there was confrontation 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290
 but why is it that about four years so we confirm 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.040
 the idea 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.670
 is to use a product 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.970
 example of contamination by microorganisms 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.270
 as is the case of the land of the ravine 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.980
 while the spirit 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.340
 remember all the important elements 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.389
 They told me constant pressure. 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:16.469
 the first step if you know the amount of substrate 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.509
 What will you need 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:19.889
 of this quantity 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.439
 this was the infusion 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.439
 the size of the century 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.629
 the number of seedlings 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.369
 What do you intend to produce? 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.929
 Let's take the following example. 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.499
 we are going to produce 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.849
 four hundred fines 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.869
 our serve 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.529
 11 centimeters of mouth 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.389
 the 20 centimeters in height 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.279
 doing all the accounts 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.339
 we'll need 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.759
 the substrate 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.459
 not a minute 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.079
 the correct ratio 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.359
 two parts 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.909
 and that about ravine was or nothing 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.009
 for each of the parties 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:02.009
 We care about the title. 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.689
 was also released 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.079
 the important entertainment 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.319
 house at least 30% more 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.639
 of seedlings 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.459
 in relation to the quantity you need 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.909
 to make it possible to select 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.479
 at planting time 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.530
 after you get the two ingredients 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.499
 in the quantities required 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.059
 let's mix 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:28.319
 Let's start filling the loot. 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.619
 but it was easier using an oil can 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:32.989
 open 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.989
 on both sides 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.779
 little earth will cause problems when 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.429
 because they covered here in the prose park 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.139
 prevent air from entering 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.719
 the formation of spaces without land 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.299
 should not be greater 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.930
 if everything went well 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.159
 When are you going to ask the other? 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.180
 upon check-out 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.840
 the author to 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.240
 should have graduated 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.860
 the importance of well-formed bribery 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.539
 was very important for the closure of the change to be implemented 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:37.020
 which they themselves define the roots 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.160
 It is good that you know that many plants that do not tolerate the discovery 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.710
 of laughing laughter 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.710
 as is the case with passion fruit 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.860
 obviously very important 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.289
 Cuca Pinho Godinho 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.360
 with plastic 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.210
 besides hindering 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.270
 with the development of roots 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.599
 but nature will take at least 50 years 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.009
 to solve this material
