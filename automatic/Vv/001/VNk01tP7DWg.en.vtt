so<00:00:09.660> you've<00:00:10.440> done<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.740> visual<00:00:11.040> field<00:00:11.250> test

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
so you've done the visual field test

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.280 
so you've done the visual field test
that<00:00:12.000> now<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.209> need<00:00:12.510> to<00:00:12.690> interpret<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.680 
that now you need to interpret the
results<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:14.580> want<00:00:14.760> to<00:00:14.940> know<00:00:15.090> whether<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
results you want to know whether the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.200

the<00:00:18.300> patient's<00:00:18.690> visual<00:00:18.990> field<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.590> whether

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the patient's visual field and whether

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.340 
the patient's visual field and whether
any<00:00:20.520> apparent<00:00:21.000> defect<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.630> something<00:00:22.199> that

any apparent defect is something that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.220 
any apparent defect is something that
requires<00:00:22.680> further<00:00:23.010> investigation<00:00:23.599> it<00:00:24.599> is
