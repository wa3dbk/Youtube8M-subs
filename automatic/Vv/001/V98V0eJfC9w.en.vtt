00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.250
 well we already know all the boom that there 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.929
 with what the company did but with 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.509
 the launch of the recent two 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.299
 new iphone phones the fight is and the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.609
 fight ship but we wonder if so 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.830
 how advanced they are in technology and in 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.710
 your software are in terms of the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.840
 resistance of the device as such that's why 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.269
 Accenture if you have prepared a 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.800
 report to see how it is exactly 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.780
 There is a man who is called the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.370
 technology killer who is a 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.140
 blogger who is responsible for recording in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.690
 slow motion endurance tests 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.600
 to new innovations in this case was 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.340
 the iphone 5 that pays attention to these 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.250
 tortures 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.410
 his name is richard ryan is a lover 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.960
 of adrenaline and although it sounds ironic 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.210
 also of the technology in these 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.840
 tests he used an iphone 5 that 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.940
 golden that did not do very well 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.810
 first free fall test on a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.690
 ground floor 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.580
 this did not happen the mobile did not resist what 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.850
 expected since it ended with several 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.280
 cracks second test free fall on 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.070
 the cement 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.170
 to the second test yes that survived the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.270
 look like the iphone 5 is better 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.479
 ready to fall on surfaces 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.479
 smooth 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.440
 third test dropped in the water 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.540
 although they clarify that the iphone5 s is not 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.329
 designed to be submerged in water 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.399
 it's about simulating a situation like 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.189
 for example that the user drops the 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.110
 mobile in the water and reacts quickly 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.310
 in this case rayÃ¡n let the mobile 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.869
 Married to the sun for 15 minutes 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.080
 it turned on it seems that everything works fine 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.289
 the fingerprint sensor works if everything 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.289
 it's okay 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 fourth test will trigger the mobile with a 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.540
 rifle on its front 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.299
 as expected the iphone not 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.100
 he survived but he remained standing 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.200
 once it received an impact like 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.880
 result you could look at the bowels 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.510
 of the iphone5 sa through the hole 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.840
 Last test shot in lateral form 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.720
 ryan fired back at iphone 5 s this 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.000
 instead of its frontal part but laterally 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.510
 iphone did not resist and was blown to pieces by 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.069
 the airs 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.950
 after seeing these amazing 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.590
 images we can recommend that 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.629
 do not perform these operations at home and 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.939
 who chooses to buy insurance against 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:38.340
 damage to your device for america 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.340
