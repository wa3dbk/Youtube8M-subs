that's<00:00:21.170> a<00:00:21.320> good<00:00:21.500> question<00:00:22.090> what<00:00:23.090> our<00:00:23.300> study

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
that's a good question what our study

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.400 
that's a good question what our study
does<00:00:23.930> is<00:00:24.500> an<00:00:25.010> exploration<00:00:25.930> it's<00:00:26.930> not<00:00:27.110> clear

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
does is an exploration it's not clear

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.800 
does is an exploration it's not clear
why<00:00:27.650> we're<00:00:27.890> seeing<00:00:28.130> it<00:00:28.280> seeing<00:00:29.120> a<00:00:29.270> reversal

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
why we're seeing it seeing a reversal

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.019 
why we're seeing it seeing a reversal
Ted<00:00:30.110> okay<00:00:30.230> that's<00:00:31.130> why<00:00:31.370> it's<00:00:31.520> a<00:00:31.610> question<00:00:31.940> we

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
Ted okay that's why it's a question we

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.730 
Ted okay that's why it's a question we
should<00:00:32.090> be<00:00:32.540> trying<00:00:32.990> to<00:00:33.080> engage<00:00:33.410> in<00:00:33.590> more

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
should be trying to engage in more

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.880 
should be trying to engage in more
studies<00:00:34.130> to<00:00:34.160> understand<00:00:34.730> better<00:00:35.590> what<00:00:36.590> we<00:00:36.710> are

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
studies to understand better what we are

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.110 
studies to understand better what we are
observing<00:00:37.760> is<00:00:38.690> that<00:00:39.290> if<00:00:39.559> you<00:00:39.739> look<00:00:40.070> at<00:00:40.340> the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
observing is that if you look at the

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.180 
observing is that if you look at the
Canadian<00:00:41.570> censuses<00:00:42.340> for<00:00:43.340> Ontario<00:00:43.820> for<00:00:44.270> Canada

Canadian censuses for Ontario for Canada

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.370 
Canadian censuses for Ontario for Canada
what<00:00:46.190> you're<00:00:46.340> observing<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.880> that<00:00:46.910> for<00:00:47.420> the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.130 

cohorts<00:00:51.380> that<00:00:51.850> are<00:00:52.850> born<00:00:53.500> prior<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:54.910> 1960

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
cohorts that are born prior to 1960

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.070 
cohorts that are born prior to 1960
there<00:00:57.140> are<00:00:57.290> more<00:00:57.500> men<00:00:57.970> graduating<00:00:58.970> or<00:00:59.239> have

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
there are more men graduating or have

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.619 
there are more men graduating or have
bachelor's<00:01:00.589> degrees<00:01:01.070> or<00:01:01.280> higher<00:01:01.460> than<00:01:02.390> women

bachelor's degrees or higher than women

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.730 
bachelor's degrees or higher than women
and<00:01:03.350> it<00:01:03.470> was<00:01:03.559> around<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.100> late<00:01:04.339> 1950s<00:01:05.150> 1960s

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
and it was around the late 1950s 1960s

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.600 
and it was around the late 1950s 1960s
where<00:01:06.740> we<00:01:06.890> start<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.280> see<00:01:07.490> that<00:01:07.730> gap<00:01:07.970> emerging

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
where we start to see that gap emerging

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.970 
where we start to see that gap emerging
gap<00:01:10.610> started<00:01:11.060> slowly<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:11.750> we're<00:01:12.230> now<00:01:12.409> if<00:01:12.800> you

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
gap started slowly and we're now if you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.710 
gap started slowly and we're now if you
look<00:01:13.159> at<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.370> Ontario<00:01:13.520> data<00:01:14.090> we're<00:01:14.480> at<00:01:14.600> about

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
look at the Ontario data we're at about

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.770 
look at the Ontario data we're at about
a<00:01:14.900> 10<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.560> 11<00:01:15.860> percentage<00:01:16.280> point<00:01:16.670> gap<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:17.450> terms

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
a 10 to 11 percentage point gap in terms

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.890 
a 10 to 11 percentage point gap in terms
of<00:01:17.990> university<00:01:18.530> participation<00:01:19.310> rates<00:01:19.520> if<00:01:20.420> you

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
of university participation rates if you

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.520 
of university participation rates if you
look<00:01:21.080> at<00:01:21.260> any<00:01:21.560> post-secondary<00:01:22.420> degree

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
look at any post-secondary degree

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.260 
look at any post-secondary degree
certificate<00:01:24.530> any<00:01:24.920> type<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.730> education

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
certificate any type of education

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.500 
certificate any type of education
outside<00:01:26.840> or<00:01:27.230> beyond<00:01:27.800> high<00:01:28.160> school<00:01:28.550> that<00:01:29.240> gap

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
outside or beyond high school that gap

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.900 
outside or beyond high school that gap
actually<00:01:29.750> started<00:01:31.240> more<00:01:32.240> with<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.910> Canadians

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
actually started more with the Canadians

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.520 
actually started more with the Canadians
who<00:01:35.180> were<00:01:35.360> born<00:01:35.690> after<00:01:36.280> 1940<00:01:38.230> so<00:01:39.230> we<00:01:39.410> are

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
who were born after 1940 so we are

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.880 
who were born after 1940 so we are
seeing<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:39.980> graph<00:01:40.250> gap<00:01:40.730> it's<00:01:41.540> growing<00:01:41.930> why

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
seeing this graph gap it's growing why

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.680 
seeing this graph gap it's growing why
is<00:01:42.950> it<00:01:43.250> happening<00:01:43.430> we're<00:01:43.820> not<00:01:43.940> really<00:01:44.210> sure<00:01:44.420> I

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
is it happening we're not really sure I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.540 
is it happening we're not really sure I
mean<00:01:45.020> what<00:01:45.200> we're<00:01:45.350> observing<00:01:45.680> in<00:01:45.980> the<00:01:46.070> report

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
mean what we're observing in the report

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.890 
mean what we're observing in the report
is<00:01:46.790> that<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:47.930> peers<00:01:48.560> as<00:01:48.830> though<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.630> has

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
is that it peers as though that it has

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.510 
is that it peers as though that it has
to<00:01:51.050> do<00:01:51.200> with<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.500> decision<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.130> go<00:01:52.220> on<00:01:52.370> to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
to do with the decision to go on to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.410 
to do with the decision to go on to
university<00:01:53.260> it's<00:01:54.260> not<00:01:54.560> what<00:01:55.460> happens<00:01:55.820> after

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
university it's not what happens after

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:09.820 
university it's not what happens after
the<00:01:56.720> application<00:01:56.870> is<00:01:57.410> put<00:01:57.650> into<00:01:57.890> place

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.760 

so<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.979> concept<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.550> tracking<00:02:12.560> one<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
so the concept of tracking one of the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.400 
so the concept of tracking one of the
things<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.130> do<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.490> in<00:02:14.820> Ontario<00:02:15.510> schools<00:02:15.840> and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
things we do in in Ontario schools and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.940 
things we do in in Ontario schools and
is<00:02:16.740> done<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.100> many<00:02:17.340> schools<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.680> even<00:02:19.680> be

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
is done in many schools is that even be

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.890 
is done in many schools is that even be
before<00:02:20.640> grade<00:02:20.850> 9<00:02:21.060> but<00:02:21.390> let's<00:02:21.570> start<00:02:21.810> with

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
before grade 9 but let's start with

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.110 
before grade 9 but let's start with
grade<00:02:22.200> 9<00:02:22.410> usually<00:02:23.070> that's<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.670> first<00:02:23.880> year<00:02:24.030> of

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
grade 9 usually that's the first year of

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.030 
grade 9 usually that's the first year of
high<00:02:24.270> school<00:02:24.300> students<00:02:25.260> start<00:02:25.500> getting<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.890> lot

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
high school students start getting a lot

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.280 
high school students start getting a lot
of<00:02:26.070> choice<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> courses<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:28.050> if<00:02:28.170> they

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
of choice in the courses so if they

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.020 
of choice in the courses so if they
start<00:02:28.560> taking<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.980> math<00:02:29.160> course<00:02:29.459> they<00:02:29.820> can

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
start taking a math course they can

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.610 
start taking a math course they can
decide<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.570> take<00:02:30.750> do<00:02:30.930> they<00:02:31.050> want<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.350> take<00:02:31.500> an

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
those decisions so as the students start

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.080 
those decisions so as the students start
making<00:02:42.810> those<00:02:42.959> decisions<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:44.250> then<00:02:44.640> affects

making those decisions that then affects

making those decisions that then affects
the<00:02:46.080> courses<00:02:46.530> they<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.739> take<00:02:47.100> down<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.430> road

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.080 
the courses they can take down the road
so<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.530> at<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.950> age<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.489> 12<00:02:51.180> 13<00:02:51.750> 14<00:02:53.090> students

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
so if at the age of 12 13 14 students

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.410 
so if at the age of 12 13 14 students
start<00:02:54.540> making<00:02:54.959> decisions<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:56.420> don't

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
start making decisions and don't

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.240 
start making decisions and don't
understand<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.260> implications<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.100> those

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
understand the implications of those

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.070 
understand the implications of those
decisions<00:02:59.880> when<00:03:00.330> they're<00:03:00.510> 17<00:03:00.989> 18<00:03:01.769> 19<00:03:02.040> 20<00:03:03.080> they

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
decisions when they're 17 18 19 20 they

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.539 
decisions when they're 17 18 19 20 they
could<00:03:04.440> end<00:03:04.769> up<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.850> stream<00:03:06.330> or<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.989> track

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
could end up in a stream or in a track

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.949 
could end up in a stream or in a track
that<00:03:08.549> makes<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:09.000> much<00:03:09.150> more<00:03:09.360> difficult<00:03:09.420> for

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
that makes it much more difficult for

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.910 
that makes it much more difficult for
them<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.350> go<00:03:10.470> on<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.950> university<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.680> one

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
them to go on to university that is one

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.320 
them to go on to university that is one
of<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.130> things<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.640> coming<00:03:14.820> on<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.180> our

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
of the things that is coming on in our

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.539 
of the things that is coming on in our
study<00:03:15.600> we<00:03:16.350> are<00:03:16.380> observing<00:03:17.070> that<00:03:17.190> there<00:03:17.400> are
