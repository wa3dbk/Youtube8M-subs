 Da Vinci 1.0 - New Print Module Replacement Tutorial 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 In order to enable da Vinci 1.0 to use PLA wire 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.900
 Please replace the new printing module and confirm that each material uses a dedicated module. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.900
 Please remove the wire inside the old nozzle before replacing the printing module. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.300
 Please turn off the power and remove the plug after removing the wire 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:35.600
 Cut off the cable tie on the print module 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 Remove the original heating cable 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.500
 Lightly press the cassette to remove the quick release print module 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.100
 Load a new print module 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.400
 The two cables attached to the box have the size of the head. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:25.300
 Connect the larger end of the cable to the nozzle 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:33.200
 Fix the new cable above the printing module with a cable tie or insulating tape 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:44.900
 The white cable connection should be specially fixed to prevent loosening. 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:54.800
 Insert the finished cable into the cable guide hole of the case 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.400
 And introduce the new cable to the rear of the case along the original cable 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.100
 Remove the back cover of the case to continue to change the connection cable 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.000
 Please remove the back cover with a T10 star screwdriver. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.300
 Remove the two star screws on the back cover 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.000
 Remove the back cover 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.600
 Pull out the two cables that you just wore 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:33.600
 And exchange with the two old lines indicated on the screen. 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.500
 Old cable does not need to be removed, it does not affect the printing function 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:53.800
 After connecting the cable, please move the printing module to the farthest end to confirm the smooth cable. 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.700
 Cut off the excess portion of the cable tie to ensure the printing process is normal 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:09.600
 Re-lock the back cover of the cabinet to complete the replacement of the nozzle 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.600
 Immediately after the replacement, perform platform calibration 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.200
 And complete the printer registration 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.200
 When you use PLA printing for the first time, the software will prompt you to register the newly changed printing module. 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:39.200
 In this case, please download and install the update kit according to the software instructions. 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:53.700
 The update kit needs to be fully unzipped to the desktop to function properly. 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:01.700
 Please turn off XYZware as indicated after opening the update kit. 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.600
 The update is in progress and needs to be confirmed in the network environment to facilitate the update. 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 To update, you need to enter the print module serial number to complete the registration. 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.100
 The serial number is marked under the outer box 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.000
 After confirming that the serial number is correct, you can continue to update the action. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.900
 At this point the machine will automatically perform a series of corrections and updates. 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Do not turn off the power and confirm that the network is connected. 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.500
 After the update process is completed 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.000
 Congratulations, the replacement printing module has been completely completed. 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.400
 Another wonderful print experience!
