ography turn because I switched and I
love<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:22.860> thing<00:02:23.099> no<00:02:23.489> shadow<00:02:23.790> sneak<00:02:24.120> and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
love in this thing no shadow sneak and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.740 
love in this thing no shadow sneak and
that<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:26.190> uh<00:02:26.459> yeah<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.970> made<00:02:27.180> me<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.510> mad<00:02:27.690> I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
that just uh yeah that made me so mad I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960 
that just uh yeah that made me so mad I
really<00:02:27.930> need<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.380> edit<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.800> set<00:02:29.190> because<00:02:29.790> it

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
really need to edit it set because it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.580 
really need to edit it set because it
has<00:02:30.090> ice<00:02:30.300> punch<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.750> an<00:02:30.959> earthquake<00:02:31.410> it

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
has ice punch and an earthquake it

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.870 
has ice punch and an earthquake it
supposed<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:31.980> shadow<00:02:32.340> snake<00:02:32.610> and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
supposed to have shadow snake and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.449 
supposed to have shadow snake and
probably<00:02:33.300> earthquake<00:02:33.900> or<00:02:34.050> ice<00:02:34.260> punch<00:02:34.560> but

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
probably earthquake or ice punch but

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.860 
probably earthquake or ice punch but
yeah<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:35.850> guess<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.239> just<00:02:36.270> need<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.600> go<00:02:36.690> for<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
yeah I guess I just need to go for the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.400 
yeah I guess I just need to go for the
earthquakes<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:38.010> break<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.459> sub<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.480> surface

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
earthquakes to break it sub but surface

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.979 
earthquakes to break it sub but surface
doing<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.830> lot<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.220> damage<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.209> he's<00:02:42.630> not<00:02:42.780> even

just to get residual damage because I

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.050 
just to get residual damage because I
thought<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.470> wouldn't<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:52.860> again<00:02:53.130> but<00:02:53.310> I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
thought I wouldn't so again but I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.330 
thought I wouldn't so again but I
thought<00:02:54.269> wrong<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:54.840> he<00:02:54.900> just<00:02:55.110> sub<00:02:55.709> again<00:02:55.920> so

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
thought wrong and he just sub again so

thought wrong and he just sub again so
my<00:02:57.180> polishin<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.750> Earth<00:02:57.959> quaked<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.640> he<00:02:59.640> goes

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
my polishin is Earth quaked and he goes

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.190 
my polishin is Earth quaked and he goes
for<00:03:00.000> another<00:03:00.060> sheriff<00:03:00.510> didn't<00:03:00.840> do<00:03:00.900> as<00:03:00.989> much<00:03:01.170> as

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
for another sheriff didn't do as much as

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.809 
for another sheriff didn't do as much as
the<00:03:01.470> last<00:03:02.250> one<00:03:02.519> but<00:03:02.730> uh<00:03:03.620> yeah<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:05.069> think<00:03:05.400> that's

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
the last one but uh yeah I think that's

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.140 
the last one but uh yeah I think that's
still<00:03:06.000> would<00:03:06.090> have<00:03:06.120> lived<00:03:06.330> in<00:03:06.450> any<00:03:06.600> way<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:08.150> go

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
still would have lived in any way and go

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.520 
still would have lived in any way and go
for<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.299> earthquake<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.810> break<00:03:09.930> his<00:03:10.049> sub<00:03:10.290> and

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
for the earthquake and break his sub and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.770 
for the earthquake and break his sub and
right<00:03:11.190> here<00:03:11.430> he<00:03:11.640> just<00:03:11.670> decides<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.269> kill<00:03:12.660> me

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
right here he just decides to kill me

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.090 
right here he just decides to kill me
off<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.200> I've<00:03:13.260> gone<00:03:13.410> for<00:03:13.650> another<00:03:13.709> sub

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
off and so I've gone for another sub

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.140 
off and so I've gone for another sub
because<00:03:14.430> um<00:03:15.319> yeah<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.760> only<00:03:17.760> know<00:03:17.970> what<00:03:18.090> he

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
because um yeah I only know what he

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.479 
because um yeah I only know what he
thought<00:03:18.359> but<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.170> guess<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.829> did<00:03:19.950> work<00:03:20.100> out<00:03:20.310> for

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
thought but I guess it did work out for

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.400 
thought but I guess it did work out for
me<00:03:20.519> because<00:03:20.850> he's<00:03:21.329> not<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.630> much<00:03:21.810> but<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.140> very

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
me because he's not that much but I very

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.280 
me because he's not that much but I very
easily<00:03:22.920> call<00:03:23.280> them<00:03:23.400> with<00:03:23.519> Zeman<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.209> go<00:03:25.109> for

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
easily call them with Zeman and go for

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.710 
easily call them with Zeman and go for
the<00:03:25.320> earthquake<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:25.799> easily<00:03:26.400> take<00:03:26.579> it<00:03:26.700> out<00:03:26.820> so

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
the earthquake and easily take it out so

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
so um I went to self the elf and I just

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.620 
so um I went to self the elf and I just
from<00:06:19.460> the<00:06:19.520> ice<00:06:19.670> punch<00:06:19.970> because<00:06:20.090> I'm<00:06:20.270> logic

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
from the ice punch because I'm logic

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.900 
from the ice punch because I'm logic
here<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:21.170> was<00:06:21.380> thinking<00:06:21.410> that<00:06:21.860> ice<00:06:22.520> punch<00:06:22.580> would

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
here I was thinking that ice punch would

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.310 
here I was thinking that ice punch would
take<00:06:23.120> down<00:06:23.210> the<00:06:23.330> subtitle<00:06:23.870> and<00:06:24.050> then<00:06:24.140> I<00:06:24.170> can

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
take down the subtitle and then I can

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.030 
take down the subtitle and then I can
deal<00:06:24.470> with<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.680> gliscor<00:06:25.160> too<00:06:25.400> and<00:06:25.870> um<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:27.410> have

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
deal with the gliscor too and um I have

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.310 
deal with the gliscor too and um I have
flag<00:06:28.250> on<00:06:28.430> can<00:06:28.640> deal<00:06:28.760> with<00:06:28.910> any<00:06:29.030> annoyances<00:06:29.570> but

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320
