00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hi friends from youtube i'm nico loquendo 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.020
 with an important notice apparently 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.120
 after the goku movie had 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.820
 success in Japan with superior earnings 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.450
 to 3 thousand 60 million yen in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.370
 Japan 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.929
 diamond films decided to negotiate for 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.880
 bring the film for countries 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.880
 Latin Americans and they got 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.859
 convince them to distribute the movie 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.859
 Argentine cinemas public diamond managed 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.320
 buy it would go after the holidays 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.210
 winter dragon ball has many 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.579
 fans in argentina 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.620
 and since the premiere of dragon ball z 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.079
 butler of touch in japan many 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.120
 bombed theaters asking for 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.430
 the local premiere but there was a great 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.370
 problem would only be released in Japan and 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.070
 it was not announced in any country not 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.100
 was in the process of global sales that 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.470
 it was explained in this note but after 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.780
 many weeks of diamond negotiations 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.149
 He managed to confirm that he could release it in 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.430
 Argentina and in all the countries of 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.750
 Latin America where it operates at least is 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.920
 say chile perú mexico and brazil 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.869
 responsible for diamond and know the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.820
 importance of this film for the 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.950
 fans so now they start to 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.720
 work on the topic of dubbing because 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.030
 the movie is in Japanese and ni 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.090
 even has official captions at 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.160
 English that's why we hope to get there 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.890
 just after the holidays of 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.050
 winter with its premiere something very 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.149
 important and positive the premiere will be 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.100
 only the digital 2d so also 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.200
 we will have to find the date where the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.390
 rooms are available although the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.310
 programmers from the cinemas also know 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.810
 of the importance of the film and of the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.280
 strength that has porn 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.440
 a heavyweight 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 and there will be avant première for the readers 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.740
 of Argentine cinemas dotcom also 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.659
 but there's no date or movies 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.909
 the important thing is to confirm that the 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.220
 movie will debut and this would not have 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.159
 been possible if they had not been all 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.430
 the queries generated when there 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.380
 News will be published on the site 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.479

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.250
 be the correct one now figure for 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.040

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.980

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.670

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.130
