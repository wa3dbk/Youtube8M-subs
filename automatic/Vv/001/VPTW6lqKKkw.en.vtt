00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:10.110
 How is it p? We introduce village added by village mod today 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.200
 Then I saw it cut until I arrived 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.340
 This village is a good Roman village with Japanese Safin culture 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.890
 By the way, all the buildings in this village are built 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:28.650
 And heliport here is a self-made one using surplus site 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.650
 If you look at the location of this village on the map, the center is the base where you usually live and the place you are now is the village 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.550
 The administrative movement always goes around the village as a guard of the village while entering the range of 21 winds listening something 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.680
 is 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.399
 And there are three rangers with machine guns on the lookout of the village. 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.710
 Keep it 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.710
 There is a house built by the villagers . I used this as a base for Seibu until this time 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.010
 It was 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.670
 Until apparently because it is small, I think trying to build a new base in the vicinity of this village in the finished 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.800
 they 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.520
 It is the introduction of the interior in the base of a three-story base completed 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.689
 The entrance door of this base is divided into one by one 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.689
 Right is an ordinary door 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.550
 The door on the left side can directly enter the bedrooms of soldiers belonging to this base 1 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.530
 You can room to 3 people sleep 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.810
 Let's go to the second floor 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.070
 The kite is a woman here 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.040
 Return home from 9 guitars 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:37.780
 The 3rd class car is participatory migration Here is the argument in the small warehouse and cng 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.500
 Since the warehouse has a large chest is 9-ball ceiling are a semi-block 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.880
 Do not waste space and introduce tna cannon 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.060
 I'm of the implosion type gnd who are no longer uncommon in version 1.5 or later 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.799
 Easy to see by pasting glass 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.799
 In the trial has 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.990
 Twee 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.680
 Finally the station introduction 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.560
 I made only the animals and after all the track was not made 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.560
 I forgot to make it that's it is this 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.020
 The distributor also makes inroads into the military department of Mikera 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:22.470
 This tank is the light tank of the tnt Tolco Cannon East-West 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.730
 It means a light tank in lt is one English 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.890
 I named it g 1 which is taking the initial letter of light tank 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.330
 Let's go try it now 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.340
 I will send 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:40.360
 The total number of blocks is large while saying 617 light tank 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.520
 The range is far beyond the previous tnt canon 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.080
 21 departs this tnt in one shot 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.050
 Destroy the pirate ship in front of you to show its power from now on 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.800
 Hmm 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.800

 Since difficult to understand from here let's go to look at fishing er tee section 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.690
 pandan 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.690
 ana 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.330
 It was quite fine. 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.160
 It was strange 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.190
 Result of hitting a pirate ship 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:47.680
 It has become like this- There is no trace anymore- 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.680
 It concludes the introduction of the village and locations in
