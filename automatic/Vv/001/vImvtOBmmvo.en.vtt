some information about the galaxy s2

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.620 
some information about the galaxy s2
plus<00:00:12.200> and<00:00:12.500> yes<00:00:12.680> I<00:00:12.830> mean<00:00:13.010> as<00:00:13.250> to<00:00:13.520> not<00:00:13.760> s3<00:00:14.450> and

plus and yes I mean as to not s3 and
this<00:00:15.110> this<00:00:15.320> has<00:00:15.500> been<00:00:15.650> completely<00:00:16.130> leaked<00:00:16.520> out

leaked some actual physical images of
this<00:00:24.710> I<00:00:24.859> haven't<00:00:25.430> covered<00:00:25.640> this<00:00:25.850> for<00:00:26.119> a<00:00:26.150> very

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
this I haven't covered this for a very

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.939 
this I haven't covered this for a very
very<00:00:26.600> long<00:00:26.779> time<00:00:26.990> just<00:00:27.529> because<00:00:27.650> there's

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
very long time just because there's

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.740 
very long time just because there's
there's<00:00:28.310> been<00:00:28.609> no<00:00:28.820> leaks<00:00:29.090> on<00:00:29.269> this<00:00:29.420> for<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:29.600> very

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
there's been no leaks on this for a very

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.170 
there's been no leaks on this for a very
long<00:00:29.869> time<00:00:30.050> besides<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.340> benchmark<00:00:31.880> that<00:00:31.939> was

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
long time besides the benchmark that was

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.090 
long time besides the benchmark that was
leaked<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:32.449> couple<00:00:32.750> months<00:00:32.989> ago<00:00:33.050> anyways<00:00:33.559> so

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
leaked a couple months ago anyways so

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.369 
leaked a couple months ago anyways so
let's<00:00:34.280> go<00:00:34.370> over<00:00:34.489> some<00:00:34.519> specs<00:00:35.090> and<00:00:35.540> week<00:00:35.960> I'm

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
let's go over some specs and week I'm

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.139 
let's go over some specs and week I'm
even<00:00:36.650> showing<00:00:36.830> you<00:00:37.010> some<00:00:37.190> physical<00:00:37.610> pictures

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
even showing you some physical pictures

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.200 
even showing you some physical pictures
of<00:00:38.390> this<00:00:38.600> galaxy<00:00:38.840> s2<00:00:39.170> plus<00:00:39.559> while<00:00:39.860> you<00:00:40.010> guys

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
of this galaxy s2 plus while you guys

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.430 
of this galaxy s2 plus while you guys
listen<00:00:41.210> to<00:00:41.239> you<00:00:41.570> spec<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.020> it's<00:00:42.140> gonna<00:00:42.260> be<00:00:42.320> a

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
listen to you spec so it's gonna be a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.060 
listen to you spec so it's gonna be a
dual-core<00:00:43.010> 1.5<00:00:43.550> gigahertz<00:00:44.000> XE<00:00:44.989> no<00:00:45.140> cpu<00:00:45.710> so

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz XE no cpu so

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.160 
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz XE no cpu so
it's<00:00:46.190> gonna<00:00:46.280> be<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.489> fairly<00:00:46.760> good<00:00:47.000> cpu<00:00:47.360> yeah<00:00:47.899> on

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
it's gonna be a fairly good cpu yeah on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.520 
it's gonna be a fairly good cpu yeah on
par<00:00:48.559> with<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.860> galaxy<00:00:49.430> s2<00:00:50.360> as<00:00:50.870> well<00:00:51.110> like<00:00:51.379> the

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
par with the galaxy s2 as well like the

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.590 
par with the galaxy s2 as well like the
north<00:00:51.710> american<00:00:52.129> version<00:00:52.640> it's<00:00:53.239> not<00:00:53.390> going<00:00:53.510> to

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
north american version it's not going to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.940 
north american version it's not going to
be<00:00:53.660> much<00:00:53.840> different<00:00:54.289> is<00:00:54.350> going<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.530> be<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.649> bit

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
be much different is going to be a bit

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.619 
be much different is going to be a bit
of<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.160> boost<00:00:55.340> to<00:00:55.520> talk<00:00:55.730> on<00:00:55.910> it<00:00:56.000> if<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.360> have<00:00:56.480> the

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
of a boost to talk on it if you have the

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.930 
of a boost to talk on it if you have the
galaxy<00:00:56.989> s2<00:00:57.140> i<00:00:57.350> would<00:00:57.620> definitely<00:00:58.399> raat<00:00:58.699> not

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
galaxy s2 i would definitely raat not

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.029 
galaxy s2 i would definitely raat not
recommend<00:00:59.510> upgrading<00:00:59.840> to<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:00.350> s2<00:01:00.829> plus

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
recommend upgrading to the s2 plus

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.610 
recommend upgrading to the s2 plus
co-operation<00:01:02.000> galaxy<00:01:02.629> s3<00:01:02.960> that's<00:01:03.170> worse<00:01:03.590> than

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
co-operation galaxy s3 that's worse than

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.740 
co-operation galaxy s3 that's worse than
upgrade<00:01:04.100> upgrading<00:01:04.759> to<00:01:04.789> this<00:01:05.059> is<00:01:05.239> definitely

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
upgrade upgrading to this is definitely

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.480 
upgrade upgrading to this is definitely
not<00:01:05.780> worth<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.289> just<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:06.590> you<00:01:06.649> know<00:01:06.890> it's<00:01:07.340> gonna

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
not worth it just so you know it's gonna

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.910 
not worth it just so you know it's gonna
have<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.729> 4.5<00:01:08.360> inch<00:01:08.600> AMOLED<00:01:09.080> display<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:09.530> it's<00:01:09.860> a

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
have a 4.5 inch AMOLED display so it's a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.340 
have a 4.5 inch AMOLED display so it's a
fairly<00:01:10.189> good<00:01:10.460> one<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.760> a<00:01:11.570> song<00:01:11.750> it's<00:01:12.200> also

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
fairly good one and a song it's also

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.960 
fairly good one and a song it's also
gonna<00:01:12.530> have<00:01:12.680> an<00:01:12.770> 8<00:01:12.950> megapixel<00:01:13.100> rear<00:01:13.850> facing

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
gonna have an 8 megapixel rear facing

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.359 
gonna have an 8 megapixel rear facing
camera<00:01:14.780> with<00:01:14.810> built-in<00:01:15.200> flash<00:01:15.860> as<00:01:16.100> well<00:01:16.250> and

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
camera with built-in flash as well and

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.710 
camera with built-in flash as well and
you<00:01:16.430> can<00:01:16.460> see<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.700> by<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.060> images<00:01:17.510> as<00:01:17.689> well

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
you can see that by the images as well

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.719 
you can see that by the images as well
he's<00:01:18.350> gonna<00:01:18.439> have<00:01:18.560> 16<00:01:19.070> gigabytes<00:01:19.549> of<00:01:19.670> built-in

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
he's gonna have 16 gigabytes of built-in

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.719 
he's gonna have 16 gigabytes of built-in
storage<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.720> one<00:01:21.020> gigabyte<00:01:21.500> of<00:01:21.710> RAM<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:22.400> it's

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
storage and one gigabyte of RAM so it's

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.999 
storage and one gigabyte of RAM so it's
less<00:01:23.180> than<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.479> galaxy<00:01:23.869> s3<00:01:24.380> even<00:01:24.710> though<00:01:24.830> it's

less than the galaxy s3 even though it's

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.890 
less than the galaxy s3 even though it's
