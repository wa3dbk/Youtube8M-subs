00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.700
 very good and that we are again in 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.160
 you create patrios a new way prowein creates 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.390
 1.7 point 10 called pure you're work 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.279
 with forging so I'm not going to declare it 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.619
 electoral and this module that does is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.260
 add or hope it brings a lot 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.750
 buts and you have to bite very many 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.420
 to be able to get an ingot 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.879
 or one of the rest even and the truth is 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.260
 that is chunga the thing is chunga me 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.480
 I've noticed that it's a very bad way 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.860
 when people do not know maybe 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.390
 who says hey I find myself too many 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.969
 materials in minecraft for me is 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 too easy because with these guys I 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.480
 I think you're going to be bored just from mines 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.219
 this mind but of course here we have as 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.079
 You see when we apply this one that is here 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.559
 the difference between normal and pure 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.210
 now he only gives us the pray 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.579
 we have to get to cook that ore 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.219
 to get to get a nugget 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.039
 Well, well, with nine invitations to the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.750
 final we will get the ingot or the 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:08.640
 arrest not what we left then as 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.590
 you see we have the man who burns 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.940
 we got the rest nugget with nine 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.330
 pieces we get 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.980
 the rest unit and with this equal with 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.510
 all say with the diamond even 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.710
 We have diamond nugget of 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.620
 diamond with nine we get a 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.060
 diamond and in the end this is crazy 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.520
 it's crazy because we have to chop 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.730
 very many to be able to get to get 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.200
 what he used that you see here not the bad what 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.570
 bad is that it changes all the suns that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.880
 are generated by the envelopes of the mod I 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.080
 I've been looking around here, I'm going to 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.180
 leave here good here you have the 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.010
 nugget is worth we have the gold nugget that 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.240
 very strange because the gold avoids us 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.150
 will give darker orbit than the orbit 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.800
 normal on the site for example conjures 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.850
 a man of gold what we have got 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.520
 a golden pita but it's a nugget 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.660
 dark is then worth nine tracks 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.970
 dark we can also get the 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.470
 Gold ingot but gold ingot is 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.760
 it turns into nine dark nuggets it does not 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.220
 turns into the normal pitas of 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.450
 minecraft is a pretty rare thing but 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.430
 good does not affect the gameplay either 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.350
 simply because the duplication of 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.900
 items and was this no no I do not understand 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.130
 well let's go down let's go for a 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.160
 cave is worth this cave has been generated 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.120
 completely natural and as you see is 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.190
 completely full of pur you are the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.600
 therefore, in this case, as you see 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.060
 they change good I do not know 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.270
 it is generated in the place of the suns 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.280
 normal plus it brings less but they come out 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.500
 many more then how are you seeing 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.110
 they have come out a lot here for example 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.420
 we can get us to apply a lot 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.020
 of coal but of course all this coal is 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.510
 pure is poor poor and the normal order is not 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.010
 appears outside said to be able to kill it 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.470
 or not to see here for wii 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.030
 and we go for the perfect one as you see everything 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.700
 what is all we are found here 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.760
 in the cave is now poor we do not have 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.280
 a single normal man and that's what has 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.650
 missed that even if they were normal 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.600
 mixed with poor homes because look 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.920
 It would be a lot cooler because it's worth 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.860
 has the greatest disagreements not of 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.860
 poor, it's worth it, but when everything is 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.230
 poor thing now is get a little 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.240
 maniac is already because of course we have to 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.130
 get a diamond peak for 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.500
 apply a lot of hours of diamond 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.920
 to be able to make you a single 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.840
 diamond and in the end that is all 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.300
 very slow not and that I do not know in my 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.170
 then good opinion is the way to 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.060
 look 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.940
 up here because to see if we find 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.800
 one of normal that I was fixing and 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.390
 they did not find me and one but it can be 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.270
 that it is clear that there is also 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.940
 so many hours of these may be that 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.700
 there is some hidden and I do not realize 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.310
 but I think it's not I think there's not even 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.340
 some guys over here have to see if 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.440
 not here the cave ends and here 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.630
 is that clear me here in this part 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.670
 why I passed and really is what 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.670
 same and why 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.280
 Come, come, come, look here, 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.680
 see is that neither injured to see 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.940
 heal yourself cure over here we have also 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.859
 about poor of all is that it is a 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.800
 last but it's clear that only I 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.880
 poor is very rare is very rare good 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.770
 guys this is the way I hope you 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.950
 I liked a lot of pulsar like and 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.790
 little paper we do not see the next video 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.790
 up high
