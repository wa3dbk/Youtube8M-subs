00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.950
 hello to all and greet the little animal 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.690
 me it's flexed and today I'm you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.700
 proposes a little video really for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.429
 develop to strengthen your forearms 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.140
 for forearms so pay who already 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.189
 before I show you the exercise I 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.509
 just wanted to say it's something 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.029
 that you will work on all 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.740
 exercises on made sumbe earth of 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.509
 tractions even seen bad shots at 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.829
 biceps including maurice hammer 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.749
 so with both hands facing each other 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.700
 you will work in the forearms 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.320
 so you can work and in addition 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.190
 in addition if you train already 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.989
 quite regularly 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.820
 okay but these matches what it takes 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.469
 do it from the outset if you do that a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.539
 two workouts a week 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.649
 bodybuilding would not only consist of 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.929
 small muscles this is the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.910
 forearm calves trapezius 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.379
 okay it's really a small 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.300
 exercise that I find very nice 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.399
 accepted from the san dandrieu coil 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.420
 exercises to complement the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.160
 is also allowing us to work 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.429
 a little bit the grip so the front 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.350
 arms 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.079
 be it at the level of the flexor 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.210
 like wrist extensors so I 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.530
 change me quickly and go duval a 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.299
 messed up my ibook exercise by v i did 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.950
 as soon as possible so it's gone for 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.020
 the exercise to the coach who's called the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.750
 good minogue and for this exercise 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.429
 need a rope that you set at a 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.229
 little chord base set their middle 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.060
 and m for you if it was not 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.409
 available reels started with a 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.729
 rather light load what are you going 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.110
 see that it's hard enough and you can 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.250
 start the exercise whose expected number 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.259
 to work at the same time 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.210
 shoulders if the rope is too long for 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.240
 climb on a steve or on a bench so 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.350
 to be able to accentuate an amplitude 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.450
 so as I was as we know 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.860
 that a light load arms stretched and we 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.649
 done in a way to let down 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.200
 the point of agreement and you go back the 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.189
 same way the ones down well what 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.689
 that we see well increase for 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.220
 work the issa brownfield for example 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.750
 and after doing the same thing but in 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.340
 rolling in the other direction in order to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.020
 also work extensors for 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.159
 very long is the ski flexor 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.530
 under the forearm but also the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.789
 expanders if it's hard and that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.729
 finally that jump on all the 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.470
 shoulders to finish by bending them and 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.799
 the arms and so we are the mrap along 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.259
 of the body here I think to do both 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.610
 sides it's something that is 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.709
 really like I say them in the beginning in 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.599
 intro is in addition to the agreement of 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.280
 bodybuilding you in london she 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.500
 also work on many others 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.540
 exercises you can do that so I 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.040
 advise you three more times too 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.870
 base pronation does the climb and the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.370
 descent the ascent descent world and 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.170
 it's simple you go back 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.239
 do the same thing I tell you about it 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.620
 as much as not ten minutes and allows itself 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.090
 of one more system on the forearms 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.980
 So be had including poland 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.750
