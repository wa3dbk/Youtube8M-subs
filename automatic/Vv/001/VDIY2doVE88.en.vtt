supported<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.310> big<00:03:27.580> hole<00:03:27.900> or<00:03:28.900> they<00:03:29.290> was<00:03:30.250> able

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
supported this big hole or they was able

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.730 
supported this big hole or they was able
to<00:03:30.580> hold<00:03:30.730> itself<00:03:31.060> together<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:32.440> know<00:03:32.560> what

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
to hold itself together you know what

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.070 
to hold itself together you know what
would<00:03:32.860> happen<00:03:33.250> at<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.550> if<00:03:34.210> the<00:03:34.570> pool<00:03:34.870> had

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
would happen at this if the pool had

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.990 
would happen at this if the pool had
fractured<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.680> hole<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.610> was<00:03:36.730> full<00:03:36.970> of

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
fractured a hole and it was full of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.930 
fractured a hole and it was full of
water<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:38.440> would<00:03:38.590> have<00:03:38.740> created<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.910> a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
water it would have created like a

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.540 
water it would have created like a
whirlpool<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.990> suction<00:03:41.860> because<00:03:42.100> all<00:03:42.340> that

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
whirlpool of suction because all that

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.950 
whirlpool of suction because all that
water<00:03:42.730> would<00:03:42.970> have<00:03:43.030> gone<00:03:43.210> right<00:03:43.270> down<00:03:43.750> the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
water would have gone right down the

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.400 
water would have gone right down the
hole

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410
