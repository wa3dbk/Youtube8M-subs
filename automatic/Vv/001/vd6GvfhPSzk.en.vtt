open<00:02:35.569> hell<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.790> got<00:02:37.790> thinking<00:02:38.150> about<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.659> you

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
open hell I got thinking about that you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.990 
open hell I got thinking about that you
know<00:02:38.900> that'd<00:02:39.049> be<00:02:39.200> pretty<00:02:39.439> cool<00:02:39.859> and<00:02:40.280> then<00:02:40.909> it

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
know that'd be pretty cool and then it

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.649 
know that'd be pretty cool and then it
dawned<00:02:41.269> on<00:02:41.510> me<00:02:42.640> if<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.819> took<00:02:43.879> my<00:02:44.560> number<00:02:45.560> 12<00:02:46.659> and

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
dawned on me if I took my number 12 and

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.699 
dawned on me if I took my number 12 and
I<00:02:47.870> took<00:02:48.139> my<00:02:48.290> number<00:02:48.409> 10<00:02:49.719> and<00:02:50.719> I<00:02:50.900> combined<00:02:51.439> and

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
I took my number 10 and I combined and

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.629 
I took my number 10 and I combined and
put<00:02:51.889> both<00:02:52.189> blades<00:02:52.700> onto<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.750> same<00:02:54.049> knife<00:02:54.639> and

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
put both blades onto the same knife and

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.089 
put both blades onto the same knife and
modified<00:02:56.329> my<00:02:56.599> number<00:02:56.930> 10<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.439> be<00:02:57.590> more<00:02:57.829> of<00:02:57.980> a

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
modified my number 10 to be more of a

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.080 
modified my number 10 to be more of a
craft<00:02:58.849> knife<00:02:59.470> for<00:03:00.470> carving<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.579> stuff<00:03:01.849> like

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
craft knife for carving and stuff like

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.619 
craft knife for carving and stuff like
that

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
that

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.229 
that
I<00:03:02.659> would<00:03:02.810> have<00:03:02.959> my<00:03:03.200> camp<00:03:03.650> cooker<00:03:04.099> and<00:03:04.669> my<00:03:04.879> craft

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
I would have my camp cooker and my craft

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.369 
I would have my camp cooker and my craft
pocketknife<00:03:06.109> together<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:08.090> as<00:03:08.419> I<00:03:08.629> was<00:03:08.840> laying

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
pocketknife together and as I was laying

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.250 
pocketknife together and as I was laying
that<00:03:09.709> out<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.370> looking<00:03:10.760> at<00:03:10.939> it<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.359> had<00:03:11.959> another

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
that out and looking at it I had another

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.369 
that out and looking at it I had another
little<00:03:12.530> idea<00:03:13.099> I<00:03:13.840> noticed<00:03:14.840> how<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.019> blades

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
little idea I noticed how the blades

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.110 
little idea I noticed how the blades
went<00:03:15.799> together<00:03:15.950> these<00:03:16.400> are<00:03:16.549> fairly<00:03:16.790> thick

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
went together these are fairly thick

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.420 
went together these are fairly thick
blades<00:03:17.419> but<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.169> number<00:03:18.409> 12<00:03:18.829> is<00:03:18.919> so<00:03:19.099> meaty

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
blades but the number 12 is so meaty

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.699 
blades but the number 12 is so meaty
there's<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.819> lot<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.480> can<00:03:20.870> put<00:03:21.079> in<00:03:21.260> here<00:03:21.469> and

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
there's a lot you can put in here and

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.379 
there's a lot you can put in here and
yeah<00:03:21.889> it<00:03:22.069> will<00:03:22.189> go<00:03:22.340> in<00:03:22.519> there<00:03:22.730> side<00:03:22.969> and<00:03:23.180> side

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
yeah it will go in there side and side

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.240 
yeah it will go in there side and side
once<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.019> relieve<00:03:24.379> it<00:03:24.590> there's<00:03:24.769> enough<00:03:25.010> wood

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
once you relieve it there's enough wood

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.240 
once you relieve it there's enough wood
and<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.150> will<00:03:26.299> fit<00:03:26.510> in<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.810> collar<00:03:27.079> that's<00:03:28.010> not

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
and it will fit in the collar that's not

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.360 
and it will fit in the collar that's not
going<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.489> be<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.609> problem<00:03:29.590> but<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.739> looking<00:03:30.980> at

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
going to be a problem but in looking at

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.670 
going to be a problem but in looking at
that<00:03:31.549> I<00:03:31.970> got<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.049> thinking<00:03:33.970> you<00:03:34.970> know<00:03:35.680> assault

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
that I got to thinking you know assault

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.530 
that I got to thinking you know assault
blade<00:03:36.949> cating<00:03:37.489> saw<00:03:37.669> blade<00:03:38.000> is<00:03:38.030> actually<00:03:38.479> a

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
blade cating saw blade is actually a

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.809 
blade cating saw blade is actually a
piece<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.870> spring<00:03:39.199> steel<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.889> therefore<00:03:40.609> it

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
piece of spring steel and therefore it

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.990 
piece of spring steel and therefore it
will<00:03:41.000> Bend<00:03:41.599> and<00:03:41.959> come<00:03:42.379> back<00:03:42.560> shape<00:03:43.010> because

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
will Bend and come back shape because

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.520 
will Bend and come back shape because
it's<00:03:44.150> got<00:03:44.299> to<00:03:44.419> be<00:03:44.510> moving<00:03:44.689> high<00:03:44.959> speed<00:03:45.290> if<00:03:45.470> it

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
it's got to be moving high speed if it

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.170 
it's got to be moving high speed if it
hits<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.829> nail<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.280> shatter<00:03:46.609> if<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.909> wasn't

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
hits a nail it shatter if it wasn't

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.509 
hits a nail it shatter if it wasn't
flexible<00:03:47.439> this<00:03:48.439> also<00:03:48.829> means<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.220> could<00:03:49.340> turn

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
flexible this also means you could turn

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.539 
flexible this also means you could turn
into<00:03:49.729> a<00:03:49.819> knife<00:03:50.060> or<00:03:50.389> whatever<00:03:50.540> later<00:03:50.959> on<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:52.400> it

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
into a knife or whatever later on but it

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.360 
into a knife or whatever later on but it
also<00:03:52.729> means<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.599> could<00:03:53.930> put<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.620> because<00:03:55.250> it

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
also means I could put this because it

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.679 
also means I could put this because it
is<00:03:55.519> so<00:03:55.939> thin<00:03:56.949> between<00:03:57.949> these<00:03:58.609> two<00:03:58.909> blades<00:03:59.239> and

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
is so thin between these two blades and

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.110 
is so thin between these two blades and
then<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.620> would<00:04:00.889> have<00:04:01.069> one<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.759> would<00:04:01.909> be<00:04:02.090> a

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
then I would have one that would be a

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.599 
then I would have one that would be a
camp<00:04:05.120> knife<00:04:05.419> a<00:04:07.090> carving<00:04:08.090> craft<00:04:08.419> knife<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:10.250> a

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
camp knife a carving craft knife and a

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.960 
camp knife a carving craft knife and a
saw<00:04:10.849> all<00:04:11.509> in<00:04:11.780> one<00:04:13.030> will<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.150> work<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.709> don't<00:04:15.709> know

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
saw all in one will it work I don't know

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.189 
saw all in one will it work I don't know
that's<00:04:16.970> what<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:17.449> I<00:04:17.539> are<00:04:17.570> about<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.959> find

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
that's what you and I are about to find

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.890 
that's what you and I are about to find
out<00:04:18.579> I've<00:04:19.579> done<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.909> little<00:04:20.239> bit<00:04:20.479> of<00:04:20.630> prep<00:04:20.870> work

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
out I've done a little bit of prep work

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.620 
out I've done a little bit of prep work
before<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.709> video<00:04:21.979> first<00:04:22.669> thing<00:04:22.970> I<00:04:23.090> did<00:04:23.240> was<00:04:23.419> I

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
before the video first thing I did was I

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.230 
before the video first thing I did was I
pried<00:04:23.900> off<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.289> locking<00:04:24.680> collar<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.370> then<00:04:26.150> I

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
pried off the locking collar and then I

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.649 
pried off the locking collar and then I
took<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.630> punch<00:04:26.900> in<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.169> small<00:04:27.440> anvil<00:04:27.680> onto<00:04:28.130> the

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
took a punch in a small anvil onto the

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:31.779 
took a punch in a small anvil onto the
peg<00:04:29.659> hook<00:04:29.960> out<00:04:30.169> so<00:04:31.159> I<00:04:31.190> could<00:04:31.370> get<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.550> blades

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
peg hook out so I could get the blades

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.990 
peg hook out so I could get the blades
out<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.900> will<00:04:36.110> also<00:04:36.469> allow<00:04:36.680> me<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:37.520> finish

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
out this will also allow me to finish

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.780 
out this will also allow me to finish
the<00:04:38.300> wood

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
the wood

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.490 
the wood
I'm<00:04:39.120> gonna<00:04:39.330> make<00:04:39.450> some<00:04:39.690> marks<00:04:39.900> on<00:04:40.140> here<00:04:40.410> and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
I'm gonna make some marks on here and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.050 
I'm gonna make some marks on here and
some<00:04:40.650> modification<00:04:41.340> we're<00:04:41.490> gonna<00:04:41.670> go<00:04:41.820> through

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
some modification we're gonna go through

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.060 
some modification we're gonna go through
that<00:04:42.090> step<00:04:42.480> by<00:04:42.540> step<00:04:43.400> but<00:04:45.590> when<00:04:46.590> you<00:04:46.710> line<00:04:47.040> up

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
that step by step but when you line up

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.100 
that step by step but when you line up
the<00:04:47.370> blades<00:04:47.820> I'm<00:04:48.210> gonna<00:04:48.390> put<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.720> in<00:04:48.750> close

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
the blades I'm gonna put you in close

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.090 
the blades I'm gonna put you in close
here<00:04:49.290> in<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.470> minute<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:50.370> just<00:04:50.520> see<00:04:50.990> like<00:04:52.100> that

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
here in a minute you just see like that

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.280 
here in a minute you just see like that
and<00:04:53.460> I'll<00:04:53.610> let<00:04:53.730> you<00:04:53.850> see<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.060> lot<00:04:54.240> closer<00:04:54.510> the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
and I'll let you see a lot closer the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.860 
and I'll let you see a lot closer the
number<00:04:55.590> 10<00:04:55.800> fits<00:04:56.160> it's<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.610> same<00:04:56.910> almost<00:04:57.690> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
number 10 fits it's the same almost the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.730 
number 10 fits it's the same almost the
same<00:04:58.080> width<00:04:58.910> maybe<00:04:59.910> a<00:05:00.000> thickness<00:05:00.270> of<00:05:00.480> a<00:05:00.570> nickel

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
same width maybe a thickness of a nickel

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.550 
same width maybe a thickness of a nickel
narrower<00:05:01.740> it's<00:05:02.340> just<00:05:02.670> shorter<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.350> I<00:05:04.350> can

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
narrower it's just shorter and I can

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.400 
narrower it's just shorter and I can
round<00:05:04.830> that<00:05:05.070> point<00:05:05.340> up<00:05:05.520> like<00:05:05.730> I<00:05:05.910> want<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.480> then

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
round that point up like I want and then

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.380 
round that point up like I want and then
this<00:05:07.590> reciprocating<00:05:08.460> saw<00:05:08.700> blade<00:05:09.030> when<00:05:09.300> you

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
this reciprocating saw blade when you

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.290 
this reciprocating saw blade when you
line<00:05:09.660> up<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.930> holes<00:05:10.230> it's<00:05:11.070> just<00:05:11.670> a<00:05:11.880> grunt

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
line up the holes it's just a grunt

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.130 
line up the holes it's just a grunt
longer<00:05:12.810> I'll<00:05:13.020> cut<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.560> saw<00:05:13.740> blade<00:05:14.100> to<00:05:14.130> fit<00:05:14.640> I

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
longer I'll cut the saw blade to fit I

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.360 
longer I'll cut the saw blade to fit I
put<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.320> saw<00:05:16.560> blade<00:05:16.950> between<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.860> two<00:05:20.100> knife

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
put the saw blade between the two knife

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.250 
put the saw blade between the two knife
blades<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:22.100> that's<00:05:23.100> how<00:05:23.310> thick<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.670> is<00:05:24.260> it's

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
blades and that's how thick it is it's

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.470 
blades and that's how thick it is it's
about<00:05:26.150> I'll<00:05:27.150> measure<00:05:27.480> it<00:05:27.630> exactly<00:05:27.810> but<00:05:28.350> it's

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
about I'll measure it exactly but it's

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.060 
about I'll measure it exactly but it's
between<00:05:30.480> 1/8<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:31.080> little<00:05:31.530> over<00:05:31.710> an<00:05:31.800> 8<00:05:31.950> maybe<00:05:32.490> I

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
between 1/8 a little over an 8 maybe I

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.640 
between 1/8 a little over an 8 maybe I
think<00:05:35.070> I<00:05:35.430> can<00:05:35.610> do<00:05:35.730> it<00:05:36.170> stay<00:05:37.170> with<00:05:37.200> me

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
think I can do it stay with me

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.770 
think I can do it stay with me
let's<00:05:37.860> see<00:05:38.010> what<00:05:38.130> we<00:05:38.220> can<00:05:38.400> do<00:05:38.550> today<00:05:38.700> be<00:05:39.660> right

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
let's see what we can do today be right

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.020 
let's see what we can do today be right
back
