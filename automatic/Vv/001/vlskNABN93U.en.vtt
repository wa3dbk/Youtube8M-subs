00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.720
hi I'm Kelsey mays for cars.com dodge
resurrect an old nameplate the 2008

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.050
Avenger a car that the automaker says
has plenty of on-road performance

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.119
attitude the adventure is the
replacement for dodges stratus which was

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.040
in the late nineties and early two
thousands

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.189
it's a midsize car is related to the
chrysler sebring which was introduced

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.360
last year as a redesigned model as you
can see Dodge has plenty of performance

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.410
styling upfront with the front crosshair
grille that looks a lot like the ones on

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.579
the dodge magnum and charger moving
around the side you can see some

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.090
similarities and the roof pillars
between the Avenger and the sebring

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.910
sibling avenger SXT has attractive
17-inch wheels in back you can see a few

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.079
similarities to the sebring in the deck
lid shape and the rear draws a few

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.640
similarities for better or worse to the
dodge caliber the base engine is dodges

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.020
2.4 liter world engine and it works for
the four-speed automatic it's fine

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.660
around town although we'd like to have a
fifth gear for better highway

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.200
acceleration inside the Avenger there
are plenty of adjustments for the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.350
driver's seat and the steering wheel
both tilts and telescopes that's a

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.370
feature some midsize cars have yet to
accommodate interiors plenty of

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.729
entertainment and storage features
although we're a little bit disappointed

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.330
with the dashboard quality the Avenger
does have some interesting features that

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.340
might set it apart from its competition

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.229
one of them is dodges chills on which
you'll also find in the 2007-2008

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.360
caliber the chill zone in the Avenger
can accommodate up to four 12-ounce cans

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.580
it doesn't take any 20 ounce bottles
however the map lights have these

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.260
interesting led white light features
crisis in a lot of its vehicles

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.520
unfortunately like a lot of other
chrysler vehicles it just doesn't like

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.210
things up very well there's also no
sunglass holder which is something we've

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.659
come to expect in a midsize car these
days

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.530
I'd like a little bit more visibility
outside the side windows as you can see

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.100
what these really thick window pillars
kind of cuts off visibility right next

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.299
to my head

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.259
truck is about thirteen and a half cubic
feet large which is roughly competitive

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.280
with this segment note the strut hinges
on the side they don't intrude on trunk

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.209
space like the arm hinges and some
popular competitors do for additional

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.980
