00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.110
 Of course there is also a final set handle 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.080
 Percent for the right hand 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.280
 For all 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.280
 Cross clays 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.589
 in fact 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.510
 but they do not have that cross like the b2 Norton Debate on 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.910
 you just play possible quite different and crosses the Norton 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.720
 take 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.460
 just by 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.609
 thinking upwards with her finger set 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.850
 play that key as c, what we do together now 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 they finger set percent 1 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
 1 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 and with the Sindelfinger set 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.210
 finds her acting all alone her way across all crossed keys 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.770
 you still have to know that you can learn a lot with a double pack 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.930
 Which 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.930
 Sign has her cross key 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.840
 I go for them all cross keys now 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.750
 once 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.230
 in fact 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.350
 I can go 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.260
 with a cross 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.040
 Just pay attention to this finger 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.930
 on 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.930
 percent 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.300
 and otherwise the reverse gear is over this percentage without being routed 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.520
 the same 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.520
 lost 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.060
 Thon leaders keep changing them 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.940
 to get back to basic tone 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.960
 Let's go to the next note 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.830
 Lingen said 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.830
 the 1 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.360
 March we have the key quake with two crosses
