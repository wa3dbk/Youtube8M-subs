this route here is called the out route
and<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.620> starts<00:02:16.620> out<00:02:16.770> like<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> fly<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:18.510> once<00:02:19.500> he

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
and it starts out like a fly but once he

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.490 
and it starts out like a fly but once he
goes<00:02:19.830> about<00:02:20.040> 56<00:02:20.910> yards<00:02:21.270> he<00:02:21.360> cuts<00:02:22.110> straight

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
goes about 56 yards he cuts straight

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.620 
goes about 56 yards he cuts straight
towards<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.040> 90-degree<00:02:23.819> turn<00:02:23.850> straight<00:02:24.390> for

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.920 
the sideline so it's basically just the
opposite<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.900> drag<00:02:28.230> route<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.720> for

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
opposite of a drag route and this is for

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.390 
opposite of a drag route and this is for
towards<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.500> end<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.830> games<00:02:32.040> when<00:02:32.280> you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
towards the end of the games when you

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.280 
towards the end of the games when you
need<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.580> get<00:02:32.730> out<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.940> bounds<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:34.110> you

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
need to get out of bounds that you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.130 
need to get out of bounds that you
generally<00:02:34.680> run<00:02:35.100> this<00:02:35.250> place<00:02:35.610> oh<00:02:35.910> it's

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
generally run this place oh it's

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:45.350 
generally run this place oh it's
generally<00:02:37.140> safe<00:02:37.440> play<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.770> get<00:02:37.950> out<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.220> bounds

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.930 

you

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.670 

okay<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.270> next<00:02:51.510> route<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.380> drag

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
okay so this next route is the drag

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.270 
okay so this next route is the drag
route<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.620> route<00:02:55.620> ran<00:02:55.890> by<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.130> wide

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
route this is a route ran by the wide

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.390 
route this is a route ran by the wide
receiver<00:02:56.670> who<00:02:57.660> runs<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.170> few<00:02:58.410> yards<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.100> field

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
receiver who runs a few yards of field

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.110 
receiver who runs a few yards of field
and<00:02:59.670> turns<00:02:59.880> at<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.660> 90-degree<00:03:01.260> angle<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.970> is

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and turns at a 90-degree angle this is

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.060 
and turns at a 90-degree angle this is
kind<00:03:03.270> of<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.390> shorter<00:03:03.720> route<00:03:03.930> used<00:03:04.740> for

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
kind of a shorter route used for

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.640 
kind of a shorter route used for
receivers<00:03:05.910> or<00:03:06.330> perhaps<00:03:06.690> running<00:03:07.020> backs<00:03:07.350> that

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
receivers or perhaps running backs that

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.180 
receivers or perhaps running backs that
can<00:03:08.310> make<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.790> lot<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.030> yards<00:03:09.420> after<00:03:09.540> catch<00:03:10.190> and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
can make a lot of yards after catch and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.170 
can make a lot of yards after catch and
perhaps<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.910> little<00:03:12.150> more<00:03:12.300> elusive<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:15.060> is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
perhaps a little more elusive this is

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.870 
perhaps a little more elusive this is
just<00:03:15.360> basically<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.810> short<00:03:16.110> route<00:03:16.400> designed<00:03:17.400> to

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
just basically a short route designed to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:28.630 
just basically a short route designed to
gain<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.450> lot<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.990> yards<00:03:19.230> after<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.530> cat

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.250 

this<00:03:29.640> route<00:03:29.879> is<00:03:29.909> called<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.480> wheel<00:03:30.690> route<00:03:30.989> and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
this route is called the wheel route and

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.190 
this route is called the wheel route and
a<00:03:32.220> wide<00:03:32.430> receiver<00:03:32.849> can<00:03:33.180> run<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.599> but<00:03:33.720> its<00:03:33.900> most

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
a wide receiver can run it but its most

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.850 
a wide receiver can run it but its most
used<00:03:34.739> by<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:34.980> running<00:03:35.730> back<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:37.319> idea<00:03:37.500> this

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
used by a running back and the idea this

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.949 
used by a running back and the idea this
route<00:03:38.129> is<00:03:38.159> to<00:03:38.459> give<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.390> quarterback<00:03:39.780> an

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
route is to give the quarterback an

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.380 
route is to give the quarterback an
option<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.799> quick<00:03:41.190> pass<00:03:41.459> or<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> deep<00:03:42.090> pass

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
option of a quick pass or a deep pass

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.660 
option of a quick pass or a deep pass
and<00:03:42.810> what<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.680> running<00:03:44.010> back<00:03:44.160> we'll<00:03:44.370> do<00:03:44.519> is

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
and what the running back we'll do is

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.280 
and what the running back we'll do is
we'll<00:03:44.819> run<00:03:45.090> towards<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.510> sideline<00:03:45.750> looking

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
we'll run towards the sideline looking

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.559 
we'll run towards the sideline looking
back<00:03:46.470> at<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.769> quarterback<00:03:47.129> who<00:03:48.120> either<00:03:48.299> could

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
back at the quarterback who either could

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.869 
back at the quarterback who either could
pass<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.989> him<00:03:49.200> or<00:03:49.379> he'll<00:03:50.220> finish<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.760> route

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
pass it to him or he'll finish the route

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.610 
pass it to him or he'll finish the route
by<00:03:51.060> turning<00:03:51.330> up<00:03:51.599> field<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.049> going<00:03:52.379> deep

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
by turning up field and going deep

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.740 
by turning up field and going deep
towards<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.250> end<00:03:53.280> zone<00:03:53.549> kind<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.209> like<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.420> fly

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
towards the end zone kind of like a fly

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.229 
towards the end zone kind of like a fly
route<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.400> then<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.670> quarterback<00:03:57.090> could

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
route and then the quarterback could

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.840 
route and then the quarterback could
throw<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.659> for<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.870> long<00:03:58.200> gain

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.550 

this<00:04:03.850> year<00:04:04.090> route<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.660> called<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.050> curl<00:04:05.290> route

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
this year route is called the curl route

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.550 
this year route is called the curl route
and<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.940> starts<00:04:07.300> off<00:04:07.450> like<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.690> fly<00:04:07.990> out<00:04:08.290> and

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
and it starts off like a fly out and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.920 
and it starts off like a fly out and
once<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.790> receiver<00:04:10.360> sees<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:10.840> the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
once the receiver sees that the

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.990 
once the receiver sees that the
cornerbacks<00:04:11.410> committed<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.160> guarding<00:04:12.850> the

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
cornerbacks committed to guarding the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.560 
cornerbacks committed to guarding the
fly<00:04:13.360> route<00:04:13.630> he<00:04:14.140> abruptly<00:04:14.350> turns<00:04:15.239> quickly<00:04:16.239> and

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
fly route he abruptly turns quickly and

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.090 
fly route he abruptly turns quickly and
looks<00:04:16.720> back<00:04:16.870> at<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.170> quarterback<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:17.980> when

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
looks back at the quarterback and when

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.770 
looks back at the quarterback and when
he<00:04:18.190> turns<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.730> quarterback<00:04:19.150> generally

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
he turns the quarterback generally

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.380 
he turns the quarterback generally
throws<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:20.739> right<00:04:20.980> before<00:04:21.190> returns<00:04:21.790> so<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.120> lot

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
throws it right before returns so a lot

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.330 
throws it right before returns so a lot
of<00:04:22.480> communication<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.350> practice<00:04:23.830> is<00:04:23.980> needed

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
of communication and practice is needed

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:32.159 
of communication and practice is needed
on<00:04:24.430> this<00:04:24.640> route

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:38.590

this<00:04:39.230> next<00:04:39.590> route<00:04:39.860> is<00:04:40.040> called<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.400> post<00:04:40.850> route

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
this next route is called the post route

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.750 
this next route is called the post route
and<00:04:41.540> this<00:04:42.410> is<00:04:42.620> for<00:04:42.830> a<00:04:42.860> moderate<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:43.580> deep

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
and this is for a moderate to deep

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.480 
and this is for a moderate to deep
passing<00:04:44.330> route<00:04:44.540> which<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.590> receiver<00:04:45.980> usually

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
passing route which the receiver usually

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.220 
passing route which the receiver usually
runs<00:04:46.730> seven<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.120> ten<00:04:47.300> yards<00:04:47.810> away<00:04:47.900> from<00:04:47.990> the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.180 
line of scrimmage straight down field
and<00:04:50.780> then<00:04:50.870> he<00:04:50.990> cuts<00:04:51.290> towards<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.890> middle<00:04:52.070> of
