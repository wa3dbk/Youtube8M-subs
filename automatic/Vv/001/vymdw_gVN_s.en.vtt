00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hi all, Swami Hunter and in this video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.040
 I will tell you about how to build 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.469
 Ender world portal how to find it and how 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.230
 rebuild in order to build 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.109
 very portal in Ender world you Panas 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.840
 switch to creative mode otherwise different 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.170
 you will not get this block 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.970
 other honest way after you 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.760
 switched to the mode and us so imagine these 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.880
 blocks you need to make a frame 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.290
 portal frame portal deal with like this 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.719
 here is the way here we see it built 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.809
 now you need to place 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:48.030
 coco ender eye ender kraft 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.329
 pearl edge precisely pearl ender 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.600
 and fire powder here we see ourselves 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.899
 fire powder can be crafted from 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.199
 rod of efrita these rods themselves fall 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.870
 killing efritov in hell 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.890
 here as soon as we had a window hole 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:16.530
 it is necessary to place the cells here in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:18.659
 these blocks as we see 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.299
 placed and in theory our portal should 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.450
 was working but for some reason he didn't 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:33.270
 I earned why I don't know yet 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:35.369
 but I will try to find out now with 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.470
 the location of these areas of the eye 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.550
 need to 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.550
 so you should be three there to look 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.490
 because we have a lot of creative resources yes 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:06.090
 here he is a portal earned as we see 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.470
 location to be like this but 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.640
 it doesn't always work because i 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.090
 experimented with building portals 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.680
 location's those eyes I was in 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.690
 that side is directed and down in general I 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.459
 I don't think that depends on it 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:30.300
 but how lucky is this if you do 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.790
 portal do it yourself now if its 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.880
 find we also need to craft 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.980
 first eye ender 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.709
 then on the ground just take in hand and 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.510
 right click we here 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.940
 see 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.140
 she is having Putin to the nearest 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.900
 the portal now we just need 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.350
 go the wrong way 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.090
 occasionally check whether we go 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.519
 that is, if the direction suddenly changes 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:08.160
 then the direction of the eye of this he 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:08.910
 flew the other way so here i am 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.239
 already been 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.239
 searched this portal for so i know where 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.820
 he is after we find 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.820
 portal site and here itâ€™s just right 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.680
 see down flew away that is we need 5 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:31.189
 from there 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:41.510
 since we are from 3 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:41.510
 somewhere here should a portal about below 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.879
 so here it is, we found a portal to 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.370
 we need to restore it 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.099
 place these cell eyes here 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.870
 just right click on 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:01.079
 with his eye in his hand we see how they 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.189
 easy to insert and with the last all 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:10.980
 the portal has been activated that is, here it is 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:13.349
 going to be activated without problems after 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:21.000
 of how you went to this portal 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:24.840
 you get to the edge of strange 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.570
 It generates and it turned out to be all on 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.250
 edge of 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.070
 the only way from here is legally 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.300
 quit it either kill the dragon either 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.449
 die 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.409
 as I have absolutely no 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.409
 opportunities to get into 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.170
 on this island I have stress here 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:53.200
 only one and one way out here 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:05:00.010
 who committed suicide well here we are 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:01.990
