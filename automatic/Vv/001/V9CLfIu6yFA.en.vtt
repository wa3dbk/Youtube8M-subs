curling irons you have your inch you

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.620 
curling irons you have your inch you
have<00:00:19.590> an<00:00:19.710> half<00:00:19.949> inch<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.000> also<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.359> your

one and a half inch they also become

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.099 
one and a half inch they also become
actually<00:00:24.150> bigger<00:00:24.390> than<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.960> then<00:00:25.080> you

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
actually bigger than this and then you

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.310 
actually bigger than this and then you
have<00:00:25.350> you're<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.650> between<00:00:25.800> sizes<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:27.320> recommend

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
have you're in between sizes I recommend

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.960 
have you're in between sizes I recommend
that<00:00:28.380> everybody<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:29.039> at<00:00:29.160> least<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.550> know<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that everybody have at least you know a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.479 
that everybody have at least you know a
one<00:00:30.689> inch<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.289> maybe<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> two<00:00:32.009> inch<00:00:32.219> or

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
one inch and maybe like a two inch or

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.569 
one inch and maybe like a two inch or
one<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> half<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:34.530> smaller<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.399> diameter

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
one and a half the smaller the diameter

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.580 
one and a half the smaller the diameter
of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.210> curling<00:00:36.660> iron<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.079> tighter<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.559> curl

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
of the curling iron the tighter the curl

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.580 
of the curling iron the tighter the curl
is<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.690> i<00:00:39.809> take<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> small

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
is going to be so if i take the small

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.709 
is going to be so if i take the small
one<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.790> also<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.629> smaller<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.140> diameter

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
one now also the smaller the diameter

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.080 
one now also the smaller the diameter
the<00:00:45.719> smaller<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.829> section<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> take

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the smaller the section you have to take

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.990 
the smaller the section you have to take
you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.440> take<00:00:49.770> too<00:00:50.070> big<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.520> section

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
you can if you take too big of a section

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
you can if you take too big of a section
the<00:00:51.480> hair<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> wrap<00:00:52.469> properly

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the hair is not going to wrap properly

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.299 
the hair is not going to wrap properly
and<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:54.000> not<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.750> go<00:00:54.899> around<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and it's not going to go around all the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.580 
and it's not going to go around all the
way<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:57.210> want<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> create<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.170> smoothness

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
way you want to create that smoothness

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.819 
way you want to create that smoothness
again<00:00:59.100> from<00:00:59.399> taking<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.180> base<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
again from taking it from the base and

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.139 
again from taking it from the base and
continuously<00:01:01.829> dragging<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.520> down<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:03.030> your

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
continuously dragging it down to your

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.840 
continuously dragging it down to your
ends<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:04.140> heat<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> ultimately<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
ends that heat is ultimately going to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.590 
ends that heat is ultimately going to
help<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.900> hair<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.119> being<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
help your hair so this one being a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590 
help your hair so this one being a
smaller<00:01:09.990> diameter<00:01:10.850> it's<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> lot

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
smaller diameter it's going to do a lot

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.160 
smaller diameter it's going to do a lot
tighter<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.560> curl<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:14.580> compared<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.240> let's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
tighter of a curl as compared to let's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.340 
tighter of a curl as compared to let's
say<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.920> one<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
say this one so this way you can see the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.990 
say this one so this way you can see the
difference<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> curl<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> way<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
difference of the curl and the way that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.539 
difference of the curl and the way that
they<00:01:21.150> overlay<00:01:21.659> each<00:01:22.049> other<00:01:22.290> again<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.340> one

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
they overlay each other again this one

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.830 
they overlay each other again this one
you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.670> take<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> bit<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.390> bigger<00:01:24.600> Dyke

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you can take a bit of a bigger Dyke

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.929 
you can take a bit of a bigger Dyke
bigger<00:01:25.439> section<00:01:25.890> because<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.340> does<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
bigger section because it does have a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.620 
bigger section because it does have a
big<00:01:27.180> bigger<00:01:27.780> diameter<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:29.210> again<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
big bigger diameter to it again to the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.789 
big bigger diameter to it again to the
base<00:01:30.920> bring<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.810> now<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:34.229> people<00:01:34.259> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
base bring it out now some people I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.859 
base bring it out now some people I
happen<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.549> find<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.939> easier<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.420> actually

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
happen to find it easier to actually

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.100 
happen to find it easier to actually
start<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> curl<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.250> use<00:01:38.820> my<00:01:39.150> good<00:01:39.509> old<00:01:39.659> piece

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
start the curl and use my good old piece

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.960 
start the curl and use my good old piece
here<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.680> order<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.670> piece

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
here in order to get this piece

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.850 
here in order to get this piece
completely<00:01:42.689> underneath<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.439> feel<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
completely underneath I feel like the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.120 
completely underneath I feel like the
curl<00:01:44.100> stays<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.610> longer<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.649> actually

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
curl stays on longer and it's actually

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.990 
curl stays on longer and it's actually
easier<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.759> maneuver<00:01:48.979> some<00:01:49.979> people<00:01:50.340> cannot<00:01:50.729> do

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
easier to maneuver some people cannot do

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.999 
easier to maneuver some people cannot do
that<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.479> cannot<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> fine<00:01:52.710> to

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
that if you cannot do that it is fine to

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.069 
that if you cannot do that it is fine to
drag<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.610> curling<00:01:53.939> iron<00:01:54.060> from<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.540> base<00:01:54.750> all

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
drag the curling iron from the base all

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.899 
drag the curling iron from the base all
the<00:01:55.350> way<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> your<00:01:55.770> ends<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:56.549> start

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the way to your ends and then start

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.700 
the way to your ends and then start
rolling<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.899> remember<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.469> aware<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
rolling just remember to be aware of

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.300 
rolling just remember to be aware of
that<00:01:59.009> crank<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> now<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.280> can

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
that crank so now as you can

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.340 
that crank so now as you can
the<00:02:04.310> curl<00:02:04.580> here<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.390> actually<00:02:05.960> going<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.230> bit

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
the curl here is actually going to bit

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.530 
the curl here is actually going to bit
tighter<00:02:06.620> than<00:02:06.890> what<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.160> Kuro<00:02:07.370> is<00:02:07.550> here<00:02:08.000> the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
tighter than what the Kuro is here the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.660 
tighter than what the Kuro is here the
diameter<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.410> little<00:02:09.740> bit<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.070> S<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.640> a

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
diameter is a little bit the S is a

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.090 
diameter is a little bit the S is a
little<00:02:11.000> bit<00:02:11.180> softer<00:02:12.020> on<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.350> one<00:02:12.590> so

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
little bit softer on this one so

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.500 
little bit softer on this one so
depending<00:02:13.550> on<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.790> look<00:02:13.940> you're<00:02:14.120> going<00:02:14.330> for

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
depending on the look you're going for

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.200 
depending on the look you're going for
is<00:02:14.870> then<00:02:15.050> depend<00:02:15.440> on<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:16.340> size<00:02:16.850> diameter

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
is then depend on the size diameter

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.930 
is then depend on the size diameter
curling<00:02:18.140> iron<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.380> want<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.770> use<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.520> larger

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
curling iron you want to use the larger
