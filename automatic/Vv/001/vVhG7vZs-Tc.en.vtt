the tail what the v's do is they

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.439 
the tail what the v's do is they
transfer<00:00:53.100> more<00:00:53.249> energy<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.909> the<00:00:54.030> end<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.359> the

too<00:00:56.550> stiff<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:58.069> the<00:00:59.069> board<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.399> still<00:00:59.609> be

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
too stiff so the board will still be

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:02.930 
too stiff so the board will still be
stiff<00:00:59.940> fortunately<00:01:00.889> but<00:01:01.889> flex<00:01:02.219> nice<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.879> easy

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
