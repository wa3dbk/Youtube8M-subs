where I think call of duty is going to

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.509 
where I think call of duty is going to
go<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> as<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.260> know<00:00:22.439> call<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.130> duty<00:00:23.160> comes

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
been going for like 10 11 years now

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.590 
been going for like 10 11 years now
where<00:01:05.100> are<00:01:05.189> they<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> go<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.970> truck

where are they going to go in a truck

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.859 
where are they going to go in a truck
always<00:01:07.020> had<00:01:07.590> gone<00:01:07.890> back<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> previous

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
always had gone back to the previous

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.500 
always had gone back to the previous
past<00:01:09.869> Wars<00:01:10.320> until<00:01:11.310> black<00:01:11.520> ops<00:01:11.729> 2<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.270> think

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
past Wars until black ops 2 and I think

on<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.400> PlayStation<00:02:35.610> 2<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:37.380> do<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.770> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
on the PlayStation 2 and I do like the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.770 
on the PlayStation 2 and I do like the
technical<00:02:38.430> games<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:38.880> i<00:02:38.910> don't<00:02:39.210> think<00:02:39.300> that

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
technical games but i don't think that

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.100 
technical games but i don't think that
neversoft<00:02:40.530> will<00:02:40.770> suit<00:02:41.160> an<00:02:41.370> FPS<00:02:42.300> they've<00:02:42.930> never

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
neversoft will suit an FPS they've never

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.060 
neversoft will suit an FPS they've never
done<00:02:43.290> an<00:02:43.440> FPS<00:02:43.860> for<00:02:44.040> before<00:02:44.580> before<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.710> don't

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
done an FPS for before before so I don't

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.310 
done an FPS for before before so I don't
think<00:02:47.310> they<00:02:47.400> will<00:02:47.580> suit<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.060> FPS<00:02:48.810> franchise

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
think they will suit the FPS franchise

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.320 
think they will suit the FPS franchise
but<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:49.650> will<00:02:49.770> see<00:02:49.980> how<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.160> goes<00:02:50.460> maybe<00:02:51.090> they

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
but we will see how it goes maybe they

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.660 
but we will see how it goes maybe they
might<00:02:51.480> team<00:02:51.780> up<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.110> sledgehammer

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670

they're definitely going to go into the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.850 
they're definitely going to go into the
future<00:03:59.580> warfare<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.870> name<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.410> could<00:04:01.740> be

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
future warfare the name it could be

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.980 
future warfare the name it could be
could<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.310> could<00:04:02.640> be<00:04:02.790> called<00:04:03.030> call<00:04:03.270> of<00:04:03.300> duty<00:04:03.660> 10

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
could it could be called call of duty 10

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.370 
could it could be called call of duty 10
it's<00:04:04.590> quite<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.950> crap<00:04:05.310> name<00:04:05.840> last<00:04:06.840> year<00:04:07.080> we<00:04:07.200> did

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
it's quite a crap name last year we did

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.320 
it's quite a crap name last year we did
see<00:04:07.740> some<00:04:07.770> leaked<00:04:08.130> information<00:04:08.460> going<00:04:08.940> around

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
see some leaked information going around

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.690 
see some leaked information going around
about<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.960> iron<00:04:10.440> wolf<00:04:10.710> but<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.520> was

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
about that iron wolf but that was

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.260 
about that iron wolf but that was
totally<00:04:12.090> illegitimate<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:14.790> name<00:04:14.970> could

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
totally illegitimate so the name could

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.560 
totally illegitimate so the name could
be<00:04:15.330> anything<00:04:16.730> you<00:04:17.730> know<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.150> probably<00:04:18.420> going

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
be anything you know it's probably going

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.180 
be anything you know it's probably going
to<00:04:18.630> be<00:04:18.690> something<00:04:19.049> like<00:04:19.320> ops<00:04:19.620> you<00:04:20.160> know

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
to be something like ops you know

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.400 
to be something like ops you know
operational<00:04:21.030> or<00:04:21.359> something<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:22.020> do<00:04:22.140> with<00:04:22.260> like

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
operational or something to do with like

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.920 
operational or something to do with like
Special<00:04:22.860> Forces<00:04:23.250> or<00:04:23.520> something<00:04:23.910> but<00:04:24.540> there's

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
Special Forces or something but there's

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.720 
Special Forces or something but there's
definitely<00:04:25.020> gonna<00:04:25.290> be<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.470> new<00:04:25.650> name

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
definitely gonna be a new name

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.410 
definitely gonna be a new name
it<00:04:27.090> could<00:04:27.420> be<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:28.080> place<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.560> could<00:04:28.710> be<00:04:28.830> set

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
it could be the place it could be set

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.610 
it could be the place it could be set
really<00:04:30.420> could<00:04:30.600> be<00:04:30.630> anywhere<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.140> mean<00:04:31.260> if<00:04:31.560> they

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
really could be anywhere I mean if they

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.500 
really could be anywhere I mean if they
do<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.890> past<00:04:32.340> warfare<00:04:32.850> game<00:04:33.090> then<00:04:33.330> obviously

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
do a past warfare game then obviously

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.170 
do a past warfare game then obviously
it's<00:04:33.870> going<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.080> be<00:04:34.170> kind<00:04:34.890> of<00:04:35.100> set<00:04:35.760> around<00:04:36.000> the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
it's going to be kind of set around the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.700 
it's going to be kind of set around the
kind<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.480> middle<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.990> earth<00:04:37.110> but<00:04:37.410> I<00:04:37.470> mean

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
kind of middle of the earth but I mean

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.900 
kind of middle of the earth but I mean
if<00:04:38.580> they<00:04:38.670> do<00:04:38.850> a<00:04:39.350> modern<00:04:40.350> warfare<00:04:40.590> game<00:04:41.010> then<00:04:41.310> or

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
even a present warfare game then maybe

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.710 
even a present warfare game then maybe
they<00:04:43.980> could<00:04:44.160> set<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.400> back<00:04:44.670> in<00:04:44.850> Afghanistan<00:04:45.510> I

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720
