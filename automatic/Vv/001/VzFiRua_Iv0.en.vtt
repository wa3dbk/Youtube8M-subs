00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
switch is open they'll go off so I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.389 
switch is open they'll go off so I
located<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.290> connections<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.950> soldered<00:02:02.310> a

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
located the connections and I soldered a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.429 
located the connections and I soldered a
couple<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.729> wires<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.689> taped<00:02:03.990> some<00:02:04.140> very

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
couple of wires and then taped some very

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.080 
couple of wires and then taped some very
small<00:02:04.710> magnets<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.399> other<00:02:05.670> end<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
small magnets on the other end of the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.419 
small magnets on the other end of the
wires<00:02:06.299> now<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.320> one<00:02:07.530> will<00:02:07.770> require<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
wires now this one will require you

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.699 
wires now this one will require you
getting<00:02:08.759> inside<00:02:09.090> your<00:02:09.119> targets<00:02:09.690> car<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.200> in

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
getting inside your targets car and in

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.220 
getting inside your targets car and in
this<00:02:10.830> case<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> glovebox

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
this case it's going to be the glovebox

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.630 
this case it's going to be the glovebox
every<00:02:13.440> glovebox<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.069> different<00:02:14.519> but

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
every glovebox is different but

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.910 
every glovebox is different but
basically<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.330> concept<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.019> same<00:02:16.050> put

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
basically the concept is the same put

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.490 
basically the concept is the same put
the<00:02:17.069> assembly<00:02:17.370> inside<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.420> car<00:02:18.659> pass<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
the assembly inside the car pass the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.119 
the assembly inside the car pass the
glovebox

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
glovebox

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.369 
glovebox
and<00:02:20.250> then<00:02:20.580> tape<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.000> wires<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:21.510> place<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
and then tape the wires in place now the

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.110 
and then tape the wires in place now the
next<00:02:22.680> time<00:02:22.799> they<00:02:22.920> open<00:02:23.340> their<00:02:23.459> glovebox<00:02:23.909> to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
next time they open their glovebox to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.270 
next time they open their glovebox to
get<00:02:24.269> something<00:02:24.569> out<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.959> close<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:28.280> they're
