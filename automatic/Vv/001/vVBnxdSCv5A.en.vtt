00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.340 
the route a half step on the G minor
giving<00:00:23.789> us<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.000> minor<00:00:24.240> major<00:00:24.449> seven<00:00:24.570> now<00:00:25.050> this

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
giving us a minor major seven now this

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.460 
giving us a minor major seven now this
is<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> very<00:00:26.340> common<00:00:26.910> walk<00:00:27.300> down<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.320> can

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
is a very common walk down and you can

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.740 
is a very common walk down and you can
use<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.980> numerous<00:00:29.369> songs<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.390> this

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
use this in numerous songs but this

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.740 
use this in numerous songs but this
lesson<00:00:31.230> has<00:00:31.640> several<00:00:32.640> purposes<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
lesson has several purposes not just the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.389 
lesson has several purposes not just the
chord<00:00:33.960> progression<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.100> rolling

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
chord progression but it's a rolling

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.580 
chord progression but it's a rolling
pick<00:00:35.880> technique<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.079> what<00:00:37.230> I'd<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
pick technique and what I'd like you to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.260 
pick technique and what I'd like you to
do<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.950> take<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.430> move<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.910> around<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
do is take this move it around the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.580 
do is take this move it around the
fretboard<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.840> your<00:00:39.960> different<00:00:40.290> inversions

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
fretboard to your different inversions

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950 
fretboard to your different inversions
and<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.430> need<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.670> few<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> ideas<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> end

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and we need a few the ideas in the end

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
and we need a few the ideas in the end
it's<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.590> fairly<00:00:43.770> simple<00:00:44.040> lesson<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.210> will

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
it's a fairly simple lesson and it will

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.470 
it's a fairly simple lesson and it will
improve<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:45.780> pick<00:00:46.200> blocking<00:00:46.620> dexterity

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
improve your pick blocking dexterity

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.029 
improve your pick blocking dexterity
hand-eye<00:00:48.480> coordination<00:00:48.719> everything<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.920> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
hand-eye coordination everything so I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.619 
hand-eye coordination everything so I
think<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.520> very<00:00:50.760> valuable<00:00:50.969> lesson<00:00:51.510> for

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
think this is a very valuable lesson for

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.240 
think this is a very valuable lesson for
you<00:00:51.750> beginners<00:00:52.050> we're<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you beginners we're going to be in the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.799 
you beginners we're going to be in the
key<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.520> F<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.000> I'm<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.420> playing<00:00:54.690> at

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
key of F so I'm going to be playing at

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.760 
key of F so I'm going to be playing at
fret<00:00:55.050> number<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.930> in<00:00:57.930> its<00:00:58.170> simplest<00:00:58.649> form

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
fret number one and in its simplest form

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:26.260 
fret number one and in its simplest form
this<00:00:59.430> phrase<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> sound<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.449> this

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.790 

so<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.510> hear<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.870> have<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.080> lot<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.320> rolling

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
so you can hear we have a lot of rolling

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.150 
so you can hear we have a lot of rolling
moving<00:01:29.520> phrases<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:30.690> over<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> F<00:01:31.920> we're

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
moving phrases here over the F we're

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:40.310 
moving phrases here over the F we're
playing<00:01:32.400> five<00:01:32.580> six<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.120> eight

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
or a strain implying a diminished chord

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.900 
or a strain implying a diminished chord
movement<00:01:46.650> to<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.830> G<00:01:46.980> minor<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.550> we<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
movement to the G minor now as we get to

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.760 
movement to the G minor now as we get to
the<00:01:48.000> G<00:01:48.180> minor<00:01:48.420> we're<00:01:48.690> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.900> use<00:01:49.080> five<00:01:49.470> six

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the G minor we're going to use five six

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.150 
the G minor we're going to use five six
and<00:01:49.950> seven<00:01:50.010> with<00:01:50.760> a<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.150> B<00:01:51.270> pedals<00:01:51.630> down<00:01:55.160> now

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
and seven with a and B pedals down now

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.720 
and seven with a and B pedals down now
this<00:01:56.580> is<00:01:56.760> our<00:01:56.910> walk<00:01:57.150> down<00:01:57.510> with<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> flavor<00:01:58.730> here

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
this is our walk down with a flavor here

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.910 
this is our walk down with a flavor here
we<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.330> our<00:02:00.450> seven<00:02:00.840> string<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.260> root<00:02:01.530> G

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
we have on our seven string the root G

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.180 
we have on our seven string the root G
the<00:02:02.460> minor<00:02:02.700> third<00:02:03.060> B<00:02:03.360> flat<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:04.260> we<00:02:05.010> have<00:02:05.160> a

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
the minor third B flat and we have a

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.990 
the minor third B flat and we have a
70-year

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.180 

so<00:02:09.570> this<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.900> a<00:02:09.930> half<00:02:10.200> step<00:02:10.560> lower<00:02:10.590> than<00:02:11.100> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
so this is a half step lower than the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.910 
so this is a half step lower than the
roof

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
roof

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.220 
roof
no<00:02:13.190> waiver<00:02:13.460> any<00:02:14.000> labor<00:02:14.240> so<00:02:14.870> we're<00:02:14.990> gonna<00:02:15.080> be

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
no waiver any labor so we're gonna be

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.570 
no waiver any labor so we're gonna be
using<00:02:15.380> open<00:02:16.390> seven<00:02:17.390> definitely<00:02:18.290> birthdate<00:02:18.860> no

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
using open seven definitely birthdate no

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:30.220 
using open seven definitely birthdate no
believer<00:02:19.880> with<00:02:20.150> made<00:02:20.390> me<00:02:21.170> leave<00:02:21.380> her<00:02:21.500> with<00:02:21.650> a

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.800 

now<00:02:31.230> we're<00:02:31.409> going<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.560> use<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.299> B<00:02:33.299> pedal<00:02:33.510> and
