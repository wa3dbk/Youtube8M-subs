00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140
 It has not been a very bright idea 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:08.859
 [Music] 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.859
 ay ay ay 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.790
 but because I'm afraid if I do not touch me 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.329
 if it happened to him oh my god I have 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.480
 powers should have brought gloves 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:23.699
 [Music] 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.349
 the mask 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.039
 or maybe you should see the sins with the 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.019
 wand instead of advancing more on 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.699
 it seems that his face was his point 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.160
 weak because it explains otherwise to the 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:39.130
 touch his hand 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.010
 the most epic battle in history 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.150
 now it will finally be rich and immortal well 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.410
 this is a moment as good as 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.390
 any other to turn my back on me 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.309
 fallen enemy while I watch the stone 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.110
 well and now I'll turn around so 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.640
 damn damn my plan was 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.350
 perfect and it would have gone well for the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.870
 nosy snotty resources 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.870
 do not dust my only weakness 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.490
 I forgot the stone 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.729
 I really hope that its moisture that 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.770
 I'm sorry, sweat, hello, teacher. 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.110
 to wake up 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.479
 I knew I should have hurried 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.640
 no stone is not harry what stone 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.140
 very funny seriously where is it 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.590
 I feel but I have no idea what is 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.659
 talking, it does not matter, you can stay 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.820
 if you want a real detainee with me 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.950
 all the time I would have been stupid 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.960
 yesterday I sat with me do not you think for 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.869
 true there is something that we have to 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.479
 speak you have killed two people are 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.860
 too many for your age harry you can not 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.590
 go around killing whoever you want 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.750
 without consequences they will only jail 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.979
 double homicide also because of you 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.330
 everyone has to repeat a course of 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.569
 professor of dark arts to death not 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.270
 can you rate them seriously I was not kidding 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.250
 I do not even open the trial and it's the same 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.319
 why we return could not beat 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.180
 will make you a very simple reason love not 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.720
 because you are the protagonist of a book 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.420
 children can not go wrong at last 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.050
 I'm like in the classes if we 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.460
 after 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.130
 but telling jokes and things that 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.490
 nothing happened 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.410
 As every year we will deliver the glasses of 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.620
 the house these are the scores 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.610
 definitive fourth gryffindor 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.330
 with 412 points burst and hatchback to 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.330
 who cares 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.030
 and the first place is for the lifting with 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.520
 472 points 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.460
 [Applause] 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.950
 but even though the competition has already 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.570
 finished in the granting to the jan jr by 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.580
 unveil as many 150-point failures 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.070
 but it is not neither to compensate for 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.040
 death of your noble 50 points travels to 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.780
 boat in 60 points he knows why and 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.060
 now that they are tied for him to win 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.960
 double-double griffin 10 points 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.900
 of mille for example 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.910
 I will have to kill myself therefore 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.260
 if my calculations are not wrong what 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.790
 it is very possible since as a magician there 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.320
 studied mathematics 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.000
 we must change the decoration 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.850
 [Music] 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.400
 in effect I do magic without a wand 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.080
 colors or not just to annoy you but 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.130
 it's not fair because we humble ourselves 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:43.210
 shape and martÃ­n thinks he is stupid 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:45.430
 you are all one today 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.190
 and it's not amazing that rum has gone from 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.510
 course for amazing what mine has 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.050
 tested without making a single spell in 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.050
 the whole movie 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.430
 [Music] 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.040
 tell me what you wanted could not 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.960
 let it out if I'm not today and what 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.960
 I kept between my buttocks to not lose it 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.970
 You have two days to collect your ashes 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.180
