00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.880 
for that waveform he does bring down the
marana<00:01:28.829> 141<00:01:29.900> even<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.079> read<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.439> imagine

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
marana 141 even if they read you imagine

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.550 
marana 141 even if they read you imagine
like<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:33.180> DOTA<00:01:33.630> had<00:01:33.810> achievements<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
like if DOTA had achievements like that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.149 
like if DOTA had achievements like that
that<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.070> routing<00:01:35.549> pub<00:01:35.790> games<00:01:36.119> yeah
