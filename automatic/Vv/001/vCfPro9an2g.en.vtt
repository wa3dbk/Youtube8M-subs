00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.950
 do not 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.949
 Well, I'm going to show you what we 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.900
 we can put pants tights 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.669
 etcetera etcetera because in the end it is 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.800
 true that as of waist for 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.150
 up we dressed with layers also of 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.430
 waist down we dress with 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.640
 different layers then the first thing that 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.349
 you can see it is meshes to use it is worth not 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.810
 They have any special design and 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.000
 not only that they will adjust them to the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.920
 leg and that also makes it more 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.589
 comfortable and also that you conserve better the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.600
 heat after we have some hands a 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.519
 little fatter is worth these suitcases a 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.900
 little fatter fleece are the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.190
 that in the end you put yourself at the beginning of 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.960
 an expedition and in which 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.760
 become your second skin 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.470
 chance of the strips and then 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.100
 you can well combine with the mesh more 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.159
 finite that we have seen before or with or so 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.229
 simply the mesh put dry with 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.939
 very easy and you can sit in 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.040
 any side you can get your ass wet 

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.530
 it may rain, etc., etc. that 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.680
 end then nothing if you leave it on 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.020
 matter of half an hour you go and you have it 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.210
 dry what we have here is what 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.100
 let's combine surely with the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.690
 little hand that we have seen at the beginning 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.880
 because with the fat mesh 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.700
 we are going to feel that we have too many 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.470
 things on is a pair of pants that 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.420
 we will use mostly for the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.100
 trekking for example because it is also 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.260
 a very comfortable garment that dries very 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.360
 fast and it's also a little elastic not 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.550
 we can put aside fashion and then 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.870
 there are also a type of trousers 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.640
 trekking like this you can 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.800
 use as trekking pants or 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.500
 as casual pants to go for the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.120
 street because shopping or walking 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.550
 even here by madrid 'so that the 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.900
 mountaineer people identify you as the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.730
 choose the garment depending on the 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.220
 activity that you are going to do is more or 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.410
 less simple because good is also going 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.490
 with the taste of each one and so on 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.380
 etcetera but what is difficult 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.470
 I tell you from experience because I am 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.210
 a little bit high is that as a general rule 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.940
 what happens to me is that the pants 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.369
 that are good for me leg are 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.560
 cigarette cases and pants that are me 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.630
 well enough of legs like 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.310
 to be comfortable they are too wide 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.710
 and two people like me fit inside 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.570
 so I think that there also for 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.850
 general rule with those with brands 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.500
 nationals we have more luck because 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.180
 they do one more size for us not 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.590
 because as Americans are a 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.840
 a little bit taller and a little bit more 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.110
 big but I that little American 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.110
 I have
