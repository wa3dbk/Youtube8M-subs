if we go into the access thing and take
a<00:02:45.959> look<00:02:46.109> at<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.349> vault<00:02:46.560> games<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:47.190> can<00:02:47.310> see

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
a look at the vault games you can see

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.610 
a look at the vault games you can see
I've<00:02:47.670> already<00:02:47.970> bought<00:02:48.359> fifa<00:02:48.599> 14<00:02:48.989> so<00:02:49.349> that<00:02:49.409> one

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
I've already bought fifa 14 so that one

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.410 
I've already bought fifa 14 so that one
is<00:02:49.650> stayed<00:02:49.920> there<00:02:50.159> whereas<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.849> vaulted<00:02:51.269> one

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
is stayed there whereas the vaulted one

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.750 
is stayed there whereas the vaulted one
is<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.799> other<00:02:52.950> two<00:02:53.069> so<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.310> think<00:02:53.639> they<00:02:53.730> are

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
is the other two so I think they are

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.759 
is the other two so I think they are
going<00:02:53.909> to<00:02:53.970> disappear<00:02:54.389> if<00:02:54.629> you<00:02:54.750> do<00:02:54.930> disconnect

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769

the service and stop paying for
something<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:57.900> wary<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.530> does<00:02:58.680> also

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
something to be wary of is it does also

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.440 
something to be wary of is it does also
renew<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.459> if<00:02:59.549> you<00:02:59.609> put<00:02:59.730> your<00:02:59.879> card<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.299> pay
