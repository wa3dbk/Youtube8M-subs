00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.580 
of stuff just because it's just sitting
here<00:03:41.060> it's<00:03:41.209> not<00:03:41.390> stuff<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:41.810> actually<00:03:42.020> wear<00:03:42.380> it

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
here it's not stuff I actually wear it

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.920 
here it's not stuff I actually wear it
just<00:03:42.620> stuff<00:03:43.489> that<00:03:43.520> I<00:03:44.060> passed<00:03:44.360> by<00:03:44.600> when<00:03:44.780> I'm

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
just stuff that I passed by when I'm

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.150 
just stuff that I passed by when I'm
actually<00:03:45.080> looking<00:03:45.290> for<00:03:45.560> something<00:03:45.800> I<00:03:45.860> want<00:03:46.070> to

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
actually looking for something I want to

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.650 
actually looking for something I want to
wear<00:03:46.310> I'm<00:03:46.610> so<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.060> doesn't<00:03:47.239> make<00:03:47.300> sense<00:03:47.360> to

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
wear I'm so it doesn't make sense to

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.210 
wear I'm so it doesn't make sense to
hold<00:03:47.870> on<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.080> this<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.320> can<00:03:48.470> go<00:03:48.650> ahead<00:03:48.770> and<00:03:48.920> I'm

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
hold on to this I can go ahead and I'm

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.830 
hold on to this I can go ahead and I'm
going<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.459> donate<00:03:49.820> it<00:03:50.000> so<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.720> know

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
going to donate it so that you know

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.260 
going to donate it so that you know
maybe<00:03:51.320> someone<00:03:51.800> other<00:03:52.010> woman<00:03:52.340> likes<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:53.090> and

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
maybe someone other woman likes it and

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.670 
maybe someone other woman likes it and
wants<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.630> wear<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:54.020> it<00:03:54.110> just<00:03:54.260> doesn't<00:03:54.620> make

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
wants to wear it it just doesn't make

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.080 
wants to wear it it just doesn't make
sense<00:03:54.739> for<00:03:54.980> me<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.160> just<00:03:55.310> be<00:03:55.489> holding<00:03:55.760> on<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:55.880> it

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
sense for me to just be holding on to it

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.900 
sense for me to just be holding on to it
so<00:03:56.239> that's<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.140> that's<00:03:57.290> my<00:03:57.610> kids<00:03:58.610> at<00:03:58.730> school
