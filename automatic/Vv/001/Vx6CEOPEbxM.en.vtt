want to show you not show you now let's
load<00:02:08.190> these<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> graph<00:02:10.020> no<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> don't

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
load these this is a graph no I don't

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.850 
load these this is a graph no I don't
wanna<00:02:10.830> turn

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
wanna turn

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.490 
wanna turn
this<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.040> graph<00:02:13.340> on<00:02:13.550> actually<00:02:14.060> I'll<00:02:14.500> think

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
this is a graph on actually I'll think

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.180 
this is a graph on actually I'll think
that<00:02:15.560> works<00:02:15.890> as<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.880> can<00:02:17.000> see<00:02:17.300> all<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.320> magic

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
that works as you can see all the magic

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.290 
that works as you can see all the magic
happens<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.880> there<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.290> cloud<00:02:22.030> we<00:02:23.030> use

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
happens in there in the cloud we use

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.930 
happens in there in the cloud we use
internet<00:02:23.990> as<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.320> bridge<00:02:25.250> between<00:02:25.280> all<00:02:25.820> the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
internet as a bridge between all the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.690 
internet as a bridge between all the
devices<00:02:26.210> so<00:02:26.660> all<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:27.650> can<00:02:27.920> be<00:02:27.980> sink<00:02:28.430> and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
devices so all of that can be sink and

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.790 
devices so all of that can be sink and
without<00:02:29.360> being<00:02:29.660> on<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.870> very<00:02:30.170> same<00:02:30.350> network

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
without being on the very same network

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.370 
without being on the very same network
or<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.280> over<00:02:31.580> Bluetooth<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.450> way<00:02:32.600> we<00:02:32.780> do<00:02:32.960> it<00:02:32.990> we

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
or on over Bluetooth the way we do it we

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.590 
or on over Bluetooth the way we do it we
use<00:02:33.590> internet<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:35.030> really<00:02:35.300> be<00:02:35.360> in

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
use internet so you can really be in

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.140 
use internet so you can really be in
different<00:02:35.960> countries<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.470> still<00:02:36.920> see<00:02:37.280> all

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
different countries and still see all

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.040 
different countries and still see all
the<00:02:39.490> everything<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:40.640> happening<00:02:41.150> like<00:02:41.450> with

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
the everything that happening like with

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.730 
the everything that happening like with
the<00:02:42.230> with<00:02:43.010> no<00:02:43.190> delay<00:02:43.490> actually<00:02:44.560> what<00:02:45.560> you're

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
the with no delay actually what you're

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.240 
the with no delay actually what you're
seeing<00:02:46.100> here<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.850> way<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.090> works<00:02:47.420> we<00:02:48.290> anything

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
seeing here the way it works we anything

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.770 
seeing here the way it works we anything
I<00:02:49.460> am<00:02:49.520> drawing<00:02:49.760> here<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.360> goes<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
I am drawing here it goes to the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.290 
I am drawing here it goes to the
internet<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.680> bounced<00:02:51.890> back<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:52.760> even<00:02:53.210> if

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
internet and it bounced back so even if

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.910 
internet and it bounced back so even if
you<00:02:53.390> see<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.630> real<00:02:53.870> time<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.410> they're<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.680> close

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
you see a real time and they're so close

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.800 
you see a real time and they're so close
to<00:02:55.040> each<00:02:55.100> other<00:02:55.310> we<00:02:55.610> still<00:02:55.910> use<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.330> internet

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
to each other we still use the internet

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.770 
to each other we still use the internet
to<00:02:57.220> share<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:59.470> drawing<00:03:00.470> so<00:03:00.740> it's<00:03:01.370> really<00:03:01.780> the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
to share the drawing so it's really the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.890 
to share the drawing so it's really the
perfect<00:03:02.990> remote<00:03:03.470> solution<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.750> let's<00:03:05.750> say

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
perfect remote solution and let's say

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.160 
perfect remote solution and let's say
you<00:03:06.080> have<00:03:06.200> different<00:03:06.560> strokes<00:03:06.920> stroke<00:03:07.670> size

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
you have different strokes stroke size

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.640 
you have different strokes stroke size
this<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.320> thinner<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:10.460> is<00:03:10.670> even<00:03:10.820> thinner<00:03:11.180> and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
this is thinner this is even thinner and

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.550 
this is thinner this is even thinner and
of<00:03:12.650> course<00:03:12.980> we<00:03:13.130> have<00:03:13.220> different<00:03:13.610> colors<00:03:13.970> and

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
of course we have different colors and

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.790 
of course we have different colors and
once<00:03:15.560> you're<00:03:15.709> done<00:03:16.000> after<00:03:17.000> you're<00:03:17.620> done<00:03:18.620> with

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
once you're done after you're done with

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.010 
once you're done after you're done with
your<00:03:18.920> meeting<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.459> can<00:03:19.640> maybe<00:03:19.790> send<00:03:20.720> an<00:03:20.870> email

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020
