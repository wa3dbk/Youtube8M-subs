00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
to get the Suki homies that was a card

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
to get the Suki homies that was a card
that<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.409> banned<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.860> elder<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.549> think

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that was banned and elder one I think

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.429 
that was banned and elder one I think
they're<00:01:45.299> already<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> five<00:01:45.930> dollars<00:01:46.259> even

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
they're already up to five dollars even

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.170 
they're already up to five dollars even
though<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> quarter<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.490> think

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
though it was like a quarter I think

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.990 
though it was like a quarter I think

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
once things kind of settle down the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.170

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
prices will kind of start going back to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.760 
prices will kind of start going back to
normal<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.750> don't<00:02:00.899> run<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.259> there<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.469> go<00:02:01.619> for

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
normal so don't run out there and go for

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.050
