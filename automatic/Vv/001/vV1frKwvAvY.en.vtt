00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
pulling a 50-ton lowboy or step deck

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.609 
pulling a 50-ton lowboy or step deck
we're<00:01:49.780> not<00:01:49.869> sure<00:01:50.020> which<00:01:50.140> it's<00:01:50.290> going<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.470> be

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
we're not sure which it's going to be

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.039 
we're not sure which it's going to be
yet<00:01:50.860> I'm<00:01:51.040> just<00:01:51.189> trying<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.369> figure<00:01:51.490> that<00:01:51.670> out

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
yet I'm just trying to figure that out

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.149 
yet I'm just trying to figure that out
I'm<00:01:53.049> probably<00:01:53.229> gonna<00:01:53.500> have<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.770> put<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> fourth

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
I'm probably gonna have to put a fourth

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.319 
I'm probably gonna have to put a fourth
axle<00:01:54.490> on<00:01:54.579> this<00:01:54.670> truck<00:01:54.880> if<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.060> go<00:01:55.180> with<00:01:55.270> the

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
axle on this truck if I go with the

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.030 
axle on this truck if I go with the
50-ton<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.229> does<00:01:56.380> have<00:01:56.560> enough<00:01:56.650> room<00:01:56.920> on

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
50-ton so it does have enough room on

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.859 
50-ton so it does have enough room on
the<00:01:57.100> frame<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.430> looks<00:01:57.460> like<00:01:57.790> so<00:01:58.119> it'll<00:01:58.780> be<00:01:58.840> just

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
the frame it looks like so it'll be just

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.359 
the frame it looks like so it'll be just
a<00:01:59.049> matter<00:01:59.229> of<00:01:59.320> getting<00:01:59.439> an<00:01:59.590> axle<00:01:59.890> found<00:02:00.070> get<00:02:00.280> to

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
a matter of getting an axle found get to

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.560 
a matter of getting an axle found get to
put<00:02:00.549> on<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:00.820> all<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.030> fun<00:02:01.210> stuff<00:02:01.390> so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
put on and all that fun stuff so

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.760 
put on and all that fun stuff so
hopefully<00:02:02.049> that'll<00:02:02.229> be<00:02:02.320> coming<00:02:02.560> down<00:02:02.649> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
hopefully that'll be coming down the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.120 
hopefully that'll be coming down the
pipe<00:02:02.920> pretty<00:02:03.189> soon<00:02:04.590> got<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.619> lot<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:05.770> work<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.100> it

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
pipe pretty soon got a lot of work to it

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.859

with a flat top sleeper I like all of
them<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.530> like<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.980> looks<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.250> every<00:02:55.430> one<00:02:55.550> of

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
them I like the looks of every one of

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.700 
them I like the looks of every one of
them<00:02:55.730> they<00:02:55.850> each<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.150> their<00:02:56.300> own<00:02:56.560> their<00:02:57.560> own

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
them they each have their own their own

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.110 
them they each have their own their own
high<00:02:57.980> notes<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.400> their<00:02:58.490> own<00:02:58.580> low<00:02:58.730> notes

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
high notes and their own low notes

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.790 
high notes and their own low notes
I<00:02:59.270> like<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.690> Aerodyne<00:03:00.050> too<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.260> mean<00:03:00.500> it<00:03:00.620> kind

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
I like the Aerodyne too I mean it kind

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.140 
I like the Aerodyne too I mean it kind
of<00:03:00.830> has<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.130> sleek<00:03:01.430> modern<00:03:01.670> look<00:03:01.910> the

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
of has that sleek modern look the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.570 
of has that sleek modern look the
cameras<00:03:02.420> really<00:03:02.660> went<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:02.960> I<00:03:03.170> think<00:03:03.320> 94<00:03:03.800> was

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
cameras really went to I think 94 was

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.950 
cameras really went to I think 94 was
actually<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.000> first<00:03:05.150> year<00:03:05.300> for<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.600> Aerodyne

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
actually the first year for the Aerodyne

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.990 
actually the first year for the Aerodyne
2<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.740> I<00:03:07.190> don't<00:03:07.370> think<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.880> original

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
2 and I don't think this is the original

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.430 
2 and I don't think this is the original
sleeper<00:03:08.510> on<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.720> truck<00:03:08.930> because<00:03:09.110> on<00:03:09.350> the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
sleeper on the truck because on the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.840 
sleeper on the truck because on the
sanding<00:03:09.830> on<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.100> found<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.670> color

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
sanding on it I found that the color

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.140 
sanding on it I found that the color
changes<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:11.330> little<00:03:11.450> bit<00:03:11.710> the<00:03:12.940> Aerodyne<00:03:13.940> one<00:03:14.120> I

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
changes a little bit the Aerodyne one I

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.520 
changes a little bit the Aerodyne one I
think<00:03:14.300> is<00:03:14.510> what<00:03:14.660> was<00:03:14.810> originally<00:03:14.930> on<00:03:15.380> this

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
think is what was originally on this

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.930 
think is what was originally on this
truck<00:03:15.800> because<00:03:16.130> we<00:03:16.220> were<00:03:16.340> out<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.550> dealership

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
truck because we were out the dealership

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.430 
truck because we were out the dealership
looking<00:03:17.180> up<00:03:17.270> some<00:03:17.390> parts<00:03:17.630> for<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.870> top<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.350> it

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
looking up some parts for the top of it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.200 
looking up some parts for the top of it
there<00:03:18.620> they<00:03:19.310> were<00:03:19.430> saying<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.700> was<00:03:19.790> flat<00:03:20.000> glass

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
there they were saying it was flat glass

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.550 
there they were saying it was flat glass
so<00:03:20.420> I'm<00:03:20.480> assuming<00:03:20.690> that's<00:03:20.960> the<00:03:21.020> Aerodyne<00:03:21.350> one

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
so I'm assuming that's the Aerodyne one

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.800 
so I'm assuming that's the Aerodyne one
I<00:03:21.710> like<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.070> sleeper<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.430> lot<00:03:22.610> as<00:03:22.760> well<00:03:22.880> not<00:03:23.600> so

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
I like that sleeper a lot as well not so

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:24.880 
I like that sleeper a lot as well not so
sure<00:03:23.990> how<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.200> would<00:03:24.260> look<00:03:24.380> on<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:24.590> truck<00:03:24.800> I

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890
