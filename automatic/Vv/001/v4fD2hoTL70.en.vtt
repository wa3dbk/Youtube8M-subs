00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you like in every time you know someone

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.300 
you like in every time you know someone
walks<00:01:26.460> by<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:27.210> senses<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> movement<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
walks by it senses the movement and it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.420 
walks by it senses the movement and it
sprays<00:01:29.729> at<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> top<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.689> little<00:01:31.020> air<00:01:31.470> scent<00:01:31.979> and

sprays at the top a little air scent and
and<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.000> think<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> very<00:01:33.900> good<00:01:34.170> feature

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and I think that is a very good feature

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.770 
and I think that is a very good feature
because<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.040> don't<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.119> spray

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
because you don't have to you know spray

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.160 
because you don't have to you know spray
it<00:01:36.900> yourself<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.189> definitely<00:01:38.670> do<00:01:39.420> recommend

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it yourself so I definitely do recommend

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.760 
it yourself so I definitely do recommend
this<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.740> product<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.649> know
