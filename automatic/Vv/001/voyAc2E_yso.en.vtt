the game between Adam took I ever the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.540 
the game between Adam took I ever the
white<00:00:26.189> pieces<00:00:26.460> against<00:00:27.180> ratto<00:00:27.510> slough<00:00:27.900> wote

white pieces against ratto slough wote

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.549 
white pieces against ratto slough wote
savin<00:00:29.550> woke<00:00:29.990> esic<00:00:31.250> and<00:00:32.750> let's<00:00:33.750> see<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.230> took<00:00:34.290> I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
savin woke esic and let's see so took I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.209 
savin woke esic and let's see so took I
of<00:00:34.710> he<00:00:34.890> opens<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.670> e4<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.680> rattle<00:00:37.680> ah<00:00:37.860> plays

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
of he opens with e4 and rattle ah plays

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.360 
of he opens with e4 and rattle ah plays
the<00:00:38.760> Sicilian<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.530> not<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.890> six<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.280> A<00:00:41.340> six

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the Sicilian and so not as six and A six

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.799 
the Sicilian and so not as six and A six
so<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:41.969> looks<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.180> he<00:00:42.329> wants<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.600> play<00:00:42.660> an

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
so it looks like he wants to play an

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.920 
so it looks like he wants to play an
idol<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:43.140> fear<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:45.000> Gaia<00:00:45.210> plays<00:00:45.629> Bishop

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
idol or fear and so to Gaia plays Bishop

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.970 
idol or fear and so to Gaia plays Bishop
c4<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.610> Fisher<00:00:48.210> sozin<00:00:48.980> variation

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
c4 so this is the Fisher sozin variation

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.560 
c4 so this is the Fisher sozin variation
and<00:00:50.539> extremely<00:00:51.539> aggressive<00:00:51.960> weapon<00:00:53.570> so

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and extremely aggressive weapon so

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.810 
and extremely aggressive weapon so
Bishop<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.289> three<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> any<00:00:56.100> six<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.610> really

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
Bishop to be three and any six is really

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.099 
Bishop to be three and any six is really
played<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.300> defend<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.379> d5<00:00:58.829> square<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> b5

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
played to defend the d5 square so b5

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.650 
played to defend the d5 square so b5
immediately<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.739> seems<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> most

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
immediately it seems to be the most

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.340 
immediately it seems to be the most
topical<00:01:04.220> just<00:01:05.220> kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> most<00:01:05.850> aggressive

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
topical just kind of the most aggressive

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.490 
topical just kind of the most aggressive
response<00:01:07.350> guess<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.520> say<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.760> black<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
response guess you can say for black and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.490 
response guess you can say for black and
Bishop<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> g5<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:12.110> also<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> pretty<00:01:13.409> aggressive

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
Bishop to g5 is also a pretty aggressive

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.340 
Bishop to g5 is also a pretty aggressive
line<00:01:14.600> also<00:01:15.600> Queen<00:01:16.350> f3<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.939> possible<00:01:18.570> f4<00:01:19.200> has

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
line also Queen f3 as possible f4 has

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.190 
line also Queen f3 as possible f4 has
been<00:01:19.500> played<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.549> even<00:01:20.850> castles<00:01:21.450> or<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
been played and also even castles or a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.410 
been played and also even castles or a
three<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.890> White<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.369> Bishop<00:01:23.670> g5<00:01:24.090> pretty

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
three for White so Bishop g5 pretty

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
three for White so Bishop g5 pretty
aggressive<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.470> Bishop<00:01:25.979> e7<00:01:26.390> allows<00:01:27.920> Queen<00:01:28.920> f3

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
aggressive and Bishop e7 allows Queen f3

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.630 
aggressive and Bishop e7 allows Queen f3
so<00:01:30.420> maybe<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.380> don't<00:01:32.009> know<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> little

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
so maybe I don't know if it's a little

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.200 
so maybe I don't know if it's a little
too<00:01:32.909> early<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.270> mean<00:01:33.420> queen<00:01:33.720> bee<00:01:33.960> 6<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.500> possible

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
too early I mean queen bee 6 as possible

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.270 
too early I mean queen bee 6 as possible
although<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.240> believe<00:01:36.329> white<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.320> played<00:01:37.619> f4

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
although I believe white is played f4

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.999 
although I believe white is played f4

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.389 
attacking the knight and also not Bishop
d7<00:02:00.719> as<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> possibility<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> castles<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.560> 97

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399

d7 as a possibility so castles in 97
Black<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:08.780> really<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.140> opening

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
Black is just I really like the opening

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.010 
Black is just I really like the opening
for<00:02:10.590> white<00:02:10.709> because<00:02:11.099> black<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.730> always

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
for white because black is always

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.780 
for white because black is always
seems<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.620> he's<00:02:13.770> struggling<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.310> catch<00:02:14.550> his

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
seems like he's struggling to catch his

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.330 
seems like he's struggling to catch his
breath<00:02:15.320> against<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:16.500> opening<00:02:16.920> because<00:02:17.040> it's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
breath against this opening because it's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.060 
breath against this opening because it's
just<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.900> natural<00:02:19.380> placement<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070

just the the natural placement of the
pieces<00:02:20.280> for<00:02:20.580> white<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.060> so<00:02:21.270> aggressive

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
and so now brought us why he tried 95 he

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.630 
and so now brought us why he tried 95 he
wants<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.810> mean<00:02:49.800> first<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.220> all<00:02:50.370> there's<00:02:50.580> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
wants to mean first of all there's a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.510 
wants to mean first of all there's a
bunch<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.940> nasty<00:02:51.260> sacrifices<00:02:52.260> looming<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:53.490> the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
bunch of nasty sacrifices looming on the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.850 
bunch of nasty sacrifices looming on the
e6<00:02:54.060> square<00:02:54.390> with<00:02:54.810> Bishop<00:02:55.170> takes<00:02:55.320> e-cigs

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
e6 square with Bishop takes e-cigs

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.720 
e6 square with Bishop takes e-cigs
something<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.460> that<00:02:56.960> so<00:02:57.960> black<00:02:58.260> 95<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.550> going

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
something like that so black 95 is going

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.080 
something like that so black 95 is going
to<00:02:59.790> go<00:02:59.910> ahead<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.090> defend<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.900> maybe

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
to go ahead and defend that and maybe

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.790 
to go ahead and defend that and maybe
maybe<00:03:03.090> black<00:03:03.570> can<00:03:03.780> even<00:03:04.020> start<00:03:04.320> thinking

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
maybe black can even start thinking

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.010 
maybe black can even start thinking
about<00:03:04.980> something<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.210> know<00:03:06.330> attacking<00:03:06.930> on

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
about something you know attacking on

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.020 
about something you know attacking on
the<00:03:07.080> kinks<00:03:07.380> on<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.770> queenside<00:03:08.010> with<00:03:08.520> be<00:03:08.700> four

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
the kinks on the queenside with be four

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.720 
the kinks on the queenside with be four
and<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> pond<00:03:10.830> as<00:03:10.980> well<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.430> 95

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
and in the a pond as well so 95

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.900 
and in the a pond as well so 95
encounters<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:15.260> violent<00:03:16.260> reputation<00:03:16.700> from<00:03:17.700> to

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
encounters a violent reputation from to

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.840 
encounters a violent reputation from to
kya<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.959> starts<00:03:19.170> with<00:03:19.380> night<00:03:19.590> f5<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.700> was

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
kya and it starts with night f5 so I was

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.210 
kya and it starts with night f5 so I was
very<00:03:20.880> common<00:03:21.480> for<00:03:21.690> white<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.930> second<00:03:22.740> night<00:03:22.890> on

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
very common for white to second night on

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.730 
very common for white to second night on
the<00:03:23.550> d5<00:03:23.940> or<00:03:24.270> f5<00:03:24.480> squares<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:25.470> variation

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
the d5 or f5 squares in this variation

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.550 
the d5 or f5 squares in this variation
and<00:03:26.360> in<00:03:27.360> this<00:03:27.570> game<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:27.840> mean<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.170> really<00:03:28.200> shows

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
and in this game I mean it really shows

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.949 
and in this game I mean it really shows
why<00:03:28.770> so<00:03:29.130> he<00:03:29.250> busts<00:03:29.490> open<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:30.000> e-file<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:30.840> now

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
why so he busts open the e-file so now

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.640 
why so he busts open the e-file so now
this<00:03:31.110> rook<00:03:31.410> is<00:03:31.560> going<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.770> be<00:03:31.860> active<00:03:32.250> first<00:03:33.650> he

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
this rook is going to be active first he

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.100 
this rook is going to be active first he
starts<00:03:35.130> by<00:03:36.120> messing<00:03:36.570> up<00:03:36.660> blacks<00:03:36.900> pawn

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
starts by messing up blacks pawn

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.380 
starts by messing up blacks pawn
structure<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.800> Bishop<00:03:38.040> takes<00:03:38.370> f6<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.090> now

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
structure so Bishop takes f6 and now

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.680 
structure so Bishop takes f6 and now
Bishop<00:03:39.900> takes<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:42.030> just<00:03:42.300> doesn't<00:03:42.570> make<00:03:42.600> any

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
Bishop takes this just doesn't make any

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.990 
Bishop takes this just doesn't make any
sense<00:03:42.990> it's<00:03:43.500> check<00:03:43.890> why<00:03:44.370> it's<00:03:44.490> picking<00:03:44.790> up<00:03:44.850> a

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
sense it's check why it's picking up a

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.400 
sense it's check why it's picking up a
rug<00:03:46.250> yeah<00:03:47.250> make<00:03:47.640> makes<00:03:47.880> no<00:03:48.030> sense<00:03:48.300> so<00:03:48.540> Bishop

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
rug yeah make makes no sense so Bishop

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.840 
rug yeah make makes no sense so Bishop
takes<00:03:49.680> f6<00:03:50.100> forces<00:03:50.700> G<00:03:51.120> takes<00:03:51.360> f6<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.050> now<00:03:52.890> 95<00:03:53.610> so

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
takes f6 forces G takes f6 and now 95 so

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.250 
takes f6 forces G takes f6 and now 95 so
another<00:03:54.030> just<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.390> know<00:03:54.540> an<00:03:54.750> accurate<00:03:55.110> move

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
another just you know an accurate move

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.560 
another just you know an accurate move
why<00:03:55.350> not<00:03:55.500> go<00:03:55.620> ahead<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.860> stick<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.160> night<00:03:56.340> in

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
why not go ahead and stick the night in

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.570 
why not go ahead and stick the night in
and<00:03:57.680> open<00:03:58.680> things<00:03:58.890> up<00:03:59.010> like<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.370> because

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
and open things up like that because

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.810 
and open things up like that because
maybe<00:04:00.450> if<00:04:00.720> white<00:04:00.930> plays<00:04:01.110> fontes<00:04:01.800> Bishop<00:04:02.610> d7

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
maybe if white plays fontes Bishop d7

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.590 
maybe if white plays fontes Bishop d7
and<00:04:03.950> maybe<00:04:04.950> 95<00:04:05.400> now<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:06.000> doesn't<00:04:06.300> work<00:04:06.390> quite

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
and maybe 95 now it doesn't work quite

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.690 
and maybe 95 now it doesn't work quite
as<00:04:06.660> good<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.350> know<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.560> why<00:04:08.100> really<00:04:08.400> wants<00:04:08.610> to

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
as good you know the why really wants to

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.430 
as good you know the why really wants to
occupy<00:04:09.060> d5<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.810> night<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:12.020> just<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.350> know

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
occupy d5 of the night so just you know

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.350 
occupy d5 of the night so just you know
a<00:04:13.470> point<00:04:13.830> where<00:04:13.980> those<00:04:14.790> little<00:04:15.180> in-between

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
a point where those little in-between

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.120 
a point where those little in-between
moves<00:04:15.900> can<00:04:16.140> really<00:04:16.380> make<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.650> difference<00:04:16.680> so

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
moves can really make the difference so

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.760 
moves can really make the difference so
95<00:04:17.959> definitely<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> good<00:04:19.080> example<00:04:19.470> just<00:04:19.650> go

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
95 definitely a good example just go

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.700 
95 definitely a good example just go
ahead<00:04:19.830> and<00:04:19.950> attacking<00:04:20.280> v6<00:04:21.380> Queen<00:04:22.380> da<00:04:22.530> it's

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
ahead and attacking v6 Queen da it's

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.920 
ahead and attacking v6 Queen da it's
probably<00:04:22.950> forced<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.640> now<00:04:24.390> just<00:04:24.600> pawn<00:04:24.750> takes

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
probably forced and now just pawn takes

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.750 
probably forced and now just pawn takes
so

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
so

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.000 
so
looking<00:04:27.360> at<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.720> material<00:04:28.350> I<00:04:28.440> believe<00:04:28.740> why<00:04:28.950> it

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
looking at the material I believe why it

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.750 
looking at the material I believe why it

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
in the position the rock on a eight so

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.450 
in the position the rock on a eight so
black<00:04:39.090> starts<00:04:39.540> with<00:04:39.750> rook<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.140> seven<00:04:40.560> defending

the rock and more importantly laterally

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.530 
the rock and more importantly laterally
defending<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.010> bishop<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:45.030> that's<00:04:45.270> one

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
defending the bishop so that's one

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.100 
defending the bishop so that's one
tactic<00:04:46.050> here<00:04:46.710> why<00:04:46.950> could<00:04:47.370> cash<00:04:47.790> in<00:04:48.150> play

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
tactic here why could cash in play

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.340 
tactic here why could cash in play
something<00:04:49.410> like<00:04:49.560> Knight<00:04:49.860> takes<00:04:50.160> f6<00:04:51.170> which<00:04:52.170> I

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
something like Knight takes f6 which I

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.400 
something like Knight takes f6 which I
kind<00:04:52.890> of<00:04:53.540> you<00:04:54.540> know<00:04:54.570> kinda<00:04:55.020> would<00:04:55.170> want<00:04:55.320> to

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
kind of you know kinda would want to

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.390 
kind of you know kinda would want to
play<00:04:55.560> myself<00:04:55.770> Knight<00:04:56.310> takes<00:04:56.460> f6<00:04:56.880> seems<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.480> be

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
play myself Knight takes f6 seems to be

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.700 
play myself Knight takes f6 seems to be
just<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.580> very<00:04:59.790> natural<00:05:00.030> move<00:05:00.540> but<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:00.900> guess<00:05:01.260> it

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
just a very natural move but I guess it

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.440 
just a very natural move but I guess it
doesn't<00:05:02.040> quite<00:05:02.370> work<00:05:02.490> I<00:05:02.850> mean<00:05:03.000> night<00:05:03.180> takes

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
doesn't quite work I mean night takes

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.270 
doesn't quite work I mean night takes
let's<00:05:03.720> say<00:05:03.870> something<00:05:04.290> like<00:05:04.440> this<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.070> maybe

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
let's say something like this and maybe

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.820 
let's say something like this and maybe
black<00:05:05.610> gets<00:05:05.970> he<00:05:06.870> gets<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:07.230> actually<00:05:07.470> use<00:05:07.650> this

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
black gets he gets to actually use this

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.450 
black gets he gets to actually use this
Bishop<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:09.410> then<00:05:10.410> maybe<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.830> world<00:05:11.070> can<00:05:11.220> open

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
Bishop and then maybe the world can open

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.420 
Bishop and then maybe the world can open
up<00:05:12.410> maybe<00:05:13.410> black<00:05:13.680> is<00:05:13.860> going<00:05:14.040> to<00:05:14.100> be<00:05:14.190> kind<00:05:14.340> of

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
up maybe black is going to be kind of

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.640 
up maybe black is going to be kind of
okay<00:05:14.550> so<00:05:14.790> Knight<00:05:15.180> takes<00:05:15.390> f6<00:05:15.810> you<00:05:16.050> no<00:05:16.140> no<00:05:16.320> no
