00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.230
 portal glass and finger 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.599
 all mobile entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.220
 hello friends with you except Jesus and 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.980
 I find my cozy hangar 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.170
 considering your new acquisition from 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.640
 6 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.859
 let's take a quick look at it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.109
 characteristics of a glass of saw 6 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.160
 his gun is pretty weak for 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.619
 eighth level 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.050
 in fact we have the same cannon 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.710
 what stands at and all 7 penetration levels 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.140
 which is 175 and the average damage 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.040
 390 but this gun has a phantom 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.770
 perk Soviet guard as regards 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.780
 mobility here is not so bad from 6 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.110
 not inferior to its competitors in level 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.820
 but don't say it takes the lead 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.770
 gradually moving to the main Kiev 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.020
 armor his armor can forgive you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.810
 many mistakes i won't tell you that 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.830
 his forehead and sides will be 6 to 100 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.720
 millimeters of armor 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.039
 which are located under very 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.079
 rational angles 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.299
 I'll just tell you relying on my 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.549
 personal experience that there are six this tank 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.369
 which you can safely travel to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.799
 the enemy and afraid to take extra damage like me 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.109
 I think of 6 is the best premium tank for 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.760
 Nagu and a among eighth levels but this 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.580
 my personal opinion 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.450
 As for consumables, I think that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.760
 first need to put 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.860
 Irine second set universal 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.330
 recovery kit and the third is 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.110
 adrenaline and what to put out 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.010
 equipment 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.650
 Of course, the rammer 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.900
 vertical guidance and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.140
 either fan or reinforced drives 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.140
 tips 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.750
 and here we are in the battle on the map of the lost 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.090
 the temple i went to town 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.220
 as there are shelters from which 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.740
 we can talk and realize our 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.539
 alpha strike 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.610
 the first thing I do is charge gold but how not 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.530
 We know who will meet me first and you need to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.530
 realize each shot 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.280
 I roll out a rhombus as the left can 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.370
 be enemies and for sure 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.959
 T29 we throw in the harp with damage and quickly 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.000
 knocked down thereby thereby do not understand 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.310
 do you understand that t29 already need to get 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.220
 just stopping t29 me 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.159
 Naturally does not break, I became reduced 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.470
 shot t29 goes to the hangar 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.319
 climb onto another tank of course this 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.590
 it was possible to make an ordinary piece of paper but 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.120
 so for sure 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.849
 do you understand that we are being pushed from behind 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.060
 points and need to take any 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.500
 actions understand that it is necessary to press 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.150
 I roll out giving thirty-four damage 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.079
 rolled back 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.480
 I'm waiting for reloading, I see that 34 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:08.799
 rolls off rolls out and just 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.489
 calm and i get in this moment i 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.900
 I realized that m103 is worth aft stern 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:19.239
 I switch to the bosses just 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:23.590
 rolling out iso live spill on our 357 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:26.290
 allies get m103 i understand that 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.840
 need to come back and fend off st chic 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.870
 and while I return I would like to say 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.120
 about one minus 6 this is his tower on 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.169
 pretty easy way through it 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.230
 classmates 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:41.549
 I do not say that the cover of his tower 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.049
 punch even the sixth and seventh levels 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.299
 here I understand that you need to push 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.650
 throws and twenties from the guard naturally 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.379
 I think I get to get 50 four 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.760
 reloading on gold throw and 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.790
 Naturally, I have no luck with alpha strike 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.069
 am d 20 somehow punches me 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.620
 most likely in the tower I just 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.949
 I roll out and in bash to choose him with 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.949
 the guard 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.620
 I see in the distance from 3 I have three frags and all 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.060
 tell me the guy take the warrior 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.790
 I'm just going for the weight of the third 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.620
 soaking up some little street 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.560
 I throw again with the guard gets any 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.670
 caterpillar third recharge well and 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.700
 course owls potsa flazhochek and it was 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.710
 the most common fight on IS-6 if you
