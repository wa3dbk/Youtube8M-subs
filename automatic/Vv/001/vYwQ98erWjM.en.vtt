00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.420 
easier to understand how this is done in
case<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.689> did<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:49.020> explain<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.409> very<00:01:49.560> well<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
case I did not explain it very well and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.230 
case I did not explain it very well and
you<00:01:50.549> see<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.149> does<00:01:51.720> work<00:01:52.079> mm-hmm<00:01:53.060> he's<00:01:54.060> my

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you see that it does work mm-hmm he's my

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.450 
you see that it does work mm-hmm he's my
perspective<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.140> I'll<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> exact<00:01:56.430> same

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
perspective of it I'll do the exact same

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.910 
perspective of it I'll do the exact same
thing<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.060> trade<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.710> except<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:58.890> really

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
thing just trade it except I'm really

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.850 
thing just trade it except I'm really
offering<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.549> shield<00:01:59.969> instead<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.630> weapon<00:02:00.960> he

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
offering a shield instead of a weapon he

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.749 
offering a shield instead of a weapon he
works<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.280> exactly<00:02:02.880> same<00:02:03.000> way

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
works the exactly same way

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.149 
works the exactly same way
and<00:02:05.390> yeah<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:05.810> put<00:02:06.200> up<00:02:06.319> the<00:02:06.439> same<00:02:06.679> shield<00:02:06.920> and
