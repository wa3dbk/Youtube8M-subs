before we decided who we were going to
work<00:02:41.370> with<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:41.910> was<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> way<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.630> identifying

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
work with this was a way of identifying

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.120 
work with this was a way of identifying
options<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.720> that's<00:02:45.900> why<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.140> said<00:02:46.590> before<00:02:46.770> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
options and that's why I said before the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.370 
options and that's why I said before the
more<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.489> see<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.420> company<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.200> work

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380

with them then they're probably gonna be
good<00:03:40.980> for<00:03:41.130> me<00:03:41.250> as<00:03:41.400> well<00:03:41.579> it<00:03:42.180> helps<00:03:42.720> I<00:03:42.930> can't<00:03:43.380> say

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
good for me as well it helps I can't say

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.710 
good for me as well it helps I can't say
it's<00:03:43.739> my<00:03:43.920> determining<00:03:44.579> factor<00:03:45.030> but<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.420> helps

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
it's my determining factor but it helps

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.630 
it's my determining factor but it helps
I<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.200> think<00:03:46.709> for<00:03:46.980> me<00:03:47.130> that's<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.549> most

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
I I think for me that's the most

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.780 
I I think for me that's the most
critical<00:03:48.299> factor<00:03:48.720> an<00:03:49.170> actual<00:03:50.040> reference<00:03:50.549> from

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
critical factor an actual reference from

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.759 
critical factor an actual reference from
somebody<00:03:51.239> who<00:03:51.450> with<00:03:51.600> contractors<00:03:52.290> don't<00:03:52.500> work

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
somebody who with contractors don't work

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.009 
somebody who with contractors don't work
for<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.579> customer<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.209> very<00:03:54.269> happy<00:03:54.840> and

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
for and that customer is very happy and

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.479 
for and that customer is very happy and
they<00:03:55.140> recommend<00:03:55.650> them<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.829> me

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
they recommend them to me

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.069 
they recommend them to me
that's<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.030> most<00:03:57.180> important<00:03:57.660> thing<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.930> all

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
that's the most important thing of all

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.299 
that's the most important thing of all
beyond<00:03:58.470> any<00:03:58.980> advertising<00:03:59.850> piece
