00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:14.580
 dvd critic another trailer check and 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:16.650
 Although not too sure how thick you are 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:25.220
 written earth and left to death 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.220
 nothing was new 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.880
 bounty hunter yes nothing since ten 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.880
 years 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.960
 he is the most dangerous man on the planet 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:43.699
 the track was 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:51.570
 peter premium so again from the beginning 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:56.000
 bread and games a little three little 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.000
 as you know where this leads 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:16.760
 it's actually time 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760
 expired 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.830
 yes let the guy off the leash 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.830
 do you want to hide from the darkness 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.390
 I think with this trailer you can see 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.010
 that fans of pitch black or 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.390
 riddick chronicles of a warrior here 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.460
 fully come at your expense we have 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.260
 a similar design and light construction similar 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.800
 feeling me personally is often a little bit 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.800
 to draw 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.870
 let yourself be action-heavy and to story and 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.700
 let yourself but what the hell it is for 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.560
 the fangemeine tailored roddick 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.560
 brings the universe film from the 19th 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.180
 september 2013 in German cinemas 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.980
 once told the story of this 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.150
 war on the left behind 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.890
 a planet of the sun 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.600
 burned there with the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.250
 extraterrestrial life regularly 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.160
 only need to confront it reddig 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.690
 meanwhile stronger than ever before 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.520
 he wants to get away from this planet 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.890
 and now because of an emergency call 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.930
 this attracts two ships, some of them 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.790
 new grouping better and stronger 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.440
 Bounty hunter and then another ship 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.390
 which will be a reunion with one 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.520
 old quotes give friend 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.170
 have played a lot by karl so have 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.270
 we bind these and carla as the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.980
 most famous but also a wrestler like 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.810
 dave bautista who plays here and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.810
 somehow quite a genre 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.010
 Compliant in casting ultimately and 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.240
 I'm curious as worthy too 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.310
 The film will definitely be on offer 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.050
 I think the cinema is going strong because 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.580
 He has a large fan base for a long time 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.380
 you wanted more and ultimately the 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.780
 row vin diesel also only the right one 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.860
 megastar made react as trader 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.630
 please write in the comments 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.700
 I think it is not content 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.470
 big numbers then technically technically 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.390
 but a big one and it will open 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.190
 carbon and testosterone muscles 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.709
 are the whole just dived because this 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.260
 scifi look there is worse 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.400
 Good genre costume probably at the end 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.600
 okay, I'm looking forward to your opinion 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.640
 please write in the comments 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.230
 that 's about me for now 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.790
 with this trailer load a check 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.530
 thumb there if you let it stay if 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.970
 Do not look at the last two movies 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.890
 reviews over or on twitter and 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.660
 want to write facebook about movies 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.430
 or not this or my second channel 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.290
 if you do not want to miss any videos 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.750
 let it stay if it does 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.610
 but only you decide tomorrow 15 o'clock 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.620

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.290
