how<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.370> took<00:02:57.579> a<00:02:57.730> chance<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.450> sat<00:02:59.230> on<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
how you took a chance and sat on the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.410 
how you took a chance and sat on the
table<00:02:59.829> instead<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.489> just<00:03:00.640> stand<00:03:01.150> by<00:03:01.359> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
table instead of just stand by the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.740 
table instead of just stand by the
perfume<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.260> think<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.190> was<00:03:03.370> great<00:03:03.669> you<00:03:04.600> took

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
perfume I think that was great you took

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.439 
perfume I think that was great you took
a<00:03:04.900> risk<00:03:05.190> but<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:06.609> paid<00:03:07.269> off

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:07.449 
a risk but it paid off

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:08.250 
a risk but it paid off
because<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.900> have<00:03:07.989> a

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
because you have a

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.610 
because you have a
