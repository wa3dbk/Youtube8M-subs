00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:06.490 
let's go as a map here the beach image

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.650 
let's go as a map here the beach image
is<00:00:06.550> going<00:00:06.729> to<00:00:06.790> be<00:00:06.850> going<00:00:07.060> through<00:00:07.300> different

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
is going to be going through different

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.450 
is going to be going through different
bail<00:00:08.650> springs<00:00:09.010> to<00:00:09.250> suit<00:00:09.430> different

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
bail springs to suit different

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.940 
bail springs to suit different
applications<00:00:10.300> and<00:00:10.540> what's<00:00:11.050> to<00:00:11.290> be<00:00:11.379> used<00:00:11.620> with

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
applications and what's to be used with

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.890 
applications and what's to be used with
what<00:00:12.129> camshaft<00:00:12.879> so<00:00:13.209> we'll<00:00:13.749> go<00:00:13.839> through

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
what camshaft so we'll go through

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.600 
what camshaft so we'll go through
different<00:00:14.650> bits<00:00:14.889> and<00:00:14.980> pieces<00:00:15.219> with<00:00:15.370> locks<00:00:15.549> and

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
different bits and pieces with locks and

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.940 
different bits and pieces with locks and
retainers<00:00:16.120> single<00:00:16.960> springs<00:00:17.230> versus<00:00:17.560> doubles

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
retainers single springs versus doubles

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.380 
retainers single springs versus doubles
when<00:00:18.070> they're<00:00:18.220> needed<00:00:18.369> and<00:00:18.670> we're<00:00:19.240> going<00:00:19.360> to

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
when they're needed and we're going to

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.540 
when they're needed and we're going to
go<00:00:19.480> through<00:00:19.690> that<00:00:19.780> for<00:00:20.050> you<00:00:20.140> right<00:00:20.290> now

supply steel locks and retain them into
the<00:00:49.780> machine<00:00:50.050> unit<00:00:50.379> rather<00:00:50.620> than<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.920> pressed

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
the machine unit rather than the pressed

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.729 
the machine unit rather than the pressed
unit<00:00:51.519> we<00:00:51.609> just<00:00:51.640> find<00:00:52.059> that<00:00:52.210> we<00:00:53.109> when<00:00:53.499> we<00:00:53.589> do

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
dolls it's not a bad piece of safety

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.389 
dolls it's not a bad piece of safety
it's<00:01:01.809> something<00:01:02.139> that<00:01:02.289> instead<00:01:03.010> of<00:01:03.069> being<00:01:03.280> is

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
it's something that instead of being is

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.350 
it's something that instead of being is
to<00:01:03.519> Pristina<00:01:03.940> where<00:01:04.120> they<00:01:04.210> just

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
to Pristina where they just

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.210 
to Pristina where they just
mass-produced<00:01:05.260> as<00:01:05.409> a<00:01:05.530> machine<00:01:05.860> and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
mass-produced as a machine and

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.160 
mass-produced as a machine and
intolerance<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:06.760> a<00:01:06.790> lot<00:01:07.090> closer<00:01:07.689> than<00:01:07.899> the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
intolerance is a lot closer than the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.359 
intolerance is a lot closer than the
factory<00:01:08.409> unit<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:08.920> it's<00:01:09.040> a<00:01:09.070> little<00:01:09.219> bit<00:01:09.310> more

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
factory unit so it's a little bit more

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.649 
factory unit so it's a little bit more
safety<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:09.909> your<00:01:10.060> when<00:01:10.149> you<00:01:10.240> guys<00:01:10.329> start

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
safety in your when you guys start

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.870 
safety in your when you guys start
running<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:11.469> camshafts<00:01:12.040> with<00:01:12.130> big<00:01:12.430> lift<00:01:12.640> and

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
running the camshafts with big lift and

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.550 
running the camshafts with big lift and
duration<00:01:13.390> yeah<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:13.960> little<00:01:14.259> bit<00:01:14.350> of<00:01:14.409> safety

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
duration yeah a little bit of safety

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.800 
duration yeah a little bit of safety
doesn't<00:01:15.219> doesn't<00:01:15.460> hurt<00:01:15.670> at<00:01:15.790> all<00:01:15.880> so<00:01:16.450> basically

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
doesn't doesn't hurt at all so basically

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.440 
doesn't doesn't hurt at all so basically
on<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.020> india<00:01:17.290> is<00:01:18.130> what<00:01:18.280> we<00:01:18.340> call<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.520> pack<00:01:18.789> 625
