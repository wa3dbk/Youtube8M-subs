00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.860
 OK? 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.540

 That's awful... 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.360
 Emeralds are too rare ... 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.440
 Imagine, if they were not rare ... 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.860
 We would trade all day! 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.120
 So we have so many of them! 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:11.000
 If emeralds were not rare 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640
 YAY !!! 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.560

 MEANWHILE... 

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:41.728

00:02:43.928 --> 00:02:44.508

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:00.708
 10 HOURS LATER ... 

00:03:07.808 --> 00:03:09.808
 Okay, seriously ... 

00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:12.648
 Why are so many emeralds here? 

00:03:12.728 --> 00:03:15.748
 Do I ask a lot? 

00:03:15.888 --> 00:03:18.448

00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:33.428

 That was so exhausting ... 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.160
 I'm so tired... 

00:05:05.328 --> 00:05:07.868
 I will go and take a nap ... 

00:05:22.248 --> 00:05:24.148
 Finally... 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.540
 No players ... 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.440
 Now I can take a nap ... 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.040
 I do not want to act for a long time now ... 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.440
 WHAT ARE ALL THESE NOISE ?! 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.300
 Oh no 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.160
 LEAVE ME ALONE!!! 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.120
