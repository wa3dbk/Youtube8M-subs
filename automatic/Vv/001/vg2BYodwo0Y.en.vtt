00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.370
 qatar 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.070
 in this video we will see 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.099
 people small limitation that is that I found in the f1 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.789
 it cost me a bit of work for closing berlanga sun and two methods 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.460
 to make a gesture that we are going to do for the moment I am going to talk to you 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.640
 my method is the method that you discovered is to do it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.860
 the result 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.079
 that sometimes I need 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.140
 is to duplicate photographs percent in the trump we can work with copies 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.710
 virtual that we will see later what are the virtual copies 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.810
 but the ex oncca does not allow us to work with duplicate photos is like 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.460
 a little bit special 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 as for the duplicate photos then 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.200
 for example 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.070
 these pictures of alexandra's pop are on another computer are not in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.670
 my local hard drive 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.540
 they are in our computer 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.820
 that I have connected mr 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.090
 if I want to 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.220
 percent copy these three pictures 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.560
 the hard drive 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.950
 boa let's work first 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.420
 with only one 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.500
 is the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.830
 0 9 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.570
 78 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.330
 per hundred is tweets we can easily drag the photograph 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.570
 well where the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.950
 that we have to copy the flight to put in me 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.980
 2008 blog folder and we are seeing 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.870
 a plus sign is usually saying this sign 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.210
 it means that we are copying 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.159
 but we are not copying but we moved our photograph here 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.130
 we had 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.560
 three photographs and the time to make the supposed copy 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.640
 we see that our photographs disappeared 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.310
 we have that is the number 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.879
 be a 9 78 goya 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.099
 to my computer 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.279
 desktop 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.450
 for one hundrerd 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.479
 said 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.479
 Alexandra 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.549
 siex andorra 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.719
 here it is 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.399
 i will see 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.679
 that disappeared 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.679
 of my other computer's hard drive 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.579
 come on we have the 77 intel to 77 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.730
 five years 70 then it's very dangerous because 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.379
 for a hundred since I just removed a photograph from my other computer 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.559
 i the person who is on our computer did not even know then 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.629
 let's go back the 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.929
 aa the computer where it was and let's see 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:59.589
 that here and it appeared 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.429
 the photo 0 9 78 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:03.639
 then good 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:09.369
 This cel the case the explanation from the case when I need to duplicate 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.109
 Photographs 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.449
 and pass them 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.779
 to adam and hard drive then we will select 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.949
 the three photographs that are 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.499
 in the computer 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.169
 this is remote 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.089
 i will go 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.089
 to the panel p export 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.879
 you're going to see this panel in detail 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.469
 but here what we are going to do is export them to the original format 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.469
 we are going to record you in the same folder 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.249
 we will oppose in the photos 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.859
 osasuna your folder 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.379
 that is called copies and we're going 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:48.429
 Add 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.969
 to this catalog then here what is the fact doing 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:53.789
 party 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:55.010
 I think 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.559
 one your folder 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:59.629
 inside the background is that it's called boc 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.159
 alexandra 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.609
 these three copies then what we do here is drag this folder 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.869
 our blog 2008 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:13.869
 and here yes in this case if you ask us 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:19.359
 to move we agree that they disappear from this photograph of this 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.729
 forgiveness folder and they appear 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.270
 to move our funds in this way we already have 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.060
 in these three copies 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.580
 on our local hard drive 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.580
 and our three photographs 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.210
 original 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.210
 in the main computer 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.539
 for other reasons 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.539
 in a future with optimism is being aware 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.279
 other tasks 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.829
 the other
