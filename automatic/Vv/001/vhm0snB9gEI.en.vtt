 and then my name is gundula 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:13.889
 There is no book about the past year. 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.359
 purchased a plot last year 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.260
 here on the waste ground decided to build 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.650
 family nest house we have turned 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.220
 small 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.050
 and began to move than to heat gas 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 no 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.450
 spend long dear winter on the nose we 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 thought 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:41.329
 electric boiler drove canoes of hope 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.370
 buy cheap powerful vectra boiler 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.739
 ring road to see 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.510
 name boilers fictional boilers 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.230
 we went there managers became us 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.930
 offer or spend 220 volts 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.520
 Naturally high power was not there 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.129
 on the square 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.049
 confuse us they are not designed then at 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.570
 we were told that they have such a stove 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:20.189
 which is much cheaper 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:23.640
 electricity and supply will heat our house in 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.240
 Overall, the choice fell on this stove along with 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.799
 stove 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.909
 here came the experts did all 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.580
 strapping politikam battery in general all 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:41.500
 all our whims fulfilled 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:46.620
 and that's about wintered with this stove 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:51.450
 Top on their gash my tickets that 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:57.720
 bought again 300 then here offered 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:04.030
 9 to hear what is not 3 times cheaper and 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:07.120
 But in this bunker did not work out 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.960
 us a day two bags with this terrible 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:15.600
 the world with those was 3 to 1 case about 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.760
 the reliability of this stove this winter 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.350
 when there was a strong wind us not here 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.610
 was but said that 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.910
 broke the wires and disconnected 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.480
 electricity electricity was not 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.650
 hours 5 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.870
 while we arrived here 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.180
 thought it would be necessary to run this stove 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:44.010
 because she 's still in the computer 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.120
 come she works in general daniel 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.890
 electricity outage for some 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:55.390
 time as far as I remember then figured out 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.780
 until ten o'clock here are the coals that 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:05.440
 inside they remain the third 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:08.550
 this time on these charcoal and if 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.530
 during this period of time electricity 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:19.510
 fall without the participation of the person herself 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:22.300
 starts up and clever many appliances for 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.640
 I can set the temperature to 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.550
 Every day she is watching 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.830

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:35.170
 two baths hot water we put it not 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.340
 at full power at half tucano on 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:44.560
 60 percent because 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:47.799
 it is a stock of our square here this 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.099
