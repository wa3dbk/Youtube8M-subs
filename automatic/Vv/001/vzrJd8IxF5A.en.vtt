scissors and hot glue so the first step

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.220 
scissors and hot glue so the first step
is<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.710> make<00:00:16.980> evenly<00:00:17.699> spaced<00:00:18.119> pieces<00:00:18.960> of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
is just to make evenly spaced pieces of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.769 
is just to make evenly spaced pieces of
cardboard<00:00:19.980> out<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> your<00:00:20.699> paper<00:00:21.060> towels<00:00:21.330> or

cardboard out of your paper towels or
toilet<00:00:21.810> paper<00:00:22.380> roll<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.640> literally<00:00:23.910> try

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
toilet paper roll you just literally try

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.660 
toilet paper roll you just literally try
to<00:00:24.689> make<00:00:24.900> them<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.289> evenly<00:00:25.800> spaced<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.430> can

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
to make them as evenly spaced as you can

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.670 
to make them as evenly spaced as you can
because<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.359> are<00:00:27.420> aren't<00:00:27.750> even<00:00:28.289> then<00:00:28.560> it

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
because if they are aren't even then it

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.500 
because if they are aren't even then it
makes<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> design<00:00:29.369> uneven<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.300> little

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
makes the design uneven and a little

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.380 
makes the design uneven and a little
lopsided<00:00:30.740> but<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.579> little<00:00:33.090> bit<00:00:33.239> off

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
lopsided but if it's a little bit off

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.299 
lopsided but if it's a little bit off
it's<00:00:33.719> not<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> big<00:00:34.350> deal<00:00:34.380> mine<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> little

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
it's not a big deal mine was a little

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.900 
it's not a big deal mine was a little
bit<00:00:35.579> off<00:00:38.629> then<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:40.110> glue<00:00:40.410> either<00:00:41.010> four<00:00:41.670> pieces

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
bit off then you glue either four pieces

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.209 
bit off then you glue either four pieces
or<00:00:42.300> five<00:00:42.660> pieces<00:00:42.989> together<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.829> make<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
or five pieces together to make a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.910 
or five pieces together to make a
cluster<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.969> kind<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> looks<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.600> star<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
cluster it kind of looks like a star the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
cluster it kind of looks like a star the
finished<00:00:47.370> design<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> show<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.480> with

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
finished design that I show you is with

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.389 
finished design that I show you is with
five<00:00:48.960> pieces<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.739> here<00:00:49.980> I'm<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
glue and put glue in between the two

glue and put glue in between the two
pieces<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.730> cardboard<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:57.660> hold<00:00:58.020> them

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
pieces of cardboard and then hold them

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.560 
pieces of cardboard and then hold them
together<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.890> second<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.510> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
together for a second it's kind of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.689 
together for a second it's kind of
self-explanatory<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.590> glue<00:01:01.980> pieces<00:01:02.399> of

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
self-explanatory just glue pieces of

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.240 
self-explanatory just glue pieces of
cardboard<00:01:02.969> together<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.080> fun<00:01:04.470> Khufu

four-piece<00:01:12.659> cluster<00:01:13.080> looks<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.700> now<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
four-piece cluster looks like now you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.520 
four-piece cluster looks like now you
just<00:01:15.030> take<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.540> rest<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.990> your<00:01:16.200> cardboard

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
pieces and fill in the empty spaces so

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
pieces and fill in the empty spaces so
same<00:01:20.130> process<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.939> glue<00:01:21.330> stick<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
same process just glue stick the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.499 
same process just glue stick the
cardboard<00:01:22.560> hold<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> second<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.180> try

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
cardboard hold for a second you can try

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.630 
cardboard hold for a second you can try
using<00:01:24.780> other<00:01:25.200> kinds<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.770> glue<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.220> Elmer's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
using other kinds of glue like Elmer's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.609 
using other kinds of glue like Elmer's
glue<00:01:26.850> or<00:01:27.000> superglue<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.229> use<00:01:28.409> hot

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
glue or superglue but I just use hot

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
glue or superglue but I just use hot
glue<00:01:28.650> because<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.640> easy<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
glue because it's really easy and it

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.569 
glue because it's really easy and it
dries<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.200> quickly<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.400> why<00:01:32.549> it's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
dries really quickly see that's why it's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.219 
dries really quickly see that's why it's
lopsided<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.720> does<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.079> has

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
lopsided because it does it has

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.859 
lopsided because it does it has
different<00:01:34.590> shaped<00:01:35.579> cardboard<00:01:36.240> pieces<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
different shaped cardboard pieces and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
different shaped cardboard pieces and
then<00:01:37.500> keep<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.400> until<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> size

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
then keep going until you get the size

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
then keep going until you get the size
and<00:01:40.079> shape<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.799> desire<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.729> how

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and shape that you desire this is how

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.030 
and shape that you desire this is how
big<00:01:42.090> mine<00:01:42.420> ended<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:42.899> being<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.680> want<00:01:43.979> to

big mine ended up being I do want to
make<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.520> little<00:01:44.729> bit<00:01:44.970> bigger<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.479> doesn't

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
