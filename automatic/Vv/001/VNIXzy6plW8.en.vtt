00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
in its the stainless steel thermo craft

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.620 
in its the stainless steel thermo craft
on<00:00:15.650> the<00:00:15.770> inside<00:00:16.070> does<00:00:16.910> not<00:00:17.060> come<00:00:17.240> in<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:17.359> glass

it has the cone shape number four cone

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.999 
it has the cone shape number four cone
dripper<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:23.839> you<00:00:23.900> just<00:00:24.140> put<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:24.380> paper<00:00:24.560> filter

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
dripper so you just put the paper filter

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.120 
dripper so you just put the paper filter
in<00:00:25.099> there<00:00:26.259> it<00:00:27.259> also<00:00:27.349> comes<00:00:27.739> with<00:00:27.800> a<00:00:27.949> lid

obviously when you get done brewing you
put<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:29.839> on<00:00:29.989> to<00:00:30.169> keep<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:30.470> heat<00:00:30.999> consistent

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
put that on to keep the heat consistent

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.170 
put that on to keep the heat consistent
inside<00:00:32.360> as<00:00:32.599> long<00:00:32.780> as<00:00:32.899> possible
