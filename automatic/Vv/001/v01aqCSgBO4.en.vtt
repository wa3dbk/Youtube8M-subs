bit of a Rondo the way I pass where did
you<00:01:53.910> learn<00:01:54.120> to<00:01:54.330> pass<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.370> I<00:01:56.370> don't<00:01:57.240> know

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
you learn to pass like that I don't know

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.140 
you learn to pass like that I don't know
I<00:01:57.660> just<00:01:57.750> always<00:01:58.490> looking<00:01:59.490> around<00:01:59.610> using<00:02:00.060> my

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
I just always looking around using my

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.940 
I just always looking around using my
core<00:02:00.390> vision<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.110> whoever's<00:02:01.470> open<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.800> guess

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
core vision and whoever's open I guess

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.360 
core vision and whoever's open I guess
so

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
so

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.850 
so
you<00:02:03.150> also<00:02:03.300> have<00:02:03.720> underrated<00:02:04.380> athleticism

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you also have underrated athleticism

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.500 
you also have underrated athleticism
maybe<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.730> is<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.910> time<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.270> people<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
maybe this is the time for people to

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.930 
maybe this is the time for people to
understand<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.140> are<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.290> two-sport<00:02:07.890> athlete
