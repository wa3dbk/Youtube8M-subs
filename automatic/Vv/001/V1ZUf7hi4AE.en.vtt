new<00:04:39.430> cassette<00:04:39.820> so<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.420> will<00:04:40.750> always<00:04:40.990> have

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
new cassette so you will always have

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.480 
new cassette so you will always have
precise<00:04:41.800> shifting<00:04:42.340> at<00:04:43.330> all<00:04:43.630> times<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:45.100> front

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
precise shifting at all times the front

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.150 
precise shifting at all times the front
derailleur<00:04:45.640> here<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.480> fully<00:04:47.230> electronic<00:04:47.770> and

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
derailleur here is fully electronic and

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.340 
derailleur here is fully electronic and
there<00:04:48.580> are<00:04:48.700> actually<00:04:49.090> no<00:04:49.330> travel<00:04:49.990> adjust

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
there are actually no travel adjust

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.290 
there are actually no travel adjust
screws<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.580> actually<00:04:51.910> controlled

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
screws that is actually controlled

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.060 
screws that is actually controlled
through<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:52.720> mode<00:04:52.900> button<00:04:53.110> up<00:04:53.440> on<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.860> left

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
through the mode button up on the left

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.600 
through the mode button up on the left
ergo<00:04:54.280> power<00:04:54.610> lever<00:04:55.650> this<00:04:56.650> here<00:04:57.070> is<00:04:57.280> the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
ergo power lever this here is the

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.280 
ergo power lever this here is the
control<00:04:58.240> unit<00:04:58.600> for<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.870> front<00:04:59.140> derailleur

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
control unit for the front derailleur

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.970 
control unit for the front derailleur
and<00:04:59.710> it's<00:05:00.280> fully<00:05:00.490> waterproof<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.740> I'll<00:05:02.740> show

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
and it's fully waterproof and I'll show

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:13.629 
and it's fully waterproof and I'll show
you<00:05:03.040> by<00:05:03.250> example<00:05:03.280> how<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.150> shifts

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.820 

it<00:05:14.639> also<00:05:14.789> has<00:05:15.120> ten<00:05:15.689> different<00:05:16.080> trim<00:05:16.319> positions

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
it also has ten different trim positions

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.589 
it also has ten different trim positions
so<00:05:17.069> you'll<00:05:17.189> always<00:05:17.400> have<00:05:17.729> a<00:05:17.789> really<00:05:18.240> precise

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
so you'll always have a really precise

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.559 
so you'll always have a really precise
shift<00:05:19.550> this<00:05:20.550> here<00:05:20.939> is<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.210> rear<00:05:21.389> derailleur

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
shift this here is the rear derailleur

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.830 
shift this here is the rear derailleur
which<00:05:22.490> accepts<00:05:23.490> electronic<00:05:24.090> signals<00:05:24.539> from

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
which accepts electronic signals from

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.689 
which accepts electronic signals from
the<00:05:24.930> power<00:05:25.110> unit<00:05:25.379> through<00:05:26.159> this<00:05:26.340> internal

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
the power unit through this internal

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.409 
the power unit through this internal
wire<00:05:27.000> into<00:05:27.569> the<00:05:27.659> unit<00:05:27.990> here<00:05:28.460> now<00:05:29.460> by<00:05:29.939> example

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
wire into the unit here now by example

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:45.709 
wire into the unit here now by example
I'll<00:05:30.539> show<00:05:30.569> you<00:05:30.810> how<00:05:31.050> it<00:05:31.199> shifts<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:45.270> now<00:05:45.539> I'll

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:45.719 
I'll show you how it shifts and now I'll

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:47.420 
I'll show you how it shifts and now I'll
show<00:05:45.960> you<00:05:46.020> how<00:05:46.500> it<00:05:46.650> shifts<00:05:46.889> when<00:05:47.159> you<00:05:47.250> just

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
show you how it shifts when you just

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.420 
show you how it shifts when you just
hold<00:05:47.669> it<00:05:48.020> down

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.120 

that's<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.479> upshift<00:05:53.870> and<00:05:54.110> then<00:05:54.470> gauja<00:05:57.130> so

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
that's the upshift and then gauja so

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.580 
that's the upshift and then gauja so
there<00:05:58.400> you<00:05:58.550> have<00:05:58.580> it<00:05:58.729> this<00:05:59.150> is<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.590> Campagnolo

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
there you have it this is the Campagnolo

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.430 
there you have it this is the Campagnolo
super<00:06:01.039> record<00:06:01.370> 11<00:06:01.610> BPS<00:06:02.419> group<00:06:02.720> set<00:06:02.990> which
