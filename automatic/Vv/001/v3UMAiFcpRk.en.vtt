00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 well here you are in charge of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.049
 roxana valdivieso that is going to speak to us 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.960
 little more of the characteristics of these 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.040
 hello trains how about cortana how are you 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.240
 good morning two a little 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.500
 characteristics of these trains and you 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.849
 we have been mentioning good the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.760
 benefits what most of all is for 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.850
 duplicate let's say the capacity that this 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.990
 he held up well is the alstom trains that already 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.420
 have been incorporated for the week 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.660
 passed to our systems what they are looking for 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.179
 is to lighten the influx of customers 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.840
 in the morning at peak time on the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.690
 night also and the and the important thing is 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.309
 that within these trains are 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.030
 interconnected with each other what allows 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.290
 greater fluency of the public and so 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.300
 can distribute better within the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.890
 sector inside all the cars we see 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 that the hours are from Monday to Friday 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.420
 at half past six until 9 and a half is 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.460
 just peak hours exactly if 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.050
 in the night from 5 to 8 at night 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.969
 approximately the weekends of the week 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.489
 on Saturdays due to the high influx 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.840
 I had the gamarra station are 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.340
 approximately those all day in 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.530
 7 in the morning until 8 in the morning 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.830
 night to ensure that all 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.300
 Customers who wish to arrive 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.510
 the gamarra station can do it without 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.010
 drawbacks and our genes 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.290
 to their schedules I imagine because they have 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.700
 seen let's say with some study that 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.130
 they are just the hours when most 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.630
 people as he goes to his work 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.780
 all ways are anyway the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.120
 schedules in which we present greater 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.040
 influx of customers and what they 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.170
 allows them to reach more 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.700
 comfortable in turn is why 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.150
 let's say it extends throughout the day 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.920
 as on Saturdays 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.660
 because let's say six and a half there's no 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.700
 average or is there any chance that 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.040
 could this be interrupted if 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.650
 all ways are issues that are already 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.110
 looking at administrative level in the 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.210
 gradual incorporation of trains 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.480
 within section 1 of roads in 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.610
 incorporate up to 12 trains on the stretch 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.020
 1 and then with the entire plant when 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.080
 Let's get to San Juan de Lurigancho with 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.360
 24 trains on Sundays do not work 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.340
 trains at the moment not for the moment 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.500
 they are not normally in the hours of greatest 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.330
 influx that are given from Monday to Friday 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.860
 mainly for people who are going 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.229
 to work and on Saturdays for 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.640
 people who mainly go to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.230
 they also got to work and also to 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.270
 visit the bar and do your shopping 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.370
 for Sundays let's also say to the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.100
 number of people so that goes out let's say 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.090
 for a walk or lunch or want to 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.880
 distracting is likely to apply 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.890
 for the moment no but nevertheless the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.570
 Sundays are the days of 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.810
 fact of less affluence of all the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.040
 week at the moment you are not seeing 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.570
 administrative issues but that 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.310
 later if they will surely leave 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.410
 incorporating to the extent that the demand 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.670
 they merit it 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.020
 at the moment the five trains are 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.880
 enough for the demand that 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.190
 currently section 1 of the route of 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.780
 life the savior towards grau juan with 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.040
 how many trains are already counted by adding 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.780
 these 5 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.980
 today we have ten trains put in 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.260
 operation 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.930
 in the times of greatest affluence and 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.030
 during the times of least affluence 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.800
 we continue with the first five trains 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.470
 and it is estimated to reach how much 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.780
 be him 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.410
 in section 1 up to 12 trains in 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.290
 operation these two trains these days 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.900
 behind more than 10 are 10 trains plus 12 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.480
 In total 12 trains are put into operation 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.130
 these two that are missing are already here in the 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.590
 country yes totally 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.090
 Today in the country we already have 17 trains 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.230
 which ones will be doing their tests 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.240
 of emptiness 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.210
 to ensure proper operation 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.220
 and from there on they will leave 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.120
 gradually incorporating as 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.340
 I meditated on it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.760
 and maintenance they receive or should 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.620
 receive those trains let's say now in 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.200
 winter time where there is quite 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.280
 rain and there have been cases where he has 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.269
 there were shorts 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.640
 I imagine having a maintenance 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.950
 special that actually issue of 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.450
 maintenance is a subject that handles it 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.150
 another area I am the head of service to 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.430
 client this the specific topics that 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.500
 you mention the specific issues that 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.200
 mentions have been controlled 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.640
 automatically and so in a few 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.980
 seconds the subway system for 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.109
 comment is a system that works 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.090
 with automatic remote monitoring 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.940
 mechanical electronic that allow 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.129
 immediate answers 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.470
 and in general the important thing is that with 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.900
 these trains the influx of 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.250
 clients is being attended and about 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.840
 everything that the clients learn to 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.639
 use the service well and that all 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.330
 we can use what you can see 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.099
 today 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.289
 people start to respect the line 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.270
 Yellow themes that people have learned 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.949
 to use the service as such to 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.150
 Respect the reserved seats inside 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.150
 from the center of the cars 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.320
 much more spacious also because of 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.450
 that are interconnected 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.970
 the advantage with respect to these trains 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.770
 with respect to the previous ones is that 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.540
 allows fluidity within trains 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.940
 which did not happen with us that 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.740
 they have separate cars then 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.540
 before we found some cars with 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.120
 older people than in others today 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.130
 we can find that people are 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.710
 distribute along the cars and 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.020
 says that it makes the use of space be 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.750
 much more efficient also for 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.100
 greater comfort of all have no air 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.130
 conditioning have air conditioning 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.700
 Factory above all the most important 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:15.570
 and what works perfectly and not 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:20.430
 only air conditioning have seats 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.430
 wider ones have vertical railings 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.080
 that allow you anyway to provide 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.350
 a better service to our customers 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.690
 that allow us all in damask the 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.690
 trains for this stretch 1 exactly if 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.850
 and good what we expect our 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.520
 customers continue to participate in caring 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.260
 our service daily as I already 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.020
 have been able to see 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.360
 have the theme of caring for example the 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.920
 Always wait for doors 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.230
 behind the yellow line the alert of 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.240
 doors when when the alarm of 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.350
 closing of doors sound we can not 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.230
 re-enter 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.680
 We can not attempt to enter or leave 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.990
 the trains take care when the train arrives 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.270
 just press the open button 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.220
 doors the green button that is just 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.780
 medium unlike those of the others 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.510
 have them reach what is towards 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.240
 the sides 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.550
 understand for example we have some 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.840
 screens of a panel of routes that we 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.340
 allows you to identify in which station 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.340
 we are perfect
