00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.909
 the session 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.689
 this title 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.179
 good evening to all are welcome in the infos on this element from this 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.650
 Friday as you see it 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.230
 we are here since the circus comes to you which has implanted itself announced 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.770
 since July 27 and will remain until August 10 for the time being at 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.400
 the opportunity to talk about it with alexandre bouillot night but before that 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.450
 the news of the merger is first of all this indictment 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.510
 montoise which concerns the director of damage as the building which would have 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.090
 sold for a small fee was well mounts look here 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.280
 street of the racket to mons is seen if the building which was sold by 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.309
 com guys at the company that these silva high schools 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.309
 at a price then we have the mandate 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.350
 as you see to buy tickets to circus bouglione 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.399
 statistics but before that know that as early as Monday the first road 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.819
 the entrance to downtown montois will be somewhat modified all this for 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:14.240
 what 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.470
 well because in the nimy street important renovation works of 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.390
 the roads are planned at once to the diversion route is provided 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 that's what we explain to you in this sequence 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.220
 from this Monday, August 1st you will be allowed to take some streets of 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.840
 the inner wall of Mons against the opposite direction 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.350
 so look we are in the beautiful circus tent bouglione 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.210
 massive and who has come here to my senses since July 27th that stayed 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.560
 until next August 10th 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.869
 and to talk about it we are lucky enough to have with us today 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.230
 alexandre guyader thank you for receiving us 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.799
 so precisely this circus for those who came in last year for example 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.560
 what are they going to see again this year listen to it already sure 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.759
 is that they are brilliant all the family bouglione who fills his film 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.610
 then he shows himself a month 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.580
 animals 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.170
 leterme acrobats elephants at the flip flop dd coulounieix teeth 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.490
 contained non-bubble trapezeist challenges and barely 0 which is enough 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.059
 exceptional 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:13.469
 especially for the sterile infused women 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.029
 hanging by the hair 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.029
 enough to see what my very visual needs to explain 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:19.739
 it is not easy 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.559
 I think the best is to see them the show and 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.049
 there is all the magic of the circuit 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.709
 and especially had some effects of 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.449
 and india 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:30.099
 something very close 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.099
 but it's the development of modernizing the circus 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.499
 a beautiful picture as pink unfortunately nothing 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.069
 I have a lot of syrte 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.049
 that do not go in that direction 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.479
 so we really feel like you're at home 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.660
 finally what are you saying that your family who is here 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.970
 in performance training the show for all audiences for 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.489
 grandchildren and for larger sites 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.869
 in the small net 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:54.979
 in beauce who participated legrand who come several times abused it is 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.949
 very nice people text so how do we start organizing 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.279
 life and a third like this because obviously you're in 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:02.120
 representation 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.120
 in the different cities in which you go then how do you 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.809
 organize for what you bring 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.639
 and set up is not enough soon bah this side is very very 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.119
 complicated already complicated by the location brucy it was very 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.309
 easy because he's good 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.769
 the party image these are friends for a very long time 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.299
 but there are cities where it's very very complicated it's time to 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.189
 charleroi we can not settle as we want it is very complicated 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.709
 there is a lot of 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.889
 the fabien who work on patrick pintail who deals for locations 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.259
 view permissions 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.649
 if this very very very complicated you have one is really helping measures 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.619
 mercenaries artistic necessarily 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.629
 so we're not ready for that, he rather offered it all that's not the 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.129
 plus it's a bit difficult after you have to maintain it all smiles morning have done 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.409
 cleaning animals 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.679
 the material everything all we want that same Saturday night people 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:48.469
 con user-friendly but all that is before frankly 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.679
 it's very complicated and it gets more and more complicated 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:56.719
 it's a shame he associates himself to weigh on who degraded location and 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.509
 all this is a little bit 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.139
 the disadvantages that we bring 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.659
 usually and then you have to be there really post you to a lot 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.889
 since these are two representations a day every day these two 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.959
 directions every day 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.819
 as the circus knew more and more artists who are not going 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.610
 all the time we live here each village 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.759
 we are really 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.239
 we live all entremont or the evening very often we do it all together 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.569
 it's a job we love 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.120
 that's why 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.139
 anyway thank you for having us today too we struggled dismantling 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.250
