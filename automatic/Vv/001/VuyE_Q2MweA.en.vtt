in many European member states one of

in many European member states one of
the<00:01:32.520> reasons<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.060> many<00:01:33.390> dentists<00:01:33.810> are

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the reasons is that many dentists are

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.840 
the reasons is that many dentists are
