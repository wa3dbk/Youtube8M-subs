00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.779
 experience again in daughters david tua 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.290
 comes from pistachio New Zealand but 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.910
 third in the Olympic Games 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:21.439
 88 this is the 31 year old record 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:25.170
 marl in north carolina one meter 83 tall 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:28.730
 94 3 pounds and that's the one out 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.340
 New Zealand 1 meter 80 98.4 kilo 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.559
 as I said after professional battles eight times 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.360
 won eight times by ko he was already 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.050
 at the amateurs on twitter the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.700
 World Championships 91 he lost to 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.700
 the world champion completely clean 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.800
 well and he was 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.000
 As I said, he will continue to play the 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.100
 precaution against the san vitale 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.969
 Nigeria and then lost some 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.770
 be due 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.770
 these were the olympic games 92 in 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.770
 Barcelona 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.630
 Of course , every woman has one 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.430
 terrible and the man off 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:33.040
 New Zealand only with 1 meter 80 best 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.040
 too small for the very heavy class 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.110
 and historian looks pretty good though 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.040
 he takes too much is already quite 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.570
 clear behind it 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.760
 Since he has already retracted the things 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.890
 times from the left and from the right box 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.970
 pretty open 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.030
 now, for example, if he himself 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.130
 beats is then completely open 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.130
 so to cling 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.840
 Also this db tour is in the stall of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.770
 youtube looks like in something like that though 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.370
 completely different 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:28.270
 one of the american success trainer 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:32.050
 which says pretty good, the 31 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.700
 year old eleven years is the older 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.700
 as the man from New Zealand 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.630
 laughs 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:02.470
 red apa that was liver direction 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.470
 liver hook he comes up again 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:11.530
 he made me hard to be unfaithful 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.530
 naive look 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.340
 there he can not even a human 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.710
 Do not fret players so scare you 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.780
 Graf loves 3 and the ek nods 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.290
 and runs into the left rows in the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.500
 right hook he comes over the first 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.500
 round 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.760
 nature takes a little time 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:00.220
 he is a professional and you are something different 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.170
 was that because you're still there 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.240
 pious or of course, and also know 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.770
 bring your time in place like 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.440
 to be fair 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:14.550
 So also help not so fast 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.550
 was the left hook and lip 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.099
 and the left comes as in ramp of the 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.099
 vip tour second round 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.030
 yes I have the feeling that the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.319
 puncher the same as the accident 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.669
 this time I have no work because I can 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:55.580
 I do not imagine that she is so hornek 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.580
 has come here over time 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.539
 this tour is still a bit 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.630
 be built around so maybe 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:21.229
 after 19 or 20 kempen times to the top 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.229
 to be brought up 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.369
 he wants 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.720
 1 1 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:50.970
 hopelessness in the face of record 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.990
 well of honey there can not talk then 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.990
 What he gets here is mappus 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:26.819
 Only the left hand of only 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.409
 once it's there almost 3 now need 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:32.639
 We fall a bit down then 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:35.669
 yes off while overzealous once again the 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:41.419
 right now struck again and that 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:43.409
 that's it's it's been since as of today 14 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:47.669

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:49.909
 11 12 seconds since it comes in 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.909
 Come on 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:07:00.210

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.449

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:10.020
 one of those not quite as more 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:11.819
 but also winners so the in 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.419
 the second round after two minutes and 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:18.449
 17 seconds that was the left would be for 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:20.550
