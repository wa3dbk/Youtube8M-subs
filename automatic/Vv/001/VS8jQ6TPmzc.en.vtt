00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.519
 hello my name is khan and i do 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.889
 my bachelor an applied 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.480
 Computer science and I have you a little 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.660
 message 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.800
 My work is done and I am happy 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.180
 i am looking forward to my work 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.480
 I'm glad I'm happy 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:33.930
 is 85 pages 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.739
 she is at night my work is 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 hag 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:47.750
 i am not happy i am happy i am 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.750
 I am glad she is alone 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.170
 50 pages 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.539
 I 'm happy 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.570
 and I'm happy 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.570
 she is uneasy for her 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.340
 that was unpleasant 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.050
 So I'm not really finished 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.740
 but basically I already have everything 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.090
 written 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.430
 now comes only a bit 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.740
 I was only troubled by that 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.510
 somehow have nothing for the attachment 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.100
 and I have no cool uml 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.470
 diagrams why do I have that then 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.270
 come book and also the actual 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.610
 I do not even go through implementation 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.760
 I do it the way you know it 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.890
 Success would be what you want to do 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.869
 without showing code 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.300
 I hope that's all right for me 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.900
 find code boring clock in such 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.100
 work 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:11.800
 you can sure so you have to 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.570
 so you know the source code you 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.590
 of course my professors already and 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:22.070
 you can see yourself looking right 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.660
 quickly back in but conclusions 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.480
 So I have to code that I already 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.510
 I may have a little bit 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.209
 rewrite and make more beautiful and 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.430
 will also document has not even 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.380
 was not made because everyone 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.870
 Programmers have the documentation 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.790
 then he will eat once because that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.250
 a code I understand documented 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.200
 again for two days really good 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.040
 we is not so 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.690
 but hey when I'm done and 85 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.400
 meaningful he resisted a lot 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.260
 that I only work him four now 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.150
 I write that much personally 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.769
 not finally that one yes 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.959
 basic research a lot 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.739
 must with the main part only the things 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.510
 zusammenfÃ¼gt and can let out 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:10.370
 but it comes the total transfers 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.260
 I had to find out he has the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.269
 must insert chamber because I have to am 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.519
 the beginning and collective remains a film 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.950
 I need to write down accurately and on 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:23.410
 end must be a statement 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:26.129
 that did and the six students 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:31.830
 make 15 times line spacing 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.830
 and then made 85 o'clock 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.140
 oh well then I will do my best now 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.849
 and make the code pretty and you 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.200
 I just wish a lot of fun, see you 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.019
 most likely in the next 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.140
 week and this sense to the next 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.140
 times
