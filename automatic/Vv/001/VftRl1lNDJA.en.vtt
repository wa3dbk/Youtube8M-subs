seven drawers so this is probably one of

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.210 
seven drawers so this is probably one of
the<00:04:09.250> more<00:04:10.250> odd<00:04:10.489> parts<00:04:11.000> of<00:04:11.090> this<00:04:11.150> deck<00:04:12.159> how<00:04:13.159> do

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
the more odd parts of this deck how do

this on yeah okay and then
I<00:04:26.180> am<00:04:27.180> running<00:04:27.930> these<00:04:28.200> two<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.770> think<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.310> should

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
I am running these two I think I should

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.190 
I am running these two I think I should
have<00:04:29.580> ran<00:04:29.790> like<00:04:30.090> two<00:04:30.570> more<00:04:30.780> Chicago<00:04:31.290> critical

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
have ran like two more Chicago critical

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.990 
have ran like two more Chicago critical
actually<00:04:36.980> yeah<00:04:37.980> but<00:04:38.220> like<00:04:38.550> if<00:04:38.700> you<00:04:38.790> should

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
actually yeah but like if you should

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.480 
actually yeah but like if you should
have<00:04:39.090> been<00:04:39.210> critical<00:04:39.470> because<00:04:42.890> so<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:43.950> rid<00:04:44.370> of

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
have been critical because so you rid of

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.980 
have been critical because so you rid of
run<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:44.850> would<00:04:44.940> have<00:04:45.060> run<00:04:45.180> foreign<00:04:45.450> for<00:04:45.630> ya

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
run you would have run foreign for ya

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.960 
run you would have run foreign for ya
okay<00:04:46.620> I<00:04:46.740> believe<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.160> because<00:04:47.310> I<00:04:47.730> didn't<00:04:47.910> even
