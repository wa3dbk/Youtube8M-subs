 It becomes a model called Minnie Barnaby us hole 100 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.890
 Why and referred to as what I bought this 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.340
 Because I thought that it seemed to be popular outside while looking at autumn leaves from now on 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.760
 Hey I bought this 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:30.230
 This is very easy to make 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.410
 It is gas cylinder of cartridge which we usually sell in supermarkets 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.570
 If you can cause a fire using 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:43.770
 Installation is also very easy 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.860
 I am not good here, but I am here for a while 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.560
 9 sums and numbers here 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.059
 After putting 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.370

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:10.310
 When lighting up 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.310
 It's been a while since I 've been driving once before and I've opened a straight line 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.220
 It is an ignition guy at the side 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.220

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.770
 In lightly even if it can be adjusted 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:37.540
 You can focus or tempt, of course 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.340
 I 'm taking indoors this time shooting, but originally it's only for outdoor use 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.020
 Please be careful when you fit 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.020
 I think I will try once 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.040
 It is the opposite of the present when removing 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.640
 It can be easily removed 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:07.080
 Please pay attention to Saul location after using it because it is made of metal 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.649
 If you have too much over it you may have burns and have fever 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.980
 Please be careful there 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.980
