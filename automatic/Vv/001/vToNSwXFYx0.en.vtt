we're quite pleased to be involved with

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.560 
we're quite pleased to be involved with
local<00:01:21.860> schools<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.340> particularly<00:01:22.730> in<00:01:23.450> the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
local schools and particularly in the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.930 
local schools and particularly in the
area<00:01:23.900> of<00:01:23.960> manufacturing<00:01:24.260> I<00:01:25.010> think<00:01:25.670> it's<00:01:25.790> very

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
area of manufacturing I think it's very

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.700 
area of manufacturing I think it's very
important<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:26.600> school<00:01:27.080> children<00:01:27.290> should

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
important that school children should

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.860 
important that school children should
get<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.979> concept<00:01:28.460> of<00:01:28.729> not<00:01:29.360> only<00:01:29.510> what

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
get the concept of not only what

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.660 
get the concept of not only what
manufacturing<00:01:30.620> is<00:01:30.710> all<00:01:30.890> about<00:01:31.190> but<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.520> full

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
manufacturing is all about but the full

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.969 
manufacturing is all about but the full
process<00:01:31.970> really<00:01:32.930> from<00:01:33.200> designed<00:01:33.650> to

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
process really from designed to

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.969 
process really from designed to
manufacture<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:35.240> brand<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.500> exercises

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
manufacture to brand so the exercises

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.130 
manufacture to brand so the exercises
that<00:01:37.340> they're<00:01:37.460> doing<00:01:37.610> today<00:01:37.850> really<00:01:38.420> mimic

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
that they're doing today really mimic

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.670 
that they're doing today really mimic
what<00:01:39.890> what<00:01:40.820> companies<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.630> are<00:01:42.229> all<00:01:42.410> about

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
what what companies that are all about

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.730 
what what companies that are all about
and<00:01:43.990> manufacturing<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.110> going<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.350> be<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.440> vital

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
and manufacturing is going to be a vital

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.160 
and manufacturing is going to be a vital
part<00:01:46.550> of<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.940> British<00:01:47.420> economy<00:01:47.930> for<00:01:48.110> the

we'll<00:01:53.150> get<00:01:53.330> more<00:01:53.479> involved<00:01:54.110> with<00:01:54.290> schools<00:01:55.100> to

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
we'll get more involved with schools to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.430 
we'll get more involved with schools to
supplement<00:01:56.390> what<00:01:56.509> we<00:01:56.540> already<00:01:56.960> do<00:01:57.170> through
