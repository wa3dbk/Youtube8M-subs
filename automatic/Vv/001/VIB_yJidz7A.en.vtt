00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.580
 hello yourself instructional video under 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.780
 hand with he summit is basic 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.970
 a trick based on it takes many 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.769
 others more difficult to perform tricks 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.769
 let's see how he looks 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.259
 if you look in slow motion 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.269
 then pen 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.919
 makes a turn 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.059
 and intersects with fleet 3 2 slot 1 2 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.159
 There are two options for Sonic 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.270
 abutments are illegal 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.930
 for easier learning advice 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.390
 the support begins but later on it is for you 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.920
 will not need 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.150
 and supporting sonic 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.460
 is all 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.790
 take the tip of this pen 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 I respect this membrane 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.449
 then pushing in front of that middle finger 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.640
 and start pushing the handle 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.200
 creates tension 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.710
 then all we have to do is 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.960
 just pull that thumb back 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.830
 so my daughter jumped off 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.830
 see how it looks 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.790
 he didn't even have to do almost anything 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.079
 pen itself 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.079
 everything is up to you 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.640
 Now 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.039
 will discuss 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.079
 illegal 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:25.830
 sonic 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.300
 now for him just need to know the hour 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.420
 so we have you at the beginning was 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.910
 now 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.170
 if you have often it will be easy for you 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.170
 make 1 turn 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 use of support 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.000
 in this case, you just need 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.710
 move middle finger 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 and connect these two 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.930
 look 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.590
 Well, good luck helped the teachings
