and my favorite is the dummy launch in
which<00:00:50.390> people<00:00:51.110> that<00:00:51.230> make<00:00:51.380> contraptions<00:00:52.070> on

which people that make contraptions on
two<00:00:52.490> skis<00:00:52.820> and<00:00:53.120> then<00:00:53.600> we<00:00:53.780> take<00:00:53.960> on<00:00:54.140> top<00:00:54.380> of<00:00:54.530> the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
two skis and then we take on top of the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.260 
two skis and then we take on top of the
hill<00:00:54.830> here<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:57.430> push<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.580> over<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:58.820> edge<00:00:58.910> and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
hill here and push it over the edge and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.180 
hill here and push it over the edge and
it<00:00:59.360> goes<00:00:59.510> down<00:00:59.750> and<00:00:59.930> it<00:01:00.050> flies<00:01:00.320> in<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.710> air<00:01:00.890> and

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
it goes down and it flies in the air and

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.990 
it goes down and it flies in the air and
then<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:01.910> crashes<00:01:02.890> we<00:01:03.890> get<00:01:04.040> judged<00:01:04.369> based<00:01:04.729> on

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
then it crashes we get judged based on

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.880 
then it crashes we get judged based on
attitude<00:01:05.530> aptitude<00:01:06.530> altitude<00:01:07.340> and<00:01:07.640> aplomb<00:01:08.890> -

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
attitude aptitude altitude and aplomb -

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.130 
attitude aptitude altitude and aplomb -
a<00:01:10.040> big<00:01:10.220> missile<00:01:10.610> it's<00:01:10.940> 14<00:01:11.360> feet<00:01:11.600> long<00:01:11.630> and

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
a big missile it's 14 feet long and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.070 
a big missile it's 14 feet long and
about<00:01:12.350> 3<00:01:12.680> feet<00:01:12.830> in<00:01:13.010> diameter<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.870> it's<00:01:14.870> on

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
about 3 feet in diameter and it's on

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.649 
about 3 feet in diameter and it's on
skis<00:01:15.500> with<00:01:15.860> locks<00:01:16.159> for<00:01:16.580> weight<00:01:16.760> so<00:01:17.360> we<00:01:17.510> get<00:01:17.630> a

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
skis with locks for weight so we get a

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.420 
skis with locks for weight so we get a
lot<00:01:17.900> of<00:01:18.080> speed<00:01:18.350> going<00:01:18.380> down<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.190> we'll<00:01:19.280> get<00:01:19.370> a

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
lot of speed going down so we'll get a

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.969 
lot of speed going down so we'll get a
lot<00:01:19.580> of<00:01:19.790> elevation<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.600> then<00:01:21.200> in<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.470> back<00:01:21.650> I

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
lot of elevation and then in the back I

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.830 
lot of elevation and then in the back I
went<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.490> got<00:01:22.640> some<00:01:22.700> fireworks<00:01:23.300> that<00:01:23.540> shoot

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
went and got some fireworks that shoot

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.620 
went and got some fireworks that shoot
flares<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.670> when<00:01:25.670> we're<00:01:25.909> gonna<00:01:26.060> go<00:01:26.360> up<00:01:26.450> on<00:01:26.510> the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
flares and when we're gonna go up on the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.270 
flares and when we're gonna go up on the
hill<00:01:26.750> we'll<00:01:26.990> light<00:01:27.200> them<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.560> shoot<00:01:27.979> flares

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
hill we'll light them and shoot flares

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.880 
hill we'll light them and shoot flares
out<00:01:28.430> of<00:01:28.610> them<00:01:28.729> push<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.120> over<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.360> edge

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
out of them push it over the edge

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.160 
out of them push it over the edge
so<00:01:30.460> it'll<00:01:30.790> should<00:01:31.060> get<00:01:31.180> some<00:01:31.360> momentum<00:01:31.540> as<00:01:32.020> it

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
so it'll should get some momentum as it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.720 
so it'll should get some momentum as it
goes<00:01:32.320> down<00:01:32.350> but<00:01:32.860> hits<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.160> lift<00:01:33.400> it<00:01:33.550> should

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
goes down but hits the lift it should

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.050 
goes down but hits the lift it should
fly<00:01:34.090> in<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.330> air<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.160> plump<00:01:36.490> whatever

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
fly in the air and be a plump whatever

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.560 
fly in the air and be a plump whatever
that<00:01:37.270> is

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
people I think in town thought the whole

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.260
