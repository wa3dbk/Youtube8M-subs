00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.850
TONY MARTIN: For me and the
whole team, that was one of

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.490
the really big highlights at the
end of this season, next

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.655
to the Tour de France.

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:12.260
So we really need to be in a
high level now in September.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.210
So it gives you also an extra
push and also, as well, some

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.690
extra pressure.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.580
So need to find a good way
to handle this pressure.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.500
And for me, it really worked
out perfectly.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.730
The pressure helped me to
go on the limit and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.700
even over the limit.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.980
And I just found two
perfect days.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.550
Getting a strong team together
in our team is not that hard

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.930
job, because when you see all
the individual riders, they

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.310
are so strong, so it was more or
less a hard decision who we

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.440
can take, because we have
so many strong guys.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.650
We made some tests on
the race course.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.780
We made some trainings,
some measurements with

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.170
Specialized, as well.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.040
And then we saw a lot of data.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.480
And then it was on the trainers
and the sport

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.050
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.290
on the development team from
Specialized to read this data

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.710
and find the best solution
for the team.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.750
And for me, at the end, we
were together with the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.540
strongest team.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.760
We found also the
perfect order.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.330
It's always hard to say who has
to start, who's the last,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.310
who rides behind who.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.170
So I think we made
a perfect job.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.730
And we just saw it
last Sunday.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.750
It worked out perfectly.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.340
How does it work?

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.060
Who draws the unlucky straw of
having to sit behind you?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.630
Actually, it's harder to ride
in front of me, because the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.900
guy has to make a good lead
going out of the lead.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.530
And then I come into the lead,
maybe accelerating

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.690
for one or two K's.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.620
And he has to go into the slip
stream again-- so accelerating

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.750
on the back again of the team.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.840
And they are always on block--
and then try to recover in the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.970
slip stream.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.649
So I guess it's not
an easy job.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.290
Last Sunday, it was
Peter Velits,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.170
and he did it perfectly.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.730
And he also survived with the
four riders coming over the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.570
line as the first.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.580
And chapeau, was really
nice job of him.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.265
What does the bike do for you?

00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:32.465
How does that factor into your
equation of being able to

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:33.540
perform so well?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.970
Yeah.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.660
I think it's no secret that
you really need the best

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.260
material to win a time trial.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.530
With a shit frame or shit tires
or bad wheels, you can't

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.690
win a time trial.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.500
That's just simply
the reality.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.340
And especially, in this course,
aerodynamic and

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.080
material was really important,
because it was

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.830
a super fast course.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.040
The average was almost 53.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.430
So you need a really good,
good material.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:10.130
And yeah, Specialized, my staff,
the mechanics did so

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.310
much work to develop the
perfect set up for me.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.900
And I really can say yesterday,
I had the best set

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.990
up I ever rode.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.180
For example, in the corners,
you really need

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.640
to trust the tires.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.380
You need to know that the you
can go full gas into the

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.480
corners and you won't crash.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.370
And I heard already yesterday
crashed some guy--

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.250
so really scary.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.960
But I trust the material 100%.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.230
And I go full risk.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.510
And you also can see
it in the results.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.770
Is the 58 tooth ring,
is it to make sure

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.249
you've got the speed?

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:50.730
Do you ever spin it out?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.310
Yeah.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.820
Yeah, sure.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.280
Especially, I have the gear
for the distance.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.350
So when you really go 65, 70 K's
an hour, and you're still

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.200
able to pedal, it's a
really good feeling.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.410
And yesterday, while we had the
good wind at the start,

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.020
even on the start, I was going
more than 60 K's an hour.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.800
So I'm also a guy that really
like the big gears, especially

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.339
on the flat.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.550
So it's just good to know that
you have it on board.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.210
Even when you just need it
for 4 K, it can make the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.315
difference.

00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:37.280
So for me, it's the chain ring
I always use in a time trial.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.790
I went into the race with a
strategy to make really my own

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.270
race the first half.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.680
Don't look too much at the
split times, for sure.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.560
I've got the information, but
when you're 10 seconds in

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.190
front, it can change in five K's
that you are back again.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.010
So for me, it made no sense to
say, OK, I go now a little bit

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.660
easier or save some energy, and
then you are behind maybe

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.060
Fabian or Bradley.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.420
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.780
you have to go full gas
to get the time back.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.400
So I really stayed on my
strategy the first half.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.530
And when I heard it was
25, 30 seconds--

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.620
I could control a little
bit the race.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.450
Also don't take 100% risk
in the corners.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:37.140
So that maybe 10% of safeness.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.420
Especially in the old town
from Florence, I took it

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.990
really easy.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.210
The corners were not
that easy to take.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.795
And I just tried to be safe that
I don't crash or don't

00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:53.740
hit a big stone or something
else to get a puncture.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.560
When did you know?

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.860
On the last four or five K's,
when I was back on the river.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.450
I had already [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.210
from Fabian.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.970
And yeah, I was still going
full gas for sure.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.690
But I was pretty
sure to win it.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.450
And it always also takes
some pain off the legs.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.300
Because I was just with positive
feelings, I knew that

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.060
I had the title again.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.030
And it was a pretty nice
last kilometers.
