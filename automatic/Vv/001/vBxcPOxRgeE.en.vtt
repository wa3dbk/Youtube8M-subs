type in the form tag and the form action
I'm<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:30.119> make<00:00:30.590> PHP<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.890> if<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.369> undo

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
I'm going to make PHP so you if you undo

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
I'm going to make PHP so you if you undo
a<00:00:32.730> label<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.300> go<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.630> here<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> PHP

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
a label you can go up here to the PHP

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.850 
a label you can go up here to the PHP
tab<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.250> echo<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.390> hit<00:00:36.570> echo<00:00:36.960> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
tab and just echo if you hit echo you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
tab and just echo if you hit echo you
can<00:00:38.010> echo<00:00:38.340> serve<00:00:38.610> yourself<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.480> now

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
can echo serve yourself like that now

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840 
can echo serve yourself like that now
what<00:00:40.290> that's<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.160> make<00:00:41.579> this

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
what that's going to do is make this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.450 
what that's going to do is make this
file<00:00:42.210> parts<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> itself<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.340> equivalent<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
file parts to itself and equivalent to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
file parts to itself and equivalent to
that<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.820> me<00:00:45.210> typing<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.079> search<00:00:46.760> PHP<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that is me typing in search PHP that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.630 
that is me typing in search PHP that
makes<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.930> also<00:00:49.110> parts<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> itself<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.520> know

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
makes it also parts to itself you know

this text field but I'm going to use the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.580 
this text field but I'm going to use the
char<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.480> here<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.020> set

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
char with here and set

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.089 
char with here and set
maybe<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.250> don't<00:02:15.090> know<00:02:15.300> eighty<00:02:15.780> all<00:02:16.410> right<00:02:16.680> so

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
maybe I don't know eighty all right so

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.530 
maybe I don't know eighty all right so
that's<00:02:17.220> what<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.580> going<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.790> look<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.239> and

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that's what it's going to look like and

that's what it's going to look like and
above<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.379> form<00:02:19.890> maybe<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.670> can<00:02:20.879> pop<00:02:21.090> in

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
above that form maybe I can pop in

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.400 
above that form maybe I can pop in
search<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:24.500> exercise<00:02:25.760> tables<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.200> go

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
search the exercise tables and we can go

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.320 
search the exercise tables and we can go
ahead<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.739> highlight<00:02:29.099> that<00:02:29.280> press<00:02:29.940> control

ahead and highlight that press control
two<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.379> will<00:02:31.530> give<00:02:31.680> us<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> nice<00:02:32.160> h2

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
two and that will give us a nice h2

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.360 
two and that will give us a nice h2
header<00:02:33.450> that'll<00:02:34.080> say<00:02:34.230> search<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.890> exercise

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
okay and then what we'll do is under the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.360 
okay and then what we'll do is under the
form<00:02:39.510> we'll<00:02:39.900> have<00:02:40.049> an<00:02:40.260> output<00:02:40.739> section<00:02:41.190> so

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
put a PHP block and here is where we

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.920 
put a PHP block and here is where we
will<00:03:21.510> process<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.910> search<00:03:25.190> query<00:03:26.810> okay<00:03:27.810> the

will this code here
run<00:04:05.579> we're<00:04:06.569> going<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.750> put<00:04:06.930> in<00:04:07.079> one<00:04:07.440> more

end operator we want to make sure this
posted<00:04:12.599> variable<00:04:13.109> is<00:04:13.260> not<00:04:14.250> equal<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.389> nothing

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
posted variable is not equal to nothing

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.430 
posted variable is not equal to nothing
so<00:04:17.400> if<00:04:17.729> it's<00:04:18.060> set<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.599> if<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.109> has<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.289> value

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
so if it's set and if it has a value

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.580 
so if it's set and if it has a value
then<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.519> only<00:04:20.609> then<00:04:20.760> are<00:04:21.090> we<00:04:21.329> going<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.719> run

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
then and only then are we going to run

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.950 
then and only then are we going to run
this<00:04:22.740> code<00:04:23.039> here<00:04:23.280> run<00:04:23.940> code<00:04:24.210> if<00:04:24.419> condition

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
this code here run code if condition

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.170 
this code here run code if condition
meets<00:04:25.520> here<00:04:26.520> okay

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
meets here okay

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.450 
meets here okay
so<00:04:27.330> here's<00:04:27.509> the<00:04:27.660> logic<00:04:27.990> if<00:04:28.229> this<00:04:28.919> posted

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
so here's the logic if this posted

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.249 
so here's the logic if this posted
variable<00:04:29.970> is<00:04:30.090> set<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.449> means<00:04:30.630> if<00:04:30.870> they<00:04:31.020> use

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
variable is set that means if they use

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.110 
variable is set that means if they use
that<00:04:31.500> form<00:04:31.919> they<00:04:32.100> type<00:04:32.310> something<00:04:32.580> in<00:04:32.880> and

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
that form they type something in and

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.700 
that form they type something in and
actually<00:04:33.900> we're<00:04:33.990> going<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.169> need<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.350> button

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
actually we're going to need a button

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.730 
actually we're going to need a button
through<00:04:35.389> so<00:04:36.389> let's<00:04:36.570> go<00:04:36.780> back<00:04:37.050> up<00:04:37.320> here<00:04:37.620> to

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
through so let's go back up here to

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.570 
through so let's go back up here to
forms<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.550> hit<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.509> button<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.430> let's<00:04:41.430> make

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
forms and hit the button and let's make

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.110 
forms and hit the button and let's make
it<00:04:41.639> a<00:04:41.789> submit<00:04:42.419> type<00:04:42.979> okay<00:04:43.979> there<00:04:44.759> we<00:04:44.910> go

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
it a submit type okay there we go

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.219 
it a submit type okay there we go
name<00:04:46.080> can<00:04:46.470> be<00:04:46.500> my<00:04:47.430> BTN<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.690> let's<00:04:48.840> see<00:04:48.990> what<00:04:49.139> we

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
name can be my BTN so let's see what we

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.340 
name can be my BTN so let's see what we
have<00:04:49.259> there<00:04:49.650> that's<00:04:50.039> good<00:04:50.630> now<00:04:51.630> back<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.110> the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
have there that's good now back to the

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.020 
have there that's good now back to the
logic<00:04:52.680> what's<00:04:52.919> going<00:04:53.070> to<00:04:53.100> happen<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:53.580> if<00:04:53.820> they

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
logic what's going to happen is if they

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.420 
logic what's going to happen is if they
press<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.660> button<00:04:55.199> they<00:04:55.590> type<00:04:55.860> something<00:04:55.889> in

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
press that button they type something in

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.580 
press that button they type something in
code<00:04:57.240> is<00:04:57.479> going<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.660> process<00:04:57.900> here<00:04:58.259> the<00:04:58.440> code

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
code is going to process here the code

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.800 
code is going to process here the code
that<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:58.830> want<00:04:58.979> to<00:04:59.039> process<00:04:59.130> here<00:04:59.699> is<00:04:59.820> looking

that you want to process here is looking

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.600 
that you want to process here is looking
in<00:05:00.930> your<00:05:01.050> database<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:02.009> search<00:05:02.160> for<00:05:02.220> things

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
that they whatever they typed in that's

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:06.170 
that they whatever they typed in that's
what<00:05:05.130> you're<00:05:05.250> going<00:05:05.370> to<00:05:05.400> search<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.820> database

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
what you're going to search the database

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.210 
what you're going to search the database
for<00:05:06.210> right<00:05:06.720> here<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.169> you're<00:05:08.039> going<00:05:08.190> to

for right here and you're going to

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.029 
for right here and you're going to
assemble<00:05:08.849> that<00:05:08.910> into<00:05:09.539> a<00:05:09.780> variable<00:05:10.259> whatever

assemble that into a variable whatever

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.490 
assemble that into a variable whatever
output<00:05:11.460> comes<00:05:12.000> out<00:05:12.180> in<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.570> loop<00:05:12.810> you're

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
output comes out in the loop you're

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.870 
output comes out in the loop you're
going<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.740> assemble<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.220> into<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.520> variable

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
going to assemble it into a variable

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.820 
going to assemble it into a variable
called<00:05:15.240> search<00:05:15.599> output<00:05:16.169> and<00:05:16.320> then<00:05:16.530> it<00:05:16.650> comes

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
called search output and then it comes

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.740 
called search output and then it comes
out<00:05:16.979> on<00:05:17.039> the<00:05:17.370> page<00:05:17.550> here<00:05:17.880> under<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.570> search

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
bar very simple very nice and I've

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.180 
bar very simple very nice and I've
decided<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.139> add<00:05:22.320> something<00:05:22.620> real<00:05:22.919> quick

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
decided to add something real quick

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.279 
decided to add something real quick
early<00:05:23.400> on<00:05:23.789> so<00:05:24.389> we<00:05:24.509> can<00:05:24.660> put<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:24.930> under<00:05:25.169> that

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
early on so we can put it under that

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.110 
early on so we can put it under that
button<00:05:25.650> there<00:05:25.860> so<00:05:26.430> what<00:05:26.639> we're<00:05:26.789> going<00:05:26.880> to<00:05:26.940> do
