00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:38.299 

you

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.130 

when<00:00:39.309> I<00:00:39.430> shift<00:00:39.850> my<00:00:39.969> weight<00:00:40.090> in<00:00:40.510> curves<00:00:40.719> I<00:00:40.930> want

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
when I shift my weight in curves I want

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.500 
when I shift my weight in curves I want
to<00:00:41.289> shift<00:00:41.530> it<00:00:42.329> towards<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.949> inner<00:00:44.949> curve

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
to shift it towards the inner curve

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.240 
to shift it towards the inner curve
closer<00:00:46.510> semester<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:47.379> move<00:00:47.769> about<00:00:47.980> the

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
closer semester I move about the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.600 
closer semester I move about the
Overtoun<00:00:48.670> message

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.540 

so<00:00:52.090> when<00:00:52.239> I<00:00:52.270> when<00:00:53.170> I<00:00:53.290> started<00:00:53.680> to<00:00:53.860> learn<00:00:54.399> this

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
so when I when I started to learn this

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.880 
so when I when I started to learn this
it<00:00:54.790> was<00:00:54.969> kind<00:00:55.329> of<00:00:55.770> scary

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
it was kind of scary

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.360 
it was kind of scary
so<00:00:57.399> I<00:00:57.540> practiced<00:00:58.540> it<00:00:58.720> on<00:00:59.140> straights<00:00:59.620> instead

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
so I practiced it on straights instead

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:10.340 
so I practiced it on straights instead
of<00:01:00.460> in<00:01:01.120> curse

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.649 

I<00:01:13.640> tell<00:01:14.640> my<00:01:14.820> C

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
I tell my C

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.410 
I tell my C
this<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.109> I<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.469> counters<00:01:17.009> there<00:01:17.249> he<00:01:18.149> over

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
this and I can counters there he over

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.340 
this and I can counters there he over
the<00:01:18.539> rain<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.149> very<00:01:21.420> stupid<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.899> take<00:01:22.289> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the rain this is very stupid to take a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.899 
the rain this is very stupid to take a
curve<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.829> this<00:01:23.119> anyway<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
curve like this anyway but I a

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.809 
curve like this anyway but I a
counteract<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:28.500> effect<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.950> my<00:01:29.250> body<00:01:29.609> weight

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
counteract the effect of my body weight

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.789 
counteract the effect of my body weight
being<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:30.990> other<00:01:31.079> side<00:01:31.319> so<00:01:31.469> heads<00:01:31.649> on

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
being on the other side so heads on

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.630 
being on the other side so heads on
straight<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:33.090> I'm<00:01:33.179> turning<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.719> because<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
straight and I'm turning right because I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.059 
straight and I'm turning right because I
move<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:35.849> body<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:37.020> tap<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> share<00:01:38.119> to

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:40.069 
move my body I can tap the share to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:02:00.420 
move my body I can tap the share to
outweigh

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.940 

so<00:02:01.430> when<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.090> move<00:02:02.780> your<00:02:02.960> ass<00:02:03.170> around<00:02:03.440> on

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
so when you move your ass around on

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.420 
so when you move your ass around on
seats

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
seats

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.740 
seats
you<00:02:05.090> use<00:02:05.810> your<00:02:06.080> legs<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:07.490> lift<00:02:07.630> yourself<00:02:08.630> up

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
you use your legs to lift yourself up

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.710 
you use your legs to lift yourself up
and<00:02:08.930> down<00:02:09.080> sit<00:02:09.290> down<00:02:09.320> again<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:10.190> don't<00:02:11.180> drag

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
and down sit down again you don't drag

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.140 
and down sit down again you don't drag
yourself<00:02:12.230> along<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.740> seat<00:02:13.010> like<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:14.030> do

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
yourself along the seat like this to do

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.880 
yourself along the seat like this to do
actually<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> bit<00:02:15.350> of

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
actually this is a bit of

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.530 
actually this is a bit of
or<00:02:17.220> restoration<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540
