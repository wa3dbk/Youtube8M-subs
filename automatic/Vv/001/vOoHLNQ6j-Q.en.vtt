colours<00:02:11.130> but<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.970> did<00:02:12.209> look<00:02:12.390> at<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> few<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.959> them

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
colours but I did look at a few of them

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.990 
colours but I did look at a few of them
and<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.590> distribution<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.400> numbers<00:02:14.730> was

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and the distribution of numbers was

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.030 
and the distribution of numbers was
different<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.569> some<00:02:15.780> socks<00:02:16.049> have<00:02:16.739> more

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
different so some socks have more

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.460 
different so some socks have more
fluctuation<00:02:17.910> some<00:02:18.510> socks<00:02:18.780> tend<00:02:19.079> to<00:02:19.140> go<00:02:19.260> high

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
fluctuation some socks tend to go high

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.770 
fluctuation some socks tend to go high
some<00:02:19.769> time<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.129> low<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.940> would<00:02:21.629> have<00:02:21.750> been

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
some time to go low it would have been

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.720 
some time to go low it would have been
good<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.170> think<00:02:22.319> if<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.709> information<00:02:23.099> was

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
good I think if that information was

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.300 
good I think if that information was
widely<00:02:24.569> known<00:02:24.840> or<00:02:25.230> they<00:02:25.379> made<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> card<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.099> did

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
widely known or they made a card to did

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.759 
widely known or they made a card to did

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
of the game and it you got to learn to

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.850 
of the game and it you got to learn to
work<00:04:50.300> around<00:04:50.450> that<00:04:50.840> other<00:04:51.140> people<00:04:51.560> were<00:04:51.710> upset

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.469 
work around that other people were upset
and<00:04:52.160> this<00:04:52.310> is<00:04:52.430> something<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:52.789> didn't<00:04:53.060> like<00:04:53.210> was

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
and this is something I didn't like was

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.500 
and this is something I didn't like was
the<00:04:53.900> fact<00:04:54.200> that<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.500> stock<00:04:54.710> market

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
the fact that the stock market

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.060 
the fact that the stock market
fluctuates<00:04:56.510> like<00:04:56.720> crazy<00:04:57.050> okay<00:04:57.620> that's<00:04:57.770> fine

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
fluctuates like crazy okay that's fine

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.430 
fluctuates like crazy okay that's fine
but<00:04:58.669> you<00:04:58.729> really<00:04:59.150> had<00:04:59.450> no<00:04:59.780> idea<00:04:59.810> how<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.380> was

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
but you really had no idea how it was

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.650 
but you really had no idea how it was
going<00:05:00.590> to<00:05:00.680> fluctuate<00:05:00.830> not<00:05:01.520> at<00:05:01.640> all<00:05:01.789> so<00:05:02.600> you

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
going to fluctuate not at all so you

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.090 
going to fluctuate not at all so you
there<00:05:02.930> was<00:05:03.050> really<00:05:03.200> no<00:05:03.410> strategy<00:05:03.680> you<00:05:04.010> were

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
there was really no strategy you were

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.880 
there was really no strategy you were
just<00:05:04.280> buying<00:05:04.520> shares<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.539> buy<00:05:05.720> that<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.680> what

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
just buying shares to buy that so what

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.029 
just buying shares to buy that so what

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.630 
think with a better rule set and a
better<00:05:32.479> obvious<00:05:33.110> that<00:05:33.830> that<00:05:33.919> is<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.490> case

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.719 
pretty good and and i'll tell you what
my<00:06:43.550> opinion<00:06:43.879> went<00:06:44.659> from<00:06:44.900> very<00:06:45.469> low<00:06:45.889> too<00:06:46.460> much

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
my opinion went from very low too much

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.600 
my opinion went from very low too much
better<00:06:47.060> as<00:06:47.300> the<00:06:47.599> games<00:06:47.840> progressed<00:06:48.529> if<00:06:49.279> i<00:06:49.460> had

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
better as the games progressed if i had

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.670 
better as the games progressed if i had
only<00:06:49.729> played<00:06:50.000> it<00:06:50.180> for<00:06:50.210> my<00:06:50.509> first<00:06:50.779> game<00:06:51.050> i<00:06:51.080> think

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
only played it for my first game i think

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.559 
only played it for my first game i think
i<00:06:51.770> might<00:06:51.919> have<00:06:52.069> thrown<00:06:52.279> it<00:06:52.430> but<00:06:52.610> i<00:06:52.789> sense<00:06:53.449> that

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:53.569 
i might have thrown it but i sense that

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:55.059 
i might have thrown it but i sense that
there<00:06:53.779> might<00:06:53.900> be<00:06:53.960> something<00:06:54.319> else<00:06:54.620> there<00:06:54.830> so

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:55.069 
there might be something else there so

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:58.809 
there might be something else there so
after<00:06:55.759> continual<00:06:56.360> tries<00:06:56.629> it<00:06:56.960> became<00:06:57.949> better<00:06:58.490> i

00:06:58.809 --> 00:06:58.819 
after continual tries it became better i

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.839 
after continual tries it became better i
still<00:06:59.419> don't<00:06:59.449> know<00:06:59.719> that<00:06:59.930> i<00:06:59.960> would<00:07:00.590> pick<00:07:01.460> it<00:07:01.669> or

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:01.849 
still don't know that i would pick it or

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:04.059 
still don't know that i would pick it or
recommend<00:07:02.330> it<00:07:02.419> myself<00:07:02.900> but<00:07:03.409> I<00:07:03.469> can<00:07:03.680> see<00:07:03.889> the

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:04.069
