00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
I'm putting a t-mobile SIM card in it

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.420 
I'm putting a t-mobile SIM card in it
Rogers<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.869> Canada<00:00:25.230> t-mobile's<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.949> US<00:00:26.220> it

Rogers in Canada t-mobile's in the US it

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.790 
Rogers in Canada t-mobile's in the US it
doesn't<00:00:26.730> matter<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.150> network<00:00:27.680> now<00:00:28.680> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
doesn't matter what network now it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.439 
doesn't matter what network now it
doesn't<00:00:29.070> necessarily<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.240> SIM

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
doesn't necessarily have to be the SIM

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
doesn't necessarily have to be the SIM
card<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.779> you're<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.619> use<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
card that you're going to use with the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.729 
card that you're going to use with the
phone<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.600> example<00:00:33.630> t-mobile<00:00:34.230> SIM<00:00:34.530> card

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
phone like for example t-mobile SIM card

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.110 
phone like for example t-mobile SIM card
I<00:00:34.770> put<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.070> actually<00:00:35.370> does<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.610> doesn't<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.059> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
I put in actually does it doesn't have a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.139 
I put in actually does it doesn't have a
live<00:00:36.329> line<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.950> will<00:00:38.070> work<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:39.090> at

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
live line on it but it will work so at

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.459 
live line on it but it will work so at

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040 
message now you've got intercept city
code<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> need<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.539> right<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
code so what you need to do right now is

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.170 
code so what you need to do right now is
you<00:00:58.079> need<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> enter<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> subsidy<00:00:59.340> code<00:00:59.579> into

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you need to enter the subsidy code into

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.060 
you need to enter the subsidy code into
the<00:01:00.210> phone<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> enter<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> one

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the phone so I'm going to enter the one

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.770 
the phone so I'm going to enter the one
again<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.640> unique<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.239> phone<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.660> it's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
again it's unique for this phone so it's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.590 
again it's unique for this phone so it's
not<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> work<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:05.250> phone<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.390> you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
can't even see it because who I'm typing

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:17.359 
can't even see it because who I'm typing
3<00:01:09.299> 0<00:01:10.250> 9<00:01:11.250> 9<00:01:11.280> 9<00:01:12.090> 8<00:01:14.000> 4<00:01:15.290> 7<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.770> once<00:01:16.950> you've<00:01:17.100> done<00:01:17.310> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
3 0 9 9 9 8 4 7 so once you've done that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.120 
3 0 9 9 9 8 4 7 so once you've done that
you<00:01:17.759> click<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.210> top<00:01:18.420> line<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.869> says<00:01:19.049> ok<00:01:19.500> watch

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
you click the top line it says ok watch

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.459 
you click the top line it says ok watch
what<00:01:20.340> happens

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.709 

now<00:01:24.469> chose<00:01:24.740> Fido<00:01:25.009> now<00:01:25.939> chose<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.329> number<00:01:26.450> that

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
now chose Fido now chose the number that

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.660 
now chose Fido now chose the number that
was<00:01:26.840> actually<00:01:27.229> on<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.619> SIM<00:01:27.829> card<00:01:27.859> I<00:01:28.189> should

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
was actually on the SIM card I should

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.940 
was actually on the SIM card I should
report<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.240> was<00:01:29.359> a<00:01:29.420> fight<00:01:29.960> oh<00:01:29.990> this<00:01:30.590> fi<00:01:30.890> toe

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
report it was a fight oh this fi toe

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.779 
report it was a fight oh this fi toe
phone<00:01:31.280> which<00:01:31.549> is<00:01:31.700> owned<00:01:31.939> by<00:01:32.030> Rogers

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.740 

so<00:01:37.789> now<00:01:37.880> let's<00:01:38.030> searching<00:01:38.329> for<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.479> network

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
so now let's searching for the network

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.480 
so now let's searching for the network
it's<00:01:38.899> not<00:01:38.990> going<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:39.319> find<00:01:39.469> a<00:01:39.590> network<00:01:39.709> how

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
it's not going to find a network how

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.960 
it's not going to find a network how
would<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.759> like<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:40.909> personalize<00:01:41.360> No

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.580 

so<00:01:48.570> what's<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.020> happen<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.440> you're

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
so what's going to happen is you're

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.350 
so what's going to happen is you're
actually<00:01:49.890> able<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.100> enter<00:01:50.580> into<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> menus

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
actually able to enter into the menus

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.670 
actually able to enter into the menus
that<00:01:51.510> actually<00:01:51.870> shows<00:01:52.080> that<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.500> phone<00:01:52.650> has

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
that actually shows that the phone has

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.250 
that actually shows that the phone has
been<00:01:53.100> unlocked<00:01:53.370> where<00:01:54.000> before<00:01:54.240> same<00:01:54.960> t-mobile

SIM cards that it's in there when I put

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.710 
SIM cards that it's in there when I put
that<00:01:58.410> in<00:01:58.620> you<00:01:59.400> are<00:01:59.550> not<00:01:59.760> able<00:02:00.120> to<00:02:00.540> actually

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
that in you are not able to actually
