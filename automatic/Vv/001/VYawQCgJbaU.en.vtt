here in New Zealand the nh90s are
probably<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> only<00:00:43.710> piece<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.980> machinery<00:00:44.250> we

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
probably the only piece of machinery we

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.630 
probably the only piece of machinery we
can<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.129> operation<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
can do it so the the operation that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.160 
can do it so the the operation that

are probably one of the largest items we

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.200 
are probably one of the largest items we
do<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.609> things<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.149> the
