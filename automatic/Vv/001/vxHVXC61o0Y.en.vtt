00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:12.709
 and welcome back to one 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.200
 Today's teacher that with certainty 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.800
 can 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.260
 jambo from the field made famous 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.570
 I'll show you a few basics 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.779
 which they can then work on and off 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.230
 which you then your own version of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.919
 shambala can shape and friendly 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.910
 Enough is in the ten you pull and 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.910
 we have a melody 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.740
 in the left hand is the scheme 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.380
 relatively easy that only grows between 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.870
 ten and go and only between the 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.850
 first and fifth stage something else 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.980
 we do not have and I played in pieces 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.800
 a kind of boogie woogie rhythm and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.800
 though with our sky 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.050
 Now I do not know that it can be me 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.600
 strongly recommend them to basslines 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.330
 to look there they find exactly the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.220
 Specify how to play this left hand 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.979
 that is it should break off here now 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.500
 and go to the other video because we 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.090
 Now continue here and the piece 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.090
 I play relatively fast 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.040
 or 11 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.810
 There you can do a lot of great things 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.000
 I wish you a lot of fun while practicing 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.530
 look calm a little bit at 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.820
 There are enough jogi clubs around 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:01.170
 videos where both played by me too 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.170
 with a lot of fun
