00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.660
 hello cuckoo today I'm going 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.789
 teach you how to make a new 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.890
 incredible manipur who is this one and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.960
 called the marbles 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.480
 but what is it like a 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.430
 marble cake but on the fingers it's 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840
 very beautiful so be careful it's very 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.090
 complicated you have to be very very gentle and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.380
 about as much corner this is going to have to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.550
 hang on to this video it's not going to be 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.950
 the simplest I prefer to tell you 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.280
 immediately in commando mode the hall 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.950
 is this tutorial good we will have in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.579
 need a rotten jar ie a 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.079
 pot pourri actually that's what we 're going 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.719
 even more the rot will lend then 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.160
 we will need polish then me 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.969
 I chose two because I'm going 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.230
 to do a kind of zebra striping candy 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.969
 trick 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.800
 that's it but we can sometimes do 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.930
 spirals of the little flowers we 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 could put more subway 4 then 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.010
 but I find it pretty ugly here I am 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.890
 say it as I think 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.090
 here I am I chose to polish the best 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.740
 it's still a little bit 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.460
 clear because we will have to put it 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.950
 in base 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.869
 that's because if we do not put in base 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.610
 to prevessin sanader not and it's very 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.869
 very ugly and it's a shame because 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.850
 it's so boring to do that if 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.810
 it's ugly after we have a little 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.530
 the impression of having lost a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.159
 half day 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.810
 here is a corrector pen 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.790
 it's because you have to 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.229
 to fuck everywhere clearly even if 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.600
 you are a very very clean person 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.520
 as I am this of hearts 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.280
 we will need kurt hours but 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.509
 why make a name is not for 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.549
 recover the remains 2010 oh but that's 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.590
 to make small drawings here but 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.720
 that I will explain to you after 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.130
 dissolving at the crates of the blow that she there 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.880
 would have a little problem whether you are 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.399
 missed arrival tax and finally a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.350
 quite incredible technique you're going to me 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.259
 thank very quickly the head of the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.950
 scot it's party maximum excitement on 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.899
 are you going m so what do you do 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.970
 the idea is therefore first to open the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.200
 varnish is not it explains you 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.740
 why do you really need them? 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.820
 schedule 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.390
 well because it will have to be very 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.910
 fast you have to be a little 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.230
 varnish macgyver the relationship with the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.500
 speed not obvious but it's not 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.740
 serious it will have to first drop on 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.810
 the must concern a rose base 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.010
 that's how I told you at the beginning if 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.520
 you followed that you did a 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.010
 little effort 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.620
 it needs a clear basis for the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.360
 drawing can adhere thereafter and then 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.190
 the used said and techniques of the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.110
 scotch then i'm going to stick it on the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.290
 edge like this i'm going in all raymond 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.540
 must leave like this that it is for 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.180
 avoid having polish after everywhere 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.510
 on the poor drank deposited here 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.050
 also to protect my more 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.300
 optimal protection 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.770
 we start and that's where we see if that 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.150
 walk or not and if this is the course is at 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.200
 good temperature since if it is 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.560
 find it does not work at all 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.680
 first drops second drops 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:21.080
 it does not work very well it does not work 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:23.130
 all indeed was it even 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.810
 temperature 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.310
 so now that super good day is 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.560
 came my rescue 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.330
 the water is now at a good temperature 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.710
 that's a little cool when 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.310
 even here it's gone 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.810
 first gute up tex due to op 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.510
 so normally when it works in 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.510
 does that make a species flat deputy 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.800
 now here I am going to do my 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.230
 small and burns with the help of my cure 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.940
 you have to go fast enough because the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.890
 dry polish it can give the shape 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.720
 I want to go back now 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.620
 my finger in it like that is going to adhere 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.050
 to a chip 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.870
 we clean all the varnish that there is 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.220
 around that stagnates on the surface of 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.750
 so that when we go back up the 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.640
 finger it does not hang everywhere and that 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.170
 it makes a trick any credit here and 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.850
 so here's the corrector then we're going 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.579
 use it to remove small 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.299
 surplus year own strengths assets 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:24.240
 finished at all beautiful fingers 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.840
 I also made a tool a little 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.419
 culture 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.720
 a sculpture if you do not win this 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.930
 wonderful culture 1 and we are enough 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.090
 for this nec and this video is this 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.080
 not to leave a little comment for 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.280
 to say how much you found it 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.780
 sublime and then how much to 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.210
 how much you want to buy it 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.610
 then what would be nice is 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.860
 to share so must talk about a movie 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.810
 also talk about others that it takes 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.910
 subscribe to a gut 6h to our movies 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.340
 a delay here 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.190
 and then you have to google + it's on google 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.479
 + this is but in fact as it exists 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.100
