00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:20.200
 Oil is one of the foods we use on a daily basis, but it is not well known how it is manufactured 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.200
 How are common commercial oils made? 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:29.930
 First of all in the case of radish oil 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.930
 Squeezing out the oil contained in the crushed seeds under pressure 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.040
 me 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:42.690
 However , of the 40% of the oil included in the mid-market price 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.690
 Only 25% of squeeze majors can be squeezed 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.210
 15% of the aperture still remains 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.800
 In most commercial products, this aperture number 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:03.070
 Apply normal hexane 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.070
 It has been commercialized mixed with the remaining to victory in the lending squeeze until the oil was oil 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:16.759
 On the other hand, the squeezed first squeezed rape seed oil of Pal System 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.759
 We only use the most squeezed oil squeezed with the press 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.909
 Our stick is Maakore 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:29.610
 I went to the customers in the form of customers most squeezed 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.520
 Specific salad Pula This I say solvent n-hexane of petroleum 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.789
 Open 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.680
 Remove the oil with chemicals and extract it 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:41.020
 Almost all or pudding body fat king 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.020
 It sounds too good to be up to about become mealy 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.730
 Because the squeezed oil still contains impurities 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:58.200
 If it does not generate and remove impurities 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:00.600
 It will not be a product, but it will be the oil. What will you do if you enter this punk oil? 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.810
 Protein in the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:10.599
 I'm removing the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:12.319
 To Well moment in the usual general oils are using the consultation earned or with Hayashi in order to take the repulsive quality newspaper force 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:20.499
 That results in rigid and 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:20.499
 We take buy to do but how to do that to remove that protein in male mountain in our company 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:33.130
 If you put the boss in the squeezed oil and stir it, the protein in the oil will change 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:40.490
 Remove separated proteins after several hours 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:42.840
 Now put hot water in the oil is a protein that reacts to Izu 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:50.430
 Because there is also 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:58.700
 Spreading with hot water can also remove remaining proteins 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.700
 This IEmi process is carefully repeated many times until the oil is clean 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:08.610
 The factory is fully operational 24 hours a day 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:14.510
 It can not be done in a short time like blue peak using medicine 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:18.840
 I think that not even one week will take usually would one day in the shortest 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.200
 The male also weak's why over carefully time 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.250
 Let it settle slowly over time 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.260
 In the form of making it convenient 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.069
 Take 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.069
 Very one bullet 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.650
 Dattari such petroleum-based solvent in the fact that the safety and security 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.750
 It is medicine 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.020
 Suck also eat boss 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:48.190
 The crust the crust the crust the crust Oh Oh number of things 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:49.510
 I want to sing and offer back calculation and wait for something on the land that is well secured 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.690
 Depending on to say 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.700
 me 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.620
 Hmm 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:03.680
 Anxiety remains for consumers Normal hexane and testicular cancer 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:06.920
 Since these are finally heated and vaporized, they are treated as processing aids. 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.630
 It will not be displayed 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:15.020
 Hmm 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:17.780
 A practical matter and Well if there are items that display is ne Well display exemption of Tteyuu of additives 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:24.590
 Last product 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:27.620
 Under such conditions that there is almost no residue, they are used in the manufacturing process 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.620
 But it does mean that you do not need to display it. 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.669
 After all 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:37.650
 The problem is how it is made 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:39.510
 For example, I do not understand because I took one oil and I did not write it anymore 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.960
 What is the back like this ? 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:47.080
 I think there is something like this price 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.030
 I think it might not be something you make yourself 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.660
 With people who can use your feet 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.660
 Make 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.060
 It is a theme of a 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:05.259
 If it thinks only by the measure called economy, it can not protect the original manufacturing method 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.570
 It is up to each of us to choose the real thing
