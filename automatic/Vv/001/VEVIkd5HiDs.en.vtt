00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.900
 Jo Mei called the couple at the start and today 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.330
 we finish the video 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.330
 my diet the whole thing is over 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.900
 a little party like what where again 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.359
 magnet and and and let's just start 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.000
 time with the results 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.080
 So I started the enbw 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.840
 just write it with 84 kilo 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.900
 and I have 75 kilos now 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.400
 i have nine kilos less i have 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.950
 but one and a half weeks ago Kreatin 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.020
 canceled so that's natural too 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.780
 a significant part of it contributes 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.570
 that of course I'll loose 20's 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.400
 fiat lost him 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.810
 I started about a 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.260
 estimated body fat percentage of 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.510
 10 to 12% no idea somewhere 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.510
 according to 7 fold measurements i am at 6,6 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.000
 percent got them in the wrong one 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.040
 I made it twice with buddy once 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.350
 less at 6.3 came out at once 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.420
 69 So in the end, the mean is 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.490
 66 percent body update video comes flat 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.930
 that is the video of today synonymous so synonymous 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.530
 you've already seen that 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.970
 video sees I was there exhausted finished 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.690
 in general 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.970
 i did eight weeks of diet because 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.409
 a banal unity with it then takes 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.430
 it would be 9 weeks not quite nine weeks 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.180
 in the meantime there were always highs 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.130
 and deep, I have partially 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.870
 Extremely feeling I've always been 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.790
 but I was mostly in a good mood 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.229
 been now but the last two 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.580
 weeks had been hard I have 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.060
 do not bother training i have to 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.960
 I force you to go into training 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.900
 have the self 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.930
 I wrote then partly really 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.840
 just made two sets i have too 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.130
 two times two days not trained and 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.000
 it has me on my team 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.890
 Power tasted 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.470
 I also shot you a video 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 But you have already seen where 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.500
 where I resisted my strength show in the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.569
 end effect and there you see that me 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.220
 actually remained equally strong away 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.190
 am if you look at the videos of previous 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.209
 Looks like the whole thing goes on now 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.440
 so I did my first I 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:27.110
 experiment today is tuesday monday 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.790
 Easter Monday morning I start to load 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.190
 today it's just a little calorie 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.950
 deficit of 200 calories to start tomorrow 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.540
 I invite you to join me on Wednesdays 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.070
 fotoshooting and thursday at the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.780
 fibo should i bounce right because 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.850
 the whole thing is pretty flat yes 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.220
 So you will in the video on 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.820
 I think yes 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.060
 average of the last four 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.459
 weeks six hours 20 is natural 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.040
 totally shit average calories 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.650
 consumes 3 1500 calories average 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.940
 deficit 3000 calories yes I have 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.590
 Eaten between 2700 and 3000 calories 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.269
 the complete the noble actually through 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.140
 Thanks to the pony media I was able to do that a lot 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.180
 cover well 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.130
 On the whole it is very good 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.370
 As I said, I'm a creatine 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.110
 deposed I have deducted values yes 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.670
 and now the last trainings I have 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.900
 really 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.250
 So there I have to fight hard I have 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.370
 then started in the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.290
 shoulder pain 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.510
 It was all about heavy I got 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.250
 I got circle so yes was mine 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.630
 then sometimes dizzy when I 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.799
 now had finished the sentence were 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.560
 dwindling I had only times out 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.820
 Knee and there are many say so 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.920
 where I already noticed 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.200
 I'm okay you're pretty busy 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.390
 limit but I still have it 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.120
 average between 34,500 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.010
 between 4 and 500 gram cups eaten 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.910
 on the subject know what I certainly synonymous 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.709
 many are interested i never have that anymore 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.200
 130 grams of protein eaten so I have 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.840
 between 15 and 30 grams so eaten 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.620
 mean I would say about 120 125th 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.900
 gram 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.250
 yes and i could after weeks in principle 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.600
 I could hold my power 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.470
 Logically, muscles also do 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.320
 hold because she would not have me 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.030
 can hold my power and yes you 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.880
 just notice it's not power 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.470
 more that is no endurance anymore 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.310
 even the swim was exhausting 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.380
 that's what it looks like 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.540
 a short conclusion yes you have 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.720
 seen position but you can see here 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.110
 also pretty good it strip everywhere and 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.810
 something at the start as it looks like so 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.250
 I'm happy when I again in 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.690
 diet then makes for a competition for 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.980
 myself at least it is such a cash register 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.350
 if I do not do it anymore 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.580
 Now watch that for so long 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.460
 as possible, or at least 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.340
 only now about the summer 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.440
 between 3403 1600 calories depending on 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.180
 as it suits me and then we see 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.550
 continue 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.979
 how is it going as well as fat 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.510
 I never want to become important again 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.800
 I can stand in the indicator 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.150
 Training is all good 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.470
 between training does not have to go down 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.530
 I just raise the caps again 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.030
 yes this is just how it looks 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.590
 I 'm just following a folie of eating 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.380
 diet so you can see what we do 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.390
 move in 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.520
 that's how people look like we can do everything 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.520
 you can do it as well as me and 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.580
 we are watching the next video I am 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.020
 really happy that I'm over now 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.400
 and that I can eat normally again 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.400
 this year patrick 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.129
 space 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.600
