Jr's<00:00:14.820> robot<00:00:15.240> reactor<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.960> actually<00:00:16.170> think<00:00:16.350> that

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
Jr's robot reactor I actually think that

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.810 
Jr's robot reactor I actually think that
this<00:00:16.770> stage<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> lot<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.180> fun<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:20.460> end<00:00:20.640> of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
this stage is a lot of fun the end of

this stage is a lot of fun the end of
its<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.000> little<00:00:21.180> bit<00:00:21.300> tough<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
its a little bit tough but this is a

its a little bit tough but this is a
pretty<00:00:22.260> fun<00:00:22.439> stage<00:00:31.940> at<00:00:32.940> least<00:00:33.120> there's<00:00:33.360> only

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
pretty fun stage at least there's only

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:50.869 
pretty fun stage at least there's only
two<00:00:33.780> real<00:00:33.989> planets<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.710> place

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:59.100 

come<00:00:51.879> on<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.610> what<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:57.879> have<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:58.210> do<00:00:58.390> to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
come on this is what you have to do to

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.430 
come on this is what you have to do to
unlock<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.820> bust<00:01:01.360> open<00:01:01.480> these<00:01:01.780> gauges<00:01:02.050> and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
unlock to bust open these gauges and

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.259 
unlock to bust open these gauges and
you'll<00:01:02.559> have<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.829> do<00:01:02.949> this<00:01:03.129> a<00:01:03.309> lot<00:01:03.579> in<00:01:03.879> later

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
you'll have to do this a lot in later

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:12.240 
you'll have to do this a lot in later
levels<00:01:09.780> where<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.930> star<00:01:11.200> bids<00:01:11.440> there<00:01:12.100> they

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
levels where the star bids there they

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:29.380 
levels where the star bids there they
are<00:01:12.280> if<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.149> saw<00:01:13.330> some<00:01:13.539> other<00:01:13.660> trails

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:41.370 

and<00:01:30.890> mega<00:01:31.890> leg<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> first<00:01:32.729> major<00:01:33.000> boss

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.520 

I<00:01:41.439> like<00:01:42.189> all<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.670> boss<00:01:42.850> fights<00:01:43.149> in<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.539> in<00:01:44.380> a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
I like all the boss fights in this in a

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.740 
I like all the boss fights in this in a
schemer<00:01:44.799> pre<00:01:45.130> innovative

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.750 

you<00:01:53.410> just<00:01:53.620> want<00:01:53.800> to<00:01:53.830> jump<00:01:54.010> on<00:01:54.160> top<00:01:54.370> of<00:01:54.430> one<00:01:54.730> of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
you just want to jump on top of one of

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:09.940 
you just want to jump on top of one of
mega<00:01:55.420> legs<00:01:55.690> legs<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:57.030> run<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.120> course

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.449 

and<00:02:10.069> then<00:02:10.729> bust<00:02:11.150> open<00:02:11.360> that<00:02:11.540> gauge<00:02:12.459> there's

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
and then bust open that gauge there's

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.210 
and then bust open that gauge there's
one<00:02:13.940> more<00:02:14.330> cage<00:02:14.750> we<00:02:15.050> have<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.290> bust<00:02:15.530> open<00:02:15.680> this

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
one more cage we have to bust open this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:33.100 
one more cage we have to bust open this
is<00:02:16.430> going<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.610> be<00:02:16.879> a<00:02:16.910> bit<00:02:17.120> harder

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.640 

oh<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.950> made<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.430> look<00:02:34.580> really<00:02:34.880> easy<00:02:35.650> because

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
oh I made that look really easy because

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.720 
oh I made that look really easy because
those<00:02:37.130> gates<00:02:37.880> up<00:02:38.330> there<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:38.980> top<00:02:39.980> protecting

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
those gates up there on top protecting

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.850 
those gates up there on top protecting
the<00:02:40.760> star<00:02:41.060> those<00:02:41.480> will<00:02:41.870> come<00:02:42.110> back<00:02:42.320> over<00:02:42.650> time

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
the star those will come back over time

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.670 
the star those will come back over time
so<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.730> pretty<00:02:43.910> much<00:02:44.060> have<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.360> do<00:02:44.780> 12<00:02:45.350> not

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
so you pretty much have to do 12 not

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.220 
so you pretty much have to do 12 not
quite<00:02:45.980> as<00:02:46.100> fast<00:02:46.250> as<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.610> did<00:02:46.820> but<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:48.050> have<00:02:48.140> to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
quite as fast as I did but you have to

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.730 
quite as fast as I did but you have to
do<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.440> pretty<00:02:48.530> quickly<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:50.080> we<00:02:51.080> have<00:02:51.470> acquired

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
do it pretty quickly so we have acquired

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.150 
do it pretty quickly so we have acquired
our<00:02:52.400> second<00:02:53.030> grand<00:02:53.300> star<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.620> going<00:02:55.040> to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
our second grand star that is going to

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.750 
our second grand star that is going to
open<00:02:55.400> up<00:02:55.520> the<00:02:55.700> next<00:02:56.230> observatory<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.760> I'm

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
open up the next observatory and I'm

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.380 
open up the next observatory and I'm
going<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.180> start<00:03:00.280> with<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.340> galaxies<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.000> that

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
going to start with the galaxies of that

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.550 
going to start with the galaxies of that
next<00:03:03.050> time<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:05.030> meantime<00:03:05.240> though<00:03:05.690> we<00:03:06.410> have

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
next time in the meantime though we have

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:28.630 
next time in the meantime though we have
a<00:03:06.590> nice<00:03:06.920> cut<00:03:07.430> scene<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.970> watch

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.460 

this<00:03:29.640> grand<00:03:30.030> star<00:03:30.300> opens<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.990> path<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.410> the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
this grand star opens the path to the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:42.080 
this grand star opens the path to the
second<00:03:31.860> observatory<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.610> fountain<00:03:41.090> and

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
second observatory the fountain and

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.690 
second observatory the fountain and
because<00:03:42.750> we've<00:03:42.930> done<00:03:43.170> some<00:03:43.410> work<00:03:43.700> getting

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
because we've done some work getting

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.480 
because we've done some work getting
extra<00:03:45.120> stars<00:03:45.420> we<00:03:46.380> can<00:03:46.740> open<00:03:47.070> up<00:03:47.130> multiple

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
extra stars we can open up multiple

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.250 
extra stars we can open up multiple
galaxies<00:03:48.030> at<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.240> time<00:03:48.450> I'm<00:03:48.720> still<00:03:48.990> going<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.140> be

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
galaxies at a time I'm still going to be

00:03:49.260 --> 00:04:03.710 
galaxies at a time I'm still going to be
going<00:03:49.440> through<00:03:49.830> them<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.370> order

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:16.590 

nah

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.110 

so<00:04:17.600> next<00:04:18.019> time<00:04:18.290> we<00:04:18.530> are<00:04:18.560> going<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:19.310> start<00:04:19.970> the

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
so next time we are going to start the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.290 
so next time we are going to start the
first<00:04:20.299> galaxies<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.959> fountain
