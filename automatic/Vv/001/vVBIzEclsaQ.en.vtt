00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
that car trip trick that I'm shuffling

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.600 
that car trip trick that I'm shuffling
the<00:01:58.229> cards<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.649> take<00:01:58.979> three<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.399> them

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
the cards you just take three of them

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.069 
the cards you just take three of them
off<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> back<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.420> put<00:02:00.840> them<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:00.990> the

we got we got ad Olga as the the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.100 
we got we got ad Olga as the the
holographic<00:02:35.790> which<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.300> amazing<00:02:36.870> looking

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
holographic which is amazing looking

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.170 
holographic which is amazing looking
that<00:02:37.290> looks<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:37.710> good<00:02:37.740> put<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.850> one<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.030> my

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
that looks so good put it in one of my

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.750 
that looks so good put it in one of my
new<00:02:39.390> sleeves<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.710> just<00:02:40.980> got<00:02:41.190> look<00:02:41.460> at<00:02:41.580> how

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
new sleeves to that just got look at how

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.790 
new sleeves to that just got look at how
fly<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.450> looks<00:02:42.810> though<00:02:43.110> kind<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.410> matches<00:02:43.590> my

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
fly that looks though kind of matches my

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.380 
fly that looks though kind of matches my
computer<00:02:44.160> background<00:02:44.550> maybe<00:02:44.850> that's<00:02:45.000> why<00:02:45.150> I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
computer background maybe that's why I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.700 
computer background maybe that's why I
don't<00:02:45.660> know<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.750> just<00:02:45.780> like<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.290> color<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
don't know I just like that color in the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.040 
don't know I just like that color in the
reverse<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:48.030> seviper<00:02:48.450> which<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.930> an

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
reverse is a seviper which is an

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.510 
reverse is a seviper which is an
uncommon<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.710> think<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.070> already<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.400> this

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
uncommon so I think I already have this

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.430 
uncommon so I think I already have this
one<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.090> reverse<00:02:51.480> actually<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.230> back

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
one in a reverse actually in the back

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.260 
one in a reverse actually in the back
feels<00:02:52.860> really<00:02:53.130> weird<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.520> feels<00:02:53.580> like<00:02:53.730> course

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
feels really weird it feels like course

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.930 
feels really weird it feels like course
like<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.410> that's<00:02:55.890> weird<00:02:56.190> has<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.460> weird<00:02:56.700> feeling

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
like it that's weird has a weird feeling

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.290 
like it that's weird has a weird feeling
alright<00:02:57.590> d<00:02:58.590> axis<00:02:58.710> so<00:02:59.580> i<00:02:59.610> think<00:02:59.790> i<00:03:00.060> might<00:03:00.270> have

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
alright d axis so i think i might have

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.630 
alright d axis so i think i might have
mixed<00:03:00.660> up<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.710> goodness<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> pack<00:03:02.430> so

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
mixed up the the goodness of the pack so

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.790 
mixed up the the goodness of the pack so
maybe<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:02.910> one<00:03:03.090> has<00:03:03.240> like<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.590> full<00:03:04.590> art

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
maybe this one has like a full art

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.500 
maybe this one has like a full art
whatever<00:03:05.070> i<00:03:05.490> don't<00:03:05.940> even<00:03:06.030> remember<00:03:06.210> what's<00:03:06.420> in

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
whatever i don't even remember what's in

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.350 
whatever i don't even remember what's in
the<00:03:06.630> set<00:03:06.930> i<00:03:06.960> think<00:03:07.260> legend<00:03:07.740> pieces<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.550> I

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
the set i think legend pieces and I

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.480 
the set i think legend pieces and I
don't<00:03:10.230> know<00:03:10.290> what<00:03:10.410> else<00:03:10.440> Prime's<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.340> don't

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
don't know what else Prime's I don't

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.550 
don't know what else Prime's I don't
know<00:03:11.550> Prime's<00:03:11.910> are<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.180> this<00:03:12.330> actually<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.050> was

Magikarp clefairy out whoops pidgey got
a<00:03:26.760> research<00:03:27.390> record<00:03:27.870> which<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.260> an<00:03:28.470> uncommon

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
a research record which is an uncommon

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.520 
a research record which is an uncommon
and<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:30.060> ten<00:03:30.360> growth<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.260> think<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.500> already

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
and a ten growth and I think I already

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.740 
and a ten growth and I think I already
have<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:31.950> tangrowth<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:32.760> putting<00:03:33.480> amounts

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
have that tangrowth so putting amounts

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.240 
have that tangrowth so putting amounts
of<00:03:33.840> ten<00:03:34.050> gross<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.620> don't<00:03:34.800> know<00:03:34.860> why<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.040> would
