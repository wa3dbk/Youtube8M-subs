 and 2 first edition of our podcast 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.090
 In this point, we will consider the following episode the anime series Digimon 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.080
 and discuss 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.899
 we 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.850
 these are for a text ads 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 in the young 1 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.400
 and on the other hand that I am me that the victory only around 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.770
 Now let's face it with who ever we are 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.600
 and now the total emerged 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.190
 percent 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.740
 so votes 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.250
 Dr 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.370
 but 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.700
 the new instances want 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.700
 when it became blind second grade 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.540
 Franz was already the picture then 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 people 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.610
 but then by the way Kelly and where has and now serious 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.620
 be formed now 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.620
 two years like that again 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.110
 I am the Simon I am 16 years old 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.140
 and I have the ones you are already following in kindergarten 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 to continue in elementary school and someday 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.759
 this is one of the opponents themselves 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.480
 Misha was very interested in that 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.690
 and continuation Aarau take half a year then I started again series 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.900
 look 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.110
 enthusiastic about and per year 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.259
 because you just 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.580
 getting older will also make some content easier to understand 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.110
 not understood before 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.099
 yes and since then 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.319
 I'm just a regular coker and I hope that someday again 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.849
 Way into German TV will find 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.479
 So after this short introduction 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.520
 in our project 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.900
 Let's start with the first episode of Season One 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.900
 the name of how it all started 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:27.369
 so 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.889
 we'll start with the summary shortly 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.490
 Percent the story 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.619
 is from Digi Man Adventure 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.969
 sets in which is explained briefly 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.969
 that there are very strange weather conditions in the world right now 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:40.969
 there are 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.549
 Percent in some areas 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:44.629
 drought 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.290
 In the Middle East, I believe a flood 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.179
 and in North America 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.939
 Percent of a sergeant's very harsh winter though it's actually Dobson 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:54.849
 Mat time was 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.559
 Century will be exactly 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:58.999
 and then 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:03.339
 Let's get to know our seven main characters in the series, all of them 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.479
 together in the summer camp are 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.879
 that are on the one hand 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.909
 Percent Martina t Tian Gorny 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.839
 Met Yamato like Schieder 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:13.819
 so rare 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.519
 go on and on 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.549
 ISI Kusch Iro Izumi 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.059
 Mimi the rental items though 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.059
 Joey Duin Kilo and Peter Kalafut addicted 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.079
 These seven percent children are just as I said at the summer camp 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:31.230
 when they suddenly notice that it started to snow 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.230
 Szczyrk summer the work that is common 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.099
 they are forgiven because of a snowstorm percent in the hour 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.409
 Scams and Kamenz blizzard 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.759
 Percent, they play in the snow 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:48.149
 and you can also recognize for the first time small traits to 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:52.699
 Example of EBT worrying his little brother tick m8 that he nothing 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.759
 Percent so percent should watch in the cold 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.900
 and Joey the suggestions you should rather stay in the camp so you can 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.929
 screaming cold catching 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:02.769
 percent 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.049
 at once 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.649
 So what he forgot is her 

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:08.909
 Height of the computer freak sits 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.719
 despite the snow being the only one to continue fighting 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.439
 and Vettel then his computer 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.440
 Percent then see that 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.009
 six children 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.009
 Aurora Aurora, which was a Northern Lightser for wine, was definitely it 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.389
 around 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.650
 and how the coach too 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.940
 and suddenly they stop 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.479
 as a meteor strikes 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.280
 from the then this weird in the AR 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.370
 when getting off 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.360
 the technically pedal to the device turn out 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.509
 on one side a huge tidal wave 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.110
 now draws the seven children 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.639
 into the world where they meet their di Montagna 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.499
 Percent if they are initially separated so first of all meet judgment 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:54.740
 ISI and percent 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.740
 the stuttering communicate as they interact 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.610
 those attacked by ProWal the man become a cheek and beetle Digimon 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.620
 the duties 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.749
 course always before this way 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:10.629
 and can hide in a kind of charcoal times it was not accurate 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:12.300
 Explanation gets 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.339
 Percent like this cave as they ever come in there 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.689
 after the Qur'an is a way to meet the two was so 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.820
 Percent the trowel and nice ones too 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.270
 you have met somebody partner 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.400
 and later, then,% contact and then met 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.909
 and imagine all again exactly 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.169
 Of course it will never be never 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.159
 which then becomes a total epic victory 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.479
 to come 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.479
 and again being persecuted by Kowa Damon 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.949
 The kids fished again until the Phelps percent on a rock abyss 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:48.800
 to meet 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.050
 and just can not get away 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.000
 Idea that one partners of the children decide then and together Kowar 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.900
 But Dammann have to attack 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.509
 No real chance to make Cuba win back for a short time 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:00.659
 is beaten 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.580
 as if respected on one then attacks again the animals everything nobody loves you 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.309
 to their next level 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:09.389
 and manage to unite revealed Watermann strike back 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.589
 in the wake of natural ones they go 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.190
 but and why and if he does one more time 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.610
 beats his teeth 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.969
 fall into the rock and the children 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.270
 Percent off the abyss from where the first episode with 1 very nice 

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:24.740
 Cliffhanger ends
