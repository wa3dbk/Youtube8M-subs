it and can she stop it is can she

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:44.879 
it and can she stop it is can she
control<00:05:43.990> it<00:05:44.110> does<00:05:44.199> she<00:05:44.289> have<00:05:44.380> control<00:05:44.710> of<00:05:44.800> her

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
control it does she have control of her

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.279 
control it does she have control of her
own<00:05:44.949> power<00:05:45.370> because<00:05:45.880> she's<00:05:46.570> very<00:05:46.750> aware<00:05:46.930> of

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
own power because she's very aware of

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.930 
own power because she's very aware of
what<00:05:47.409> she<00:05:47.560> does<00:05:47.800> but<00:05:48.070> does<00:05:48.250> it<00:05:48.370> seem<00:05:48.520> like<00:05:48.729> she

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
what she does but does it seem like she

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.390 
what she does but does it seem like she
can<00:05:49.240> control<00:05:49.930> what<00:05:50.199> she<00:05:50.380> does<00:05:50.590> because<00:05:51.370> she

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
can control what she does because she

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.010 
can control what she does because she
states<00:05:51.729> she<00:05:51.820> can't<00:05:52.210> kill<00:05:52.419> someone<00:05:52.750> so<00:05:52.930> it

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
states she can't kill someone so it

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.469 
states she can't kill someone so it
makes<00:05:53.169> me<00:05:53.289> assume<00:05:53.710> that<00:05:54.310> whatever<00:05:54.520> she

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
makes me assume that whatever she

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.140 
makes me assume that whatever she
transforms<00:05:56.050> into<00:05:56.199> has<00:05:56.470> control<00:05:57.010> over<00:05:57.039> her<00:05:57.490> so

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
transforms into has control over her so

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.270 
transforms into has control over her so
moving<00:05:58.419> mask<00:05:58.720> that<00:05:58.960> all<00:05:59.380> other<00:05:59.650> aspects<00:06:00.159> of

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
moving mask that all other aspects of

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.659 
achieve it stat there's gonna be three
seasons<00:06:48.419> but<00:06:48.960> this<00:06:49.440> is<00:06:49.680> going<00:06:50.009> to<00:06:50.100> be<00:06:50.190> like<00:06:50.430> 12

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
seasons but this is going to be like 12

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.129 
seasons but this is going to be like 12
episodes<00:06:51.150> and<00:06:51.300> then<00:06:51.389> the<00:06:51.449> next<00:06:51.690> season<00:06:51.840> comes

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
episodes and then the next season comes

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:53.689 
episodes and then the next season comes
out<00:06:52.289> like<00:06:52.410> two<00:06:52.620> seasons<00:06:53.009> from<00:06:53.130> now<00:06:53.220> so<00:06:53.460> forth

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 
out like two seasons from now so forth

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:54.680 
out like two seasons from now so forth
there's<00:06:53.850> gonna<00:06:53.940> be<00:06:54.090> a<00:06:54.120> break<00:06:54.360> between<00:06:54.509> each

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
there's gonna be a break between each

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.510 
there's gonna be a break between each
season<00:06:55.229> and<00:06:55.620> so<00:06:55.770> if<00:06:55.889> this<00:06:55.979> is<00:06:56.130> only<00:06:56.220> gonna<00:06:56.400> be

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
season and so if this is only gonna be

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.189 
season and so if this is only gonna be
12<00:06:56.729> episodes<00:06:57.180> I'm<00:06:57.360> guessing<00:06:57.750> it's<00:06:57.870> gonna<00:06:58.050> have

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 
12 episodes I'm guessing it's gonna have

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.469 
12 episodes I'm guessing it's gonna have
slightly<00:06:58.590> quick<00:06:59.009> pacing<00:06:59.460> I<00:06:59.639> I<00:06:59.669> don't<00:07:00.150> really

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 
slightly quick pacing I I don't really

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.260 
slightly quick pacing I I don't really
know<00:07:00.690> but<00:07:01.320> it<00:07:02.009> felt<00:07:02.310> like<00:07:02.520> this<00:07:02.820> overall

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270
