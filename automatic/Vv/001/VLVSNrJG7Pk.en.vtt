so<00:03:42.250> that's<00:03:42.430> another<00:03:42.700> reason<00:03:42.970> why<00:03:43.299> this<00:03:43.359> is<00:03:43.600> an

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
so that's another reason why this is an

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.050 
so that's another reason why this is an

Samsung continues to use their

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
proprietary charger there although this

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.710 
proprietary charger there although this
looks<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.680> little<00:03:57.010> bit<00:03:57.519> different<00:03:58.060> than<00:03:58.480> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
looks a little bit different than the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.509 
looks a little bit different than the
8.9<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.380> 10.1<00:03:59.859> we'll<00:03:59.980> have<00:04:00.069> to<00:04:00.160> look<00:04:00.280> at<00:04:00.400> that

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
8.9 and 10.1 we'll have to look at that

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.759 
8.9 and 10.1 we'll have to look at that
later<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:01.810> device<00:04:02.139> is<00:04:02.319> not<00:04:02.470> intended

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
later and this device is not intended

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.430 
later and this device is not intended
for<00:04:02.889> the<00:04:03.069> US<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:03.549> you<00:04:03.609> get<00:04:03.880> a<00:04:04.260> different<00:04:05.260> kind

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
for the US so you get a different kind

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.020 
for the US so you get a different kind
of<00:04:05.470> plug<00:04:05.709> there<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:06.100> let's<00:04:06.579> get<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:06.850> stuff

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
of plug there so let's get this stuff

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.830 
of plug there so let's get this stuff
out<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.420> way

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
out of the way

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.710 
out of the way
and<00:04:07.930> let's<00:04:08.470> look<00:04:08.650> more<00:04:08.920> closely<00:04:09.130> at<00:04:09.880> the

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
and let's look more closely at the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.500 
and let's look more closely at the
Galaxy<00:04:11.230> Tab<00:04:12.239> 7.7<00:04:13.239> let's<00:04:13.690> take<00:04:13.900> off<00:04:14.079> this

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
Galaxy Tab 7.7 let's take off this

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.210 
Galaxy Tab 7.7 let's take off this
screen<00:04:16.510> protector<00:04:16.930> here<00:04:17.500> obviously<00:04:17.919> a

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
screen protector here obviously a

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.649 
screen protector here obviously a
buttonless<00:04:18.579> design<00:04:19.090> this<00:04:19.239> is<00:04:19.389> running

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
buttonless design this is running

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.460 
buttonless design this is running
Android<00:04:20.039> 3.2<00:04:21.039> honeycomb<00:04:22.169> which<00:04:23.169> is<00:04:23.289> rather

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
Android 3.2 honeycomb which is rather

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.120 
Android 3.2 honeycomb which is rather
unfortunate

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
unfortunate

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.860 
unfortunate
because<00:04:24.490> honeycomb<00:04:24.970> compared<00:04:25.390> to<00:04:25.480> Ice<00:04:25.630> Cream

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
because honeycomb compared to Ice Cream

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.160 
because honeycomb compared to Ice Cream
Sandwich<00:04:25.900> is<00:04:26.470> kind<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.370> it's<00:04:27.970> quite<00:04:28.210> slow<00:04:28.480> so

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
Sandwich is kind of it's quite slow so

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.800 
Sandwich is kind of it's quite slow so

will<00:05:38.200> do<00:05:38.320> all<00:05:38.440> of<00:05:38.470> that<00:05:38.560> later<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.160> let's

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
will do all of that later and let's

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.910 
will do all of that later and let's
actually<00:05:39.880> just<00:05:40.270> go<00:05:40.510> right<00:05:40.840> home<00:05:41.350> we'll<00:05:41.620> skip

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
this will do that Hong Kong time let's

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:56.010 
this will do that Hong Kong time let's
switch<00:05:49.390> that<00:05:49.690> to<00:05:50.550> Eastern<00:05:51.550> Time<00:05:51.790> and<00:05:55.020> of

all of Samsung's Galaxy Tab devices but

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.270 
all of Samsung's Galaxy Tab devices but
this<00:06:03.850> time<00:06:04.120> we're<00:06:04.390> looking<00:06:04.420> at<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:04.990> with<00:06:05.770> Super

this time we're looking at it with Super

AMOLED on a Super AMOLED display and the

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.070 
AMOLED on a Super AMOLED display and the
contrast<00:06:09.010> is<00:06:09.220> just<00:06:09.520> unreal<00:06:10.150> here<00:06:10.420> as<00:06:10.600> a<00:06:10.840> little

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
contrast is just unreal here as a little

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.300 
contrast is just unreal here as a little
bit<00:06:11.260> of<00:06:11.320> a<00:06:11.410> comparison<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.040> we're<00:06:12.160> going<00:06:12.280> to

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
bit of a comparison and we're going to

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.210 
bit of a comparison and we're going to
do<00:06:12.460> a<00:06:12.490> a<00:06:12.730> more<00:06:13.510> full<00:06:13.840> test<00:06:14.230> here<00:06:14.590> we're<00:06:15.070> going

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
do a a more full test here we're going

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.220 
do a a more full test here we're going
to<00:06:15.280> turn<00:06:15.400> on<00:06:15.700> the<00:06:15.910> original<00:06:16.270> Galaxy<00:06:16.480> Tab<00:06:16.930> here

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
to turn on the original Galaxy Tab here

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.720 
to turn on the original Galaxy Tab here
just<00:06:17.710> so<00:06:17.770> you<00:06:17.860> can<00:06:17.950> get<00:06:18.100> a<00:06:18.130> sense<00:06:18.430> for<00:06:18.640> the

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
just so you can get a sense for the

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.970 
just so you can get a sense for the
difference<00:06:19.120> in<00:06:19.390> terms<00:06:20.230> of<00:06:20.530> the<00:06:20.710> screen

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
difference in terms of the screen

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.590 
difference in terms of the screen
clarity<00:06:21.370> so<00:06:21.490> let's<00:06:21.670> open<00:06:21.820> up<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.120> calculator

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
clarity so let's open up the calculator

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.620 
clarity so let's open up the calculator
on<00:06:22.870> both<00:06:23.320> and<00:06:23.670> maybe<00:06:24.670> that's<00:06:24.940> a<00:06:25.150> screen<00:06:25.480> that

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
on both and maybe that's a screen that

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.560 
on both and maybe that's a screen that
looks<00:06:25.750> somewhat<00:06:26.170> similar<00:06:26.940> very<00:06:27.940> different<00:06:28.420> so

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
looks somewhat similar very different so

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.120 
looks somewhat similar very different so
that<00:06:28.720> really<00:06:28.900> doesn't<00:06:29.350> serve<00:06:29.590> as<00:06:29.770> a<00:06:29.830> good

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
that really doesn't serve as a good

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.460 
that really doesn't serve as a good
basis<00:06:30.430> of<00:06:30.610> comparison<00:06:30.930> let's<00:06:31.930> go<00:06:32.080> back<00:06:32.260> into

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
basis of comparison let's go back into

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.880 
basis of comparison let's go back into

see if there's anything common between
these<00:06:49.190> if<00:06:49.850> it<00:06:50.000> go<00:06:50.090> into<00:06:50.270> alarm-clock<00:06:50.690> these

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
these if it go into alarm-clock these

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
these if it go into alarm-clock these

coming in the near future let's just see
how<00:07:20.060> fast<00:07:20.330> the<00:07:20.510> screen<00:07:20.780> rotates<00:07:21.200> this<00:07:22.190> is<00:07:22.370> such

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:22.640 
how fast the screen rotates this is such

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.240 
how fast the screen rotates this is such
a<00:07:22.850> nice<00:07:23.210> size<00:07:23.600> for<00:07:23.630> a<00:07:24.050> tablet<00:07:24.440> it<00:07:24.530> really<00:07:24.740> is<00:07:24.860> so
