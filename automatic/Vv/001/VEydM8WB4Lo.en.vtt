00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:11.000
 In the World Cup, a section of the show called "What Spain did not see" was known. There are pictures that we have to see that have not yet been seen. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 We showed it to you yesterday, and many believe this discussion between Pep Guardiola and Xabi Alonso is unbelievable. It is when Guardiola and Cristiano have a microcavia and Guardiola wants to be justified in Xabi Alonso. The rest of the Madrid players are not Xabi Alonso yes why he has such a personality that the guardiola knows ... These are some of the many pictures you deserve to see because this is "What Spain did not see". 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Spain did not see how Valdano smashed his hands to Camp Nou. He would have blurred his eyes. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Not that Mourinho greeted the guardiola. Not that Cristiano was looking for Villa's forgiveness. Seconds would not be his eyes. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Nor did he see that Xavi's hairpins just hide the ball but also hide a goal. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 And Spain did not see the game from the eyes of Benzema.Karim before he started ... Not even the faith of Paredo From the soil to Uranus Excessive glances to Villa and Messi! 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.000
 Karim in the 18th minute. Neither did he look at what he is looking for and he does not find it. Neither does he find and find! 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Karim in the 2nd half. And Spain did not see the shot without a reward. The reward would wait for a few seconds. 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:02:00.000
 Neither his 2nd hairpin. With the 2nd goal in his hands! And Spain did not see the 1st of Ramos. 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.500
 Karim after the 5th. And Spain did not see the transformation of Mourinho. So it started. And so it was over. The bitterness of defeat. 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:20.000
 Neither the fate of the bench to Cristiano Ronaldo. What Spain saw was another 5-0. Through Barca's eyes. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
