normal level of testosterone so the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.369 
normal level of testosterone so the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
what's the big deal about it they're all

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.590 
what's the big deal about it they're all
heavyweights<00:01:13.250> you<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.729> rule<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
heavyweights you know that all rule it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.910 
heavyweights you know that all rule it
around<00:01:15.869> 250<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> 60<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.939> they<00:01:18.840> could<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.560> mean

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
around 250 and a 60 so they could I mean

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.469 
around 250 and a 60 so they could I mean
in<00:01:20.100> theory<00:01:20.340> they<00:01:20.759> should<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> same

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
in theory they should have the same

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.230 
in theory they should have the same
power<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.530> absolutely<00:01:23.189> wrong<00:01:23.850> guys

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
power it is absolutely wrong guys

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.999 
power it is absolutely wrong guys
absolutely<00:01:24.479> wrong<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.830> several

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
absolutely wrong and there are several

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.969 
absolutely wrong and there are several
factors<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.630> some<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.500> might

factors for that so some of you might

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.719

if<00:02:37.769> I'm<00:02:37.980> not<00:02:38.099> mistaken

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
if I'm not mistaken

if I'm not mistaken
now<00:02:39.599> what<00:02:39.810> indi<00:02:40.079> was<00:02:40.260> quite<00:02:40.650> famous<00:02:40.919> is<00:02:41.669> poor

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
now what indi was quite famous is poor

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.110 
now what indi was quite famous is poor
hormone<00:02:42.389> which<00:02:43.069> obviously<00:02:44.069> converts<00:02:44.730> into

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
hormone which obviously converts into

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.349 
hormone which obviously converts into
the<00:02:45.959> star<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.680> or<00:02:46.889> literally<00:02:47.340> when<00:02:47.760> one

the star on or literally when one

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.679 
the star on or literally when one
testosterone<00:02:49.049> which<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.799> a<00:02:49.829> derivative<00:02:50.250> of

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
testosterone which is a derivative of

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.899 
testosterone which is a derivative of
the<00:02:51.689> star<00:02:51.930> Xuan<00:02:52.199> it<00:02:52.439> does<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:52.949> in<00:02:53.219> the<00:02:53.250> liver<00:02:53.639> so

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
the star Xuan it does so in the liver so

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.640 
the star Xuan it does so in the liver so
it<00:02:54.000> goes<00:02:54.150> through<00:02:54.299> through<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.719> liver<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.439> it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
it goes through through the liver and it

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.289 
it goes through through the liver and it
converts<00:02:56.069> into<00:02:56.959> one<00:02:57.959> testosterone<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.299> once

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
converts into one testosterone and once

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.879 
converts into one testosterone and once
the<00:03:00.449> stars<00:03:00.689> for<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.900> formula<00:03:01.230> mistaken<00:03:01.709> if<00:03:01.799> I

significant way your ability to feel

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
pain that's why some some steroids users

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.660 
pain that's why some some steroids users
do<00:04:38.270> not<00:04:38.450> feel<00:04:38.750> pain<00:04:38.990> even<00:04:39.290> when<00:04:39.950> they<00:04:40.130> destroy

do not feel pain even when they destroy
their<00:04:41.390> joints<00:04:41.930> that's<00:04:42.200> why<00:04:42.410> let's<00:04:42.890> say<00:04:43.070> take

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
their joints that's why let's say take

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.550 
their joints that's why let's say take
it<00:04:43.400> easy<00:04:43.700> when<00:04:44.390> you<00:04:44.510> are<00:04:44.660> on<00:04:44.840> something<00:04:45.110> strong

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
it easy when you are on something strong

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.080 
it easy when you are on something strong
because<00:04:45.800> you<00:04:45.950> don't<00:04:46.130> feel<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.460> pain<00:04:46.490> of

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
because you don't feel the pain of

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.320 
because you don't feel the pain of
course<00:04:47.390> guess<00:04:47.600> testosterone<00:04:48.260> is<00:04:48.500> the

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
course guess testosterone is the

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.870 
course guess testosterone is the
antagonist<00:04:50.330> of<00:04:50.540> another<00:04:51.070> hormone<00:04:52.070> namely

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
antagonist of another hormone namely

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.420 
antagonist of another hormone namely
cortisone<00:04:53.600> right<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.170> cortisone<00:04:54.710> that<00:04:55.250> is

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
cortisone right and cortisone that is

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.980 
cortisone right and cortisone that is
basically<00:04:57.250> related<00:04:58.250> in<00:04:58.880> a<00:04:58.940> major<00:04:59.120> way<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.630> the

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
basically related in a major way to the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.520 
basically related in a major way to the
pain<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.520> paint<00:05:01.760> process<00:05:02.030> in<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:03.140> human

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
pain to the paint process in the human

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.970 
pain to the paint process in the human
body

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
body

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.120 
body
so<00:05:04.280> that's<00:05:04.490> that<00:05:04.700> if<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.540> dude<00:05:05.780> is<00:05:06.140> on<00:05:06.680> something

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
so that's that if a dude is on something

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.030 
so that's that if a dude is on something
of<00:05:07.550> course<00:05:07.820> he<00:05:08.030> can<00:05:08.210> inflict<00:05:08.720> more<00:05:09.170> damage<00:05:09.230> to

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
of course he can inflict more damage to

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.850 
of course he can inflict more damage to
his<00:05:10.220> opponent<00:05:10.850> right<00:05:11.630> it<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:11.990> known<00:05:12.620> because

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
his opponent right it is known because

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.980 
his opponent right it is known because
he<00:05:13.010> is<00:05:13.130> way<00:05:13.490> stronger<00:05:13.910> and<00:05:14.300> he<00:05:14.390> is<00:05:14.480> stronger

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
he is way stronger and he is stronger

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.340 
he is way stronger and he is stronger
than<00:05:15.800> normal<00:05:16.130> even<00:05:16.550> though<00:05:16.910> he<00:05:17.900> has<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.050> same

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
than normal even though he has the same

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.620 
than normal even though he has the same
weight<00:05:18.650> so<00:05:18.950> a<00:05:19.130> two<00:05:19.790> hundred<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.120> sixty<00:05:20.450> five

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
weight so a two hundred and sixty five

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.910 
weight so a two hundred and sixty five
pounder<00:05:21.880> dude<00:05:22.880> who<00:05:23.180> is<00:05:23.300> not<00:05:23.510> natural<00:05:24.110> can

pounder dude who is not natural can
definitely<00:05:25.400> be<00:05:25.580> way<00:05:26.030> way<00:05:26.330> more<00:05:26.360> stronger<00:05:27.140> than
