00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 the building is already well 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.310
 advanced 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.290
 but before you start the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.540
 finish the mason still have to 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.540
 make coatings and subfloor 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.840
 after the masonry of the walls 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.369
 made of the pillars of the alloys is 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.960
 time to start the investment 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.090
 Alex is doing the first step that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.500
 consists of wall investment 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.429
 in the sequence he's going to show us 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.960
 How can I make a chapÃ©u? 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.270
 has the function of preparing the wall 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.680
 leaving the surface rougher and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.649
 providing better adhesion 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.579
 between the wall and the other layers of 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.800
 investment 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.920
 it consists of a very soft mass war 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.820
 a liquid mortar in the dash from 1 to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.449
 3 done, it is necessary to wait 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.340
 at least three days for drying 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.309
 second coating layer is the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.199
 called the charge the charge is nothing more than 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.020
 that the regularization of the surface 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.000
 using mortar to perform the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.559
 we need points 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.750
 reference and guides 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.330
 we use so-called tariffs is 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.880
 It is important to make two modifications 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 one of them is the plumb it should be 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.869
 made during the settlement of thales 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.990
 which checks whether the rate promo 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.790
 higher than the lower rate 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.390
 verification that needs to be done is 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.920
 relation to horizontal alignment 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.020
 using the aluminum ruler makes this 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.180
 check whether the grid made with 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.920
 the finalists are ok 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.840
 in the wake of the talisca we are 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.549
 making the master guides vertical 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.229
 the process is as follows with the same 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.880
 clamshell coating 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.799
 we launched among the finalists 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.079
 superior and even earlier 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.930
 the mortar and regularize or better 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.420
 nor veiled with the aluminum ruler does 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.939
 if the alignment of the two lists 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.530
 This vertical master guide has the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.430
 function of supporting at the time of 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.430
 pocket drag 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.970
 staff another check that also 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.750
 needs to be done is the verification of 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.610
 square 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.600
 it should be done when you have a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.600
 against walls 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.180
 ok the wall is 90 degrees exactly 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.459
 now it's time to make the refund 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.680
 itself is nothing more than 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.670
 release damp water against the wall between 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.250
 the meter guides 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.709
 this is the mass has the dash from 1 to 2 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.410
 for 9 or a measure of cement 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:31.830
 two lime measures and nine measures of 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.840
 Sand made the launch is time to do 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.840
 the thinning using a ruler of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.630
 aluminum me decide to support on the guides 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.920
 previously done 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.920
 regularizing the wall perfectly 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.840
 after the pocket drying we go to the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.120
 last stage of the wall cladding 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.159
 the plaster has the function of giving a 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.629
 more finish says the wall before 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.060
 receive painting 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.610
 this mass has a trace of one to two 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.060
 or a measure of calm for two of 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.610
 sand sifted notice that it will not 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.409
 meddling that brings alex will come here 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.060
 and will show us the sequence that 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.980
 must be made of plaster 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.980
 the first thing is to obey the wall 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.299
 done that you put some mass 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.859
 on the forklifts and 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.389
 apply on the wall making movements 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.410
 always circle from bottom to top 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.970
 the sequence is this 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.370
 just continue on every surface 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.370
 and the wall is plastered 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.310
 Finally, Alex will use a 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.260
 wooden splitter with foam 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.260
 to give the final finish to the wall 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.680
 made in all the plaster this layer 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.680
 is completed
