 so that could be the loire that is 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.310
 here but I changed 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.130

 paterno earphones are not very 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.640
 pleasant to the ear but hey it's 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:43.920
 it's not bad for a medium phone 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:46.290
 range a usb adapter for plugging 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:53.009

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.360
 is also available in white I know 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.400

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.970
 she have a few years but have no 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.830

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:36.610
 volume at the top you have the plug for 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.260
 the charger and for the headphones on the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.970
 right side 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.540
 the on / off button lock 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.960

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.170
 micro SD card on the bottom you have a 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:54.580
 microphone and the notch to remove the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:58.180
 hull so here the button menu button 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.450
 back and the button for the options here 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.830
 you have the earpiece to call and here 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.459
 what you see here are small 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.140
 sensors that allow that to extinguish 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.330
 the screen when you approach your 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.750
 here's the ear then we'll light it to myself 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.540
 prove 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.820
 on the other side micro flash microphone 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.510
 5 megapixel camera and brand 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.510
 saab are then or to the anime 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.180
 the code of the mit a model you can 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:54.990
 unlock your phone from 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:56.280
 many ways here then so I 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.060
 the nine 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.250
 I have not put a lot 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.390
 of application on it but what is 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.130
 rather annoying is that there is a lot 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.350
 application at the base so it takes 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.910
 a lot of memory and all these 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.330
 the basic one we can not 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:13.920
 remove 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:17.810
 you have a camera radio then 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.600
 we will test the internet bag to small 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.360
 so normally it's pretty fast 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.260
 but hey it does not catch much 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.770
 still do a test 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:35.370
 so that's pretty fluid and 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:40.220
 works with google pleases the ancestor 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:44.250
 de gaulle googleplex was android store 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.190
 that's it, we'll test the device 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.830
 photo it has a good quality 5 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.980
 megapixels no it's not it's not 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.560
 the iphone but it's already not bad 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:59.730
 you can not see what my 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.450
 device does not appear great here you are 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.380
 can listen to music 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:09.840
 I think I pretty much did the 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:12.050
 turn and that's the weather you have a one 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.830
 gps 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.250
 to spot a plan you can do 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.879
 itineraries on it here you are 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.879
 shows that you are 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:30.080
 so here's this phone 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.509
 is not bad at all I will you 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.090
 recommended 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:37.280
 and in addition the habib price has dropped since 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.129
 his exit he must be around 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.870
 130 euros 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:42.409
 and that's so it's over for this 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.379
 video 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.379
