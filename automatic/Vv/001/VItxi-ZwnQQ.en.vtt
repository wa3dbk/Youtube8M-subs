00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:04.629
 Dr 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.859
 We should be in the pampa without being particularly outraged by the US stock exchanges 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.379
 I thought I had wrapped up in the morning wishing to get around that 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.269
 realize 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.619
 under 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.560
 otherwise safe facilities 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.619
 No 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.619
 we aben 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.039
 on 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 see these 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.529
 act 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.260
 at the same time tried swallowed 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.300
 we are in the middle of the pampas 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.670
 b to find the relatively early degree because percent I had through the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.370
 Density of driving on rural roads and but - I thought how blatant SS 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.160
 that's a woman turned up 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.870
 and that's exactly what they did 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.699
 Percent of winter is tough 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.940
 has already seen him 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.370
 I have already been seen 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.610
 and that was pretty scary 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.200
 AP these goals in the already almost this one car it is we are at night 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.440
 and that is not a child itself 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.970
 The city in her tent in the back seat apparently wanted four days 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.370
 will take place and somewhat weaker while the parents 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.010
 let the lights go out you see the critters everywhere 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.829
 and he sure it will be sent 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.439
 as an important one today Kombi I have made a long time close and very short 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.600
 to report 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.040
 and the winners flash the cars are coming 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.369
 Customers are Aldi flashes today what percent they say 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.280
 because we have combined different techniques, namely long exposure 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.610
 and also very short shutter speed I have an exposure for example 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.659
 Ghost effects need transparency when exposed for a long time 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.759
 here with the natural light from the author 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.310
 she's already pretty spooky out of four that he's the Alexander of our mind 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.579
 and the chances of victory are percent in this light 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.830
 relative percent of institutions out 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.390
 and percent of the Occident he definitely does 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.160
 but the single card in the car flashed through the flash and a short time 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.160
 requested midnight and only 60 resolution was her son 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:18.089
 Percent, there is also a very crazy moved one does not know because 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.959
 There are a lot of different elements in it too, for example, test them here 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.959
 I have extra occupied Jan Paul long exposure for and made that 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.049
 i want to play everything on the computer so i compose them together and so to speak 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.269
 as I said 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.939
 Turn off the lights 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.890
 Schützenkönig is a click
