the leg much less smart off the kick
around<00:01:07.450> so<00:01:08.350> that's<00:01:08.500> not<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.770> best<00:01:08.799> way<00:01:09.100> to

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
around so that's not the best way to

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.789 
around so that's not the best way to
defend<00:01:09.460> what<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.270> prefer<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.720> do<00:01:11.049> is<00:01:11.470> think

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
defend what I prefer to do is think

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.530 
defend what I prefer to do is think
