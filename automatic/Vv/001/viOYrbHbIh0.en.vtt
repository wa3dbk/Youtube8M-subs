just making a smoothie from the recipe

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.710 
just making a smoothie from the recipe

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
on the package that I just got from my

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.720 
on the package that I just got from my
local<00:02:21.750> store<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.800> making<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.220> smoothie<00:02:23.580> is

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
local store so making a smoothie is

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.000 
local store so making a smoothie is
pretty<00:02:24.000> straightforward<00:02:24.330> but<00:02:24.840> yes<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.560> managed

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
pretty straightforward but yes I managed

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:41.290 
pretty straightforward but yes I managed
to<00:02:26.040> fail<00:02:26.400> anyway<00:02:27.060> so

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.680 

little<00:02:41.750> kids<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.830> next<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.300> tip<00:02:44.570> is

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
little kids the next so this tip is

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.900 
little kids the next so this tip is
probably<00:02:44.990> not<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:45.290> everyone<00:02:45.830> but<00:02:46.310> because

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
probably not for everyone but because

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.720 
probably not for everyone but because

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
pencils I know my notebooks look like

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.120

the important stuff in my notebooks and
on<00:03:05.510> papers<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.440> if<00:03:06.890> your<00:03:07.130> original<00:03:07.220> learner

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
on papers and if your original learner

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.370 
on papers and if your original learner
then<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.120> can<00:03:08.270> see<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.690> difference<00:03:09.170> between

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
then you can see the difference between

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.020 
then you can see the difference between
highlighting<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.220> not<00:03:10.340> highlighting<00:03:10.820> like

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
highlighting and not highlighting like

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.240 
highlighting and not highlighting like
highlighting<00:03:11.840> helps<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.470> much<00:03:12.620> for<00:03:12.860> me<00:03:12.980> so

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
highlighting helps so much for me so

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:23.320 
highlighting helps so much for me so
yeah<00:03:13.970> take<00:03:14.240> an<00:03:14.390> example<00:03:14.660> right<00:03:14.990> here<00:03:22.330> just

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
yeah take an example right here just

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.860 
yeah take an example right here just
like<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.720> moth<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.190> flame<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:26.180> sometimes<00:03:26.720> when

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870
