00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
I like the silver paint apps on it I

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.500 
I like the silver paint apps on it I
like<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.010> silver<00:01:00.370> right<00:01:00.489> over<00:01:00.729> here<00:01:01.030> right

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
like the silver right over here right

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.600 
like the silver right over here right
there<00:01:01.659> on<00:01:01.809> his<00:01:01.960> talent<00:01:02.290> his<00:01:02.559> Raptor<00:01:02.949> claw<00:01:03.220> like

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
there on his talent his Raptor claw like

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.740 
there on his talent his Raptor claw like
the<00:01:03.790> silver<00:01:04.030> paint<00:01:04.210> right<00:01:04.420> there<00:01:04.570> in<00:01:04.659> his

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
the silver paint right there in his

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.940 
the silver paint right there in his
teeth<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.229> I<00:01:05.260> think<00:01:05.409> they're<00:01:05.530> sculpted

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
teeth and I think they're sculpted

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.870 
teeth and I think they're sculpted
pretty<00:01:06.130> well<00:01:06.280> looks<00:01:06.520> like<00:01:06.580> we<00:01:06.700> get<00:01:06.820> some

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
pretty well looks like we get some

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.210

metallic<00:01:07.450> blue<00:01:07.659> right<00:01:07.840> there<00:01:08.110> for<00:01:08.320> his<00:01:08.470> eyes<00:01:08.710> I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
metallic blue right there for his eyes I

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.580 
metallic blue right there for his eyes I
think<00:01:09.370> that's<00:01:09.640> pretty<00:01:10.180> cool<00:01:10.479> too<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.170> tail<00:01:11.380> is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
think that's pretty cool too the tail is

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.110 
think that's pretty cool too the tail is
a<00:01:11.620> bit<00:01:11.890> short<00:01:12.310> though<00:01:12.550> that's<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.970> bit

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
a bit short though that's a bit

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.640 
a bit short though that's a bit
bothersome<00:01:13.659> for<00:01:13.870> me<00:01:13.960> I<00:01:13.990> don't<00:01:14.229> like<00:01:14.380> that<00:01:14.530> the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
bothersome for me I don't like that the

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.500 
bothersome for me I don't like that the
tail<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.070> so<00:01:15.190> short<00:01:15.520> which<00:01:16.030> they<00:01:16.180> made<00:01:16.390> it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
tail is so short which they made it

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.060 
tail is so short which they made it
longer<00:01:16.720> but<00:01:17.049> oh<00:01:17.229> well<00:01:17.409> and<00:01:17.560> then<00:01:17.710> there's<00:01:17.950> the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
longer but oh well and then there's the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.950 
longer but oh well and then there's the
top<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.490> figure<00:01:18.670> overall<00:01:19.450> really<00:01:19.659> not

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
top of the figure overall really not

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.180 
top of the figure overall really not
looking<00:01:20.260> too<00:01:20.409> shabby<00:01:20.440> now<00:01:20.860> this<00:01:21.010> figure

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
looking too shabby now this figure

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.950 
looking too shabby now this figure
measures<00:01:21.549> about<00:01:21.700> six<00:01:22.030> inches<00:01:22.270> across<00:01:22.420> and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
measures about six inches across and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.149

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
only about three inches tall so here's

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.289 
only about three inches tall so here's
our<00:01:24.250> one<00:01:24.310> step<00:01:24.610> changer<00:01:24.850> compared<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.210> the

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
our one step changer compared to the

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.120 
our one step changer compared to the
deluxe<00:01:25.570> slash<00:01:25.960> over<00:01:26.350> here<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.799> you<00:01:26.860> can<00:01:26.979> see

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.590 
deluxe slash over here and you can see
there's<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:27.549> much<00:01:27.670> more<00:01:27.909> detail<00:01:28.060> and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
there's so much more detail and

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.090 
there's so much more detail and
everything<00:01:28.960> going<00:01:29.140> on<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.560> being<00:01:29.799> a<00:01:29.829> deluxe

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
everything going on it being a deluxe

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.100 
everything going on it being a deluxe
class<00:01:30.430> figure<00:01:30.820> as<00:01:30.969> it<00:01:31.149> should<00:01:31.509> which<00:01:31.780> isn't<00:01:31.990> a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
class figure as it should which isn't a

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.719 
class figure as it should which isn't a
problem<00:01:32.140> with<00:01:32.500> me<00:01:32.590> one<00:01:32.770> thing<00:01:32.920> though<00:01:33.070> is<00:01:33.310> that

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
problem with me one thing though is that

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.100 
problem with me one thing though is that
I<00:01:33.759> really<00:01:33.969> wish<00:01:34.090> this<00:01:34.210> guy<00:01:34.390> had<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.810> silver

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
I really wish this guy had the silver

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.810 
I really wish this guy had the silver
talons<00:01:35.740> right<00:01:36.039> over<00:01:36.219> here<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.460> just<00:01:36.490> may

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
talons right over here I just may

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.550 
talons right over here I just may
repaint<00:01:37.299> this<00:01:37.420> so<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.780> these<00:01:37.990> talons<00:01:38.439> are

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
repaint this so that these talons are

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.719 
repaint this so that these talons are
silver<00:01:38.829> I<00:01:38.859> think<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.219> would<00:01:39.369> look<00:01:39.520> pretty

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
silver I think that would look pretty

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:39.990 
silver I think that would look pretty
cool

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
cool

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.310 
cool
so<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.270> main<00:01:40.390> reason<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:40.780> really<00:01:40.990> picked<00:01:41.229> this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
so the main reason I really picked this

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.200 
so the main reason I really picked this
figure<00:01:41.619> up<00:01:41.740> is<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.009> see<00:01:42.219> this<00:01:42.460> display<00:01:42.789> right

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
figure up is to see this display right

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.480 
figure up is to see this display right
over<00:01:43.539> here<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.020> I<00:01:44.079> think<00:01:44.409> slash<00:01:44.740> looks<00:01:45.039> a<00:01:45.159> lot

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
over here and I think slash looks a lot

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.490 
over here and I think slash looks a lot
better<00:01:45.759> with<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.180> figures<00:01:46.570> like<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:47.079> he's

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
better with the figures like this he's

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.260 
better with the figures like this he's
on<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.740> same<00:01:47.920> plane<00:01:48.219> as<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.430> Grimlock<00:01:48.969> over

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
on the same plane as the Grimlock over

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.429 
on the same plane as the Grimlock over
here<00:01:49.479> so<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.689> could<00:01:49.750> really<00:01:49.899> see<00:01:50.109> the<00:01:50.229> size

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
here so you could really see the size

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.649 
here so you could really see the size
difference<00:01:50.469> more<00:01:51.130> though<00:01:51.399> when<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.880> add<00:01:52.270> in<00:01:52.630> the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
difference more though when I add in the

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.419 
difference more though when I add in the
hope<00:01:53.170> we<00:01:53.320> just<00:01:53.500> got<00:01:53.619> tail<00:01:53.859> in<00:01:53.979> his<00:01:54.070> nose<00:01:54.280> and

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
hope we just got tail in his nose and

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.190 
hope we just got tail in his nose and
there's<00:01:54.609> a<00:01:54.700> deluxe<00:01:55.000> class<00:01:55.210> slash<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.840> he<00:01:55.929> just

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
there's a deluxe class slash and he just

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.289 
there's a deluxe class slash and he just
looks<00:01:56.439> way<00:01:56.710> too<00:01:56.740> big<00:01:57.429> he<00:01:57.729> stands<00:01:57.939> at<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.090> same

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
looks way too big he stands at the same

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.029 
looks way too big he stands at the same
size<00:01:58.539> as<00:01:58.689> Grimlock<00:01:59.079> over<00:01:59.320> here<00:01:59.530> surprisingly

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
size as Grimlock over here surprisingly

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.230 
size as Grimlock over here surprisingly
the<00:02:00.189> transformation<00:02:00.700> for<00:02:00.789> this<00:02:00.880> one<00:02:01.060> step

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
the transformation for this one step

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.719 
the transformation for this one step
changer<00:02:01.479> takes<00:02:01.689> a<00:02:01.780> very<00:02:02.170> very<00:02:02.469> long<00:02:02.859> time<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:03.700> I

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
changer takes a very very long time so I

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:04.889 
changer takes a very very long time so I
don't<00:02:03.939> blame<00:02:04.149> me<00:02:04.270> if<00:02:04.359> you<00:02:04.420> want<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:04.600> skip<00:02:04.780> the

don't blame me if you want to skip the

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.690 
don't blame me if you want to skip the
transformation<00:02:05.530> just<00:02:06.130> go<00:02:06.249> ahead<00:02:06.429> and<00:02:06.520> click

right over here annotation for that and

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.779 
right over here annotation for that and
that'll<00:02:08.830> take<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.490> end<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.729> the

let's<00:02:12.100> get<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.490> one<00:02:12.670> step<00:02:12.850> change<00:02:13.030> where

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
let's get to this one step change where

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.690 
let's get to this one step change where
you<00:02:13.240> take<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.450> away<00:02:13.540> bumblebee

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
you take it away bumblebee

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.160 
you take it away bumblebee
alright<00:02:15.700> good<00:02:15.880> job<00:02:15.910> will<00:02:16.210> be<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.630> what<00:02:17.050> you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
alright good job will be so what you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.230 
alright good job will be so what you
want<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.380> do<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.650> there's<00:02:18.220> these<00:02:18.460> pegs<00:02:18.850> right

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
want to do is there's these pegs right

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.910 
want to do is there's these pegs right
here<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.840> they<00:02:19.900> go<00:02:20.050> into<00:02:20.170> these<00:02:20.380> slots<00:02:20.500> same

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
here and they go into these slots same

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.400 
here and they go into these slots same
thing<00:02:21.069> on<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.280> side<00:02:21.460> over<00:02:21.580> here<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.410> boom

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
thing on this side over here and boom

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.650 
thing on this side over here and boom
there<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.010> goes<00:02:24.160> yeah<00:02:24.670> look<00:02:25.300> at<00:02:25.420> that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
there it goes yeah look at that

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.570 
there it goes yeah look at that
now<00:02:25.930> that's<00:02:26.110> get<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.290> 360<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:26.860> this<00:02:27.100> figure<00:02:27.430> it

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
now that's get a 360 on this figure it

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.430 
now that's get a 360 on this figure it
doesn't<00:02:27.880> look<00:02:28.030> too<00:02:28.270> bad<00:02:28.510> actually<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:29.110> like<00:02:29.319> the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
doesn't look too bad actually I like the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.160 
doesn't look too bad actually I like the
silver<00:02:29.650> paint<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.069> it<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:31.390> back<00:02:31.570> mostly<00:02:32.020> looks

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
silver paint on it the back mostly looks

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.360 
silver paint on it the back mostly looks
like<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.320> dinosaur<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:33.010> he<00:02:33.100> does<00:02:33.250> have

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
like a dinosaur but he does have

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.160 
like a dinosaur but he does have
articulated<00:02:33.880> arms<00:02:34.300> they<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.690> move<00:02:34.780> up<00:02:34.990> and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
articulated arms they can move up and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.460 
articulated arms they can move up and
down<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.620> much<00:02:35.920> so

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
down this much so

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.140 
down this much so
kinda<00:02:36.920> like<00:02:37.040> how<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.280> mouth<00:02:37.460> guard<00:02:37.730> looks<00:02:38.000> in

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
kinda like how that mouth guard looks in

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.400 
kinda like how that mouth guard looks in
the<00:02:38.240> helmet<00:02:38.510> looks<00:02:38.660> pretty<00:02:38.870> good<00:02:39.020> on<00:02:39.080> it<00:02:39.200> it's

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
the helmet looks pretty good on it it's

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.990 
the helmet looks pretty good on it it's
not<00:02:39.530> too<00:02:39.680> bad<00:02:39.860> for<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.220> one-step<00:02:40.610> changer

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
not too bad for a one-step changer

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.310 
not too bad for a one-step changer
really<00:02:41.180> now<00:02:41.510> look<00:02:41.660> at<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.870> rest<00:02:42.050> of<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.290> you

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
really now look at the rest of it you

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.900 
really now look at the rest of it you
know<00:02:42.500> all<00:02:42.620> these<00:02:42.740> details<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:43.550> make<00:02:43.760> it

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
know all these details to just make it

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.640 
know all these details to just make it
function<00:02:44.330> for<00:02:44.510> its<00:02:44.600> one-step<00:02:45.020> transformation

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
function for its one-step transformation

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.770 
function for its one-step transformation
make<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.010> look<00:02:46.250> actually<00:02:46.520> very<00:02:47.060> cool

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
make it look actually very cool

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.300 
make it look actually very cool
I<00:02:47.810> thought<00:02:48.080> about<00:02:48.320> logo<00:02:48.590> on<00:02:48.710> his<00:02:48.830> shoulder<00:02:49.130> I'm

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
I thought about logo on his shoulder I'm

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.740 
I thought about logo on his shoulder I'm
pretty<00:02:49.580> sure<00:02:49.730> he<00:02:49.790> did<00:02:50.000> not<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.300> an<00:02:50.420> Autobot

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
pretty sure he did not have an Autobot

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.420 
pretty sure he did not have an Autobot
logo<00:02:50.990> anywhere<00:02:51.380> on<00:02:51.470> his<00:02:51.620> Dino<00:02:51.830> mode<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.340> the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
logo anywhere on his Dino mode and the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.040 
logo anywhere on his Dino mode and the
arms<00:02:52.640> are<00:02:52.760> sculpted<00:02:53.150> okay<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.600> then<00:02:53.720> there's

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
arms are sculpted okay and then there's

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.870 
arms are sculpted okay and then there's
his<00:02:54.230> feet<00:02:54.590> nothing<00:02:55.070> too<00:02:55.220> spectacular<00:02:55.430> about

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
his feet nothing too spectacular about

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.730 
his feet nothing too spectacular about
that<00:02:56.210> at<00:02:56.360> all<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.720> here's<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.080> back<00:02:57.260> we<00:02:57.440> -<00:02:57.650> the

a one-step changer slash stands at about

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.160
