00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
up and it was you can also use a delayed

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.510 
up and it was you can also use a delayed
to<00:03:22.900> complement<00:03:23.380> your<00:03:23.440> solo<00:03:23.770> make<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.340> sound

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
more full it goes it goes all the way up

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.020 
more full it goes it goes all the way up
to<00:03:27.730> 600<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:28.690> look<00:03:28.990> around<00:03:29.110> six<00:03:29.530> 65<00:03:30.040> milliseconds

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
to 600 I look around six 65 milliseconds

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.360 
to 600 I look around six 65 milliseconds
worth<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.140> delay<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:32.410> it's<00:03:32.590> pretty<00:03:32.830> cool<00:03:33.040> I

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
worth the delay so it's pretty cool I

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.290 
worth the delay so it's pretty cool I
get<00:03:34.360> it<00:03:34.480> kind<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.870> mellow<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:36.490> know<00:03:37.150> so

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
anyways switching to the bridge pickup

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:47.970 
anyways switching to the bridge pickup
now<00:03:39.130> here's<00:03:39.460> bypass<00:03:39.850> signal

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.230 

and<00:03:48.980> now<00:03:49.790> here's<00:03:50.030> with<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.390> delay<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:51.050> the

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
and now here's with the delay and the

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:06.560 
and now here's with the delay and the
trusty<00:03:53.240> boss<00:03:53.450> ds-1<00:03:54.490> distortion

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.670 

so<00:04:07.570> you<00:04:07.630> can<00:04:07.750> kind<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:07.960> hear<00:04:08.080> that<00:04:08.320> will<00:04:08.470> try

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
so you can kind of hear that will try

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.080 
so you can kind of hear that will try
that<00:04:08.890> without<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.400> delay<00:04:09.610> just<00:04:09.850> so<00:04:09.910> you<00:04:09.970> can

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
that without the delay just so you can

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:27.930 
that without the delay just so you can
also<00:04:10.240> hear<00:04:10.510> how<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:10.750> would<00:04:10.870> sound

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.340 

so<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.000> know<00:04:29.270> so<00:04:29.510> you<00:04:29.570> can<00:04:29.720> hear<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.200> can

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
so you know so you can hear you can

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.659 
so you know so you can hear you can
clearly<00:04:30.560> hear<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.830> difference<00:04:31.250> as<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.400> when

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
clearly hear the difference as to when

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.790 
clearly hear the difference as to when
you<00:04:32.300> have<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.450> delay<00:04:32.840> on<00:04:33.050> or<00:04:33.230> not<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.560> I<00:04:33.590> think

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
you have a delay on or not and I think

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.000 
you have a delay on or not and I think
it's<00:04:33.919> pretty<00:04:34.100> cool<00:04:34.370> um<00:04:35.440> you<00:04:36.440> know<00:04:36.530> once<00:04:36.740> again
