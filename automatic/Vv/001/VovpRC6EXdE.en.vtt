00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.200
 here is such a device 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.900
 by chance I managed 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.620
 hold in hand i'm not an expert in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.470
 field of photography 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:22.020
 but I think he's cool this company 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:25.800
 aqua aqua which I always used 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.070
 a cassette is written here beat 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.300
 record maybe this is the model name 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.700
 because or nothing else is written 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.040
 here is what immediately strikes this device is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.710
 this one 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:53.190
 old school lens oh look what 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:57.469
 handsome and everything should be 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.120
 accordion here is some kind of mega magnifier 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.590
 which looks into space and apparently 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.590
 sends whale signals there 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:17.040
 what we see behind is very very beautiful 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:21.810
 shutter sound that we see from behind behind we 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:29.119
 see the cover which is supposed to 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.119
 open now about opened here 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 widescreen or like a name-calling 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:42.270
 wide shorter film cool well all 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:48.720
 there is nothing in the lens all 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.710
 filmed right here it is probably necessary 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.299
 twist by hand 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.399
 I twist the shots very good 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.580
 viewfinder I really liked it 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:05.290
 so straight nyashny up 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.729
 and look there and look for us to 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:13.600
 for taking photos here here 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.040
 cool red window so i'm so 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.360
 I understand through him 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.160
 we look and check the availability of the film ui 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.420
 inside 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.910
 so that, like that seed, semyonitch not shoot in 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.540
 idle 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:37.120
 so close the viewfinder here we are 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:43.500
 mounts on a tripod and here mounts on 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:46.810
 tripod upright position that's the principle 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.250
 I repeat I am not an expert on this 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.480
 tell me nothing more about him 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.180
 just cool its generally nice 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.950
 keep in hand 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:03.720
 here are two handles such things where the strap 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.760
 you can extend and of course its cover 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.330
 such that you can immediately see that this device 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.910
 very long and hard to use 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.950
 the most incredible situations and case judging 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.290
 because in such a beautiful state that 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.980
 parade cover perfectly coped with his 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.310
 by function 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.230
 and as I understand it will cope with them 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.030
 at 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.030
 all calm nights girls and boys
