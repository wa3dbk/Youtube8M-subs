bone so beta I'm not connected to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.250 
bone so beta I'm not connected to
internet<00:01:01.670> because<00:01:02.420> this<00:01:02.629> is<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.809> virtual

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
internet because this is a virtual

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.079 
internet because this is a virtual
machine<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.649> I<00:01:04.009> wouldn't<00:01:04.399> connect<00:01:04.640> in<00:01:04.879> it

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
machine and I wouldn't connect in it

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.990 
machine and I wouldn't connect in it
otherwise<00:01:05.570> it'd<00:01:05.750> be<00:01:05.899> like<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.189> IP<00:01:07.189> conflict<00:01:07.549> or

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000

in<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.310> light<00:02:12.250> here's<00:02:13.250> my<00:02:13.340> hard<00:02:13.880> drive<00:02:14.060> but<00:02:14.240> it's

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
in a light here's my hard drive but it's

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.230 
in a light here's my hard drive but it's
really<00:02:14.660> not<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.110> small<00:02:15.770> because<00:02:16.670> it's<00:02:17.120> just

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
really not that small because it's just

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.030 
really not that small because it's just
a<00:02:17.450> virtual<00:02:17.810> machine<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.350> messes<00:02:18.590> up<00:02:18.800> like

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
a virtual machine and it messes up like

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.580 
a virtual machine and it messes up like
that<00:02:19.300> same<00:02:20.300> theme<00:02:20.570> is<00:02:20.750> vista<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.410> bit

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
that same theme is vista just a bit

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.800 
that same theme is vista just a bit
different<00:02:22.090> like<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.300> side<00:02:23.510> you'll<00:02:23.750> notice

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
different like on the side you'll notice

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.690 
different like on the side you'll notice
it's<00:02:24.230> different<00:02:24.590> it's<00:02:24.710> cooler<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.280> like<00:02:25.550> it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
it's different it's cooler I like it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.360 
it's different it's cooler I like it
much<00:02:25.910> better<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.950> once<00:02:27.950> again<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.190> recommend

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
much better I once again I recommend

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.000
