00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello that such friends welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.660
 of multi gaming today we are going to make the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.940
 review of the blue jet microphone and this is 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.710
 the studio bundle version that apart from the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.410
 microphone brings two programs 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.529
 musical production that are the presonus and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.900
 the isotope we hope that this review will 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.390
 serve for future purchases now yes 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.750
 let's move on with the microphone that I eat 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.460
 You see, it's because of usb of course and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.090
 so it was not missing a source of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.340
 phantom power addition that is luján 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.490
 play of course which means that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.610
 just plug it in and it should work 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.680
 it's an aesthetically beautiful microphone 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.900
 resistant and especially heavy since its 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.240
 weight round the kilo and a half so that 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.250
 make an idea 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.230
 in the bottom part we can see that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.080
 Bring a thread to connect it to 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.150
 other support also has its entrance 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.010
 to connect it and an entry to 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.200
 headphones that by the way we can 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.200
 control the audio with the wheel you see 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.810
 just up 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.120
 the button that you see a little bit higher 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.950
 is to announce the microphone and if it is 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.020
 in blinking mode is that our 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.690
 microphone is distressed and if it is fixed 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.640
 is that it is available 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.280
 well let's move on to the back 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.250
 because there are several very useful options 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.520
 for example the profit we can 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.350
 adjust it to get a volume 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.410
 perfect this is depending if we are 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.300
 closer or further from the microphone by 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.550
 another side we have the pattern an option 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.900
 quite important that depends on the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.360
 situation where we are like 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.370
 example we have the stereo mode that this one 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.980
 uses left and right channels 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.510
 to capture a wider sound and 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.360
 It would be ideal if we want to record 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.770
 acoustic guitar or a chorus we have 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.230
 also the cardio mode and that is the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.750
 most used is ideal for podcast 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.910
 vocal performances or instruments the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.040
 cardio mode of recording sources of 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.780
 sound that are directly in front of the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.150
 microphone 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.070
 the omnidirectional mode picks up the sound 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.840
 of the entire microphone is used in 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.420
 situations in which the person wishes 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.979
 capture the environment of being there for 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.170
 to be clearer would be like a recording 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.650
 live or in the performance of a 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.420
 band and finally the bidirectional this 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.160
 mode only records the part 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.470
 front and the back of a 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.230
 microphone is ideal for recording a duet 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.670
 or interview of two people this part 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.440
 of the review is being recorded with the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.030
 microphone includes has the cardio mode and 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.920
 in the way most used by the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.570
 users well let's leave the review 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.550
 around here we hope you liked it 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.410
 I say goodbye but today I am nicolás for 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.410
 multi gaming and goodbye chao
