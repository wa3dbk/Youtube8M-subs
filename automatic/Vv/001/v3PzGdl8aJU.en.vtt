00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.900
 and as promised here's to you the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.900
 address book 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.239
 Hi everyone 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.940
 so today as I have already told you the 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.699
 I think the third part of the column will be there 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.970
 fourth video sorry but I'm a bit 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.220
 so let's move to the worktop e 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.150
 let's see what we need to create the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.960
 our liquid or gaseous filler here I do 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.030
 to use it as a primer is in the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.600
 decoupage course and also as a juice 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.579
 during the restoration a container a 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.759
 spatula 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:13.720
 the bologna water drop gesture is 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:21.630
 alcohol the passage from the ladder to the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.630
 what with his majesty was done 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:30.350
 fatigue but already done 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.350
 the second phase 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:40.930
 I was a single jab those plans 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.679
 he called the press room known 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.679
 we talk 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.870
 let speak of another sixth hut 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:04.580
 time was the track map 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:07.300
 but touch the ball this year 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.300
 celo is missing 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.370
 here is I'm going to put to mixed 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.890
 mix as you can well see e 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.610
 now I just add a micro drop 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:29.150
 of alcohol that will help to dry a lot 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:32.030
 faster and then up to get 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.010
 a very liquid compound in this way 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.340
 now we will also do a test with the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.340
 brush 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.680
 here I also took the brush 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.430
 now I get closer as you can see the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.650
 consistency and very liquid must have 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.210
 in fact that is precisely this consistency 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.620
 so let's move on from there 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.290

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.010
 I take the decoupage course because the 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.519
 course of restoration 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.989
