little<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.250> actually<00:03:20.519> is<00:03:23.450> put<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.570> up

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
little this actually is put it up

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.520 
little this actually is put it up
against<00:03:26.540> here

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.900 

here's<00:03:31.520> an<00:03:31.670> s4<00:03:33.459> was<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.580> case<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.180> but<00:03:35.390> it's

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
here's an s4 was the case on it but it's

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.570 
here's an s4 was the case on it but it's
pretty<00:03:37.910> small<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.840> is<00:03:39.140> feels<00:03:39.830> like<00:03:39.980> nothing<00:03:40.250> is

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
pretty small it is feels like nothing is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.760 
pretty small it is feels like nothing is
that<00:03:41.230> absolutely<00:03:42.670> weightless<00:03:43.670> on<00:03:44.590> it's<00:03:45.590> got<00:03:45.740> a

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
that absolutely weightless on it's got a

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.170 
that absolutely weightless on it's got a
rubberized<00:03:46.540> rubber<00:03:47.540> bottom<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.880> that<00:03:49.910> it

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
rubberized rubber bottom so that it

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.410 
rubberized rubber bottom so that it
doesn't<00:03:51.819> slide<00:03:52.819> around<00:03:54.280> like<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.850> box<00:03:56.120> that

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420
