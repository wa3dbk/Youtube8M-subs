00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
Yankovic a few years ago now so was one

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.869 
Yankovic a few years ago now so was one
of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> most<00:00:37.170> memorable<00:00:37.800> matches<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.760> me

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
of the most memorable matches for me

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.549 
of the most memorable matches for me
that<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.090> think<00:00:39.600> ever<00:00:39.750> played<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.200> my<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.530> my

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that I think ever played in my in my

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.130 
that I think ever played in my in my
career<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.040> because<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:42.210> crowd<00:00:42.420> was<00:00:42.480> really

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
career just because the crowd was really

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.930 
career just because the crowd was really
into<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.710> obviously<00:00:43.980> they<00:00:44.370> had<00:00:44.460> their<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
into it and obviously they had their you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.610 
into it and obviously they had their you
know<00:00:45.030> she<00:00:45.180> had<00:00:45.390> her<00:00:45.510> Serbian<00:00:45.989> fans<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.559> they

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
know she had her Serbian fans and they

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.979 
know she had her Serbian fans and they
were<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.100> into<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.820> was<00:00:48.120> almost

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
were just so into it and it was almost

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.510 
were just so into it and it was almost
like<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> soccer<00:00:49.559> game<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> way<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
like a soccer game in the way and I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.010 
like a soccer game in the way and I
think<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.879> know<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.000> obviously<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
think you know that obviously that was a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
think you know that obviously that was a
great<00:00:52.410> event<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> win<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:53.820> go

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
great event you just to win and then go

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.060 
great event you just to win and then go
go<00:00:54.270> off<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.110> Australian<00:00:55.649> Open<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
go off to the to the Australian Open and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.950 
go off to the to the Australian Open and
so<00:00:56.910> there's<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> lot<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.360> matches<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so there's a lot of matches that I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
so there's a lot of matches that I
remember<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.890> where<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.609> felt<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> clean

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
remember and where I felt like a clean

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
remember and where I felt like a clean
up<00:01:00.510> playing<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:00.960> good<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.379> physically<00:01:01.829> i

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
up playing really good and physically i

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.439 
up playing really good and physically i
think<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.489> obviously<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.969> tough

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
think it's it's obviously a tough

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.690 
think it's it's obviously a tough
challenge<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.110> because<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:05.369> remember

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
challenge out there because now remember

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.399 
challenge out there because now remember

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
there all the time but now that you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.040

older<00:01:31.580> she<00:01:31.880> understands<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.510> little<00:01:32.660> bit<00:01:32.870> she

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
older she understands a little bit she

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.690 
older she understands a little bit she

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
were achieved in the past and it gets

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.410 
were achieved in the past and it gets
you<00:02:00.050> going<00:02:00.260> again<00:02:00.530> I<00:02:00.830> mean<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.430> winds<00:02:01.730> are<00:02:01.850> of

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
you going again I mean the winds are of

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.880 
you going again I mean the winds are of
course<00:02:02.630> there<00:02:02.900> is<00:02:03.020> still<00:02:03.200> important<00:02:03.710> but<00:02:03.740> i

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
course there is still important but i

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.620 
course there is still important but i
think<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.280> losses<00:02:04.670> are<00:02:04.790> maybe<00:02:05.060> less<00:02:05.330> less

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
think the losses are maybe less less

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.840 
think the losses are maybe less less
important<00:02:06.130> you<00:02:07.130> still<00:02:07.340> want<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.580> learn<00:02:07.670> from

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
important you still want to learn from

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.760 
important you still want to learn from
the<00:02:08.030> losses<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:08.570> i<00:02:08.630> think<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.960> winds<00:02:09.290> now<00:02:09.470> are

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
the losses but i think the winds now are

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.520 
the losses but i think the winds now are
