00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.640 
why we had to take out the other pieces
and<00:02:32.290> put<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.560> new<00:02:32.590> ones<00:02:36.090> okay<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.150> now<00:02:37.450> the

and put in new ones okay so now the
fleece<00:02:38.650> has<00:02:38.890> been<00:02:39.160> positioned<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.690> I'll<00:02:40.840> just

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
fleece has been positioned so I'll just

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.760 
fleece has been positioned so I'll just
tacking<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.040> or<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.640> stapling<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.770> speaker

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
tacking it or just stapling the speaker

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.790 
tacking it or just stapling the speaker
ring<00:02:45.010> parts<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.090> place<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.630> yeah<00:02:47.020> that's

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
ring parts in place and yeah that's

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.480 
ring parts in place and yeah that's
pretty<00:02:47.950> much<00:02:48.160> it

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
pretty much it

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.020 
pretty much it
so<00:02:48.760> next<00:02:49.240> step<00:02:49.510> would<00:02:49.750> be<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.819> stretch<00:02:51.819> the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
so next step would be to stretch the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.770 
so next step would be to stretch the
fleece<00:02:52.330> behind<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.740> edge<00:02:54.330> that's<00:02:55.330> going<00:02:55.720> to

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
fleece behind that edge that's going to

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.160 
fleece behind that edge that's going to
be<00:02:55.900> glued<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.620> tacked<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.310> place<00:02:57.340> with<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:58.170> CA

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
be glued and tacked in place with a CA

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.340 
be glued and tacked in place with a CA
glue<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.830> don't<00:03:00.819> have<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.180> right<00:03:01.330> on<00:03:01.510> hand<00:03:01.750> so

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
glue I don't have that right on hand so

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:33.480 
glue I don't have that right on hand so
I<00:03:02.380> yeah

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.550
