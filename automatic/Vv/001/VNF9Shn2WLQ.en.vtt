00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.020
 so hello everyone who watches my videos on 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.620
 construction 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 turbo engines we will continue 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.840
 a little bit I'll just show it all 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.439
 really really look we are now 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.539
 we bring the turbo collector taken from us head 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.000
 our usual classic black 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.279
 boys asked 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.550
 such a construction is obtained by the way 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.740
 for welding seams do not judge because I 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.320
 not a welder and cook honestly 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 practically could not 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.879
 but still we get a little bit 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.950
 this is the base that's bolted 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:48.149
 heads what is it all welded here 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.579
 this part here it is taken from me bitch here 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.440
 and there was no spider 421 which I am safely 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.850
 cut here took this part then 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:04.010
 I bought myself the details here 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:07.400
 aisi 304 steel stainless steel food grade two 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.390
 here and then the whole structure yes that 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:16.530
 folded and welded so basically 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.500
 the boys here this thing in this I was also 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.119
 old here and here about this 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.509
 put 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.420
 I say nothing let's see what happens with 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.360
 us by the way 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.150
 pipes, well, everything seems to be initially 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.860
 I had such a part of the adapter that 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:43.320
 one collector here and from her this part 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:47.430
 cut it now let's throw it out think 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.030
 that pipe collector we succeed 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.290
 it should not be a flame 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.790
 here for later here these all hide 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.510
 who we have here 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.390
 under this thermal tape I will open with electrodes 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.660
 on stainless steel with boiling that's welding 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.270
 inventory let's not leave here electrodes 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.360
 stainless steel 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.400
 not professionals who felled 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.950
 welding machines have long been 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.280
 or so they said that of a complex type 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.500
 really difficult lose weight not a welder 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.890
 don't want a bit anyway 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.250
 it turns out so guys do it yourself 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.530
 you can make a pipe collector need 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.670
 a little bit of time and desirable so 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.670
 Hello
