00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.560
 a game that was originally intended to make some technical presentations. 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.340
 In the end, it became one of Nintendo's most popular star products. 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.260
 This year (2013) is the 20th anniversary of the birth of Star Wars Firefox. 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:38.400
 The mercenary group’s adventures in the Lylat galaxy continue to this day, and the most recent game is on the Nintendo 3DS. 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.580
 However, the development of [Star Wars Firefox] is not just entertaining. 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.860
 It also contains innovation 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.400
 It is the first game to bring Nintendo to the 3D world. 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:54.100
 The launch of [Star Wars Firefox 64] introduces a vibration pack, which can vibrate the controller according to the action in the game. 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.700
 And it is now standard equipment for video game controllers. 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.960
 So in honor of the 20th anniversary 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.540
 Let us review the [Star Wars Firefox] series....please enjoy 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.780
 In the early 1990s, a British game company called Argonaut Games was developing 3D technology for console games. 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.780
 Nintendo is very interested 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.240
 And hired a few programmers from the company. 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.020
 Including young Dylan Cuthbert 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.220
 Cuthbert developed a 3D engine at the age of 18 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.220
 Nintendo was impressed at the time, they asked Dylan to produce a Gameboy game called [X]. 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.160
 Sold only in Japan 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.880
 [X] is impressive because it is the earliest, otherwise the earliest portable 3D game 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.440
 [X] Rotating Miyamoto's brain like a gear 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.120
 He became famous in the video game industry because of the development of Mario and Dajingang games. 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.000
 It was only after the completion of the super-release version of [Flying Club] and [F-ZERO] 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.660
 He feels wasted a lot of time in order to draw many objects at different angles. 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.280
 Because that's not true 3D 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.560
 Miyamoto wants to use real 3D polygons on the super task 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.600
 The founder of Jez San--Argonaut Games, presented a prototype 3D game called snes glider to Miyamoto 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.620
 He can only run 3 frames in one second. 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.040
 San said if there is no additional hardware support. This is probably the maximum performance that can be achieved. 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.820
 Nintendo agreed to give Argonaut $1 million to develop the necessary hardware 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.860
 Find and hire a team of professional chip designers from Cambridge to develop the first 3D graphics accelerator 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.940
 Its code name is "Mali" wafer, but most of our well-known names are SUPER FX chips. 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.420
 So what did this chip do? 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.060
 in short 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.540
 Super Nintendo can't handle complex mathematical operations 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.320
 In order to render 3D graphics, the system must perform a lot of mathematical operations. 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.240
 Due to the limited capabilities of Super Nintendo itself, SUPER-FX chips are used to assist in these operations. 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.040
 With their new hardware, Nintendo can develop their new game. 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.420
 Dylan Cuthbert becomes chief programmer 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.060
 The team made some ideas, including the tank's 3D manipulation game. 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.920
 But in the end, Miyamoto rejected these ideas because they are just cool and not interesting. 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.600
 He hopes that the game will have a fixed path and that flying games will be the most suitable. 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.640
 Cuthbert remembers some frustrating development 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.140
 Due to constant changes in content games 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.660
 The programmer has several ideas for this game, but Miyamoto will shoot them. 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.780
 Cuthbert recalls that he learned an important lesson in this process, that is, there is nothing that must be put into the game, even if it is a good idea. 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.580
 Miyamoto’s strategy is simple, creating a playable and fun game. 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.560
 The rest is to compare the latter. 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.360
 The final game is 70% complete 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.260
 Now is the time to build the entire game world. 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.840
 Approximately 15 minutes from the old Nintendo headquarters, it is a shrine dedicated to Inari 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.560
 It is best known for its thousands of torii and fox statues on the road. 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.000
 This is a popular attraction known as Fushimi Inari Shrine. 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.640
 Miyamoto was inspired by the visit to the shrine 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.280
 The bird's door looks like an interesting obstacle 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:51.720
 The fox's idol and the mascot of the local baseball team are also foxes, giving the image of Miyamoto's protagonist. 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.980
 He gave his thoughts to the character designer Imamura Takaya. 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:04.640
 Imamura added other animals from Japanese folklore, including hares and falcons, but frogs come from different sources. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.680
 According to Miyamoto, a Nintendo staff used a frog as a personal mascot in his work. 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.920
 They adopted this mascot and made him the role of Slimby. 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.240
 Because I decided to use animals as the theme, 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.980
 So the dog and the monkey fight each other to become the main line of the story (Canine 猿の仲), 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.020
 The dog family led by General Pepper, opposed the monkey family led by Andres 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.140
 The spacecraft used by the Starfox team is a fighter called Arwing. 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:42.400
 The intentional design of the body as a triangle is due to the inability to make complex shapes due to over-restrictions. 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.280
 All these ideas and concepts together form a truly unique game called "Star Wars Firefox" 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:06:19.020
 BGM: Corneria 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.720
 The game draws a unique box painting that is the protagonist Firefox ● MacLeod's doll version 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.880
 Inspired by Miyamoto's favorite puppet show, such as the Thunderbirds, etc. 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.280
 So the character was made into a puppet wind 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.300
 In Europe, the game is sold under the name [StarWing] because of fear of infringement of the trademark rights of the old Atari 2600 game. 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.340
 [Star Wars Firefox] is a key and commercial success 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.360
 And it was the biggest sale in the history of video games at the time. 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.260
 Gamers are attracted by the technology used in the game 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.580
 People fall in love with all the characters in the Leilat galaxies 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:06.020
 The video game monthly magazine was selected as the best shooting game in 1993, and a new Nintendo star work was officially born. 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.940
 In order to promote sales and establish publicity, Nintendo created a super Starfox weekend 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.460
 This is an event held all over the world. 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:23.380
 Every store has a Starfox game cassette, which is a game that can only limit playing for 4 minutes. 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.660
 Today, this game cassette is attracting attention in the eyes of collectors. 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.420
 The current price on eBay is about $800. 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.480
 It is well known that Nintendo sells for [Star Wars Firefox] and SUPER-FX chips. 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.360
 They want to take advantage of this additional power in other games right away, like [Super Mario Yoshi's Island] 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.300
 But they have not finished yet 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:50.160
 Work begins with a more powerful chip and a sequel to [Star Wars Firefox] 

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.820
 The next episode of Gaming historian 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.760
 [Star Wars Firefox 2], almost complete game
