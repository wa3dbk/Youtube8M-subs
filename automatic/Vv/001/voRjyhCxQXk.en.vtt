00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.519
 Hello everyone 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.519
 today I 'm coming back to you with the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.920
 recipe for a baseness to dÃ¼rer I know 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.240
 not if it's done differently in 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.029
 different regions of Algeria in all 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.980
 case for me I'm preparing that with some 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.560
 semolina so I put too much to 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.670
 measure of average semolina I'm going to put 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.119
 a little bit of salt I mix everything for 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.119
 hand sparkle 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:42.120
 and here I add a flagship measure of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 butter fang 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.290
 I work with my hand 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.920
 need stationery but try to do in 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.510
 so that the sum absorbs all the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.510
 players so I'm doing this with my hands 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.420
 you 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.100
 is that some people add 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.350
 oil mixture of oil with 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.750
 butter but I'm using that bieber and 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.690
 there I add a little water as 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.230
 and as a measure until I get a 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.230
 dough 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.070
 ok I know to pick the semolina with 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.070
 some water 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.250
 no 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.670
 you must not put water once 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.370
 for all but try to put a 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.770
 very little like that you do not do 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.770
 a mistake by putting a lot of water 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.140
 so here I feel that my paw is almost 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.970
 ready 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.970
 I mix a little higher 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.540
 to test so I take a little 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.680
 piece I'm trying to do 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.239
 let's shoot so I see they break 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.720
 not who he is holding so that's my paw is 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.140
 ready 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:51.519
 so here i'm just going to suffer the pac 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.860
 on a clean stuff of course on a 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.720
 table or clean and there good I try to 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:01.390
 flatten it to give him about a 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.150
 thickness of 1 to 1.5 cm after I cut 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.280
 to give it a nice shape and there 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.930
 you can discover one of these as 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.319
 you feel it 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.450
 I have not in squares and rectangles you 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.859
 do as you personally feel 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.329
 I find this trio more English 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:21.129
 easy for me faster 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:23.670
 so I do this operation there so you 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.670
 can quickly 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.510
 what evening do you that the ends 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.510
 are far from genes 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.770
 and there the couple 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.359
 so that's what your first looks like 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:10.090
 piece of water does not stop in a triangle but the 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.209
 everything on a pan 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.810
 preheat on a really soft bottom and 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:24.410
 who I hope I let him take 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:26.810
 really his time so here you are 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.910
 cook on both sides you 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.070
 prepare something above it 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.690
 much better 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:38.560
 and then here first and on both sides 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.560
 I pose them here 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.550
 enjoy it with a bench it's at the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.550
 sale
