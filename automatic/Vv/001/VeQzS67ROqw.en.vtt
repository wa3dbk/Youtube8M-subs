Knight<00:02:26.360> takes<00:02:26.600> on<00:02:26.870> d4<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.610> move<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.820> plane

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
Knight takes on d4 is the move a plane

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.220 
Knight takes on d4 is the move a plane
in<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.480> game<00:02:30.220> let's<00:02:31.220> go<00:02:31.370> back<00:02:32.020> Bishop<00:02:33.020> takes

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
in the game let's go back Bishop takes

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.720 
in the game let's go back Bishop takes
on<00:02:33.440> d4<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:34.070> betim<00:02:34.790> over<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.240> let's<00:02:36.110> see<00:02:36.290> why<00:02:36.730> we

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
on d4 is betim over and let's see why we

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.880 
on d4 is betim over and let's see why we
would<00:02:37.880> have<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.240> continuation<00:02:38.890> Knight

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
would have this continuation Knight

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.200 
would have this continuation Knight
takes<00:02:40.160> Bishop<00:02:41.080> Knight<00:02:42.080> takes<00:02:42.410> Knight<00:02:43.210> Bishop

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
takes Bishop Knight takes Knight Bishop

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.630 
takes Bishop Knight takes Knight Bishop
to<00:02:44.570> b4<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.740> now<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:47.330> best<00:02:47.750> move<00:02:48.070> Knight<00:02:49.070> to<00:02:49.490> e2

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
to b4 and now the best move Knight to e2

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.410 
to b4 and now the best move Knight to e2
why<00:02:50.330> is<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.780> best<00:02:50.900> move<00:02:51.200> if<00:02:52.150> Queen<00:02:53.150> takes

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
why is that the best move if Queen takes

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.030 
why is that the best move if Queen takes
on<00:02:53.780> b4<00:02:55.360> then

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
on b4 then

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.280 
on b4 then
Queen<00:02:58.040> takes<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:58.460> d4<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.810> white<00:03:00.020> is

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
Queen takes on d4 and the white is

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.590 
Queen takes on d4 and the white is
better

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
better

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.950 
better
that's<00:03:02.600> why<00:03:02.870> Knight<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.710> e2<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.810> right

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
that's why Knight to e2 is the right

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.240 
that's why Knight to e2 is the right
move<00:03:06.370> Queen<00:03:07.370> takes<00:03:07.610> on<00:03:07.910> e2<00:03:08.239> Queen<00:03:09.230> takes<00:03:09.410> on<00:03:09.709> b4

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
move Queen takes on e2 Queen takes on b4

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.050 
move Queen takes on e2 Queen takes on b4
and<00:03:10.520> game<00:03:11.390> is<00:03:11.630> equal<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:13.310> black<00:03:13.580> is<00:03:13.760> also

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
and game is equal but black is also

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.090 
and game is equal but black is also
happy<00:03:14.360> because<00:03:14.680> he<00:03:15.680> won<00:03:15.860> upon<00:03:16.750> let's<00:03:17.750> go<00:03:17.900> back

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
happy because he won upon let's go back

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.590 
happy because he won upon let's go back
in<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.220> game

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
in the game

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.720 
in the game
black<00:03:20.600> captured<00:03:21.470> at<00:03:21.590> night<00:03:22.570> Knight<00:03:23.570> X<00:03:23.840> Knight

black captured at night Knight X Knight

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.090 
black captured at night Knight X Knight
Bishop<00:03:25.730> takes<00:03:26.120> Knight<00:03:26.380> winning<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.590> pawn<00:03:27.830> and

Bishop takes Knight winning a pawn and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.340 
Bishop takes Knight winning a pawn and
now<00:03:29.290> white<00:03:30.290> played<00:03:30.590> Bishop<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.310> b4<00:03:32.350> attacking

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
now white played Bishop to b4 attacking

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.830 
now white played Bishop to b4 attacking
Queen<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.970> you<00:03:34.970> know<00:03:35.000> what<00:03:35.270> black<00:03:35.480> played<00:03:35.720> in

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
Queen and you know what black played in

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.330 
Queen and you know what black played in
this<00:03:35.959> position<00:03:37.090> he<00:03:38.090> played<00:03:38.420> nothing<00:03:39.340> he

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
this position he played nothing he

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.330 
this position he played nothing he
resigned<00:03:41.200> why<00:03:42.200> he<00:03:42.650> resigned

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
resigned why he resigned

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.900 
resigned why he resigned
let's<00:03:44.150> check<00:03:44.510> why<00:03:44.750> if<00:03:45.680> he<00:03:45.920> continued<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.489> most

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
let's check why if he continued the most

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.790 
let's check why if he continued the most
obvious<00:03:47.420> move<00:03:47.600> which<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:47.959> Queen<00:03:48.290> takes<00:03:48.530> on

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
obvious move which is Queen takes on

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.720 
obvious move which is Queen takes on
before<00:03:49.250> then<00:03:50.239> white<00:03:50.660> put<00:03:50.840> caps<00:03:51.110> on<00:03:51.260> d4

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
before then white put caps on d4

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.620 
before then white put caps on d4
attacking<00:03:52.730> rook<00:03:52.940> if<00:03:54.160> black<00:03:55.160> put<00:03:55.370> castle<00:03:55.970> then

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
attacking rook if black put castle then

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.650 
attacking rook if black put castle then
Bishop<00:03:57.050> takes<00:03:57.410> on<00:03:57.590> f7<00:03:57.890> check<00:03:58.400> attacking<00:03:59.390> Queen

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
Bishop takes on f7 check attacking Queen

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.590 
Bishop takes on f7 check attacking Queen
so<00:04:00.260> if<00:04:00.380> for<00:04:00.560> example<00:04:00.620> rook<00:04:01.100> takes<00:04:01.310> Queen<00:04:01.670> takes

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
so if for example rook takes Queen takes

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.449 
so if for example rook takes Queen takes
Queen<00:04:02.870> what<00:04:03.830> else<00:04:04.209> if<00:04:07.239> black<00:04:08.239> plays<00:04:08.510> d6

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
Queen what else if black plays d6

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.259 
Queen what else if black plays d6
then<00:04:11.459> simple<00:04:12.140> Queen<00:04:13.140> takes<00:04:13.319> rock<00:04:13.680> with<00:04:13.920> check

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
then simple Queen takes rock with check

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.680 
then simple Queen takes rock with check
and<00:04:15.269> that's<00:04:16.049> why<00:04:16.579> black<00:04:17.579> design<00:04:18.060> but<00:04:18.299> let's<00:04:18.509> go

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
and that's why black design but let's go

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.670 
and that's why black design but let's go
to<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.930> critical<00:04:19.500> position<00:04:20.630> so<00:04:21.630> right<00:04:22.079> CAPTCHA

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
to a critical position so right CAPTCHA

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.180 
to a critical position so right CAPTCHA
was<00:04:23.520> with<00:04:23.910> Bishop<00:04:24.120> but<00:04:25.080> usually<00:04:25.650> grünfeld

that's why black dinner take bit big

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.450 
that's why black dinner take bit big
Bishop<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.389> that's<00:04:33.900> why<00:04:34.110> he<00:04:34.470> lost<00:04:34.680> game<00:04:35.130> so

Bishop and that's why he lost game so

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.930 
Bishop and that's why he lost game so
