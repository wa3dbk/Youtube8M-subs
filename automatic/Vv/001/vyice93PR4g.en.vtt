hey guys is Alec or deceased Rock HD and
today<00:00:10.590> I'm<00:00:10.680> going<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.860> show<00:00:11.039> you<00:00:11.099> guys<00:00:11.280> how<00:00:11.340> to

today I'm going to show you guys how to

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.429 
today I'm going to show you guys how to
make<00:00:11.670> landmines<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.929> this<00:00:13.199> is<00:00:13.379> my<00:00:15.410> marker<00:00:16.410> I

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
make landmines and this is my marker I

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.269 
make landmines and this is my marker I
guess<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.670> right<00:00:17.939> enough<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:19.039> what<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.099> do

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
guess it's right enough so what you do

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.430 
guess it's right enough so what you do
is<00:00:20.310> dig<00:00:21.300> three<00:00:21.570> blocks<00:00:21.869> down<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.860> spider<00:00:23.310> web

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
is dig three blocks down with spider web

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.519 
is dig three blocks down with spider web
then<00:00:25.440> tanti<00:00:26.090> gravel<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.360> sand<00:00:27.390> doesn't<00:00:28.260> really

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
then tanti gravel or sand doesn't really

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.359 
then tanti gravel or sand doesn't really
matter<00:00:28.740> which<00:00:29.010> time<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.550> prefer<00:00:29.940> sand<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
matter which time I prefer sand with a

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.240 
matter which time I prefer sand with a
wooden<00:00:32.369> pressure<00:00:32.609> plate<00:00:32.910> or<00:00:33.890> gravel<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
wooden pressure plate or gravel with a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.329 
wooden pressure plate or gravel with a
stone<00:00:35.760> pressure<00:00:36.149> plate<00:00:36.480> now<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.079> is

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
stone pressure plate now what you do is

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.619 
stone pressure plate now what you do is
they're<00:00:38.339> supposed<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> walk<00:00:38.940> over<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.449> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
they're supposed to walk over it and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.599 
they're supposed to walk over it and
then<00:00:39.749> not<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:40.019> able<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.229> jump<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.589> so<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.249> walk

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
then not be able to jump out so I walk

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.360 
then not be able to jump out so I walk
over<00:00:41.789> it<00:00:42.350> that<00:00:43.350> usually<00:00:43.499> happens<00:00:44.069> that's<00:00:44.219> why

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
over it that usually happens that's why

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.849 
over it that usually happens that's why
i<00:00:44.429> have<00:00:44.699> three<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:47.449> then<00:00:48.449> you're<00:00:48.600> screwed<00:00:48.859> now

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
i have three and then you're screwed now

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.840 
i have three and then you're screwed now
there<00:00:50.519> is<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.420> more<00:00:51.979> efficient<00:00:52.979> way<00:00:53.069> of<00:00:53.219> making

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
there is a more efficient way of making

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.610 
there is a more efficient way of making
it<00:00:54.030> not<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.510> officially<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it not really officially it's just a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.559 
it not really officially it's just a
whole<00:00:56.190> lot<00:00:56.399> more<00:00:56.549> effective<00:00:57.030> dig<00:00:58.819> just<00:00:59.819> uh<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
whole lot more effective dig just uh you

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.910 
whole lot more effective dig just uh you
know<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.440> mean<00:01:02.309> how<00:01:03.119> many<00:01:03.179> course<00:01:03.569> is<00:01:03.690> that

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
know make I mean how many course is that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.289 
know make I mean how many course is that
you<00:01:04.920> make<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.369> all<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.119> make<00:01:06.270> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
you make for all right so you make a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.960 
you make for all right so you make a
little<00:01:06.540> plus<00:01:06.720> symbol<00:01:07.020> right<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.670> put

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
little plus symbol right there you put

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.660 
little plus symbol right there you put
your<00:01:09.660> spider<00:01:10.170> webs<00:01:10.410> now<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.190> way<00:01:11.370> I<00:01:11.400> did

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
your spider webs now the way I did

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.340 
your spider webs now the way I did
before<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.480> more<00:01:12.660> official<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.140> that's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
before was the more official one that's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.130 
before was the more official one that's
the<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:14.190> you're<00:01:14.400> less<00:01:14.610> likely<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:15.180> step<00:01:15.960> over

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the one you're less likely to step over

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.040 
the one you're less likely to step over
and<00:01:16.560> die<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.880> know<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> mean<00:01:18.300> it's

and die on but you know I mean it's

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.210 
and die on but you know I mean it's
still<00:01:20.510> be<00:01:21.510> pretty<00:01:21.750> effective<00:01:22.220> it'll

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
still be pretty effective it'll

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.530 
still be pretty effective it'll
definitely<00:01:23.370> scare<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:23.850> crap<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.300> guide

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
definitely scare the crap out of guide

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
basically it that's how you make a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.280 
basically it that's how you make a
landline<00:02:09.410> but<00:02:09.950> there<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:10.940> also<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.900> better<00:02:12.110> way

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
landline but there is also a better way

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.820 
landline but there is also a better way
to<00:02:12.350> do<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.770> what<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.280> like<00:02:13.550> doing<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.830> destroy

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
to do it what I like doing is I destroy

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.950 
to do it what I like doing is I destroy
the<00:02:15.950> guys<00:02:16.070> house<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:17.060> lets<00:02:17.270> say<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.780> would<00:02:17.870> be
