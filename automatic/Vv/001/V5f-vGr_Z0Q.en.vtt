pretty<00:01:28.860> cool<00:01:29.100> especially<00:01:29.220> from<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.180> we've

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
pretty cool especially from what we've

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.910 
pretty cool especially from what we've
seen<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.570> him<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.020> trailers<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.650> how<00:01:31.860> he

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
seen of him in the trailers like how he

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.069 
seen of him in the trailers like how he
actually<00:01:32.159> gets<00:01:32.549> his<00:01:32.790> enemies<00:01:33.270> which<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.900> guess

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
actually gets his enemies which I guess

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.690 
actually gets his enemies which I guess
you<00:01:34.200> could<00:01:34.229> say<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.799> his<00:01:35.009> prey<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.520> how<00:01:35.640> he

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you could say is his prey and how he

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.550 
you could say is his prey and how he
just<00:01:36.000> jumps<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.509> from<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.869> buildings<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.530> I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
just jumps down from the buildings or I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
just jumps down from the buildings or I
guess<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> could<00:01:38.040> say<00:01:38.189> dive<00:01:38.490> down<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
guess you could say dive down so the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.440 
guess you could say dive down so the
name<00:01:39.689> definitely<00:01:40.290> does<00:01:40.560> sue<00:01:40.799> him<00:01:41.040> well<00:01:41.450> now

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
name definitely does sue him well now

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.060 
name definitely does sue him well now
that<00:01:42.659> wasn't<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> only<00:01:43.649> thing<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that wasn't actually the only thing that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.039 
that wasn't actually the only thing that
Alex<00:01:44.399> spoke<00:01:44.640> about<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.329> he<00:01:45.479> also<00:01:45.689> spoke

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
person he really is but in fact where we

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.310 
person he really is but in fact where we
did<00:03:10.670> see<00:03:10.880> him<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.269> more<00:03:11.420> recent<00:03:11.660> trailer<00:03:12.080> I

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320

guess we can say he is kind of caring

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.420

because<00:03:14.750> he<00:03:15.019> did<00:03:15.230> save<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.650> Templar<00:03:16.160> so

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
because he did save a Templar so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.550 
because he did save a Templar so
