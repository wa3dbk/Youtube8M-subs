if a widget is too big it can
auto-resize<00:01:59.610> itself<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.659> fit<00:02:00.869> into<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.229> space

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
auto-resize itself to fit into a space

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.130 
auto-resize itself to fit into a space
you<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:02.759> example<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.810> in

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
you want so for example here I have in

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.139 
you want so for example here I have in
this<00:02:04.619> column<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.219> right<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.640> my

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
this column on the right I have my

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.570 
this column on the right I have my
bookmarks<00:02:06.869> widget<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.950> let's<00:02:08.220> say<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.369> want<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
bookmarks widget now let's say I want to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.070 
bookmarks widget now let's say I want to
place<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.119> space<00:02:09.390> over<00:02:09.569> here<00:02:09.720> well

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
place it in this space over here well

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.520 
place it in this space over here well
that's

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that's

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.590 
that's
smaller<00:02:10.920> than<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.250> column<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:12.270> let's<00:02:12.450> try

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
smaller than this column but let's try

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.440 
smaller than this column but let's try
it<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.319> I'm<00:02:13.709> going<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.950> drag<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.370> into<00:02:15.120> that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
it so I'm going to drag it into that

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.449 
it so I'm going to drag it into that
space<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.310> let<00:02:17.310> go<00:02:17.959> but<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.470> resized<00:02:20.010> itself

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
space and let go but it resized itself

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.680 
space and let go but it resized itself
and<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:21.150> fit<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:22.050> perfect<00:02:23.270> now<00:02:24.270> another

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
