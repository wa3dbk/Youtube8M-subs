00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
so I'm just going to keep pushing I can

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.060 
so I'm just going to keep pushing I can
put<00:01:46.850> down<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.330> little<00:01:47.630> bit<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:48.040> powdered<00:01:49.040> sugar

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
you don't want a lot because you don't

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.719

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
roll fondant but I'm just going to put

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.260 
roll fondant but I'm just going to put
down<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.979> little<00:01:55.190> and<00:01:55.369> I<00:01:55.460> can<00:01:55.670> turn<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:56.090> and

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
down a little and I can turn it and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.270 
down a little and I can turn it and
rotate<00:01:56.689> it<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.320> can<00:01:57.619> always<00:01:57.890> be

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
rotate it so that I can always be

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.260 
rotate it so that I can always be
pushing<00:01:58.580> and<00:02:00.520> getting<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.610> good<00:02:01.790> angle<00:02:01.970> on

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
pushing and getting a good angle on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.469 
pushing and getting a good angle on
things<00:02:03.010> of<00:02:04.010> course<00:02:04.220> because<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:04.790> mat<00:02:05.090> is

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
things of course because this mat is

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.690 
things of course because this mat is
easy<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.049> pick<00:02:06.229> up<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.530> move<00:02:06.650> I<00:02:06.950> could<00:02:07.430> just

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
easy to pick up and move I could just

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.140 
easy to pick up and move I could just
turn<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:08.149> mat<00:02:08.360> if<00:02:08.689> I<00:02:08.929> wanted<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.849> now<00:02:10.849> there's

fondant onto your cake you can lift it

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.539 
fondant onto your cake you can lift it
up<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.069> big<00:02:16.280> pizza<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:17.150> put<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.019> top

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
up like a big pizza and put it on top

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.199 
up like a big pizza and put it on top
you<00:02:19.549> can<00:02:19.909> use<00:02:20.540> your<00:02:20.840> rolling<00:02:21.200> pin<00:02:21.650> as<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.819> bat

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
you can use your rolling pin as a bat

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.750

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
and lift it up and slide it on

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.509 
and lift it up and slide it on
or<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:29.489> can<00:02:29.730> use<00:02:30.030> your<00:02:30.060> fond<00:02:30.569> ex<00:02:30.780> mat<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:32.250> lift

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
or you can use your fond ex mat to lift

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.970 
or you can use your fond ex mat to lift
it<00:02:32.700> because<00:02:32.909> it<00:02:33.569> will<00:02:33.780> stick<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.769> fondant

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
it because it will stick to the fondant

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.250 
it because it will stick to the fondant
and<00:02:36.500> use<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.739> as<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:38.480> helper<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.750> meantime

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
and use it as a helper in the meantime

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.600 
and use it as a helper in the meantime
so<00:02:40.680> I'm<00:02:40.769> gonna<00:02:41.930> take<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.140> mat<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.220> move<00:02:47.489> it

a<00:04:39.100> little<00:04:39.640> bit<00:04:39.910> covered<00:04:40.690> so<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:41.500> would<00:04:41.710> just

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
a little bit covered so I would just

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.550 
a little bit covered so I would just
take<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.100> little<00:04:42.430> piece<00:04:42.820> of<00:04:43.500> rolled<00:04:44.500> fondant

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
take a little piece of rolled fondant

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.580 
take a little piece of rolled fondant
knead<00:04:47.560> it<00:04:47.710> until<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:48.070> was<00:04:48.190> soft<00:04:48.460> again<00:04:48.880> and

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
knead it until it was soft again and

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.100 
knead it until it was soft again and
then<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.650> can<00:04:50.860> come<00:04:51.070> back<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.460> polish<00:04:52.110> the

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
then I can come back and polish the

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.080 
then I can come back and polish the
edges<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:54.100> what<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:54.400> is<00:04:54.520> going<00:04:54.670> to<00:04:54.730> do<00:04:54.910> is

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
edges and what that is going to do is

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.820 
edges and what that is going to do is
it's<00:04:55.420> going<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.660> break<00:04:55.960> off<00:04:56.200> all<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.620> little

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.650 
it's going to break off all the little
sugar<00:04:56.980> crystals<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.730> so<00:04:58.120> it's<00:04:58.300> going<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.540> have

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
sugar crystals and so it's going to have

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.620 
sugar crystals and so it's going to have
a<00:04:58.690> really<00:04:58.930> smooth<00:04:59.500> satin<00:05:00.130> finish<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:00.880> it's
