usage and lasted for two years and we
decided<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:05.010> want<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.370> exact<00:01:05.820> same<00:01:06.090> product

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
decided we want the exact same product

again<00:01:07.040> just<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.130> different<00:01:08.520> color<00:01:08.730> this<00:01:09.240> time

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
again just a different color this time

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.510 
again just a different color this time
so<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> tea<00:01:10.410> kettle<00:01:10.650> by<00:01:11.010> lake<00:01:11.280> crew

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
so this is the tea kettle by lake crew

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.220 
so this is the tea kettle by lake crew
say<00:01:11.730> they<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.390> different<00:01:12.810> kinds<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
say they have all different kinds of

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.490 
say they have all different kinds of
sizes<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.460> forms<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.210> shapes<00:01:15.480> but<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.320> like

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
sizes and forms and shapes but we like

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.790 
sizes and forms and shapes but we like
this<00:01:16.740> particular<00:01:16.980> model<00:01:18.050> so<00:01:19.050> let's<00:01:19.290> start

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
this particular model so let's start

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.450 
this particular model so let's start
with<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.250> negative<00:01:20.510> here<00:01:21.510> um<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.110> that's<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
with the negative here um and that's the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.840 
with the negative here um and that's the
handle<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.690> manufacturer<00:01:25.620> claims<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
handle the manufacturer claims that the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.270 
handle the manufacturer claims that the
handle<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.360> heat<00:01:27.660> resistant<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.800> fact<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
handle is heat resistant but the fact of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.120 
handle is heat resistant but the fact of
the<00:01:29.430> matter<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.730> it's<00:01:30.300> not<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> case<00:01:31.050> so<00:01:31.800> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the matter is it's not the case so I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.560 
the matter is it's not the case so I
always<00:01:32.790> use<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> towel<00:01:33.660> as<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:35.120> remove<00:01:36.120> the<00:01:36.390> tea

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
always use a towel as I remove the tea

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.930 
always use a towel as I remove the tea
kettle<00:01:36.810> from<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.350> stove<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:38.730> that's

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
kettle from the stove I think that's

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.720 
kettle from the stove I think that's
really<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.510> puli<00:01:40.050> that's<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:41.310> poor<00:01:41.580> this

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
really a puli that's really poor this

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.540 
really a puli that's really poor this
product<00:01:42.270> design<00:01:42.630> other<00:01:43.260> than<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.160> though

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
product design other than that though

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.290 
product design other than that though
the<00:01:45.480> positive<00:01:46.170> features<00:01:46.650> definitely

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
the positive features definitely

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.380 
the positive features definitely
outweigh<00:01:48.300> in<00:01:48.600> my<00:01:49.110> opinion<00:01:49.800> that<00:01:50.010> one<00:01:50.640> negative

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
outweigh in my opinion that one negative

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.510 
outweigh in my opinion that one negative
because<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> fact<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.710> matter<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
because the fact of the matter is the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.360 
because the fact of the matter is the
catalysts<00:01:54.090> itself<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.990> very<00:01:55.380> sturdy<00:01:55.950> built

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
catalysts itself is of very sturdy built

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.880 
catalysts itself is of very sturdy built
as<00:01:56.580> I<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.060> told<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.510> it<00:01:57.690> lasted<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.530> two

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.150 
as I just told you it lasted for two
years<00:01:59.370> and<00:01:59.640> for<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.120> family<00:02:00.720> who<00:02:01.470> heats<00:02:01.890> up

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
water like five to ten times a day it's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.860

not<00:02:04.980> an<00:02:05.130> exaggeration<00:02:05.520> that's<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.690> how

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
not an exaggeration that's really how

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.279 
not an exaggeration that's really how
frequently<00:02:07.440> we<00:02:07.710> use<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:09.479> tea<00:02:09.660> caddy<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.110> heat

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
frequently we use the tea caddy to heat

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.179 
frequently we use the tea caddy to heat
up<00:02:10.470> water<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:12.060> its<00:02:12.870> successor<00:02:13.379> lasted<00:02:14.010> for

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
up water that its successor lasted for

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.250 
up water that its successor lasted for
two<00:02:14.400> years<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.939> that<00:02:15.180> speaks<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.019> quality

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
two years and that speaks to the quality

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.440 
two years and that speaks to the quality
of<00:02:16.939> the<00:02:17.939> product

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
of the product

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.020 
of the product
itself<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.410> there<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.129> no<00:02:20.340> point<00:02:20.610> in<00:02:20.819> taking

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
itself so there is no point in taking

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.850 
itself so there is no point in taking
you<00:02:21.330> downstairs<00:02:21.810> now<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.410> kitchen<00:02:22.620> and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
you downstairs now to the kitchen and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.710 
you downstairs now to the kitchen and
show<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:23.190> how<00:02:23.489> you<00:02:23.550> heat<00:02:23.910> up<00:02:23.940> water<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
show you how you heat up water and the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.729 
show you how you heat up water and the
teakettle<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.349> pretty<00:02:25.590> much

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
teakettle it's pretty much

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.920 
teakettle it's pretty much
self-explanatory<00:02:26.209> but<00:02:27.209> just<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.599> we<00:02:27.720> like

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
self-explanatory but just so we like

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.559 
self-explanatory but just so we like
this<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.560> see<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.430> on<00:02:29.610> camera<00:02:29.849> so

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
this so you see that here on camera so

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.710 
this so you see that here on camera so
the<00:02:30.720> handle<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:32.220> everything<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.910> is<00:02:33.120> really<00:02:33.480> of

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the handle so everything is is really of

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.120 
the handle so everything is is really of
sturdy<00:02:34.019> built<00:02:34.319> there's<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> little<00:02:34.920> bit<00:02:35.040> of

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
sturdy built there's a little bit of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.360 
sturdy built there's a little bit of
flexibility<00:02:35.849> here<00:02:35.940> as<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.660> can<00:02:36.690> see<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:38.040> top

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
flexibility here as you can see the top

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.100 
flexibility here as you can see the top
doesn't<00:02:39.180> come<00:02:39.360> off<00:02:41.000> if<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.269> prefer<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.660> fill

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
doesn't come off if you prefer to fill

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.259 
doesn't come off if you prefer to fill
and<00:02:43.410> water<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:44.010> way<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.549> I<00:02:44.580> usually<00:02:45.000> just

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
and water that way but I usually just

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.140 
and water that way but I usually just
leave<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.900> top<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.650> flip<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.430> whistle<00:02:47.819> here

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
leave the top on I flip the whistle here

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.479 
leave the top on I flip the whistle here
and<00:02:48.330> fill<00:02:48.569> water<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.959> there<00:02:49.200> but<00:02:49.489> but

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
and fill water in there but but

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.940 
and fill water in there but but
obviously<00:02:50.910> either<00:02:51.150> way<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.630> fine<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:52.560> yeah

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
obviously either way is fine so yeah

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
obviously either way is fine so yeah
well<00:02:53.220> obviously<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.880> comes<00:02:54.090> with<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.450> whistle

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
well obviously it comes with the whistle

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.009 
well obviously it comes with the whistle
and<00:02:55.080> that's<00:02:55.830> really<00:02:56.099> it<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.239> kettle<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.780> made

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
and that's really it the kettle is made

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.940 
and that's really it the kettle is made
of<00:02:58.290> enamel<00:02:58.980> which<00:02:59.630> which<00:03:00.630> makes<00:03:00.900> sure<00:03:01.019> that

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
of enamel which which makes sure that

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.309 
of enamel which which makes sure that
the<00:03:02.190> heat<00:03:02.519> is<00:03:02.549> being<00:03:03.000> retained<00:03:03.599> so<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.049> can

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
the heat is being retained so you can

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.580 
the heat is being retained so you can
really<00:03:04.530> heat<00:03:04.950> up<00:03:05.160> water<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:07.170> can<00:03:07.380> come

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
really heat up water and you can come

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.500 
really heat up water and you can come
back<00:03:07.620> half<00:03:08.160> an<00:03:08.340> hour<00:03:08.459> later<00:03:08.849> or<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
back half an hour later or so in the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.630 
back half an hour later or so in the
water<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.989> still<00:03:10.319> hot<00:03:10.349> which<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.310> another

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
water is still hot which is another

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.059 
water is still hot which is another
great<00:03:12.180> feature<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.319> this<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.799> best

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
great feature so is this the best

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.430 
great feature so is this the best
teakettle<00:03:14.670> ever<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.970> don't<00:03:15.360> know<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.810> was<00:03:16.079> good

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
teakettle ever I don't know it was good

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.100 
teakettle ever I don't know it was good
enough<00:03:16.709> for<00:03:16.980> us<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.400> go<00:03:17.940> again<00:03:18.420> for<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.840> same

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
enough for us to go again for the same

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.559 
enough for us to go again for the same
model<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.709> despite<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.340> fact<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:21.269> obviously

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
model it despite the fact that obviously

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.190 
model it despite the fact that obviously
and<00:03:22.170> admittedly<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:23.790> handle<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.450> just<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.900> very

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
and admittedly the handle is just a very

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.289 
and admittedly the handle is just a very
poor<00:03:25.799> product<00:03:26.280> design<00:03:26.579> because<00:03:26.940> they<00:03:27.090> should

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
poor product design because they should

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.729 
poor product design because they should
make<00:03:27.540> they<00:03:28.109> should<00:03:28.380> have<00:03:28.500> made<00:03:28.680> it

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
make they should have made it

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.710 
make they should have made it
heat-resistant<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.850> that's<00:03:30.060> not<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.540> case

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
heat-resistant and that's not the case

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.500 
heat-resistant and that's not the case
so<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.560> me<00:03:32.010> personally<00:03:32.609> it<00:03:32.790> doesn't<00:03:32.819> matter

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
so to me personally it doesn't matter

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.020 
so to me personally it doesn't matter
as<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:34.350> just<00:03:34.380> told<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.250> grab<00:03:35.639> a<00:03:35.670> towel

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
as I just told you I just grab a towel

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.970 
as I just told you I just grab a towel
and<00:03:36.389> take<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.720> off<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.870> stove<00:03:37.200> or<00:03:37.530> pour<00:03:37.920> it

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
and take it off the stove or pour it

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.309 
and take it off the stove or pour it
into<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.370> cup<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:38.609> it's<00:03:38.910> done<00:03:39.180> because<00:03:39.840> I

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
into the cup and it's done because I

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.410 
into the cup and it's done because I
know<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.950> product<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.400> gonna<00:03:41.579> last<00:03:41.910> us<00:03:42.150> for

long term

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.590 
long term
because<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.680> alternative<00:03:46.769> would<00:03:47.430> be<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.730> you

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
because the alternative would be to you

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.629 
because the alternative would be to you
know<00:03:48.630> buy<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:48.959> product<00:03:49.290> for<00:03:49.620> $19.99<00:03:50.609> or

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
something like that but then after a

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.729 
something like that but then after a
couple<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:54.030> months<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.510> have<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.049> buy<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> new<00:03:55.530> one
