and we're going to show you the tools
but<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.160> do<00:01:19.340> that<00:01:19.520> we<00:01:19.970> have<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.240> switch<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:20.600> game

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
but to do that we have to switch to game

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.600 
but to do that we have to switch to game
mode<00:01:21.380> 0<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.930> yeah<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.350> basically<00:01:24.470> this<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.130> one

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
mode 0 and yeah so basically this is one

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.940 
mode 0 and yeah so basically this is one
point<00:01:25.880> two<00:01:26.030> five<00:01:26.060> times<00:01:26.510> faster<00:01:27.140> than<00:01:27.620> the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
point two five times faster than the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.580 
point two five times faster than the
diamond<00:01:28.370> shovel<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:30.140> diamond

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
diamond shovel and then the diamond

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.680 
diamond shovel and then the diamond
pickaxe<00:01:30.830> is<00:01:31.310> one<00:01:31.580> point<00:01:31.850> two<00:01:32.210> five<00:01:32.240> times

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
pickaxe is one point two five times

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.960 
pickaxe is one point two five times
faster<00:01:33.140> than<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.740> Emerald<00:01:34.070> pickaxe<00:01:34.370> is<00:01:34.550> one

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
faster than the Emerald pickaxe is one

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.370 
faster than the Emerald pickaxe is one
point<00:01:35.240> two<00:01:35.360> five<00:01:35.570> times<00:01:35.870> faster<00:01:36.170> than<00:01:36.230> the

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
point two five times faster than the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.860 
point two five times faster than the
diamond<00:01:36.650> pickaxe<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.640> can<00:01:37.820> see<00:01:38.000> mine

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
diamond pickaxe so you can see mine

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.860 
diamond pickaxe so you can see mine
obsidian<00:01:39.050> isn't<00:01:39.650> nearly<00:01:40.010> as<00:01:40.130> bad<00:01:40.690> but<00:01:41.690> it's

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
obsidian isn't nearly as bad but it's

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.260 
obsidian isn't nearly as bad but it's
still<00:01:42.050> noticeably<00:01:42.680> slow<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.250> then<00:01:43.909> for<00:01:44.180> the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
still noticeably slow and then for the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.870 
still noticeably slow and then for the
horse<00:01:44.540> armor<00:01:44.780> as<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.320> said<00:01:45.590> it's<00:01:45.830> 1.5<00:01:46.580> times

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
horse armor as I said it's 1.5 times

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.390 
horse armor as I said it's 1.5 times
better<00:01:47.180> than<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.450> diamond<00:01:47.780> horse<00:01:47.930> armor<00:01:48.400> so

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
better than the diamond horse armor so

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.620 
better than the diamond horse armor so
we're<00:01:49.490> gonna<00:01:49.580> take<00:01:49.760> this<00:01:49.909> off<00:01:50.150> we're<00:01:50.540> gonna

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
we're gonna take this off we're gonna

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.560 
we're gonna take this off we're gonna
take<00:01:51.110> them<00:01:51.290> off<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.530> here<00:01:51.880> press<00:01:52.880> E<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.240> then

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
take them off of here press E and then

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.780 
take them off of here press E and then
click<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.200> on<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:55.100> actually<00:01:55.430> glitches

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
click this on but actually glitches

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.850 
click this on but actually glitches
right<00:01:55.940> now<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:56.960> you're<00:01:57.050> actually<00:01:57.200> not<00:01:57.470> able<00:01:57.710> to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
right now so you're actually not able to

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.880 
right now so you're actually not able to
put<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.070> on<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:59.330> basically<00:01:59.659> you<00:02:00.409> can't<00:02:00.620> protect

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
put it on so basically you can't protect

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.890 
put it on so basically you can't protect
your<00:02:01.010> horse<00:02:01.550> with<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:01.850> hopefully<00:02:02.659> will<00:02:02.690> be

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
your horse with this hopefully will be

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.490
