00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:13.410
 so hello and welcome last 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:15.360
 at 3001 de stage 6 media tank of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.410
 the German is actually only one 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.830
 miniature edition of vk 3000 2d and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.390
 somehow the equivalent to the t 34 without 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 85 that if I then the 3000 2 d 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.369
 you heard correctly levels 6 and 34 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.850
 why does not that just fit that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.739
 That's what we mean 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.770
 can cut with it what actually 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.270
 also the main reason for buying this 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.559
 vehicle is likely to be because it is 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.320
 about the same again vk 3001 hair 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.739
 or the panther live on level seven 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.760
 that means we will then sliten and 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.600
 this part is meant for that too 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.190
 it has at least been distributed to me 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.439
 but everything is just more up 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.340
 and we will 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.549
 right now express it so hello 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.229
 I'm the only one in a battle 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.369
 what was sometime found 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.259
 that's why I have to go directly 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.700
 take up 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.170
 but what the heck they already is 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.990
 is moving quite fast what does not turn 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.319
 good the usual with the German 1 has 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.579
 there is no pirate turn-king bit 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:33.280
 pity that was in any way 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:37.020
 Acer video times said well what should we 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.020
 have a t 34 in gray 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.530
 if you're curious how that works because of the 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.690
 map here is actually already right 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.400
 big and then only six 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.120
 play seven players per side times 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.120
 look how it will be 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.930
 then just stay here 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.420
 stand and wait for the enemy is you 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.170
 get along in the end that's right 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:41.310
 which represents the game and I meet 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:44.580
 me and now I'm still stuck 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.580
 almost to 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.840
 that 's me too often now 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.560
 but those hits do not stand out 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.870
 damage 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.270
 they are always coming up 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.320
 Reinforced on you can see already 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.380
 you hardly ever get to grade 6 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.130
 the armor is somehow already 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.840
 a bit understated 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.880
 and well the match was really shit but 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.150
 they see exactly what the whole one 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.760
 time happens on the testserver man 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.470
 just loses mega moderate because of the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.180
 only one is somehow and the one 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.150
 rest behind kindly at base 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:41.360
 camp I'm not complaining now but 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:45.010
 why do you do that ? 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.180
 now also no matter when I'm already dead 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.440
 Here we can still the smoking questioned 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.740
 I've seen a lot of things lately 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.030
 have seen well the test server is 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.660
 really shit 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.680
 Honestly, I 'll just come to that 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:04.959
 not clear and I just do not feel like it 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.980
 more on it without jokes but ugly 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.080
 I hope you have fun with the others 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.720
 videos that I did not enjoy 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.930
 so filthy here 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.930
 and well later
