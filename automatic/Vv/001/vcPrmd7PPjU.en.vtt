00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.130 
video I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:16.109> nice<00:00:16.440> camera<00:00:16.890> movement<00:00:17.550> using<00:00:18.140> After

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
a nice camera movement using After

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:28.630 
a nice camera movement using After
Effects<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.340> camera<00:00:20.789> movement<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.510> this

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.790 

it<00:00:29.640> rotates<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:32.189> flows<00:00:33.680> okay<00:00:36.469> yes<00:00:37.469> it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it rotates and it flows okay yes it

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.130 
it rotates and it flows okay yes it
first<00:00:38.129> open<00:00:38.520> After<00:00:38.760> Effects<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.660> example

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
first open After Effects and for example

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.369 
first open After Effects and for example
make<00:00:40.290> some<00:00:40.530> text<00:00:40.860> layers<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.420> I<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.719> 4<00:00:43.020> text

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
make some text layers and I have 4 text

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.440 
make some text layers and I have 4 text
layers<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:46.579> okay<00:00:47.579> let's<00:00:47.610> start<00:00:48.090> make<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
layers here and okay let's start make a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.580 
layers here and okay let's start make a
new<00:00:48.809> layer<00:00:49.789> camera<00:00:51.379> ok

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
new layer camera ok

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.430 
new layer camera ok
and<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.219> will<00:00:53.370> make<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> new<00:00:54.059> null<00:00:54.480> object<00:00:57.440> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and I will make a new null object and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.760 
and I will make a new null object and
pair<00:00:59.309> internal<00:00:59.940> add<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.750> camera<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> null

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
pair internal add the camera to the null

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.920 
pair internal add the camera to the null
object<00:01:01.800> only<00:01:02.460> take<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> pick<00:01:03.149> whip<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.629> bring

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
object only take the pick whip and bring

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.399 
object only take the pick whip and bring
it<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> null<00:01:04.769> object<00:01:05.299> ok<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.840> now<00:01:07.350> we

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it up to the null object ok and now we

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.770 
it up to the null object ok and now we
want<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.799> make<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> 3d<00:01:08.549> layer<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.210> no<00:01:09.360> object

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
want to make it a 3d layer to no object

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.609 
want to make it a 3d layer to no object
and<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.890> when<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.850> moved<00:01:12.619> no

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and you can see it when we moved no

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.800 
and you can see it when we moved no
object<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> camera<00:01:14.549> moves<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> text

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
object the camera moves not the text

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
object the camera moves not the text
layers<00:01:16.020> moves<00:01:16.409> only<00:01:17.570> look<00:01:18.570> at<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.860> camera<00:01:20.159> ok

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
layers moves only look at the camera ok

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.370 
layers moves only look at the camera ok
and<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:22.340> bring<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.700> no<00:01:24.450> object<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.110> nice

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and now bring the no object to a nice

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.789 
and now bring the no object to a nice
position<00:01:26.040> where<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.119> any<00:01:27.799> text

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
position where you can see any text

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.560 
position where you can see any text
layer<00:01:29.360> yes

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
layer yes

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
some second for words and make another

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.690 
some second for words and make another
position

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.800 

yes<00:01:59.390> okay<00:01:59.860> now<00:02:00.860> we<00:02:00.920> got<00:02:01.250> this<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:01.790> when<00:02:02.570> we

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.790 
orientation here click on the stopwatch
after<00:02:25.550> orientation<00:02:25.900> go<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> few<00:02:27.350> seconds

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
after orientation go a few seconds

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:37.150 
after orientation go a few seconds
forward<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.810> rotate<00:02:29.810> on<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.709> X<00:02:31.400> X<00:02:34.510> good<00:02:36.160> now

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
forward and rotate on the X X good now

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.320 
forward and rotate on the X X good now
when<00:02:37.400> we<00:02:37.549> take<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.819> look

and now we are here and we want to go to

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.590 
and now we are here and we want to go to
this<00:02:52.280> text<00:02:52.910> layer<00:02:53.209> here<00:02:53.900> after<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> effect

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
this text layer here after the effect

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.830 
this text layer here after the effect
this<00:02:56.600> layer<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.940> ok<00:03:00.640> we<00:03:01.640> go<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.850> few<00:03:02.060> seconds

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.959 
frames go a few seconds forward and now
we<00:03:27.859> have<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.519> search<00:03:28.850> for<00:03:29.209> the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:33.969 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:46.250 

what<00:03:38.049> here<00:03:39.049> it<00:03:39.230> is

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:59.630 

and<00:03:46.709> now<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.120> orientation

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.470

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.059 

so<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.590> we<00:04:04.770> got<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:06.540> now<00:04:07.470> let's<00:04:07.770> take<00:04:08.040> a

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
so that we got this and now let's take a

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:20.000 
so that we got this and now let's take a
look

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.560

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.920 

it<00:04:26.140> rotates<00:04:26.710> here<00:04:27.040> again<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.370> got<00:04:30.550> this

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
it rotates here again and you got this

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.420 
it rotates here again and you got this
and<00:04:31.930> now<00:04:32.680> we<00:04:32.740> want<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.310> go<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:34.380> layout

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
and now we want to go to the layout

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.170
