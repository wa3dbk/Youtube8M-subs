00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.780
 hello today our review will be 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.969
 is devoted to an important component in 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.299
 mountain bike namely depreciation 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.509
 view 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:21.400
 we do not work with advertisers and firms 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.400
 we do test purchase 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.920
 let's see what the industry is preparing for us 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.530
 requirement for modern velcom grow 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.360
 After all, grow and your 3 now everyone teaches the bar 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.520
 backs crumbs of the century body practically with 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.350
 first years we ride and therefore fork 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.690
 must be either 20 millimeters by you 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.430
 either under 15 the crown should be 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.140
 aluminum pants any fire either 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.879
 Aluminum desirable to have 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.879
 aluminum headquarters because it does not bend 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.440
 with frontal in the mountains and ideally have 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.110
 aluminum legs because they also 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.030
 minutes in brief about those on racks which 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.940
 you get when you buy glasses 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.339
 with me just this key chain key chain this 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.110
 increasing the pressure on the spring it can 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.229
 be mechanical or air like 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.840
 mordor 2 building this is a rebound slurp 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.760
 this is the speed with which the plug 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.790
 returns to its original position after 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.650
 squeeze this is the basic setting at all 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.549
 normal forks feat without rebound 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.620
 meaningless third option you 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.659
 get it compression compression it 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.320
 increase fork stiffness depending 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.270
 off load 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.159
 that is, until the middle of the fork stroke she 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.020
 remains soft and after all are one 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.909
 it becomes sharply tough so you don't 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.850
 traded them it's time to circle all 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.670
 the difference between warsaw sol p and duals and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.860
 the principle of operation is the same there and 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.930
 positive and negative cameras positive 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.420
 cameras marked compression negative for 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.829
 rebound but in solo or you pump up the hatch 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.270
 through one nipple and pressure 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.969
 automatically distributed 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.979
 duals or you can optional 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.829
 pump like years without having done work 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.200
 the blizzard is very exclusive and so the first 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.630
 fork it will suntour duro hold 20 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.520
 millimeters she weighs 2 kilograms 700 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.439
 gram has twenty millimeter guest 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.420
 counter and oil rebound 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.160
 very good candidate for those who 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.740
 have a little day 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.760
 the next version of suntour duro fr 20 is 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.140
 more expensive option 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.300
 thirty five millimeter 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.670
 aluminum legs to the rear has 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.130
 preload adjustment ie drive 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.870
 and the oil rebound move I have enough 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.820
 tall but she is served with gonna 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.820
 Naturally 20 millimeters and axis 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.780
 I warn you when you are driving 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.510
 lengths of rest in real blizzards with great 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.270
 leg diameter and wait fine work 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.960
 you are mistaken their bounce will be something water 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.390
 tire filled repeat do not get carried away 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.910
 driving for profitable free native white 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.200
 the next category is able to summer 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.210
 skirts from famous brands 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.920
 to buy a school breakfast is no longer 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.020
 enough have to type mom what are you 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.240
 signed up for the 7th and the month to wet 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.130
 towel and slate handle bars first 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.890
 the plug that we take from will be rap 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.440
 shock sorter 302 perhaps the most popular 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.560
 now she has two known diseases 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.060
 the first is bending the legs 2 then not the stock 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.310
 talking stock rock shox more or less 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.620
 We can handle it so that the legs do not bend the link 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.410
 You need to drive Wilkie there are only two 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.200
 settings this is a sea bounce and 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.550
 key chain drive on the stand and for a couple to 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.590
 it is necessary to increase it to unscrew the top 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.010
 cover and not a fad plastic aleppo 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.680
 her 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.260
 the next who have shock absorber 318 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.120
 it is also called different versions 32 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.220
 only the presence of compression well 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.590
 naturally increased price goes further 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.090
 mars a4 jumper two bowlers has a mass 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.060
 as far as air swap 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.209
 it is 100 grams heavier than 318 argyle and 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.489
 closes this category cheese piece fork 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.020
 has a compress here locking oil 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.400
 rebound 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.420
 mechanical pilot 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.700
 the next category is really 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.740
 road starts it if the taste itself here 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.230
 experts this plug has air 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.650
 oil compression springs attentive 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.230
 rebound 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.020
 aluminum legs and 20 millimeters fall off 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.320
 yuko weighs 20 50 following villas cutter 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.840
 shock sardar 409 and 318 it is different 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.730
 the presence of the air spring cartridge is very 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.550
 safe and easy to set up love 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.010
 hard from 202 300 lit by rockstar 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.450
 Guyver network look the same 2200 has 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.430
 aluminum legs that are no longer 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.470
 bend on air day tour in it 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.650
 much easier than 409 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.080
 Lyubka weighs 2 3 next hand to fool 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.550
 for a jumper one she has a high price 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:33.190
 weight 2 250 rebound and air compression 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.840
 preload modern racing forks 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.250
 very reliable and for example what are you 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.920
 buy rock shox by cause 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.380
 millimeters with a stroke of 140 you can safely 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.960
 dogwood used to chase sheet depart 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.720
 Well, a couple of words about your favorite farsan 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.340
 uniquely forks with 131 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.280
 she has the lowest weight possible 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.040
 number of settings and high strength 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.900
 Of course the body is the price and here 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.460
 Profile for 6 faxes can not say 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.860
 no good slots 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.050
 6 very quickly breaks it breaks 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.750
 inside the gut can't stand work in 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.410
 the amount on in fox mode has become absolutely 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.630
 unsuitable 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.070
 very quickly fails and now 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.040
 for those who watched this video to the end 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.180
 the most important fork of our time of hands 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.420
 shock sector words 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.490
 It has 20 mm spine vozdushki 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.280
 spring compression rebound 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.680
 whether it is very durable buy and boldly 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.840
 rounded up and wonder if you are resting there 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.210
 linear legs in your forks nothing 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.430
 terrible if there were uneven sharp 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.110
 edges that stick out scrape them off 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.780
 neatly so that they don't scratch 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.830
 gland check the tightening of the axles before 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.120
 every ride and 1 year change plugs 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.120
 prophylactic purposes so as not to dolman
