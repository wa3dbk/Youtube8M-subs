00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.319
 how to configure the anchor in the network 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.809
 the network anchor is an option of 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.370
 samsung galaxy s3 phone and a lot 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.259
 Android operating system with which 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.540
 We can share the internet with another 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.300
 device either another laptop another 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 mobile phone this way you do what 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.779
 that is called the term in English the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.180
 which phone is used with a 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.039
 gateway or it is configured as if it were a 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.590
 modem or a computer network 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.000
 wireless for other devices its 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.340
 configuration is very important 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.640
 it is basically assigning a name of 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.950
 network and a password and that's that simple 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.579
 we enter by a mind here by 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.370
 configuration as to configuration more 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.120
 configurations enter the zone 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.660
 laptop and network anchor basically what 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.670
 what you do is activate it here while 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.150
 activated simply what we do is 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.700
 and enter here 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.760
 here will give us the options of 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.520
 configuration at this moment tells me 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.160
 that there are no connected devices 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.380
 says how I am like how is my 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.180
 current configuration ie this network 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.670
 will be found by the name that I have 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.250
 given here that is what is the android and 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.640
 which people will be able to access this 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.400
 Internet connection or this mode by 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.390
 say it so enjoyer that I created 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.390
 entering that password 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.400
 these these configuration data 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.200
 commenting that here in configure and 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.980
 here we choose the name we want 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.710
 have a network 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.610
 it's as simple as we choose the option of 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.890
 psk felled security is that we 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.420
 allows you to set a password or if 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.430
 we want we can use an open 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.830
 but an open one is not convenient anymore 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.230
 that anyone could connect 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.420
 and use your internet cell phone 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.240
 ending your data plan then 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.150
 it stays here in the deputy can be 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.810
 that the safest we give you a 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.910
 password and we give you save like this is 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.360
 simple one is configured being already 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.370
 configured and good already set 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.350
 and allow other devices to 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.150
 connect in this case I do not have 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.750
 devices connected to this phone 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.640
 and only then activated the wifi of the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.790
 laptop computer that I have 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.790
 in front 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.480
 then fernando to connect to 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.020
 let them see that where they say there is no 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.020
 devices will immediately appear the 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.110
 option 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.490
 let's go here try 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.660
 a collection 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.800
 we could connect 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.970
 basically immediately I've already 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.400
 connected a device to a 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.800
 connected device I came out here a 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.330
 notification that again tells me a 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.790
 connected device press to 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.310
 configure immediately I can enter 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.250
 here again and here tells me the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.890
 device that you connected you want a 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.200
 hewlett packard 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.239
 he tells me his mac and his ip address 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.730
 and effectively I'm already well navigating 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.540
 through the telephone so simple 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.940
 we can configure the portable area or a 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.440
 anchor or the terry in our phones 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.519
 galaxy is tense 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.519
