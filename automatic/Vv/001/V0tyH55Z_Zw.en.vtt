proof<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.860> measurement<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.340> alcohol<00:00:11.759> by

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
proof is a measurement of alcohol by

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.390 
proof is a measurement of alcohol by
volume<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.450> America<00:00:13.049> it's<00:00:13.259> generally<00:00:14.040> double

volume in America it's generally double

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.980 
volume in America it's generally double
the<00:00:14.820> proof<00:00:15.059> has<00:00:15.210> doubled<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.540> alcohol<00:00:15.839> by

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
the proof has doubled the alcohol by

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.529 
the proof has doubled the alcohol by

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539

that's<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.489> standard

that's your standard

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.959 
that's your standard
yeah<00:01:00.510> that's<00:01:00.690> your<00:01:00.780> vodka<00:01:00.989> proof

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
yeah that's your vodka proof

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.310 
yeah that's your vodka proof
straightforward<00:01:02.969> easy<00:01:03.480> drinking<00:01:03.809> but

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
straightforward easy drinking but

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.690 
straightforward easy drinking but
there's<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.500> more<00:01:04.619> interesting<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
there's a more interesting you know I

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.760 
there's a more interesting you know I
mean<00:01:05.850> why<00:01:06.090> more<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.320> why<00:01:07.439> stop<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
mean why more is more so why stop it
