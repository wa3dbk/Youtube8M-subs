00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
can see that it's damaged falls off

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.789 
can see that it's damaged falls off
pretty<00:01:53.759> heavily<00:01:54.090> making<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.259> three<00:01:55.500> shot<00:01:55.740> at

pretty heavily making it a three shot at
extreme<00:01:56.310> ranges<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.810> also

not too drastic the velocity is a little

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.960 
not too drastic the velocity is a little
bit<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.629> differ

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
bit of a differ

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.880 
bit of a differ
but<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.660> two<00:02:13.840> major<00:02:14.170> things<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.650> need<00:02:14.800> to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
but the two major things you need to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.140 
but the two major things you need to
take<00:02:15.040> into<00:02:15.220> consideration<00:02:15.850> when<00:02:15.940> dealing

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
take into consideration when dealing

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.820 
take into consideration when dealing
with<00:02:16.270> bolt<00:02:16.510> actions<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.960> two<00:02:17.080> most<00:02:17.290> important

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
with bolt actions the two most important

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.230 
with bolt actions the two most important
parts<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.220> understand<00:02:18.640> about<00:02:18.850> these<00:02:19.000> guns

parts to understand about these guns

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.760 
parts to understand about these guns
which<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.480> didn't<00:02:19.690> even<00:02:19.840> show<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.350> that<00:02:20.500> chart

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.430 
which I didn't even show on that chart
right<00:02:20.920> there<00:02:21.190> are<00:02:21.720> how<00:02:22.720> well<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.080> holds<00:02:23.200> to

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
right there are how well it holds to

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.830 
right there are how well it holds to
damage<00:02:23.800> over<00:02:24.100> distance<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.730> how<00:02:25.090> well<00:02:25.600> you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
damage over distance and how well you

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.110 
damage over distance and how well you
can<00:02:25.990> manage<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.590> bullet<00:02:26.890> drop<00:02:27.070> for<00:02:27.700> example

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
can manage the bullet drop for example

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.810 
can manage the bullet drop for example
the<00:02:28.180> F<00:02:28.270> yjs<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> srr<00:02:29.290> 61<00:02:29.740> have<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> six<00:02:30.340> bullet

drop the lowest in the game making it

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.730 
drop the lowest in the game making it

not recoil excuse me bullet drop than
those<00:02:45.610> other<00:02:45.820> two<00:02:46.150> in<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.420> category<00:02:46.900> that's<00:02:47.110> a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
those other two in the category that's a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.160 
those other two in the category that's a
big<00:02:47.800> difference<00:02:48.310> especially<00:02:48.820> over<00:02:49.540> range<00:02:49.840> and

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
big difference especially over range and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.250 
big difference especially over range and
it<00:02:50.560> does<00:02:50.800> also<00:02:51.070> tack<00:02:51.700> up<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.209> slower<00:02:52.750> bit<00:02:53.140> of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
it does also tack up to a slower bit of

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.380 
it does also tack up to a slower bit of
a<00:02:53.320> bullet<00:02:53.800> velocity<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:54.940> got<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.240> take

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
a bullet velocity so you got to take

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.090 
a bullet velocity so you got to take
those<00:02:55.540> things<00:02:55.750> into<00:02:55.900> consideration<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.860> gun

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
those things into consideration this gun

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.740 
those things into consideration this gun
is<00:02:57.130> not<00:02:57.550> bad<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.820> close<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.120> medium-range

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
is not bad it close to medium-range

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.150 
is not bad it close to medium-range
anything<00:02:59.200> past<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.620> even<00:02:59.950> though<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
anything past that even though the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.460 
anything past that even though the
damage<00:03:00.459> holds<00:03:00.700> on<00:03:00.850> pretty<00:03:01.060> decently<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:02.080> gets

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
damage holds on pretty decently it gets

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.750 
damage holds on pretty decently it gets
a<00:03:02.530> little<00:03:02.680> crazy<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.160> other<00:03:03.340> thing<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.640> take

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
a little crazy the other thing to take

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.880 
a little crazy the other thing to take
into<00:03:03.820> consideration<00:03:04.600> is<00:03:04.720> guns<00:03:05.260> like<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.560> SR

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
into consideration is guns like the SR

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.040 
into consideration is guns like the SR
61<00:03:06.430> definitely<00:03:06.940> hold<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.330> damage<00:03:07.720> over

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
61 definitely hold on to damage over

a bad one a lot of it's going to come

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.780 
a bad one a lot of it's going to come
down<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.380> preference<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:14.980> how<00:04:15.340> things<00:04:15.580> work

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790

my favorite in the game is they apply

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.420 
my favorite in the game is they apply
jeaious<00:04:17.440> a<00:04:17.560> lot<00:04:17.709> of<00:04:17.769> people<00:04:17.890> don't<00:04:18.100> like<00:04:18.160> it

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
jeaious a lot of people don't like it

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.699 
jeaious a lot of people don't like it

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
so hopefully you've taken some of this

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.519 
so hopefully you've taken some of this
into<00:04:41.819> consideration<00:04:41.969> hopefully<00:04:42.960> you<00:04:43.050> learn

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:43.529 
into consideration hopefully you learn

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.529 
into consideration hopefully you learn
to<00:04:43.710> maybe<00:04:44.039> try<00:04:44.430> other<00:04:44.669> weapons<00:04:45.090> if<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.300> find

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
to maybe try other weapons if you find

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.029 
to maybe try other weapons if you find
that<00:04:45.689> this<00:04:45.779> one<00:04:45.990> works<00:04:46.199> for<00:04:46.409> you<00:04:46.469> go<00:04:46.680> with<00:04:46.889> it

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
that this one works for you go with it

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.519 
that this one works for you go with it
but<00:04:47.759> again<00:04:48.110> statistically<00:04:49.110> it's<00:04:49.259> not<00:04:49.409> going

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:49.529 
but again statistically it's not going

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:50.629 
but again statistically it's not going
to<00:04:49.620> hold<00:04:49.680> up<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.889> a<00:04:50.009> some<00:04:50.219> of<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.400> others

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
to hold up to a some of the others

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.249 
to hold up to a some of the others
because<00:04:50.939> the<00:04:51.029> damage<00:04:51.240> drop<00:04:51.569> off<00:04:51.779> is<00:04:51.990> pretty

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
because the damage drop off is pretty

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.920 
because the damage drop off is pretty
significant<00:04:52.740> with<00:04:52.860> only<00:04:52.979> 100<00:04:53.340> meters<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:53.930> the

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
significant with only 100 meters and the

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.950 
significant with only 100 meters and the
velocity<00:04:55.409> is<00:04:55.439> not<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.800> best<00:04:55.919> in<00:04:56.129> the<00:04:56.219> world<00:04:56.340> so

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
velocity is not the best in the world so

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.240 
velocity is not the best in the world so
