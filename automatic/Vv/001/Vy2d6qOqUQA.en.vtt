00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.110
 good to all I'll show you how 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.500
 install on your samsung galaxy ice 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:12.730
 in versions s 58 30 stripped without 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.090
 no number or letter or s 58 30 l in 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.609
 a roman cornada cooked with jelly bean 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.560
 what is Android 4.2 for what 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.960
 we will need to have the club work mods 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.609
 installed on our device if not 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.789
 you have it I have a video of how 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.760
 install the club work mod in s 58 30 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.739
 and in the ly we will start lighting 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.140
 the phone in recovery mode we tighten 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.140
 the home button and the power button 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.330
 as you see with the green triangle of 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.330
 center the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.960
 the white let's wave datafactory reset 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.680
 and we give the home as we see with the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.680
 volume weightlifters 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.050
 and so we leave it as if it were all without 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.480
 no data from the old version of the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.330
 rom that I had before we're going to erase 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.230
 also the web pax and partition we are going 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.230
 again yes 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.710
 and I like to go in advanced 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.000
 give the wave david h 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.250
 we give him 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.720
 this last time is that they do not say it 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.210
 to do but well I like it more does not cost 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.120
 nothing we are going back and now we are going to 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.490
 say install chrome sd card 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.600
 well before doing this you have to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.240
 take the file that you put in the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.520
 description and put it at the root of the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.190
 micro sd card that is the file 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.490
 what are we going to install now 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.990
 we give this guide choose jif promise 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.930
 that the card file 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:56.980
 memory we give you and the file is called 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:00.170
 jb 4.2 and at four points under s 58 30 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.660
 we exist in fact 30 l is only valid for 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.360
 these two models if you have a and a m a 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.190
 other do not do it because you can 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.220
 you are left with a useless phone 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.020
 maybe that being and that and cost you 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.580
 much to see to have it functional or 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.400
 directly you will have it as if it were 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.879
 a toy 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.360
 we give home and confirm again 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:25.739
 with the volume we give it and it's already in 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.739
 it installing 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.890
 It does not take long from the day with many 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.710
 three or four minutes I can not say 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.760
 Exactly the time tested will pass until the 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.830
 when it is installed for 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.380
 cut the video and as soon as 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.960
 installed by good 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:46.030
 We will continue to see the new version of 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.880
 living that is a kitchen based on 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.220
 woman so if you do not know what they are 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.920
 the functions are a rom that makes the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.920
 let's say people do not do the companies and 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.840
 catching breaks other andy phones 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.750
 the android 2 you take the improvements of 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.970
 they each make a medley and take out a 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.380
 functional rom to some extent in the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.480
 device x let's say when the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.520
 companies no longer support or take out 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.720
 new versions because there are people who 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.940
 pulling chunks of a version of one or 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.830
 Applications modules or widgets is done 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.960
 in a kind of personalized rom to his 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.660
 taste and this is what we're going to be 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.110
 now that it takes as an Android 4.2 base and 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.020
 almost always eliminates cooked rom 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.450
 many have as they are not functional and 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.700
 you will be 100% many after they have 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.940
 fail some kind of error and good has 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.980
 installed so it fails you the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.720
 camera uses a prema normally 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.540
 these versions can be to test 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.670
 for 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.890
 some can be used normally but 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.989
 there are others that give some problems 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.769
 this one could not see exactly what 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.829
 inconveniences have if they have any 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.230
 failure already series but we give to 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.730
 reboot to restart and we 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.580
 start 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.860
 load us already in the new version with 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.140
 yelling as you will see now it will take a 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.400
 little because he has to do again 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.080
 all the system files because 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.700
 we have done the uruguay has to 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.530
 configure everything and it is normal that the 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.190
 first start took a bit in 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.540
 start so we 'll move on to the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.110
 moment at which start and well then 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:28.069
 we will continue as you see 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.509
 and it's already just started and as 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.689
 you see here we have the Spanish language of 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.689
 Spain 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.340
 in Spain we must start 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.120
 without being treated and how they have inserted 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.620
 last one next you would have good 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.870
 card 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.130
 activating uci we say jump good the 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.139
 wake configuration as we celebrate of 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.139
 buy the phone anyway 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.840
 following 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.699
 and well basically this is already the 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.400
 installation I'm going to put my name but 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.860
