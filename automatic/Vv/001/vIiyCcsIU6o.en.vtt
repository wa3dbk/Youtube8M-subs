00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.280
 In my last video I have mine 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.980
 rebuilt raspberry pi presented 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.750
 one day later today after reading 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.820
 so country the same day I told you so 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.230
 uploaded last night this morning 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.880
 the monitor has arrived 3 5 inches and 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.340
 I have since actually an utterance 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.510
 housing that's why I took out 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.780
 because so much smaller 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:39.079
 So what I've done is the bip 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.000
 this mini computer is the thing 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.239
 I just have that a bit 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.829
 remodeled power supply directly soldered to it 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.829
 normally is built over usb 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:58.649
 This mini monitor is for one 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.770
 fallback camera actually 20 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.170
 cost euro 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.799
 which is built must be built with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.180
 12 volts 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:16.229
 I have two 7 volt batteries in here 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.759
 row and thus I come to 14 wanted 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.409
 I then run the screen well 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.090
 can 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.920
 this little device here is for 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.770
 car, the parts are actually too 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.409
 they are put in the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:38.060
 cigarette lighter around a usb socket 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:40.020
 then so 12 volts to 35 4 usb adapter 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.759
 it is also due to the batteries 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.439
 connected to the page here 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.890
 another small meter soon which tells me 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.369
 also have as much stress here yet 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.320
 yes on the left there is usb and 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.040
 lan box the raspberry pi 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.399
 usually have rv books and 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.080
 audio I have now not used 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.870
 soon, too 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.790
 on top there is at the bottom 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.080
 hdmi where i also here one 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.530
 screen external screen 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.300
 then I can put it 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.300
 to one side 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.440
 tension falls because the batteries are almost empty 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.060
 are 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.640
 it takes a while to get it right 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.730
 calculate 7 volts of 14 that is one 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:42.190
 little bit and there it starts 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:44.280
 raspberry pi synonymous already the camera 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.510
 you do not recognize it so well now 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.050
 I have to say it's hard to 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.570
 read 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.790
 some things but if you for example 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.420
 to type in what you type or program 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.370
 I'll take care then if you know what you are 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.500
 enters and if you know what comes out 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.860
 should then i can get almost 100 percent 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.780
 always say what is there so in the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.740
 set if there with a board and a 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.720
 letter is missing 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.510
 I know what's there 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.910
 which letter should be so now 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.320
 I deposits me at the things 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:24.319
 password raspberry that is still 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:27.879
 standard mistyped me 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.879
 I do not think so 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:43.890
 but already settled one notices here 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.580
 make internet also has two lan 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.410
 affiliated 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:54.410
 I can make that google 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.410
 Point 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.670
 under 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.850
 Yes 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.850
 run the ping 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:16.120
 that's enough after all and yes this 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.250
 I can do it now 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.440
 take it with you and use it on the way 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:26.139
 it does not really need any connections 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.870
 I can do it completely without usb 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.250
 and wi-fi 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.970
 yes and then it is a working one 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.620
 pc I also have a mini somewhere 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.590
 bluetooth keyboard lying around 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.830
 how will I connect with it? 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:46.660
 It is relatively heavy but it looks good 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.400
 a kind if you can, but I can 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.870
 but also an external screen 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.530
 Connect I will sometimes joined 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.150
 demonstrate 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.410
 I have to go out because of that 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.870
 screen driver to otherwise 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:02.100
 recognizes here I have such a nice 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:06.490
 adapter bought 5 euros on ebay hdmi vga 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:11.560
 the focus would work on it 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.470
 from the camera and I can get up 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.750
 infect the back 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:27.430
 there I still melted that 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:29.410
 switch on connected case starts 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.680
 and the screen is about to start now 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:36.030
 so no problem he seemed to want 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.320
 hdmi output not use 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.789
 then I have a bit of a mistake 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.090
 searched for the error also found 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.729
 it was because you saw her 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.620
 that the voltage was very low 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:50.229
 that was not enough for the hdmi adapter 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.360
 to take the hand sucked too 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.760
 a lot of electricity 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.460
 Now I have the batteries charged 15 volts 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.990
 that's almost full 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.990
 and there the screen jumps on 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:12.230
 have you were also small at first and 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.470
 you have questions write in the 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.470
 Comments 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.760
 See you
