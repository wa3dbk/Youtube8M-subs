the hinges I bought I bought eight of

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.680 
the hinges I bought I bought eight of
them<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:04.070> was<00:03:04.190> 299<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.910> hair<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.360> bought<00:03:05.570> them

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
them it was 299 and hair I bought them

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.840 
them it was 299 and hair I bought them
online<00:03:05.870> because<00:03:06.830> I<00:03:06.890> could<00:03:07.070> not<00:03:07.190> find<00:03:07.250> them<00:03:07.610> in

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
online because I could not find them in

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.810 
online because I could not find them in
any<00:03:08.240> local<00:03:08.870> store<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:10.070> i'll<00:03:10.190> post<00:03:10.490> them<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:10.760> the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
any local store so i'll post them in the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.450 
any local store so i'll post them in the
link<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.040> description<00:03:14.710> why<00:03:15.710> do<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.010> think

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
link in the description why do you think

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.400 
link in the description why do you think
you<00:03:17.000> could<00:03:17.120> find<00:03:17.300> them<00:03:17.480> anywhere<00:03:17.660> near<00:03:18.200> you

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
you could find them anywhere near you

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.020 
you could find them anywhere near you
that's<00:03:18.620> probably<00:03:19.040> better<00:03:19.340> because<00:03:19.460> actually

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
that's probably better because actually

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.550 
that's probably better because actually
like<00:03:20.270> three<00:03:20.480> days<00:03:20.630> release<00:03:20.990> which<00:03:21.320> slowed

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
like three days release which slowed

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.080 
like three days release which slowed
down<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:22.090> book<00:03:23.090> process<00:03:24.040> but<00:03:25.040> um<00:03:25.280> hey<00:03:25.940> there

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
down the book process but um hey there

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.060 
down the book process but um hey there
are<00:03:26.830> whoops<00:03:28.120> there<00:03:29.120> are<00:03:29.320> they're<00:03:30.320> very<00:03:30.560> tiny

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
are whoops there are they're very tiny

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.470 
are whoops there are they're very tiny
less<00:03:31.550> than<00:03:31.730> two<00:03:31.910> inches<00:03:32.060> tall<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.970> they're

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
less than two inches tall and they're

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.370 
less than two inches tall and they're
called<00:03:36.110> though<00:03:36.910> lift<00:03:37.910> off<00:03:38.060> hinges<00:03:38.390> or<00:03:38.870> take

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
called though lift off hinges or take

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.370 
called though lift off hinges or take
apart<00:03:39.680> hinges<00:03:40.840> because<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.080> good<00:03:42.230> thing

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
apart hinges because the good thing

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.650 
apart hinges because the good thing
about<00:03:42.410> these<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:43.000> they<00:03:44.000> come<00:03:44.270> part<00:03:45.550> so<00:03:46.660> each

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
about these is they come part so each

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.540 
about these is they come part so each
panel<00:03:48.020> it<00:03:48.080> could<00:03:48.290> be<00:03:48.470> separated<00:03:49.250> from<00:03:49.370> each

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
panel it could be separated from each

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.120 
panel it could be separated from each
other<00:03:49.730> when<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.300> put<00:03:50.480> them<00:03:50.600> away<00:03:50.920> which<00:03:51.920> i<00:03:52.070> think

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
other when I put them away which i think

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.900 
other when I put them away which i think
is<00:03:52.310> going<00:03:52.459> to<00:03:52.550> be<00:03:52.640> really<00:03:52.910> good

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
is going to be really good

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.090 
is going to be really good
um<00:03:55.190> I'm<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.520> believe<00:03:56.970> dragon<00:03:57.510> boards<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.770> the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
um I'm I believe dragon boards is the

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.720 
um I'm I believe dragon boards is the
same<00:03:59.310> type<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.000> hinges<00:04:00.800> so<00:04:01.800> on<00:04:02.070> I've<00:04:02.520> actually

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
same type of hinges so on I've actually

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.150 
same type of hinges so on I've actually
never<00:04:03.030> seen<00:04:03.210> them<00:04:03.510> in<00:04:03.570> person<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.920> I'm<00:04:04.950> not

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
never seen them in person so I'm not

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.680 
never seen them in person so I'm not
sure<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.430> that's<00:04:05.580> what<00:04:05.730> they<00:04:05.880> used<00:04:06.090> by<00:04:06.300> assume

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
sure if that's what they used by assume

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.210 
sure if that's what they used by assume
so<00:04:06.900> because<00:04:07.140> we<00:04:07.170> could<00:04:07.380> take<00:04:07.560> apart<00:04:07.890> the

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
so because we could take apart the

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.100 
so because we could take apart the
panels

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.970 

so<00:04:12.650> once<00:04:12.890> again<00:04:13.040> it's<00:04:13.190> on<00:04:13.310> b2<00:04:13.640> per<00:04:13.940> panel<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.890> I

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
so once again it's on b2 per panel and I

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.090 
so once again it's on b2 per panel and I
think<00:04:16.220> they<00:04:16.310> should<00:04:16.489> be<00:04:16.609> fine<00:04:17.380> i'll<00:04:18.380> post<00:04:18.739> i'll

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
think they should be fine i'll post i'll

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.450 
think they should be fine i'll post i'll
post<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:20.060> video<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.510> moonstone<00:04:20.900> because<00:04:21.460> we're

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
post a video and moonstone because we're

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.920

a hot spot on the facade because it's

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.189 
a hot spot on the facade because it's
just<00:06:27.080> you<00:06:27.590> know<00:06:27.620> it's<00:06:27.860> as<00:06:28.310> big<00:06:28.699> of<00:06:28.759> all<00:06:29.199> sounds

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:30.199 
just you know it's as big of all sounds

beam<00:06:33.169> so<00:06:33.500> that<00:06:33.669> leaves<00:06:34.669> a<00:06:34.789> hot<00:06:34.970> spot<00:06:35.240> and

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
beam so that leaves a hot spot and

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.540 
beam so that leaves a hot spot and
doesn't<00:06:36.080> cover<00:06:36.289> the<00:06:36.409> whole<00:06:36.800> facade<00:06:37.190> is<00:06:37.370> easy

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
doesn't cover the whole facade is easy

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.480 
doesn't cover the whole facade is easy
and<00:06:38.740> there<00:06:39.740> will<00:06:39.919> actually<00:06:40.009> be<00:06:40.220> more

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
and there will actually be more

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.959 
and there will actually be more
expensive<00:06:40.789> than<00:06:41.169> these<00:06:42.169> three<00:06:42.740> strips<00:06:43.129> there

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:43.969 
expensive than these three strips there

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:46.390 
expensive than these three strips there

them from IDG now refurbished for like
sixty<00:06:49.129> seven<00:06:49.610> dollars<00:06:50.180> i<00:06:50.990> think<00:06:51.729> which<00:06:52.729> is

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
sixty seven dollars i think which is

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.070 
sixty seven dollars i think which is
still<00:06:53.090> I<00:06:53.150> picked<00:06:53.449> them<00:06:53.569> off<00:06:53.719> for<00:06:53.870> the<00:06:53.930> next

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
still I picked them off for the next

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.360 
still I picked them off for the next
project<00:06:54.319> on<00:06:54.770> building<00:06:55.159> and<00:06:56.590> in<00:06:57.590> for<00:06:57.830> a<00:06:57.860> place<00:06:58.099> I

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
project on building and in for a place I

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.010 
project on building and in for a place I
think<00:06:58.639> they're<00:06:58.789> for<00:06:59.150> the<00:06:59.240> price<00:06:59.419> that<00:06:59.449> can<00:06:59.870> be

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
think they're for the price that can be

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.890 
think they're for the price that can be
can<00:07:01.009> be<00:07:01.039> beat<00:07:01.370> and<00:07:01.550> their<00:07:02.180> slim<00:07:02.419> part<00:07:02.659> so

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
can be beat and their slim part so

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.649 
can be beat and their slim part so
they're<00:07:03.050> only<00:07:03.169> like<00:07:03.319> three<00:07:03.590> inches<00:07:03.710> thick

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:04.659 
they're only like three inches thick

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:08.320 
they're only like three inches thick
they're<00:07:05.659> not<00:07:05.750> like<00:07:05.810> the<00:07:06.259> blizzard<00:07:07.069> non<00:07:07.370> parks

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
they're not like the blizzard non parks

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.370 
they're not like the blizzard non parks
but<00:07:08.690> they're<00:07:09.590> close<00:07:09.800> to<00:07:10.009> it

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
but they're close to it

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.990 
but they're close to it
so<00:07:12.300> once<00:07:13.300> I<00:07:13.450> get<00:07:13.660> the<00:07:13.810> facade<00:07:13.990> ready<00:07:14.610> I'll<00:07:15.610> do<00:07:15.970> a

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
so once I get the facade ready I'll do a

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.630 
so once I get the facade ready I'll do a
full<00:07:16.390> video<00:07:16.780> with<00:07:17.260> these<00:07:17.380> lights<00:07:17.650> and<00:07:18.070> see<00:07:18.520> how

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.640 
full video with these lights and see how

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.690 
full video with these lights and see how
they<00:07:18.820> work<00:07:19.030> right<00:07:19.690> now<00:07:19.720> they're<00:07:20.050> running<00:07:20.380> on

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
they work right now they're running on

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.580 
they work right now they're running on
just<00:07:21.700> one<00:07:21.910> of<00:07:22.000> the<00:07:22.090> modes<00:07:22.270> not<00:07:23.230> sound

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590 
just one of the modes not sound

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.250 
just one of the modes not sound
activated<00:07:23.800> or<00:07:24.790> not<00:07:24.970> length<00:07:25.450> together<00:07:25.990> right

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:26.260 
activated or not length together right

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.860 
activated or not length together right
now<00:07:26.290> but<00:07:27.190> what<00:07:27.340> I<00:07:27.370> did<00:07:27.670> with<00:07:28.270> DMX<00:07:28.720> they're

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870 
now but what I did with DMX they're

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.900 
now but what I did with DMX they're
linked<00:07:29.170> with<00:07:29.260> power<00:07:29.500> because<00:07:30.430> you<00:07:30.670> know<00:07:30.790> you

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910 
linked with power because you know you

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.090 
linked with power because you know you
could<00:07:31.030> link<00:07:31.210> on<00:07:31.330> the<00:07:31.390> power<00:07:31.630> and<00:07:31.930> I<00:07:32.560> just<00:07:32.800> plug

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.100 
could link on the power and I just plug

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.830 
could link on the power and I just plug
them<00:07:33.220> it<00:07:33.370> at<00:07:33.490> the<00:07:33.610> same<00:07:33.760> time<00:07:34.000> so<00:07:34.690> they're

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 
them it at the same time so they're

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.060 
them it at the same time so they're
actually<00:07:34.930> doing<00:07:35.230> the<00:07:35.380> same<00:07:35.560> exact<00:07:35.830> thing

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
actually doing the same exact thing

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.340 
actually doing the same exact thing
without<00:07:36.310> being<00:07:37.500> DMX<00:07:38.500> which<00:07:39.250> is<00:07:39.340> pretty<00:07:39.520> cool

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:40.350 
without being DMX which is pretty cool

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.350 
without being DMX which is pretty cool
that's<00:07:41.350> one<00:07:41.500> of<00:07:41.560> the<00:07:41.620> tricks<00:07:41.920> I<00:07:42.070> learned

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 
that's one of the tricks I learned

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.280 
that's one of the tricks I learned
without<00:07:43.360> lighting<00:07:44.250> um<00:07:45.870> you<00:07:46.870> guys<00:07:46.960> have<00:07:47.170> any

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.290 
without lighting um you guys have any

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.770 
without lighting um you guys have any
questions<00:07:47.500> let<00:07:48.100> me<00:07:48.160> know<00:07:48.280> I<00:07:48.730> think<00:07:49.540> I<00:07:49.600> went

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:49.780 
questions let me know I think I went

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.810 
questions let me know I think I went
over<00:07:50.020> everything<00:07:50.350> and<00:07:50.740> right<00:07:51.400> now<00:07:51.550> we're

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:51.820 
over everything and right now we're

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.700 
over everything and right now we're
going<00:07:51.940> to<00:07:52.000> go<00:07:52.300> put<00:07:52.450> the<00:07:52.600> hinges<00:07:52.900> on<00:07:53.050> and

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:53.710 
going to go put the hinges on and

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.840 
going to go put the hinges on and
hopefully<00:07:54.700> put<00:07:55.150> the<00:07:55.300> fabric<00:07:55.510> on<00:07:56.130> but<00:07:57.130> if<00:07:57.400> we

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:57.850 
hopefully put the fabric on but if we

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.340 
hopefully put the fabric on but if we
have<00:07:57.970> to<00:07:58.090> paint<00:07:58.300> one<00:07:58.510> more<00:07:58.720> time<00:07:58.930> that<00:07:59.200> one

00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.350 
have to paint one more time that one

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.840 
have to paint one more time that one
won't<00:07:59.530> be<00:07:59.740> able<00:07:59.920> to<00:08:00.130> but<00:08:00.310> hopefully<00:08:00.670> two

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:00.850 
won't be able to but hopefully two

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.390 
won't be able to but hopefully two
coaches<00:08:01.240> enough<00:08:01.800> and<00:08:02.800> we<00:08:03.010> could<00:08:03.160> put<00:08:03.280> the

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 
coaches enough and we could put the

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.990 
coaches enough and we could put the
fabric<00:08:03.580> on<00:08:03.910> and

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 
fabric on and

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.410 
fabric on and
I<00:08:05.090> could<00:08:05.720> shoot<00:08:05.870> a<00:08:05.960> video<00:08:06.140> with<00:08:07.060> the<00:08:08.060> facade

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:08.420 
I could shoot a video with the facade

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.480 
I could shoot a video with the facade
