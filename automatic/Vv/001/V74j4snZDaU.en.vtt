the<00:00:02.399> direct<00:00:02.820> elimination<00:00:03.179> right<00:00:03.689> now<00:00:03.750> as<00:00:04.080> you

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
the direct elimination right now as you

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.900 
the direct elimination right now as you
can<00:00:04.319> see<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:05.160> seat<00:00:05.430> doesn't<00:00:05.670> look<00:00:05.879> very

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
can see the seat doesn't look very

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.509 
can see the seat doesn't look very
natural

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519 
natural

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:10.100 
natural
the<00:00:08.519> shadows<00:00:08.940> are<00:00:09.059> completely<00:00:09.450> black

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
the shadows are completely black

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.890 
the shadows are completely black
you<00:00:10.710> can't<00:00:11.010> really<00:00:11.130> tell<00:00:11.429> where<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> few<00:00:12.690> amps

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
you can't really tell where the few amps

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.240 
you can't really tell where the few amps
here<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.380> whether<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.679> touches<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> floor

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
here and whether it touches the floor

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.140 
here and whether it touches the floor
knots<00:00:15.379> and<00:00:16.379> all<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.710> stuff<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.460> shadow<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
knots and all the stuff in the shadow is

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.630 
knots and all the stuff in the shadow is
completely<00:00:18.750> invisible<00:00:19.220> so<00:00:20.220> there<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.520> no

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
completely invisible so there is no

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.279 
completely invisible so there is no
focus<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.029> course<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.510> we're<00:00:21.750> not<00:00:22.020> taking

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
focus of course is that we're not taking

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.040 
focus of course is that we're not taking
the<00:00:22.710> indirect<00:00:23.189> bounces<00:00:23.670> into<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.000> counter<00:00:24.420> so

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the indirect bounces into the counter so

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.099 
the indirect bounces into the counter so
only<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.590> points<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.070> surface<00:00:26.510> which<00:00:27.510> see

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
only the points of the surface which see

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.470 
only the points of the surface which see
the<00:00:28.289> light<00:00:28.439> directly<00:00:28.910> are<00:00:29.910> getting<00:00:30.210> more<00:00:30.390> than

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the light directly are getting more than

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.920 
the light directly are getting more than
eight<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.859> order<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> confuse<00:00:32.930> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
eight so now in order to confuse the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.700 
eight so now in order to confuse the
indirect<00:00:34.440> illumination<00:00:34.820> as<00:00:35.930> we<00:00:36.930> talked<00:00:37.620> about

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
indirect illumination as we talked about

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.680 
indirect illumination as we talked about
we<00:00:38.129> come<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.489> create<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.030> box<00:00:39.270> light<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
we come to create this box light the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.760 
we come to create this box light the
presentation<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.800> here's<00:00:41.489> how<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.730> looks<00:00:41.910> like

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
presentation so here's how it looks like

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.049 
presentation so here's how it looks like
it's<00:00:43.770> still<00:00:43.980> running<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.280> real<00:00:44.460> time<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.910> can

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it's still running in real time you can

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.190 
it's still running in real time you can
now<00:00:45.180> see<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.719> box<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.610> from<00:00:47.610> being<00:00:47.850> rendered

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
now see this box off from being rendered

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:58.790 
now see this box off from being rendered
life<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:50.520> again<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> coding<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:56.510> over<00:00:57.800> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
life and again the coding here over the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.290 
life and again the coding here over the
pics<00:00:59.180> fractional<00:01:00.260> coverage<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:03.090> amount

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
pics fractional coverage or the amount

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.050 
pics fractional coverage or the amount
of<00:01:03.390> fractional<00:01:03.780> coverage<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.350> works<00:01:05.060> so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
of fractional coverage that works so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090 
of fractional coverage that works so
this<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> positive<00:01:06.659> exultation<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.890> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
this is a positive exultation this is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.890 
this is a positive exultation this is
basically<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.119> amount<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.600> matter

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
basically just the amount of matter

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.219 
basically just the amount of matter
which<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.950> contained<00:01:11.340> within<00:01:11.400> each<00:01:11.909> voxel<00:01:12.229> so

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
which is contained within each voxel so

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.590 
which is contained within each voxel so
now<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> next<00:01:13.740> step<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.460> second<00:01:14.850> step<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.420> our

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
now the next step the second step in our

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.120 
now the next step the second step in our
algorithm<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:17.780> lightly<00:01:18.780> judge<00:01:19.130> my

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
algorithm is to lightly judge my

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.410 
algorithm is to lightly judge my
congestion<00:01:20.880> force<00:01:21.869> happens<00:01:22.790> on<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.270> same

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
congestion force happens on the same

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.469 
congestion force happens on the same
boxes<00:01:25.189> which<00:01:26.189> are<00:01:26.340> intimately<00:01:26.850> visible<00:01:27.360> from

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
boxes which are intimately visible from

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.870 

all<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.250> lights<00:01:38.460> which<00:01:38.790> is

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
all the lights which is

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.850 
all the lights which is
here<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.420> getting<00:01:41.720> objective<00:01:42.230> in<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:42.500> region

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
here is getting objective in this region

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.340 
here is getting objective in this region
here<00:01:43.070> similarly<00:01:43.640> for<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.910> smaller<00:01:44.350> secured

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
here similarly for the smaller secured

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.610 
here similarly for the smaller secured
here<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:46.610> bolts<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.150> box<00:01:47.480> are<00:01:48.410> also

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
here the bolts of the box are also

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.500 
here the bolts of the box are also
composed<00:01:49.100> out<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.460> box<00:01:49.670> even<00:01:50.060> though<00:01:50.240> it's<00:01:50.390> not

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
composed out of box even though it's not

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.390 
composed out of box even though it's not
entirely<00:01:50.810> obvious<00:01:51.020> here<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.040> essentially

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
entirely obvious here the essentially

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.940 
entirely obvious here the essentially
agreed<00:01:52.850> a<00:01:53.240> wall<00:01:53.870> of<00:01:54.140> boxes<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.960> now<00:02:00.110> once<00:02:00.830> the

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
agreed a wall of boxes so now once the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.400 
agreed a wall of boxes so now once the
concurrence<00:02:01.460> for<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.090> results<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.660> like

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
concurrence for the results of like

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.090 
concurrence for the results of like
injection<00:02:04.040> we<00:02:04.700> can<00:02:04.880> do<00:02:05.000> contrasting<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:07.040> a

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
injection we can do contrasting and a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.460 
injection we can do contrasting and a
result<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.640> come<00:02:07.820> tracing<00:02:08.300> is<00:02:08.509> essentially

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
result of come tracing is essentially

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.220 
result of come tracing is essentially
this<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.789> again<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.750> interact

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
this so this is again just that interact

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:34.210 
this so this is again just that interact
automation<00:02:13.630> without<00:02:17.350> this<00:02:18.489> bright<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.920> now<00:02:34.160> we

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
automation without this bright so now we

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.270 
automation without this bright so now we
can<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.730> final<00:02:35.030> step<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.230> combine<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
can the final step is to combine the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.850 
can the final step is to combine the
personnel<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.450> xgi<00:02:38.989> this<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.560> what<00:02:39.739> you

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
personnel of the xgi this is what you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.229 
personnel of the xgi this is what you
get<00:02:40.989> if<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.170> follow<00:02:42.440> all<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.950> steps<00:02:43.010> as<00:02:43.640> as<00:02:44.090> we

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
get if you follow all the steps as as we

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.020 
get if you follow all the steps as as we
describe<00:02:44.630> them<00:02:44.840> as<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.709> can<00:02:45.860> see<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.670> spheres

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
describe them as you can see the spheres

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.150 
describe them as you can see the spheres
are<00:02:47.239> not<00:02:47.510> perfectly<00:02:47.930> diffused<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.650> if<00:02:49.040> you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
are not perfectly diffused and if you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.180 
are not perfectly diffused and if you
look<00:02:49.280> carefully<00:02:49.489> they<00:02:50.269> kind<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:51.049> reflects<00:02:51.709> the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
look carefully they kind of reflects the
