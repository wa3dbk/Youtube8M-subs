that<00:03:24.690> used<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.900> go<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.989> little<00:03:25.110> bit<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.319> the

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
that used to go a little bit to the

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.720 
that used to go a little bit to the
right<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.010> we're<00:03:26.129> on<00:03:26.159> a<00:03:26.250> jump<00:03:26.459> just<00:03:26.610> a

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
right of it so we're on a jump just a

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.770 
right of it so we're on a jump just a
little<00:03:27.030> bit<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.239> right<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.690> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
little bit of the right of it and it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.869 
little bit of the right of it and it
won't<00:03:27.959> push<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.230> back<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.860> you'll<00:03:29.549> be<00:03:29.730> in

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
won't push you back and you'll be in

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.020 
won't push you back and you'll be in
it's<00:03:30.269> just<00:03:30.480> not<00:03:30.629> as<00:03:30.780> good<00:03:30.959> as<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.230> old<00:03:31.260> one<00:03:32.030> so

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
it's just not as good as the old one so

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.759 
it's just not as good as the old one so
it<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:33.810> goes<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.019> show<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.349> even<00:03:34.680> though

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769

pretty<00:03:45.959> fun<00:03:46.260> this<00:03:46.680> one<00:03:46.860> is<00:03:47.220> not<00:03:47.370> like<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.700> one

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
pretty fun this one is not like the one

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.039 
pretty fun this one is not like the one
on<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:48.060> rock<00:03:48.209> where<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.510> just<00:03:48.690> could<00:03:48.930> do

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
on the rock where you just could do

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.630 
on the rock where you just could do
nothing<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.530> sit<00:03:49.739> there<00:03:49.769> yet<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.549> actually

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
nothing and sit there yet to actually

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.130 
nothing and sit there yet to actually
burn<00:03:50.940> them<00:03:51.150> otherwise<00:03:51.420> they<00:03:51.480> do<00:03:51.659> you<00:03:51.780> get<00:03:51.959> to

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140

you<00:03:52.230> eventually<00:03:53.159> so<00:03:53.879> I<00:03:54.290> don't<00:03:55.290> know<00:03:55.439> just<00:03:56.010> my

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
you eventually so I don't know just my

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.679 
you eventually so I don't know just my
opinion<00:03:56.489> witches<00:03:56.939> are<00:03:57.060> cool<00:03:57.239> as<00:03:57.420> long<00:03:57.450> as

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689
