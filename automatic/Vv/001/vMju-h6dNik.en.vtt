consuming time-consuming one this is
easy<00:01:03.510> ones<00:01:03.870> compared<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.439> those<00:01:05.150> anyway<00:01:06.150> this

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
easy ones compared to those anyway this

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.219 
easy ones compared to those anyway this
is<00:01:06.479> how<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.659> made<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.520> Loram<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:09.080> mean<00:01:10.080> like

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
base our base is done right this is how

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.609 
base our base is done right this is how
it<00:01:13.590> looks<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:17.479> thought<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.470> don't
