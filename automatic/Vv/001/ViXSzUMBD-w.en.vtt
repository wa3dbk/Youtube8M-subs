a<00:00:57.059> systematic<00:00:57.809> review<00:00:58.199> or<00:00:58.550> meta-analysis<00:00:59.550> on

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
a systematic review or meta-analysis on

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.150 
a systematic review or meta-analysis on
the<00:01:00.149> research<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.510> he<00:01:00.750> has<00:01:00.960> got<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:02.010> we

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the research that he has got and then we

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.439 
the research that he has got and then we
could<00:01:02.280> start<00:01:02.489> taking<00:01:02.850> things<00:01:03.030> more<00:01:03.300> seriously

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
could start taking things more seriously

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.420 
could start taking things more seriously
but<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.870> do<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.409> irresponsible<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:05.339> him

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
but I do think it's irresponsible of him

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.910 
but I do think it's irresponsible of him
to<00:01:05.760> make<00:01:05.909> those<00:01:06.090> recommendations<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
to make those recommendations at a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.609 
to make those recommendations at a
public<00:01:08.280> level<00:01:08.840> could<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.900> dangerous<00:01:10.530> because

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
public level could be dangerous because

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.350 
public level could be dangerous because
it<00:01:10.860> depends<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.850> after<00:01:12.210> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it depends on you know after that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
it depends on you know after that
responsibility<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> whole<00:01:14.070> population

responsible<00:03:14.849> I<00:03:15.090> think<00:03:15.390> just<00:03:16.079> because<00:03:16.349> it

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
responsible I think just because it

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.709 
responsible I think just because it
works<00:03:16.709> for<00:03:16.829> some<00:03:17.010> people<00:03:17.370> or<00:03:18.269> something<00:03:18.569> I
