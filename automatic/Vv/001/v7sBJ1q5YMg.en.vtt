00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.270
 welcome everyone today small 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.939
 reviewer 2 to 7 f3 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.640
 remember this tax was that owl 911 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.400
 will appear until I came how come 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.920
 I compare them with what they differ in general 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.470
 With regards to May 7, 3 I want to start from the remote 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.660
 control remote control small he 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.800
 really easy it eats only 4 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.399
 batteries 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.890
 there are not so many bundles of settings 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.160
 The principle is nothing to set up standard 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.059
 our coaches go on the left side u 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.880
 we have 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.360
 a button a button is responsible for two modes 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.100
 flight catalog drink and high speed 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 press the button go high speed 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.550
 high speed mode gives us more tilt 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.920
 and skew plates respectively for 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.439
 helicopter in midsummer I'm a little faster 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.990
 not straight faster but actually it 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.869
 little more no settings here 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.790
 if you bought this helicopter you 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.430
 turn on the remote control you have 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.049
 It is written that there are many two at once 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.600
 I want to say that two can be written 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.700
 here is this mod 4 in our real life 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.800
 to make mods here 2 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.409
 find it must be written fashion one 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.440
 to switch off our remote 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.290
 of management 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.390
 squeeze was carried out on the right and turn on 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.450
 hardware all hardware goes over 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.060
 we are god mode and one is written here but 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.550
 this will be our standard 10 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.790
 throttle on the left and control plate and 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.620
 on the right is all a pound more 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.130
 nothing to add 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.140
 The standard is cool and good 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.190
 as for the 2 itself, the usual 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.260
 classical scheme 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.420
 global fixed pitch system 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.940
 blades are collector nedvizhki 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.230
 in the front and in the back 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.790
 staffed with two batteries and 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.670
 charger control panel 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.790
 and the blades also the spare enters 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.280
 a helicopter kit is basically difficult 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.400
 Killed for the home is great and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.980
 easy to operate hanging well if 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.080
 crash nothing practically breaks 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.410
 during all of my fingers i'm so nothing 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.770
 until I broke there to work on it 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.870
 some kind of spring 1 separator just 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.060
 you do not like for yourself 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.120
 do you want to start your own 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.030
 virtual life start with this 4 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.130
 kanalnik and some basics will work a 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.630
 then go to other helicopters 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.010
 as for flying outside but 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.870
 I recommend doing only in complete calm 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.180
 when there is no wind when on it 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.950
 you can fly there will be a breeze then 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.830
 it will be demolished because 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.400
 resistance 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.970
 what a helicopter to break and I think done 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.800
 soul for home and for the hall that is in the hall 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.560
 it will be possible to betray him well 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.410
 you have such an opportunity is excellent in 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.120
 general kindness 4-channel helicopter 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.130
 which is great for home 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.770
 especially the winter period when they are very 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.250
 I want to go out 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.980
 can fly calm and difficult to kill well 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.800
 kill him is difficult but important therefore 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.120
 watch the flight video waiting for new reviews 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.120
 and see you soon 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.150
 she is 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.150
 football
