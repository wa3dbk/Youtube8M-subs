00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:25.250
 I got up in the morning and decided to show you something 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.910
 what we bought that member back and 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.260

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:40.250
 overgrown well almost cleaned by us 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:42.170
 garden area three and a half weave with 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.200
 water tank 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:50.660
 This kind of water is a very important thing. 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.140
 therefore issued twice a week 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.840
 only half a year at a time necessary 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.930
 watering what's next with water here already 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:09.080
 everyone chooses for someone digging 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.540
 well on average 50 meters deep 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.250
 someone uses imported water machine 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.560
 which costs one and a half thousand rubles 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.530
 lead that is responsibly 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.080
 similar capacity is buried similar 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.820
 here in this pit which is almost here 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.799

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.189
 top up by car water used 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.090
 for household needs 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:43.020
 Well, here it is an irregularly shaped plot 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:47.100
 it turns out 25 meters then wall 27 then you 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:52.619
 there he gave strokes to the post and here it is 46 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.200
 diagonal connection goes and just 33 4 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.930
 weave be exactly here this we have already begun 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.290
 clearing to do here was very 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.810
 difficult to pass almost unreal we 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.600
 already started clearing 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.450
 preparing a place for the future mass of the house 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.360
 1 will be in this corner right here 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.080
 Naturally trees will clean these 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.260
 will remain only on the left side 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.230
 some trees are still alive here or 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.130
 disembark but by the way what not 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.360
 characteristic of 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.730
 fiolenta on that stretch of land is possible 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.440
 when it imported possible here it was 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.780
 to clay such 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.360
 or a different color but this land on which 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.860
 growing you see here a lot of grass and 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:44.220
 different plants here this site which 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.130
 we acquired the family and on which already 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.470

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.960
 next month we will start 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.190
 building our own home in 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.540
 city ​​of sevastopol garden plot 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:05.070
 is generally in a convenient place here 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:08.930
 to stop right there somewhere 200 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:13.760
 meters will stop route 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:17.120
 bus and two stops 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.620
 this shuttle will be 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.450
 the developed part of the city is called the pilots 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.690
 This is the area of ​​the city where but absolutely 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.880
 everything is there are two stops and already 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.070
 the city here is like a private sector 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.070
 garden friend, I showed you our 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.800
 the plot where we bought it 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.880
 but I told you first the video that we 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.700
 already spent the night here 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.360
 of course here we can't sleep 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:50.430
 because there is no place to sleep here but we are completely 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:54.739
 close in three plots from this here and 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:00.930
 I'll show you there is our car 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:07.380
 it was there that we were lucky as always and we 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:11.360
 removed the cottage with the building so very 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.360
