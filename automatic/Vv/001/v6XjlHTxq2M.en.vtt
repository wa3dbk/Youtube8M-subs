00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
see what how it really performs it is a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.510 
see what how it really performs it is a
DMX<00:00:42.420> light<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.680> right<00:00:43.860> here<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.370> our

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
DMX light and so right here we have our

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.190 
DMX light and so right here we have our
DMX<00:00:45.059> input<00:00:45.440> or<00:00:46.440> our<00:00:46.559> DMX<00:00:47.070> output<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:48.079> this<00:00:49.079> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
DMX input or our DMX output and this is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.740 
DMX input or our DMX output and this is
for<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.920> those<00:00:50.010> those<00:00:50.579> controllers<00:00:51.329> idea

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
for one of those those controllers idea

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.650

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
a nice little solution to that you can

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.500 
a nice little solution to that you can
sit<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:43.650> down<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.310> it's<00:03:44.849> not<00:03:45.030> touching<00:03:45.420> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
sit this down and it's not touching the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.429 
sit this down and it's not touching the
mirrors<00:03:45.780> do<00:03:46.769> this<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.930> wouldn't<00:03:48.930> be<00:03:49.049> banging

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
mirrors do this I wouldn't be banging

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.240 
mirrors do this I wouldn't be banging
around<00:03:49.620> like<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.099> but<00:03:50.459> good<00:03:51.359> little<00:03:51.810> plus<00:03:52.530> so

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
around like that but good little plus so

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.130 
around like that but good little plus so
it's<00:03:53.459> good<00:03:53.609> for<00:03:53.640> mobile<00:03:54.120> work<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.540> lot<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.959> your

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
it's good for mobile work a lot of your

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.140 
it's good for mobile work a lot of your
old<00:03:55.349> scanner<00:03:55.829> lights<00:03:56.129> we're<00:03:56.370> not<00:03:56.670> good<00:03:56.970> for

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
old scanner lights we're not good for

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.240 
old scanner lights we're not good for
mobile<00:03:57.450> work<00:03:57.629> for<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.200> couple<00:03:58.440> reasons<00:03:58.500> one<00:03:58.829> a

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
this mirror because the mirror was

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.369
