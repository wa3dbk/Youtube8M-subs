00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.790
 Hello, I really want to say about 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.290
 wonderful occupation 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:16.379
 right-hand drawing which went 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:20.850
 in the company for points from my colleagues and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.119
 friends of us were 12 people and we were able 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.619
 do some wonderful work 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.500
 were able to embody their 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.810
 probably an old dream at least 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 I can say for myself I am creative 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.790
 man i have seven years of music 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.890
 schools in the background I studied next to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.770
 multiple classes always envy 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.410
 looked at the artists you wore 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.860
 I also wanted my beautiful works 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.320
 try very water finally i 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 I could realize my dream I can 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.780
 demonstrate yes this is my 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.490
 drawing it I was able to draw 20 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.650
 seconds and here 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:06.960
 the work that I did a little more to me 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.990
 it seems that the difference is obvious and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.710
 say you may not have died 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.000
 lovely 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.290
 Russians like bumps or repins are acceptable 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.330
 I highly recommend to try 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.200
 people who maybe see me now 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.330
 and don't hear it very interesting very 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.930
 entertaining and allows first 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:38.140
 probably plunge into the atmosphere 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.740
 creativity and probably go away 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.340
 from the concerns of the problems that we are in this 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.440
 life is infinitely surrounded and very 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.270
 I want to say thank you to the people who 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.540
 today we have been given so much joy 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.680
 this is svetlana who conducted the workshop and 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.040
 you at least you could 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.539
 us too suggest up open mind and so 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.789
 once and without ironing 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.210
 thank you very much for very much 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:11.640

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.640
