communicating as you can see it's
reading<00:00:53.990> our<00:00:54.110> revs<00:00:54.500> from<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:55.010> car<00:00:55.280> i'ma<00:00:55.550> give

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
reading our revs from the car i'ma give

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.720 
reading our revs from the car i'ma give
it<00:00:55.850> some<00:00:56.000> gas<00:00:58.480> okay<00:00:59.480> as<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:01.040> can<00:01:01.070> see<00:01:01.250> it's

per<00:03:21.420> gallon<00:03:21.660> zero<00:03:22.319> since<00:03:22.739> we're<00:03:22.980> not<00:03:23.160> moving

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
per gallon zero since we're not moving

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:34.809 
per gallon zero since we're not moving
now<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.680> great<00:03:25.980> thing<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.640> say

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.119 

so<00:03:35.450> torque<00:03:35.930> here<00:03:36.349> the<00:03:36.620> reason<00:03:36.920> it's<00:03:37.069> not

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
so torque here the reason it's not

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.250 
so torque here the reason it's not
giving<00:03:37.549> us<00:03:37.790> torque<00:03:38.209> is<00:03:38.450> because<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.049> need<00:03:39.170> to

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
giving us torque is because you need to

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.979 
giving us torque is because you need to
set<00:03:39.499> up<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.709> vehicle<00:03:39.950> profile<00:03:40.760> what<00:03:41.749> you<00:03:41.870> do

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
set up a vehicle profile what you do

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.000 
set up a vehicle profile what you do
with<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.230> vehicle<00:03:42.650> profile<00:03:43.280> is<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:45.019> vehicle

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
with the vehicle profile is the vehicle

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.569 
with the vehicle profile is the vehicle
profile<00:03:46.579> create<00:03:47.540> new<00:03:47.980> what<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.159> do<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.430> you

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
profile create new what you do is you

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.250 
profile create new what you do is you
enter<00:03:49.849> in<00:03:49.999> the<00:03:50.030> weight<00:03:50.389> your<00:03:50.719> displacement

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
enter in the weight your displacement

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.740 
enter in the weight your displacement
everything<00:03:52.040> like<00:03:52.250> that<00:03:52.280> once<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:53.329> create<00:03:53.599> the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
everything like that once you create the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.929 
everything like that once you create the
vehicle<00:03:54.170> profile<00:03:54.680> it'll<00:03:55.040> automatically<00:03:55.579> pull

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
vehicle profile it'll automatically pull

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.250 
vehicle profile it'll automatically pull
your<00:03:56.120> vin<00:03:56.359> number<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.959> we'll<00:03:57.049> keep

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
your vin number and we'll keep

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.129 
your vin number and we'll keep
everything<00:03:57.579> basically<00:03:58.579> organized<00:03:59.420> in<00:03:59.780> here

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
everything basically organized in here

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.770 
everything basically organized in here
you<00:04:00.799> can<00:04:00.980> create<00:04:01.159> multiple<00:04:01.780> multiple

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
you can create multiple multiple

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.039 
you can create multiple multiple
profiles<00:04:03.349> that<00:04:04.209> way<00:04:05.209> if<00:04:05.359> you're<00:04:05.480> using<00:04:05.689> it<00:04:05.930> on

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
profiles that way if you're using it on

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.080 
profiles that way if you're using it on
different<00:04:06.409> vehicles<00:04:06.919> you<00:04:07.370> can<00:04:07.400> just<00:04:07.760> load<00:04:08.060> up

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
different vehicles you can just load up

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.689 
different vehicles you can just load up
a<00:04:08.450> profile<00:04:09.019> and<00:04:09.319> it's<00:04:09.469> ready<00:04:09.739> to<00:04:09.859> go<00:04:11.739> obd<00:04:12.739> fault

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:13.699 
a profile and it's ready to go obd fault

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:19.719 
a profile and it's ready to go obd fault
codes<00:04:15.699> now<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:18.620> just<00:04:18.799> pull<00:04:19.070> that<00:04:19.099> it<00:04:19.519> works

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
codes now you just pull that it works

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.620 
codes now you just pull that it works
just<00:04:19.849> like<00:04:20.090> an<00:04:20.269> obd2<00:04:20.720> scanner<00:04:20.930> as<00:04:21.709> well<00:04:22.330> so<00:04:23.330> as

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
just like an obd2 scanner as well so as

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.110 
just like an obd2 scanner as well so as
you<00:04:23.840> can<00:04:24.020> see<00:04:24.380> i<00:04:24.410> got<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:24.860> couple<00:04:25.669> of<00:04:25.849> fault

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
you can see i got a couple of fault

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.909 
you can see i got a couple of fault
codes<00:04:26.479> here<00:04:30.009> let's<00:04:31.009> see<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:33.110> what<00:04:33.289> you<00:04:33.440> can<00:04:33.650> do

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
codes here let's see so what you can do

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:40.629 
codes here let's see so what you can do
actually<00:04:34.669> is<00:04:34.870> let's<00:04:35.870> say<00:04:38.740> fault<00:04:39.740> code<00:04:40.039> okay<00:04:40.580> so

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
actually is let's say fault code okay so

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.510 
actually is let's say fault code okay so
if<00:04:41.300> I'm<00:04:41.570> this<00:04:41.780> fault<00:04:42.080> code<00:04:42.380> you<00:04:43.159> can<00:04:43.280> actually

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
if I'm this fault code you can actually

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.730 
if I'm this fault code you can actually
do<00:04:43.789> a<00:04:43.820> web<00:04:44.150> look<00:04:44.509> up<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:44.960> I'll<00:04:45.139> look<00:04:45.380> up<00:04:45.530> what

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
do a web look up and I'll look up what

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.469 
do a web look up and I'll look up what
that<00:04:45.919> code<00:04:46.159> is<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:46.759> you<00:04:46.849> don't<00:04:47.000> actually<00:04:47.180> have

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
that code is so you don't actually have

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.960 
that code is so you don't actually have
to<00:04:47.509> go<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.229> search<00:04:48.650> through<00:04:49.009> books<00:04:49.370> and

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
to go and search through books and

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.939 
to go and search through books and
online<00:04:50.389> it'll<00:04:51.080> do<00:04:51.289> it<00:04:51.409> for<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:53.320> so<00:04:54.320> there<00:04:54.800> you

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
online it'll do it for you so there you

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.980 
online it'll do it for you so there you
have<00:04:54.979> it<00:04:55.220> that<00:04:55.580> is<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.789> jew<00:04:56.570> tronic<00:04:56.990> CH<00:04:57.470> x<00:04:57.789> 25
