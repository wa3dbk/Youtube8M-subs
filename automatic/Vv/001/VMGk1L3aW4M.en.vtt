00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:09.330
 how the tutorial gives you this 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.889
 which we are going to talk about now is about 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:19.189
 waltz rhythm and the criollo waltz and a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.189
 gender that is universal or from 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:30.660
 but that's how it is 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.250
 either that well it's all have their 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.000
 inform everyone that they are in three times 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.180
 the main base is thinkable in a 3 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.830
 by 4 that would be given a second time 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.770
 time and after doing hundreds and three 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.140
 black is the basics how you touch can 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.820
 carla touch lower and my older two 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.379
 basic chords for the one who is 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.989
 beginning to play the guitar 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:58.660
 exercise it the rhythm this thumb down 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.879
 the thumb these are the fingers the hand 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.010
 comes as we know luckily beings 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.259
 humans we have to separate in two parts what 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.940
 that allows us to clamp and between 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.700
 other things 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.700
 then he touched thumb down down 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.600
 instead 2000 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.079
 one 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.079
 much less fast 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.880
 that is the basis yes then yes we are going to 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.039
 that the sheet that I have written well in 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.990
 Creole would be three by four the first 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.369
 time with a thumb down 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.280
 generally grab the strings more 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.750
 serious the second time with a finger 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.789
 down generally grab the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.850
 nylon strings and the third one also 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:56.049
 reattach the nylon strings if 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:59.440
 it's the same some of the tutors in the 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.690
 mine they know that I can divide 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.060
 where I have time to search 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.520
 to put some resource an oil some 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.950
 another tap more then the second 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.420
 variant that I suggest that is used 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.569
 many of valsecitos greeks and also 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.659
 the rancheras 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.819
 divide the second time the one that was with 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.920
 one finger down and the third one instead 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.989
 to have three blacks or three figures 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.480
 same as I had the one in the top 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:30.629
 base / the second and the third time in 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.639
 two and I left this I do it took off 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.319
 so that so that the 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:43.639
 one longer when it's time for him to come 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:47.959
 first time as the vulgar mole 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.959
 took advantage of the one who moves the thumb and low 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.400
 I refer 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.700
 to make low echoes when I'm under 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.930
 the finger I think the whole hand is 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.580
 pressing inside the 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.560
 guitar then the same fingers 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.310
 when they finish going down they make me 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.310
 drop your hand 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.570
 unlike there in that race that 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.900
 I have to leave the first ones sounding 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.900
 ropes 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.180
 but if I think I have the first 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.069
 whole the second and third / not 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.180
 I can divide the first one is also what 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.180
 that everything divided in two 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.270
 the first where the second in two and 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.660
 the third in two and seeing the hand that 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.660
 from this 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.739
 ah 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:26.569
 and 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.590
 I already know quite a bit how real the 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.240
 rhythm that's why I always suggest 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.240
 go back to the source that is the first 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.169
 and then you can discard first 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.840
 You've probably seen some video that 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.340
 had done a long time ago of alterna 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.650
 the thumb with fingers and I touch in 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.950
 blocks or from the smoothies by celebrities 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.020
 milkshakes and then healthy today that's touching the 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.080
 first serious time in this case if to a 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.449
 side the fifth string and the three strings 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.990
 to hours 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.990
 and 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.430
 32 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.430
 ah 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.040
 the formula was put xa a degree 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.110
 which can be sixth fifth and the 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.110
 three sharp strings one two three 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:35.610
 the printed examples about the minor and 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:38.030
 greater with that concept I later divided the 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.540
 second and the third time 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.540
 ah 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.170
 good people, I hope you have served them 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.330
 this was a tutorial on one of the 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.700
 more universal rhythms let's say that 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.510
 also the Argentine future obviously 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.420
 also own it as own and good 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.970
 balanced ranches waltzes waltzes 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.100
 criollos has to do always with this 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.570
 question of three times the first 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.460
 serious the second and third time 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.750
 acute patience generally waltzes 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.020
 to differences out there of those more 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.840
 traditional or chacareras 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.120
 they are harmonically are more complex or 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.280
 that they have enough chords for the 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.770
 left hand what that way 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.530
 makes it difficult at first to touch 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.819
 if I do not have all the basic chords 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.680
 older and younger can touch a waltz 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.199
 they have a lot more quietly 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.569
 chords yes but good patience 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.970
 quiet write subscribe be the 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.889
 channel ask questions comments if 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.379
 You need me to send you an email or some 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.360
 information or suggested some other 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.159
 tutorial do not hesitate to do it well 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.699
 thank you very much and it will be next 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.699
