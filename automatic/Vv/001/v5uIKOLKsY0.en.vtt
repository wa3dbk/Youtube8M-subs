year we've gotten you know a lot smarter

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.270 
year we've gotten you know a lot smarter
we've<00:00:40.140> gotta<00:00:41.140> know<00:00:41.290> you<00:00:41.829> know<00:00:41.920> some<00:00:42.100> big

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
we've gotta know you know some big

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.940 
we've gotta know you know some big
acquisitions<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.510> I<00:00:43.600> think<00:00:43.810> that's<00:00:43.960> just<00:00:44.079> you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
acquisitions and I think that's just you

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.440 
acquisitions and I think that's just you
know<00:00:45.040> shows<00:00:45.340> of<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.579> organization<00:00:46.090> wants<00:00:46.300> to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
know shows of the organization wants to

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.729 
know shows of the organization wants to
you<00:00:46.690> know<00:00:46.750> keep<00:00:46.960> keep<00:00:47.320> pushing<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.710> envelope

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
you know keep keep pushing the envelope

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.470 
you know keep keep pushing the envelope
with<00:00:48.460> going<00:00:48.730> out<00:00:48.790> and<00:00:48.940> winning<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.270> I<00:00:49.300> think

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
with going out and winning and I think

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.170 
with going out and winning and I think
that's<00:00:49.630> kind<00:00:49.840> of<00:00:49.870> what<00:00:50.020> it<00:00:50.110> takes<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.850> know<00:00:51.940> it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
that's kind of what it takes you know it

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.720 
that's kind of what it takes you know it
a<00:00:52.420> lot<00:00:53.050> of<00:00:53.200> it<00:00:53.320> has<00:00:53.559> to<00:00:53.590> do<00:00:53.860> with<00:00:54.070> just<00:00:54.280> us<00:00:54.489> going

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
a lot of it has to do with just us going

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.250 
a lot of it has to do with just us going
out<00:00:54.910> there<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.149> being<00:00:55.420> ourselves<00:00:55.719> and<00:00:56.230> I

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:50.169 
have kind of the same values and you

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:51.539 
have kind of the same values and you
know<00:01:50.259> that<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:50.649> makes<00:01:50.889> it<00:01:51.039> a<00:01:51.099> lot<00:01:51.219> easier<00:01:51.279> for

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
know that that makes it a lot easier for

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.339 
know that that makes it a lot easier for
us<00:01:51.789> to<00:01:51.819> really<00:01:52.240> relate<00:01:52.599> to<00:01:52.659> have

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:53.349 
us to really relate to have

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:55.580 
us to really relate to have
conversations<00:01:54.009> I<00:01:54.189> know<00:01:54.340> we<00:01:54.459> hang<00:01:54.609> out<00:01:54.729> a<00:01:54.759> lot

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
conversations I know we hang out a lot

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.749 
conversations I know we hang out a lot
you<00:01:56.590> know<00:01:56.679> in<00:01:56.859> the<00:01:56.889> Alpha<00:01:57.219> their<00:01:57.429> batting

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
you know in the Alpha their batting

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.919 
you know in the Alpha their batting
practice<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.209> I<00:01:58.270> think<00:01:58.329> that<00:01:58.479> always<00:01:58.719> helps

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
practice so I think that always helps

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.389 
practice so I think that always helps
because<00:01:59.139> you're<00:01:59.409> just<00:01:59.590> able<00:01:59.709> to<00:01:59.889> converse<00:02:00.159> and

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
because you're just able to converse and

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.919 
because you're just able to converse and
you<00:02:00.609> know<00:02:00.669> just<00:02:00.880> uh<00:02:00.999> you<00:02:01.450> know<00:02:01.659> get<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.840> know

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
you know just uh you know get to know

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.050 
you know just uh you know get to know
everybody<00:02:02.319> to<00:02:02.799> you<00:02:03.489> know<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.759> get<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:03.909> better

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
everybody to you know and get a better

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.359 
everybody to you know and get a better
understanding<00:02:04.149> but<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:04.929> think<00:02:05.169> that<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.529> the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
understanding but I think that that the

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.919 
understanding but I think that that the
organization<00:02:06.609> i<00:02:07.029> think<00:02:07.209> is<00:02:07.329> sense<00:02:07.569> that<00:02:07.779> and

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
organization i think is sense that and

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.120 
organization i think is sense that and
seeing<00:02:08.140> that<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.349> think<00:02:08.619> that's<00:02:08.739> why<00:02:08.860> they<00:02:08.979> kind

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
seeing that I think that's why they kind

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.499 
seeing that I think that's why they kind
of<00:02:09.250> want<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.520> put<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.700> together<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:10.179> because

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
of want to put this together is because

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.060 
of want to put this together is because
we<00:02:10.630> do<00:02:10.780> we<00:02:10.929> all<00:02:11.020> get<00:02:11.170> along<00:02:11.230> really<00:02:11.410> well<00:02:11.740> and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
we do we all get along really well and

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.460 
we do we all get along really well and
it<00:02:12.910> does<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.360> think<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.600> helps<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:14.410> know

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
it does it I think it helps you know

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.770 
it does it I think it helps you know
when

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
when

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.390 
when
when<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> good<00:02:15.170> times<00:02:15.410> are<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:16.190> know<00:02:16.250> really

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
when the good times are you know really

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.530 
when the good times are you know really
high<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.640> then<00:02:16.940> when<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.150> kind<00:02:17.240> of<00:02:17.330> get<00:02:17.450> in

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
high and then when you kind of get in

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.670 
high and then when you kind of get in
