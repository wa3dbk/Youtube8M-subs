alright<00:00:02.250> so<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.669> part<00:00:02.939> two<00:00:03.179> in<00:00:03.389> the

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
alright so this is part two in the

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.570 
alright so this is part two in the
settling<00:00:03.929> setting<00:00:04.350> up<00:00:04.470> modeling<00:00:04.920> blueprints

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
settling setting up modeling blueprints

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.419 
settling setting up modeling blueprints
for<00:00:05.759> my<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.940> hand<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.600> couple<00:00:06.839> things<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.589> ran

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
for my a hand a couple things that I ran

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.230 
for my a hand a couple things that I ran
at<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.670> time<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.150> cover<00:00:09.389> on<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.809> UM<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:11.240> last

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
at a time to cover on the UM the last

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.099 
at a time to cover on the UM the last
video<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.290> if<00:00:13.740> your<00:00:14.509> image<00:00:15.509> sizes<00:00:16.020> are

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
video is is if your image sizes are

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.660 
video is is if your image sizes are
modeling<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.680> or<00:00:16.949> like<00:00:17.130> really<00:00:17.490> high

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
modeling with or like really high

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.640 
modeling with or like really high
resolution<00:00:18.449> images<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.050> these<00:00:19.170> aren't<00:00:19.380> like

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
resolution images and these aren't like

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.279 
resolution images and these aren't like
I<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.980> look<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.490> image<00:00:21.390> size<00:00:21.600> attributes

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
I can look in the image size attributes

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.349 
I can look in the image size attributes
it's<00:00:23.630> 466<00:00:24.630> 561<00:00:25.590> pixels<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.820> they're<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.150> very

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
it's 466 561 pixels so they're not very

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.960 
it's 466 561 pixels so they're not very
large<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.080> don't<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.590> really<00:00:28.970> you

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
large and I don't have to really you

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.700 
large and I don't have to really you
know<00:00:30.000> optimize<00:00:30.689> them<00:00:30.960> too<00:00:31.140> much<00:00:31.320> because

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
know optimize them too much because

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.380 
know optimize them too much because
they're<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> bug<00:00:32.520> Maya<00:00:32.759> down<00:00:33.120> but

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
they're not going to bug Maya down but

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.290 
they're not going to bug Maya down but
if<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> needed<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.520> you<00:00:35.520> need<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.090> about

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
if you needed to you need to think about

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.619 
if you needed to you need to think about
the<00:00:36.600> common<00:00:37.079> size<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.030> front

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the common size on these like this front

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.330 
the common size on these like this front
view<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.140> 161<00:00:41.070> by<00:00:41.510> 466<00:00:42.510> pixels<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.340> side

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
view is 161 by 466 pixels and the side

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.430 
view is 161 by 466 pixels and the side
view<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:45.469> 158<00:00:46.469> wide<00:00:46.920> by<00:00:47.780> 466<00:00:48.780> height<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
view is 158 wide by 466 height so the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.049 
view is 158 wide by 466 height so the
height<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.680> when<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.219> cut<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.550> out<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.879> height

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
height is when we cut it out the height

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.600 
height is when we cut it out the height
was<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> common<00:00:52.079> denominator<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
was the common denominator so if you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.760 
was the common denominator so if you
have<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.000> over<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.329> thousand<00:00:55.020> something

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
have like over a thousand something

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.229 
have like over a thousand something
pixel<00:00:56.129> image<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.820> make<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.239> 1024<00:00:59.000> 512<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
pixel image just make it a 1024 512 a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.189 
pixel image just make it a 1024 512 a
256<00:01:01.699> something<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:04.080> could

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
256 something like that and we could

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.539 
256 something like that and we could
deal<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.470> these<00:01:04.559> images<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.189> not<00:01:05.369> going

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
deal with these images but I'm not going

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.990 
deal with these images but I'm not going
to<00:01:05.610> bother<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.570> know<00:01:06.689> Maya<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.229> handles<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
to bother you know Maya just handles the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.969 
to bother you know Maya just handles the
common<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.720> denominator<00:01:10.380> numbers<00:01:10.740> like

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
common you know denominator numbers like

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.399 
common you know denominator numbers like
that<00:01:12.200> more<00:01:13.200> efficiently<00:01:14.720> we<00:01:15.720> also<00:01:15.869> made<00:01:16.229> them

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that more efficiently we also made them

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.590 
that more efficiently we also made them
more<00:01:16.560> efficient<00:01:17.040> by<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:18.030> converting<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
more efficient by the converting of the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.630 
more efficient by the converting of the
grayscale<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.920> right<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:20.189> we're<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.549> go

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
grayscale so right now we're going to go

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.399 
grayscale so right now we're going to go
inside<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.000> Maya<00:01:21.240> actually<00:01:21.600> demonstrate<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
inside of Maya actually demonstrate the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.380 
inside of Maya actually demonstrate the
part<00:01:22.619> where<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.070> map<00:01:23.610> them<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
part where you map them in so we have a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.780 
part where you map them in so we have a
front<00:01:24.689> decide<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.259> I'll<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.340> under<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
front decide to you I'll go under the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.929 
front decide to you I'll go under the
panel's<00:01:27.570> tab<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.229> window<00:01:28.500> and

orthographic<00:01:29.939> will<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:30.570> front<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.079> first

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
orthographic will go front of you first

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.399 
orthographic will go front of you first
and<00:01:32.100> we're<00:01:32.670> not<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> move<00:01:33.119> anything<00:01:33.409> no

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and we're not going to move anything no

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.499 
and we're not going to move anything no

and it's going to just ask me to look
for<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.619> put<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:43.950> my<00:01:44.070> desktop<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.759> look

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
for it I put it on my desktop so look

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.450 
for it I put it on my desktop so look
for<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:45.960> camera<00:01:46.229> name<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.740> its<00:01:46.860> front<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
for your camera name here its front so

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.789 
for your camera name here its front so
we<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:47.850> need<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> front<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.799> there

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
we know we need the front of you there

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.020 
we know we need the front of you there
it<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.540> it's<00:01:51.540> placed<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.140> outstanding<00:01:52.850> go<00:01:53.850> back

third right one you can go down to where
inputs<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.489> image<00:03:45.850> plane<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:46.570> can<00:03:46.720> do

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
inputs is image plane and you can do

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.610 
inputs is image plane and you can do
adjustments<00:03:47.320> there<00:03:47.560> so<00:03:48.310> with<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.640> selected<00:03:48.850> I

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
adjustments there so with it selected I

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.910 
adjustments there so with it selected I
can<00:03:50.620> go<00:03:50.890> in<00:03:51.040> there<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:52.650> mean<00:03:53.650> with<00:03:53.769> the

can go in there and I mean with the

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.370 
can go in there and I mean with the
center<00:03:54.310> XY<00:03:54.760> we<00:03:55.030> can<00:03:55.180> move<00:03:55.330> it<00:03:55.390> up<00:03:55.570> if<00:03:56.230> you

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
center XY we can move it up if you

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.380 
center XY we can move it up if you
wanted<00:03:56.680> above<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.040> grid<00:03:57.250> like<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:57.880> found<00:03:58.090> out

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
wanted above the grid like I found out

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.900 
wanted above the grid like I found out
that<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.690> think's<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.650> y-axis<00:04:00.430> centered

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
that I think's and the y-axis centered

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.220 
that I think's and the y-axis centered
15<00:04:01.840> he<00:04:02.050> sits<00:04:02.320> right<00:04:02.500> on<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.800> grid<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.690> we<00:04:05.080> got

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
15 he sits right on the grid so we got

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.380 
15 he sits right on the grid so we got
them<00:04:05.380> up<00:04:05.500> there<00:04:05.790> I'm<00:04:06.790> going<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.000> select<00:04:07.180> the

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
them up there I'm going to select the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.170 
them up there I'm going to select the
other<00:04:07.510> one<00:04:07.950> go<00:04:08.950> down<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.190> inputs<00:04:09.549> image<00:04:09.880> plane

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
other one go down the inputs image plane

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.250 
other one go down the inputs image plane
will<00:04:11.140> Center<00:04:11.500> him<00:04:11.680> up<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:12.010> 15-2<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:14.049> they're

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
will Center him up a 15-2 so they're

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.219 
will Center him up a 15-2 so they're
perfectly<00:04:15.660> evenly<00:04:16.660> up<00:04:16.810> there<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.900> now<00:04:20.019> what<00:04:20.200> I

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
perfectly evenly up there so now what I

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.539 
perfectly evenly up there so now what I
want<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.500> do<00:04:20.620> is<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.830> want<00:04:20.859> to<00:04:21.070> make<00:04:21.190> it<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.459> where

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
want to do is I want to make it to where
