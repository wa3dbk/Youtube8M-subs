00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.420 
the unsportsmanlike penalty so we've
been<00:02:01.140> trying<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> cut<00:02:01.740> down<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.189> fights

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
been trying to cut down on the fights

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.889 
been trying to cut down on the fights
quite<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> bit<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.329> kind<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.630> fight<00:02:03.869> in

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
quite a bit and just kind of fight in

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.679 
quite a bit and just kind of fight in
between<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.469> whistle<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.090> been<00:02:06.329> fairly

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
between the whistle but it's been fairly

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.680 
between the whistle but it's been fairly
competitive<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:08.069> know<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.220> think<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:09.420> pretty

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
competitive you know I think it's pretty

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.360 
competitive you know I think it's pretty
good<00:02:09.929> mixture<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.530> back<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.979> forth<00:02:11.220> with

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
good mixture going back and forth with

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.960 
good mixture going back and forth with
the<00:02:11.489> defense

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the defense

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.190 
the defense
so<00:02:12.120> that's<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.420> sign<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.840> good<00:02:12.960> team

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
so that's a sign of a good team

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.990 
so that's a sign of a good team
switching<00:02:13.950> over<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.250> kind<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.490> game<00:02:14.700> time

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
switching over to the kind of game time

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.940 
switching over to the kind of game time
start<00:02:15.330> type<00:02:15.750> situations<00:02:16.350> what<00:02:16.740> type<00:02:16.920> of

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
start type situations what type of

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.410 
start type situations what type of
mindset<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.580> want<00:02:17.700> offensive<00:02:18.090> lineman<00:02:18.360> to

mindset do you want offensive lineman to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.050

that can create some movement maybe the
shorter<00:03:07.080> guys<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:08.130> definitely<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:08.790> me<00:03:08.940> I

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
shorter guys but definitely for me I

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.900 
shorter guys but definitely for me I
think<00:03:09.120> we've<00:03:09.390> got<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.570> few<00:03:10.310> tweeners<00:03:11.310> here<00:03:11.580> we

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
think we've got a few tweeners here we

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.330 
think we've got a few tweeners here we
need<00:03:12.090> some<00:03:12.390> true<00:03:12.630> tackles<00:03:13.230> like<00:03:13.620> yourself<00:03:14.070> so

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
need some true tackles like yourself so

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.560 
need some true tackles like yourself so

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
area so far I would definitely say the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.090 
area so far I would definitely say the
weather<00:03:22.430> it's<00:03:23.430> not<00:03:23.640> too<00:03:23.850> hot<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:24.090> too<00:03:24.510> cold

weather it's not too hot not too cold

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.530 
weather it's not too hot not too cold
they've<00:03:26.100> assured<00:03:26.250> me<00:03:26.489> it's<00:03:26.820> like<00:03:27.000> this<00:03:27.239> and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
they've assured me it's like this and

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.620 
they've assured me it's like this and
during<00:03:28.410> training<00:03:28.800> camp<00:03:28.830> so<00:03:29.280> we'll<00:03:29.459> see<00:03:29.700> but

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
during training camp so we'll see but

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.850 
during training camp so we'll see but
yeah<00:03:30.780> that's<00:03:30.959> that's<00:03:31.200> probably<00:03:31.620> been<00:03:31.830> the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
yeah that's that's probably been the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.590 
yeah that's that's probably been the
best<00:03:32.190> thing<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.610> know<00:03:32.730> not<00:03:32.910> having<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.360> arrow

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
best thing you know not having the arrow

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.660 
best thing you know not having the arrow
at<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.050> house<00:03:34.200> it's<00:03:34.530> leaving<00:03:34.739> windows<00:03:35.280> open

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
at the house it's leaving windows open

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.000 
at the house it's leaving windows open
that's<00:03:35.880> obviously<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.630> big<00:03:37.110> change<00:03:37.769> for<00:03:37.950> me

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
that's obviously a big change for me

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.600 
that's obviously a big change for me
coming<00:03:38.430> from<00:03:38.660> out<00:03:39.660> east<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:40.410> i<00:03:40.650> would<00:03:41.160> say<00:03:41.340> that

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
coming from out east so i would say that

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.640 
coming from out east so i would say that
and<00:03:41.880> it's<00:03:42.030> just<00:03:42.209> beautiful<00:03:42.420> here<00:03:42.959> just

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650
