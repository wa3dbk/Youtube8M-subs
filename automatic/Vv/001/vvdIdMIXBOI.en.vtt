00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.629
 and we will continue 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.990
 this for the people who come to us 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.720
 following more or less are in the 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.029
 issue that we had left to put together 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.890
 theme of the numbers I brought a little bit 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.400
 advance some steps and with a 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.349
 stencil and a bit of toasted siena 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.099
 Toasted man depends on the color you 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.170
 Like, let's complete what would be the 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.589
 quadrant let's finish painting the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.350
 numbers with a little bit of acrylic on 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.420
 acrylic has to be hard there is no need to 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.699
 dilute it with water because if it does not go away 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 to enter below the stencil and good 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.120
 this step would be finished as well 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.219
 we have dry the dimensional or the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.809
 three-dimensional that was the one of grace that 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.300
 we had added in the previous step 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.769
 then this is going to be left aside and 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.410
 let's work now with the edge 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.350
 we had done 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.610
 that is, a decoupage and we are going to work 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:14.190
 with a little 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:18.550
 from old white rather to toasted with 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.140
 the sealer we insist that that already 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.920
 we used to make a kind of 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.480
 glaze and then this one that leaves a 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.580
 hue as well as transparent between 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.680
 transparent does not leave it transparent 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.640
 then once side let's do 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 clear and this is going to give us what is going to 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.300
 look like a wood effect 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.430
 and you are going putting we are going to apply 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.620
 white way so as to Spanishize 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.980
 old white a quantity and of j'adore 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.730
 and a little bit of toasted siena and we're going to 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.490
 apply and now as the sealer is going to 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.950
 give a little time to delay a little 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.640
 drying what I'm going to do is remove 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:07.200
 with a cloth or a piece of paper and a 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.270
 little bit of material to give that effect 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 running 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:17.100
 that has the original let's do what 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.890
 same with the dark sector for that 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.650
 let's use a little bit the gassed 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.600
 about occupying if we are going to use 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.970
 sienna toasted and magenta good frosting 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.710
 combination of this combination to me 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.140
 charm 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.140
 then the concrete looks 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.790
 and let it dry up here we would have 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.980
 the steps that correspond to this 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.380
 second and that you do not pick it up with normal 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.420
 I'm going to let you have it 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.490
 you are adding the amount of material 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.530
 you want until you achieve the color that you 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.360
 like quick dry 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.060
 quick dry 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.830
 we leave it there to dry for 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.840
 continue later with the next step 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.810
 Well, well, we need nothing 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.030
 see you then next Tuesday with 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.620
 the end of work by the same channel 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.620
 for the same obvious channel
