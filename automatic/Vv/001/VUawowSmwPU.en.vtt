00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.730 

okay<00:00:03.990> so<00:00:04.609> what<00:00:05.609> I'm<00:00:05.730> gonna<00:00:05.879> do<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.420> just<00:00:07.350> test

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
okay so what I'm gonna do is just test

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.089 
okay so what I'm gonna do is just test
the<00:00:08.069> strongest<00:00:08.809> ionization<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:12.920> the<00:00:13.920> way<00:00:14.040> you

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
the strongest ionization and the way you

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.300 
the strongest ionization and the way you
do<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.460> on<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.820> common<00:00:15.320> is<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.100> push

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
do that on the common is you just push

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.939 
do that on the common is you just push
that<00:00:17.520> strong<00:00:17.880> acidic<00:00:18.300> water<00:00:18.539> and

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
that strong acidic water and

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.220 
that strong acidic water and
interestingly<00:00:19.949> enough<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.660> top<00:00:21.930> will

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
interestingly enough out the top will

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.130 
interestingly enough out the top will
come<00:00:22.460> alkaline<00:00:23.460> even<00:00:23.939> though<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> says<00:00:24.449> strong

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
come alkaline even though it says strong

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.509 
come alkaline even though it says strong
with<00:00:25.289> sitting<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.769> kind<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.310> little

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
with sitting it's kind of a little

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.669 
with sitting it's kind of a little
strange<00:00:26.900> but<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:30.359> next<00:00:30.810> thing<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.529> gonna

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
strange but the next thing I'm gonna

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.120 
strange but the next thing I'm gonna
turn<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.309> Athena<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.450> I've<00:00:34.290> already<00:00:34.770> got<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
turn the Athena on I've already got the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.880 
turn the Athena on I've already got the
power<00:00:35.399> booster<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.180> wanted<00:00:36.420> okay<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.290> just

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
power booster I just wanted okay I just

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.209 
power booster I just wanted okay I just
turn<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> athena<00:00:38.730> off<00:00:39.950> okay

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
turn the athena off okay

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.250 
turn the athena off okay
I<00:00:41.250> already<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> power<00:00:42.300> booster<00:00:42.840> setting

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
I already have the power booster setting

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.139 
I already have the power booster setting
I'm<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.649> miss<00:00:43.860> showing<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.399> already

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
I'm just miss showing you I already

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.680 
I'm just miss showing you I already
changed<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.930> six<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.640> we're<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
changed it to six so that we're going to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.439 
changed it to six so that we're going to
get<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.020> strongest<00:00:49.399> ionization<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:50.960> now<00:00:51.960> my

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
get the strongest ionization here now my

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.540 
get the strongest ionization here now my
guess<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.110> say<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.800> I'm<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.100> going

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
guess is going to say that I'm not going

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.650 
guess is going to say that I'm not going
to<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.239> strong<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.500> athena<00:00:59.300> at<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
to get as strong for the athena at the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.579 
to get as strong for the athena at the
extremes<00:01:02.000> at<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.210> drinking<00:01:03.719> levels<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
extremes at the drinking levels the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.410 
extremes at the drinking levels the
athena<00:01:04.920> generally<00:01:05.780> usually<00:01:06.780> beats<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.680> magic

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
athena generally usually beats the magic

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.280 
athena generally usually beats the magic
and<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.260> every<00:01:10.890> case<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:12.060> our

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
and not not in every case but on our

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.609 
and not not in every case but on our
general<00:01:13.369> average<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.670> does<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:18.439> but<00:01:19.439> with

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
general average it does and but with

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.539 
general average it does and but with
this<00:01:19.799> strong<00:01:20.330> it<00:01:21.330> probably<00:01:21.659> won't<00:01:22.369> all<00:01:23.369> right

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
this strong it probably won't all right

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.780 
this strong it probably won't all right
well<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:23.880> gonna<00:01:24.000> go<00:01:24.270> ahead<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.659> pour<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:26.369> both

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
well I'm gonna go ahead and pour it both

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.190 
well I'm gonna go ahead and pour it both
that<00:01:30.290> both<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.799> based<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.549> level

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
that both it but based on this level

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.920 
that both it but based on this level
alkaline<00:01:37.490> okay<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.110> now<00:01:40.110> I'm<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.280> just

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
alkaline okay and now I'm going to just

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.470 
alkaline okay and now I'm going to just
well<00:01:42.560> spore<00:01:43.100> no<00:01:43.280> just<00:01:43.580> an<00:01:43.730> itch<00:01:43.880> gifts<00:01:44.270> on<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
well spore no just an itch gifts on the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.640 
well spore no just an itch gifts on the
city<00:01:44.780> water<00:01:48.130> just<00:01:49.130> getting<00:01:49.580> some<00:01:50.470> been<00:01:51.470> a

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
city water just getting some been a

00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:19.260 
city water just getting some been a
champion<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:54.140> then<00:01:54.350> I'll<00:01:54.530> get

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.270 

all<00:02:20.270> right<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.810> I'm<00:02:20.990> not<00:02:21.320> gonna<00:02:21.710> even<00:02:21.920> bother

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
all right and I'm not gonna even bother

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.420 
all right and I'm not gonna even bother
to<00:02:22.880> test<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.540> ORP<00:02:23.810> because<00:02:24.560> you're<00:02:25.100> not<00:02:25.220> going

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
to test the ORP because you're not going

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.990 
to test the ORP because you're not going
to<00:02:25.490> drink<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.630> water<00:02:27.170> at<00:02:27.620> these<00:02:28.000> extreme

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
to drink the water at these extreme

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.250 
to drink the water at these extreme
levels<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.130> don't<00:02:31.190> want<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.630> really<00:02:32.630> text

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
levels and I don't want to really text

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.150 
levels and I don't want to really text
my<00:02:33.470> ORP<00:02:34.130> meter<00:02:34.720> for<00:02:35.720> something<00:02:36.200> silly<00:02:36.800> like

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
my ORP meter for something silly like

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.800 
my ORP meter for something silly like
theme<00:02:38.170> extremes<00:02:39.170> all<00:02:40.070> right<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:41.860> an<00:02:42.860> ajik

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
theme extremes all right so the an ajik

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.990 
theme extremes all right so the an ajik
at<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:45.020> highest<00:02:45.260> alkaline<00:02:45.980> Co<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.880> got

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
at the highest alkaline Co but it got

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.360 
at the highest alkaline Co but it got
out<00:02:47.060> yeah<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:52.810> that's<00:02:53.810> really<00:02:54.500> nice<00:02:54.710> and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
out yeah and that's really nice and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.610 
out yeah and that's really nice and
that's<00:02:55.730> that's<00:02:56.150> gonna<00:02:56.390> be<00:02:56.630> typical<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.410> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
that's that's gonna be typical of the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.070 
that's that's gonna be typical of the
imagine<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:58.310> like<00:02:58.400> eleven<00:02:59.000> point<00:02:59.270> six<00:02:59.540> pH

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
imagine it's like eleven point six pH

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.970 
imagine it's like eleven point six pH
just<00:03:00.860> really<00:03:01.370> awesome<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:03.410> let's<00:03:03.620> see<00:03:03.800> what

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
just really awesome so let's see what

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.600 
just really awesome so let's see what
the<00:03:04.100> Athena<00:03:04.520> got<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.860> know<00:03:06.980> just<00:03:07.280> as<00:03:07.430> I

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
the Athena got and you know just as I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.480 
the Athena got and you know just as I
said<00:03:07.910> isn't<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.900> just<00:03:09.140> isn't<00:03:09.620> quite<00:03:09.920> as<00:03:10.190> strong

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
said isn't it just isn't quite as strong

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.970 
said isn't it just isn't quite as strong
but<00:03:10.850> it's<00:03:11.030> still<00:03:11.330> very<00:03:11.390> strong<00:03:12.170> eleven<00:03:12.770> point

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
but it's still very strong eleven point

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.000 
but it's still very strong eleven point
three<00:03:13.100> pH<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:14.810> quite<00:03:15.080> respectable<00:03:15.830> and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
three pH it's quite respectable and

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.930 
three pH it's quite respectable and
strong<00:03:16.400> pH<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.750> will<00:03:17.980> emulsify<00:03:18.980> oils<00:03:19.700> it'll

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
strong pH that will emulsify oils it'll

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.870 
strong pH that will emulsify oils it'll
do<00:03:20.090> just<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:21.620> know<00:03:21.770> just<00:03:22.190> everything<00:03:22.550> it's
