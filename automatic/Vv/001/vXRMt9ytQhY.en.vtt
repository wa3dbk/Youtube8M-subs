00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
are with the - laser made by code-3 with

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.270 
are with the - laser made by code-3 with
the<00:00:08.790> five<00:00:09.090> flash<00:00:09.389> mirror<00:00:09.800> at<00:00:10.800> night<00:00:13.280> pretty

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the five flash mirror at night pretty

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.040 
the five flash mirror at night pretty
bright

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.029 

there<00:00:24.619> it<00:00:24.710> is<00:00:24.740> from<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.009> side<00:00:26.830> and<00:00:27.830> this<00:00:27.980> is

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
there it is from the side and this is

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:37.030 
there it is from the side and this is
what<00:00:28.250> it<00:00:28.340> looks<00:00:28.460> like<00:00:28.550> with<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:28.759> single<00:00:29.090> flash

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.750 

so<00:00:37.640> free<00:00:37.880> bread<00:00:38.149> on<00:00:38.270> its<00:00:38.420> own

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.350 

and<00:00:43.390> this<00:00:43.570> just<00:00:43.809> has<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.670> black<00:00:45.670> shroud<00:00:46.090> or<00:00:46.270> on

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
and this just has the black shroud or on

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.910 
and this just has the black shroud or on
the<00:00:46.480> back<00:00:46.690> so<00:00:46.960> it<00:00:47.050> doesn't<00:00:47.079> line<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.680> driver

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
the back so it doesn't line the driver

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.890 
the back so it doesn't line the driver
you<00:00:48.550> can<00:00:48.700> see<00:00:48.970> it<00:00:49.059> there<00:00:49.210> bouncing<00:00:49.629> off<00:00:49.720> the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
you can see it there bouncing off the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.069 
you can see it there bouncing off the
a-pillars<00:00:50.350> but<00:00:51.030> as<00:00:52.030> far<00:00:52.239> as<00:00:52.270> it<00:00:52.449> goes<00:00:53.699> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
a-pillars but as far as it goes and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.310 
a-pillars but as far as it goes and
finally<00:00:56.079> here<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.530> on<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:56.710> roof<00:00:56.890> a<00:00:58.320> little

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
finally here it is on the roof a little

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.290 
finally here it is on the roof a little
bit<00:00:59.440> brighter<00:00:59.680> on<00:00:59.890> the<00:00:59.920> roof<00:01:00.160> probably<00:01:01.059> just

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
bit brighter on the roof probably just

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.660 
bit brighter on the roof probably just
because<00:01:01.570> there's<00:01:01.750> no<00:01:02.070> windshield<00:01:03.070> getting<00:01:03.610> in

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
because there's no windshield getting in

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.910 
because there's no windshield getting in
the<00:01:03.790> way

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the way

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.290 
the way
robbing<00:01:05.920> some<00:01:06.100> of<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.250> light<00:01:09.060> looks<00:01:10.060> pretty

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
robbing some of the light looks pretty

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.410 
robbing some of the light looks pretty
good<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:12.580> figured<00:01:12.820> I'd<00:01:12.909> show<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.060> guys<00:01:13.270> what

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
it looks like from inside the car with

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.670 
it looks like from inside the car with
the<00:01:16.420> light<00:01:16.600> on<00:01:16.750> so<00:01:16.930> here<00:01:17.110> it<00:01:17.170> is<00:01:17.259> with<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.440> five

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
the light on so here it is with the five

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.529 
the light on so here it is with the five
flash<00:01:17.950> mirror<00:01:24.000> does<00:01:25.000> that<00:01:25.210> extremely

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
flash mirror does that extremely

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.080 
flash mirror does that extremely
blinding<00:01:26.160> you<00:01:27.160> can<00:01:27.280> still<00:01:27.490> see<00:01:27.670> pretty<00:01:27.850> well

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
blinding you can still see pretty well

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.330 
blinding you can still see pretty well
you<00:01:28.300> can<00:01:28.479> see<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.410> heads-up<00:01:29.740> display<00:01:29.800> there

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
you can see the heads-up display there

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.190 
you can see the heads-up display there
in<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.580> windscreen<00:01:33.820> so<00:01:34.330> it's<00:01:35.110> not

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
in the and the windscreen so it's not

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.350 
in the and the windscreen so it's not
super<00:01:35.380> bright<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:35.979> don't<00:01:36.280> really<00:01:36.550> find<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:36.970> a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
super bright I don't really find it a

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.840 
super bright I don't really find it a
bother<00:01:37.720> while<00:01:38.020> driving<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:39.340> still<00:01:39.640> quite

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
bother while driving it's still quite

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.020 
bother while driving it's still quite
noisy

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.640 

I'm<00:01:43.480> sure<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.750> camera<00:01:44.050> makes<00:01:44.230> it<00:01:44.320> sound<00:01:44.410> a<00:01:44.500> lot

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
I'm sure the camera makes it sound a lot

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.430 
I'm sure the camera makes it sound a lot
louder<00:01:44.830> than<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.370> is<00:01:45.520> on<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:46.570> last<00:01:46.750> video<00:01:47.050> it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
louder than it is on the last video it

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.990 
louder than it is on the last video it
was<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.710> day<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.100> got<00:01:48.370> it<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.700> was<00:01:48.730> a<00:01:48.820> lot

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
was the day that I got it it was a lot

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.420 
was the day that I got it it was a lot
noisier<00:01:49.150> than<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.660> is<00:01:49.780> there<00:01:49.990> now<00:01:50.140> I've<00:01:51.100> had<00:01:51.400> it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
noisier than it is there now I've had it

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.090 
noisier than it is there now I've had it
on<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:51.640> few<00:01:51.880> calls<00:01:52.090> now<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:53.260> seems<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.980> have

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
on a few calls now and it seems to have

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.400 
on a few calls now and it seems to have
quieted<00:01:55.000> down<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.490> there<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:57.700> have<00:01:57.730> it<00:01:58.410> the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
quieted down so there you have it the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.350 
quieted down so there you have it the
code<00:01:59.950> 3<00:02:00.220> -<00:02:00.430> later<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:00.940> highly<00:02:01.870> recommend<00:02:02.260> it
