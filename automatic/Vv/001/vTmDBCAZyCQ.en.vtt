that's the proper way to dismount the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.910 
that's the proper way to dismount the
alternator<00:01:56.930> but<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.229> still<00:01:57.470> have<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:57.860> one

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
alternator but we still have that one

alternator but we still have that one
heavy<00:01:58.340> connector<00:01:58.820> left<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.600> deal<00:01:59.840> with<00:02:00.610> take<00:02:01.610> a

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
heavy connector left to deal with take a

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.249 
heavy connector left to deal with take a
small<00:02:01.940> screwdriver<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.630> push<00:02:03.020> the

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
small screwdriver and push the

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.609 
small screwdriver and push the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
just like so that's gonna expose the nut

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.270

and then we're gonna go ahead and take
that<00:02:10.459> off<00:02:10.610> right<00:02:10.910> now<00:02:30.280> there<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.430> go

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739

take<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:36.950> slip<00:02:37.220> off<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.730> wiring<00:02:38.269> connector

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.810 

just<00:02:42.110> like<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.980> proper<00:02:46.400> way<00:02:46.580> to
