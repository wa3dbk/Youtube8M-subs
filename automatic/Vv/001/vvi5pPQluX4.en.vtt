00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hey people get glock and 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.400
 christmas money video here I show you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.350
 like you from the other 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:14.670
 would throw away and really great 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:16.260
 I want to make toys first 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.150
 show how to swim like that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.460
 I'll do it here, we just take it 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.890
 a few leftovers or now reached 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.140
 for example in a t-shirt and 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.349
 then cuts her from several air 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.150
 boots for infusion from now you can 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.280
 about this fabric last choice the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.809
 Balloons and I find the best 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.640
 the waves is that you open bacher 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.469
 swim and then they themselves 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.670
 of course, support for the eleven 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.899
 to go to the tracks 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.660
 the next one was completely help vogel.de 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.149
 atoms russell but who so lazily fixed 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.559
 to get off the league has a lot better 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.329
 win in the little ones 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.620
 the which I have here now taken the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.820
 it is already a bit too big 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.829
 are still some available for 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.080
 example about algae there you can easily 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.280
 everything first to live or others dry 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.860
 with his club 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.479
 and then try the next one 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.189
 playing time is already for babies 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.460
 a little bit older they are just what they are 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.740
 times a socket for it simply ne dose 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.240
 laid with a foundation and in the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.700
 Lid in a slot or for example 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.460
 also write in the circle so big 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 that the children fits in or in which 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.810
 cold condition 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.210
 everyone here is suitable 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.229
 for example coffee cans milk powder 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.710
 Boden schubste and philipp be the 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.329
 Expensive were also chances to say then 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.970
 Just makes times less right 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.810
 Most solutions and private baths in 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.509
 the other one 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.770
 We simply take 200 milliliters 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.020
 water 60 milliliters baby shampoos and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.369
 triangles syrup and if your sides 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.920
 in bottle is not empty 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.820
 throw away but just the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.979
 Homemade printed on fill 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.860
 the game is a nice word again 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.110
 felt cuts a plastic bottle 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.640
 just a few holes and support fits 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.500
 as well as there are no sharp edges 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.520
 and corners then arise the synergies 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.440
 are reliable 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.150
 now the toy is coming from 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.940
 all 10 toys 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.980
 the mix favorit has made since would 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.349
 easy from hammer and nail and in 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.510
 this is loose in the lid 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.370
 the blanket could now be a package 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.340
 already on road and then you have yours 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.319
 beautiful power make the sail on the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.209
 sharp vital corners on the lids 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.340
 arise when the wine is still row house 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.170
 you can either sand that off 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.670
 But it is a lot of work or you 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.100
 simply knots with the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.410
 packet cord can knot on it 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.120
 then no one will start what the blanket 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.989
 you can of course for this country 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.850
 because we make just the packages 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.370
 how fast tinkering will save me baby 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.900
 race is how we as you can really 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.660
 everything possible introduction of you with 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.660
 Table tennis falls a chestnut walnut 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.740
 now comes a personal favorite 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.440
 Just live a bit hardy and too 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.290
 which degree or in newspapers 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.230
 material, for example, everything clips for this 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.700
 suitable and puts the bag into her 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.430
 great you can then with transparent 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.200
 sticking tape in just what he is sticking 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.360
 Eighth people that the christ fight 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.560
 there are no sharp edges for you 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.850
 do not break 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.260
 then you can for example on the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.760
 stick on the table top or on the floor 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.770
 or if a board like me 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.420
 has done here and you have that 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.530
 nice for chemicals subject to the 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.270
 By the way, even toddlers still 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.300
 find exciting as I noticed recently 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:40.000
 have these toys that can you 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.740
 produce on leftover missing 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.110
 just like with the cover caterpillar easy 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.970
 on a package string or you can 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.890
 even lower-grade, for example, thin 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.890
 then it will be even more beautiful and so on 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.390
 creates a knock or circle ever 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.090
 after knot education together or 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.040
 turnover and for the last player of the 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.870
 The bells are too small, but I can 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.510
 well imagine that older surfaces like that 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.390
 little is find the book easy one 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.130
 few balloons or you maybe 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.050
 still old balloons of one and 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.780
 six games left and is as in 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.980
 big complete there can be 80 times 80 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.770
 centimeters in size 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.230
 this is a very exciting film incentive 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.970
 for the smallest and need here 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.680
 note the balloons is likely 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.390
 not quite blow up otherwise the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.970
 class and then of course that's not 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.620
 that's not how it works 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.720
 Do you have more homemade 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.470
 playing time on the rhine so in the 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.850
 Comments 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.260
 and if no footprints more 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.850
 want to miss and more such 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.540
 we just wanted to subscribe 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.700
 my channel 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.050
 I'm glad that it has to be natural 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.050
 follow until the next one
