00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 in this installment of how to play 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.000
 we'll talk about the movement again 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.740
 and of the three points to do before fashion 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.260
 that is against was his own arc of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.290
 fire against the relative and see if 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.700
 indeed with come bites no ie it is up 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.839
 to us to misinterpret does not mean 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.970
 that you have to continually camp 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.830
 we are talking if we should move yes 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.750
 or not depending on the occasion anyway 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.750
 we'll talk about it in the video theme 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.000
 different and well among the hosting game 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.800
 I'm a jack of hearts and I 'm telling you 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.080
 I'm here today with another episode 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.880
 of how to play this series that 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.410
 we are seeing that you like it today 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.380
 we will also talk once in motion 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 because it is not enough in my opinion not fps in 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.680
 which most of the time is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.000
 moves and then shoots for us that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.820
 we hope more grade contraction there 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.350
 we always move is appropriate beckham for 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.850
 you understand we always move is not that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.830
 they do not speak with pleasure we move 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.960
 always this in my opinion why reduce 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.210
 the single bet movement was a bit 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.220
 reductive so today we have another 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.120
 episode in which we will talk about mine 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.980
 advice 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.960
 before starting a moment 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.390
 hence of these three points which are 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.790
 necessary to pass a right one too 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.650
 very fast depending on the times for 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.530
 decide if and move with can not 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.290
 having said this let's start immediately and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.070
 let's talk about these three points 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.479
 three ideas of advice concepts before 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.460
 movement fraction because as you see it 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.270
 a last episode move test 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.310
 fundamental to move is fundamental 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.520
 these first three points are necessary e 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.200
 just to do when we're in that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.580
 situation of the advantages of which he spoke 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.920
 to the last video then when we are 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.810
 up to safe situations of advantage 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.030
 the opponent and we are covering with one 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.160
 area a playing field or better called 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.810
 killzone then an area in front of us 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.430
 where we should be sure that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.590
 our weapon should harpoon a 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.060
 opponent for one then two there is a bit of 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.180
 see also the typology of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.720
 he said this today let's talk about these 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.970
 three points 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.350
 let's start right away from the first one that is 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.270
 essentially looking at the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.830
 check ahead the area of 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.470
 fire because it is important to check 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.300
 oh well guys there is a fps is a shooter 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.810
 if we do not check at least ahead of us 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.879
 it is not very suitable for non-players 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.170
 that is, check how it is now as not 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.930
 being able to play because we do n't have 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.459
 eyes are therefore essential 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.110
 check several things ahead of us 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.060
 before starting to move almost 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.950
 forward or backward as appropriate 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.349
 what we need to control essentially 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.060
 at the first point we have the availability 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.379
 coverage in that area 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.480
 I give you a very stupid example of 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.990
 a previous episode I have already said but if 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.610
 we have washed it forward 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.740
 but without a cover cause 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.380
 probably that area is a lot 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.690
 dangerous because it is the case but there is 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.700
 re us where we hide help us 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.160
 on the ground it can be an option but 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.450
 let's pretend that battlefield 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.160
 we can not because received the bring 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.900
 so the spain goes therefore we die where 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.580
 be careful if we have in the area 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.170
 of useful covers where to hide 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.390
 so that's the first point on the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.290
 second point you have to think if you have 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.170
 seen or if you think if that area that 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.000
 do to reach is a spot or a 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.980
 hot zone as follow goal then 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.260
 where you can imagine that there is a 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.180
 first opponent of the range then 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.350
 if you know that there is an opponent there for 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.910
 example from that side 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.790
 in that area where interventions on 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.980
 background of the opponent probably if 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.920
 you get cover coverage ok but 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.690
 if he seeing from that side to one 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.000
 better coverage than you 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.680
 face of the stupid I have a tree that 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.280
 it's a cover, a bit of a challenge from us 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.720
 instead a nice car on the ground 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.430
 why car that nice car 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.660
 probably auto covers destroyed 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.310
 my millions so I'm in 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.530
 disadvantage so guess what not 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.200
 you need maurizio at the second point 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.210
 we have the slightest dad this thing a little 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.500
 stupid but there was to repeat it is a 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.840
 player especially good ones 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.220
 look at me map every two seconds or so 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.570
 let's look for why then when he hasn't 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.370
 relieved quite excited is 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.680
 activated politicians but beautiful mom the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.930
 united messina parrot as 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.610
 check it how to look at it then it 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.420
 same in the same way as we do 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.730
 look around 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.220
 we should look at different things he has like 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.260
 always cover areas where 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.030
 this hiding is fundamental not 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.440
 why compare it because it pays you a 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.300
 war game if we don't have a cabbage 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.530
 of a goblin to hide us or that parries 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.330
 partly the blows 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.070
 I've already part of it so we will die so it is 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.320
 important as always check 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.640
 purchased transmit the wall such as 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.049
 I know the wall behind my back 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.970
 these things like that 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.590
 at the second point I have to check how 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.750
 always the enemies so if we see 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.130
 map brought hour to that enemy shoots 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.050
 of that version to that help in 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.930
 that tradition we can decide how 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.040
 move to get around it or to go to it 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.780
 presumably in the face though 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.260
 were I already said that if we are not 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.760
 of volunteers 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.380
 I have to go so if we go in the face 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.120
 probably the enemy will kill us more 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.370
 easily then as always well 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.960
 stem and then the most important point 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.330
 of my work 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.760
 this just pisses me off because 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.740
 everyone does not say it is a certain thing 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.780
 fundamental that is not what it is 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.480
 fundamental for those who say so much to you 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.940
 so many fucking fans count because if there 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.700
 reasoned and really important you have to 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.320
 be with your team 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.150
 friends with whom you are at stake then that 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.470
 I am the guests called in December in 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.570
 the whole affair then some way 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.920
 managed to coordinate them over playing 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.230
 so alone to the hunt 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.550
 you have to stay with our team is the 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.290
 fundamental thing but because the boys 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.500
 because he only had to show some 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.360
 Quick clips below if I'm from 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.490
 only the pro player can also be 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.350
 better than the world and against four 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.000
 enemies 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.010
 understand that I am not at an advantage I could 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.800
 even make it to everyone forlì with 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.500
 a beautiful absolute regatta can happen is 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.150
 the thing that leaves a lot however a lot 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.250
 often given from first time will be 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.420
 difficult that we win 4 against 1 3 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.310
 against 1 also of tax payers 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.790
 difficult at the beginning so it can happen 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.550
 for example on bf we pretend 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.410
 I die just in case the kindly mailed friend yes 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.000
 pull up or else it can happen that up 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.540
 we are with three people in the same 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.030
 area 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.860
 luis acidato the opponent comes out and I do it 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.040
 i kill because i saw it so it is not 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.020
 so much because the pro player ban on their own 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.670
 they all certainly do so then 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.740
 first thing very fine to go it alone 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.540
 because guys I do it too though 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.000
 when we are a little early or 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.830
 we are a bit in critical areas is good 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.870
 to always be with someone who was not 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.450
 ally friend ok you need to talk to us 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.250
 the importance would be because 2 4 8 10 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.530
 eyes always look better than one is 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.900
 a fundamental thing therefore came to the 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.820
 most salient point of all that is but 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.310
 I should move this one thing 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.840
 quite stupid there is actually not 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.870
 I needed to do this point 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.750
 but I like the idea of ​​remembering 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.670
 make some remark discover 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.160
 underline what we already have 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.960
 that is to say, I should move there vi 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.790
 let me give an example then go to the 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.140
 left there is no enemy the area is 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.820
 quiet there are walls of 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.590
 little stones and so on 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.780
 my friends you are going more or less 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.370
 I move but where am I actually going 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.800
 that I make you a goal 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.180
 thus returning to meaningless sentences or to 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.740
 example I 'm my base I'm doing the 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.510
 demented that is the boys you always have to 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.760
 think about where you are going ie 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.100
 move towards a goal that is a 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.750
 2000 opponent who both circumvent them and 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.670
 is a goal that you know I know one 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.350
 bomb to place must always think of 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.140
 where he is returning I give an example 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.990
 stupid if I'm covering the area and I have 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.490
 before me 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.690
 I assume 34 enemies because i probably 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.820
 their shores come from that side there 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.190
 probably only 34 because yes 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.410
 they are moved by the mini map understood 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.150
 that if I go on let's pretend it is not 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.730
 not even the covers look for death 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.560
 so in that case it is favored in 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.330
 some in some way remain still 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.640
 wait for your opponents to kill them then 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.460
 move or maybe even better 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.080
 well, run away running for it 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.300
 look for a new spot for example 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.340
 make you more stupid I 'm in front of you 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.570
 sure as I said before four 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.630
 against one for how much better position 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.190
 can be dangerous and to the boxes i 

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.300
 I make the rounds then come forward 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.830
 photos from away from which photos of the side 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.390
 so as it said the other time it seems 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.310
 in advantage because as I said in the 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.310
 last episode and series where trust
