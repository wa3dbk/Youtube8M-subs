00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
Canelo before cooled off my quinella

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.630 
Canelo before cooled off my quinella
would<00:03:33.560> even<00:03:33.799> oh<00:03:34.180> no<00:03:35.180> what

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
would even oh no what

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.460 
would even oh no what
Canelo<00:03:38.630> definitely<00:03:39.020> doesn't<00:03:39.170> want<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.410> fight

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
Canelo definitely doesn't want to fight

Canelo definitely doesn't want to fight
me<00:03:39.620> with<00:03:39.770> i<00:03:40.040> think<00:03:40.430> nevel's<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:41.000> hell<00:03:41.120> of<00:03:41.150> a

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
me with i think nevel's a hell of a

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.210 
me with i think nevel's a hell of a
fighter<00:03:41.480> but<00:03:41.959> i<00:03:42.200> guess<00:03:42.770> maybe<00:03:42.920> whether<00:03:43.130> I

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
fighter but i guess maybe whether I

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.350 
fighter but i guess maybe whether I
think<00:03:43.370> Mayweather<00:03:43.490> is<00:03:43.670> too<00:03:43.819> much<00:03:44.000> from<00:03:44.150> right

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
think Mayweather is too much from right

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.449 
think Mayweather is too much from right
now<00:03:44.480> at<00:03:45.050> 154<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:45.770> would<00:03:46.130> be<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.220> good<00:03:46.340> fight

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
now at 154 that would be a good fight

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.860 
now at 154 that would be a good fight
that'll<00:03:46.730> be<00:03:46.790> Mayweather's<00:03:46.970> third<00:03:47.420> fight<00:03:47.630> I

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
that'll be Mayweather's third fight I

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.220 
that'll be Mayweather's third fight I
154<00:03:48.830> against<00:03:49.100> another<00:03:49.340> champ<00:03:49.640> but<00:03:50.240> that'll<00:03:51.170> be

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
154 against another champ but that'll be

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.270 
154 against another champ but that'll be
a<00:03:51.260> tough<00:03:51.319> fight<00:03:51.650> but<00:03:51.860> I<00:03:51.920> think<00:03:52.100> Mayweather

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
a tough fight but I think Mayweather

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.930 
a tough fight but I think Mayweather
technical<00:03:53.030> wise<00:03:53.920> Canelo<00:03:54.920> cannot<00:03:55.280> allow<00:03:55.700> box

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
technical wise Canelo cannot allow box

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.020
