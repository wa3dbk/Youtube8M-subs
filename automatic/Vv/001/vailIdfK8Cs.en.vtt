persistent I guess you could say see
gravity<00:01:31.409> will<00:01:31.650> always<00:01:31.860> take<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.490> my

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
gravity will always take it so that's my

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.399 
gravity will always take it so that's my
point<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.299> unscripted<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.259> whole
