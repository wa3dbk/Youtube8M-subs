00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the bat brings a kind of an odd angle

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.120 
the bat brings a kind of an odd angle
plus<00:01:39.689> we're<00:01:39.869> not<00:01:39.990> reaching<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.619> frame<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.100> a

comes with spacers to help level off the
spring<00:01:45.180> assembly<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:45.750> needed<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
spring assembly as needed in this

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.499 
spring assembly as needed in this
situation<00:01:47.460> we're<00:01:47.579> going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.880> use<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
situation we're going to use the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.170 
situation we're going to use the
one-inch<00:01:48.869> step<00:01:49.320> right<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> think<00:01:51.090> it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
one-inch step right here and I think it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.120 
one-inch step right here and I think it
looks<00:01:51.299> pretty<00:01:52.110> close<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> even<00:01:52.530> level<00:01:52.950> right

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
looks pretty close to even level right

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.679 
looks pretty close to even level right
here<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.640> drips<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.030> rolled<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> back

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
here the drips down rolled in the back

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.060 
here the drips down rolled in the back
that's<00:01:54.899> fine<00:01:55.110> because<00:01:55.259> once<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.649> weights<00:01:55.860> on

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
that's fine because once the weights on

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.319 
that's fine because once the weights on
the<00:01:56.250> truck<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.759> springs<00:01:57.180> will

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the truck is on the springs will

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.640 
the truck is on the springs will
actually<00:01:57.570> come<00:01:57.689> back<00:01:57.869> up<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.170> little<00:01:58.350> bit<00:01:58.469> too

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
actually come back up a little bit too

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.250 
actually come back up a little bit too
okay<00:02:00.370> so<00:02:00.640> we're<00:02:00.970> okay<00:02:01.240> with<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.600> setup<00:02:01.840> on<00:02:02.110> the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
okay so we're okay with the setup on the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.580 
okay so we're okay with the setup on the
bottom<00:02:02.560> of<00:02:02.830> our<00:02:03.160> airbag<00:02:04.290> alright<00:02:05.290> next<00:02:05.440> I'm

frame right drill four holes out we will
go<00:02:11.410> ahead<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.620> add<00:02:11.770> a<00:02:11.800> little<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.100> air<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.460> the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
go ahead and add a little the air to the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.980 
go ahead and add a little the air to the
bag<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.000> stretch<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.360> out<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.690> little<00:02:13.720> bit

bag so stretch it out just a little bit

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.440 
bag so stretch it out just a little bit
just<00:02:14.920> enough<00:02:15.070> for<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.520> get<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.700> job<00:02:15.910> done<00:02:15.940> and

just enough for to get the job done and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.240 
just enough for to get the job done and
then<00:02:17.110> we'll<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.590> work<00:02:17.770> for<00:02:17.800> some

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
then we'll have to do the work for some

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.070 
then we'll have to do the work for some
be<00:02:18.340> easier<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.670> mark<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.090> drill<00:02:19.120> our<00:02:19.390> holes<00:02:19.570> to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
be easier to mark and drill our holes to

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.000 
be easier to mark and drill our holes to
inflate<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.530> bag

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
inflate the bag

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.260 
inflate the bag
we're<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.460> just<00:02:21.550> run<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.790> small<00:02:22.090> piece<00:02:22.240> of

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
we're going to just run a small piece of

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.240 
we're going to just run a small piece of
airline<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:23.020> use<00:02:23.170> our<00:02:23.290> valve<00:02:23.530> just<00:02:23.980> hold

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
airline and use our valve just hold

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
inside there's a good spot to show you

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.100 
inside there's a good spot to show you
where<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.760> how<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.880> line<00:02:28.210> hooks<00:02:28.510> up<00:02:28.660> into<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
where and how the line hooks up into the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.990 
where and how the line hooks up into the
valves<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:30.040> will<00:02:30.160> make<00:02:30.310> sure<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> disc

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
valves you will make sure of it the disc

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.030 
valves you will make sure of it the disc
cut<00:02:31.240> here<00:02:31.570> as<00:02:31.690> square<00:02:32.200> as<00:02:32.230> possible<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.860> sharp

and clean and all you do really is you
just<00:02:35.350> push<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.710> into<00:02:36.250> place<00:02:36.490> until<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.210> stops

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
just push it into place until it stops

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.260 
just push it into place until it stops
and<00:02:38.070> pull<00:02:39.070> back<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.430> little<00:02:39.550> bit<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.580> locks

take this end and apply to our elbow on
top<00:02:58.290> I'm<00:02:59.290> gonna<00:02:59.380> put<00:02:59.530> some<00:02:59.650> air<00:02:59.740> to<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.040> run<00:03:00.550> up

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
top I'm gonna put some air to it run up

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.830 
top I'm gonna put some air to it run up
again<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.030> don't<00:03:01.090> want<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.300> put<00:03:01.450> too<00:03:01.570> much<00:03:01.690> and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
know all we're going to do is hold this

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.050 
know all we're going to do is hold this
up<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.590> little<00:03:08.800> bit<00:03:08.920> more<00:03:09.130> make<00:03:09.550> sure<00:03:09.700> we<00:03:09.880> stay

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
up a little bit more make sure we stay

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.699 
up a little bit more make sure we stay
away<00:03:10.090> from<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.450> curve<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.260> steel<00:03:11.500> right

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
away from the curve of the steel right

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.680 
away from the curve of the steel right
here<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.280> we<00:03:12.340> can<00:03:12.489> have<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> plenty<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.510> room<00:03:13.660> for

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
here so we can have a plenty of room for

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.780 
here so we can have a plenty of room for
a<00:03:13.900> washer<00:03:14.350> this<00:03:14.709> washer<00:03:15.040> here<00:03:15.220> will<00:03:15.580> actually

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
a washer this washer here will actually

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.580 
a washer this washer here will actually
go<00:03:15.880> on<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.000> inside<00:03:16.420> but<00:03:16.870> we're<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.110> flange<00:03:17.380> nut

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
go on the inside but we're a flange nut

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.010 
go on the inside but we're a flange nut
goes<00:03:18.030> will<00:03:19.030> be<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> good<00:03:19.239> idea<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.750> take<00:03:19.870> this

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
goes will be a good idea to take this

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.900 
goes will be a good idea to take this
washer<00:03:20.470> put<00:03:20.800> it<00:03:20.920> behind<00:03:21.010> our<00:03:21.400> bracket<00:03:21.790> right

now<00:03:22.120> use<00:03:22.780> as<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.959> gauge<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.380> tell<00:03:23.410> us<00:03:23.620> how<00:03:23.800> far<00:03:23.980> up

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
now use as a gauge to tell us how far up

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.910 
now use as a gauge to tell us how far up
we<00:03:24.220> need<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.430> go<00:03:25.080> so<00:03:26.080> a<00:03:26.110> washer<00:03:26.410> will<00:03:26.560> sit<00:03:26.680> flat

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
we need to go so a washer will sit flat

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.860 
we need to go so a washer will sit flat

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
springs clamp on the bottom side we'll

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.619 
springs clamp on the bottom side we'll
sit<00:04:41.780> like<00:04:41.930> just<00:04:42.229> like<00:04:42.379> this<00:04:46.210> will<00:04:47.210> drop<00:04:47.479> our

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:47.629 
sit like just like this will drop our

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:49.270 
sit like just like this will drop our
bolts<00:04:47.900> through<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.530> we<00:04:48.680> can<00:04:48.710> clamp<00:04:49.069> it<00:04:49.159> to

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
bolts through and we can clamp it to

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.700 
bolts through and we can clamp it to
this<00:04:49.400> top<00:04:49.639> overload<00:04:50.120> spring<00:04:50.419> right<00:04:50.569> here<00:04:50.710> you

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
this top overload spring right here you

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.279 
this top overload spring right here you
can<00:04:52.009> go<00:04:52.159> to<00:04:52.219> the<00:04:52.400> bottom<00:04:52.580> however<00:04:53.060> over<00:04:54.020> time<00:04:54.050> I

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
can go to the bottom however over time I

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.379 
can go to the bottom however over time I
would<00:04:54.560> think<00:04:54.770> these<00:04:55.520> Springs<00:04:55.879> will<00:04:56.090> compress

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
would think these Springs will compress

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.570 
would think these Springs will compress
up<00:04:56.569> down<00:04:56.830> enough<00:04:57.830> where<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:58.099> could<00:04:58.279> shift

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
up down enough where it could shift

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.369 
up down enough where it could shift
around<00:04:58.879> and<00:04:59.210> might<00:04:59.479> possibly<00:04:59.840> damage

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
around and might possibly damage

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.200 
around and might possibly damage
something<00:05:00.620> on<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.430> airbag<00:05:01.699> itself<00:05:02.060> might

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
something on the airbag itself might

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.279 
something on the airbag itself might
come<00:05:02.419> out<00:05:02.539> of<00:05:02.629> alignment<00:05:02.779> so<00:05:03.080> we're<00:05:03.199> actually

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
come out of alignment so we're actually

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.260 
come out of alignment so we're actually
going<00:05:03.770> clamp<00:05:04.069> it<00:05:04.189> to<00:05:04.310> this<00:05:04.430> part<00:05:04.699> right<00:05:04.849> here

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
going clamp it to this part right here

going clamp it to this part right here
of<00:05:05.689> the<00:05:05.840> helper<00:05:06.169> spring<00:05:06.439> itself<00:05:06.740> it's<00:05:07.370> okay<00:05:07.639> to

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
of the helper spring itself it's okay to

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.390 
of the helper spring itself it's okay to
do<00:05:07.909> that<00:05:08.120> is<00:05:08.360> an<00:05:08.840> instruction<00:05:09.289> states<00:05:09.590> however

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
do that is an instruction states however

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.399 
do that is an instruction states however
the<00:05:10.520> bolt<00:05:10.699> is<00:05:10.879> like<00:05:11.060> really<00:05:11.509> long<00:05:11.779> if<00:05:12.259> we're

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
under our angle piece or elbow we're

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.440 
under our angle piece or elbow we're
going<00:06:21.930> to<00:06:21.990> push<00:06:22.140> that<00:06:22.170> in<00:06:23.060> and<00:06:24.060> then<00:06:24.210> once<00:06:24.360> you

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
going to push that in and then once you

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.090 
going to push that in and then once you
just<00:06:24.660> rest<00:06:25.170> of<00:06:25.290> it<00:06:25.350> out<00:06:25.470> now<00:06:25.740> we're<00:06:25.890> going<00:06:26.040> to

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
just rest of it out now we're going to

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.320 
just rest of it out now we're going to
go<00:06:26.190> ahead<00:06:26.250> and<00:06:26.430> mark<00:06:26.550> out<00:06:26.700> the<00:06:26.790> holes<00:06:27.000> for<00:06:27.180> our

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
go ahead and mark out the holes for our

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.110 
go ahead and mark out the holes for our
air<00:06:27.480> valves<00:06:27.960> for<00:06:28.740> our<00:06:28.920> air<00:06:29.040> bags<00:06:29.280> and<00:06:29.550> I<00:06:29.970> think

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
air valves for our air bags and I think

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.940 
air valves for our air bags and I think
we're<00:06:30.210> going<00:06:30.300> to<00:06:30.360> put<00:06:31.320> a<00:06:31.410> hole<00:06:31.590> about<00:06:31.770> right

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
we're going to put a hole about right

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.290 
we're going to put a hole about right
here<00:06:32.220> in<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:32.520> corner<00:06:32.730> of<00:06:32.910> the<00:06:32.970> license<00:06:33.270> plate

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
here in the corner of the license plate

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.610 
here in the corner of the license plate
there's<00:06:34.020> a<00:06:34.080> little<00:06:34.230> valve<00:06:34.380> will<00:06:34.530> get

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
there's a little valve will get

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.170 
there's a little valve will get
installed<00:06:34.950> I<00:06:35.160> think<00:06:35.460> we<00:06:35.580> use<00:06:35.760> one<00:06:36.030> of<00:06:36.090> the

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
installed I think we use one of the

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.970 
installed I think we use one of the
washers<00:06:36.570> that<00:06:36.780> come<00:06:36.930> with<00:06:37.080> it<00:06:37.110> as<00:06:37.530> a<00:06:37.590> guide<00:06:37.950> to

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
washers that come with it as a guide to

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.210 
washers that come with it as a guide to
mark<00:06:38.940> your<00:06:39.060> hole<00:06:39.210> and<00:06:39.450> of<00:06:39.900> course<00:06:40.110> you'll<00:06:41.040> make
