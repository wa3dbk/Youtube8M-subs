what's<00:00:01.260> up<00:00:01.350> guys<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:02.070> VFX<00:00:02.429> spread<00:00:02.639> coming

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
what's up guys is the VFX spread coming

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.100 
what's up guys is the VFX spread coming
from<00:00:02.939> behind-the-scenes<00:00:03.540> video

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
from behind-the-scenes video

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.240 
from behind-the-scenes video
now<00:00:04.230> in<00:00:04.319> this<00:00:04.410> video<00:00:04.529> we<00:00:04.710> decided<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.100> switch

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
now in this video we decided to switch

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.190 
now in this video we decided to switch
up<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.549> little<00:00:05.730> bit<00:00:05.879> where<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.120> was<00:00:06.509> actually<00:00:06.779> in

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
up a little bit where I was actually in

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.740 
up a little bit where I was actually in
the<00:00:07.350> video<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.940> Eric<00:00:08.940> was<00:00:09.030> behind<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.420> camera

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
the video and Eric was behind the camera

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.240 
the video and Eric was behind the camera
filming<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.260> originally<00:00:10.769> thought<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.130> idea

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
filming I originally thought this idea

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.980 
filming I originally thought this idea
when<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.670> was<00:00:11.759> singing<00:00:11.910> about<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.300> processes

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
when I was singing about the processes

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.660 
when I was singing about the processes
of<00:00:13.170> doing<00:00:13.469> visual<00:00:13.799> effects<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.280> how<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.400> add

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
of doing visual effects and how you add

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.129 
of doing visual effects and how you add
in<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> stock<00:00:15.299> footage<00:00:15.509> or<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:15.990> do<00:00:16.109> a

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
in the stock footage or you do a

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.500 
in the stock footage or you do a
simulation<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.369> add<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.090> just

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
simulation and you add it in I just

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.359 
simulation and you add it in I just
thought<00:00:18.600> how<00:00:18.720> cool<00:00:18.930> would<00:00:18.990> be<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.800> add<00:00:19.980> in

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
thought how cool would be to add in

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.460 
thought how cool would be to add in
these<00:00:20.580> elements<00:00:21.240> as<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.900> video<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.140> playing

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
these elements as the video is playing

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710 
these elements as the video is playing
out<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.710> real<00:00:23.130> time<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.970> my<00:00:24.210> main<00:00:24.359> idea<00:00:24.600> was

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
out in real time and my main idea was

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.269 
out in real time and my main idea was
that<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.199> saw<00:00:25.350> at<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> end<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.039> 3d

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
that what you saw at the end with the 3d

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.460 
that what you saw at the end with the 3d
explosion<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.029> how<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.420> camera<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:28.109> able<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
explosion and how the camera was able to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.109 
explosion and how the camera was able to
rotate<00:00:28.769> around<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.580> was<00:00:29.699> messing<00:00:30.029> around

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
rotate around it as I was messing around

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.240 
rotate around it as I was messing around
and<00:00:30.390> adding<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> elements<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.189> I

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and adding the elements in just like I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.860 
and adding the elements in just like I
do<00:00:32.430> when<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> work<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.030> these<00:00:33.210> visual<00:00:33.540> effects

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
do when I work with these visual effects

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.290 
do when I work with these visual effects
so<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.500> effect<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:34.950> got<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> harness<00:00:35.610> which

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
so do this effect we got a harness which

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.049 
so do this effect we got a harness which
we<00:00:36.510> strap<00:00:37.170> Justin<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.860> we<00:00:38.489> also<00:00:38.640> had<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
we strap Justin in and we also had to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.380 
we strap Justin in and we also had to
get<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> rope<00:00:39.719> which<00:00:40.559> our<00:00:40.710> friend<00:00:40.950> Gavin<00:00:41.390> was

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
get a rope which our friend Gavin was

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.279 
get a rope which our friend Gavin was
kind<00:00:42.600> enough<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> climb<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> very<00:00:43.800> high<00:00:44.010> tree<00:00:44.370> to

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
kind enough to climb a very high tree to

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.720 
kind enough to climb a very high tree to
to<00:00:46.289> wrap<00:00:46.590> around<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.489> could<00:00:47.610> have

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
to wrap around so that we could have

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.389 
to wrap around so that we could have
Justin<00:00:48.239> dangle<00:00:48.780> from<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> tree<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.100> we

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
Justin dangle from the tree as we

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.029 
Justin dangle from the tree as we
progress<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.940> shot<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.649> because<00:00:52.890> that's

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
progress with a shot and because that's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.470 
progress with a shot and because that's
the<00:00:53.160> biggest<00:00:53.309> VFX<00:00:53.699> shot<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> be

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the biggest VFX shot I'm going to be

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.270 
the biggest VFX shot I'm going to be
talking<00:00:54.660> about<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> most<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.100> first

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
talking about that the most so the first

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.439 
talking about that the most so the first
thing<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> original<00:00:57.149> footage

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
thing we have is the original footage

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.000 
thing we have is the original footage
and<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.899> said<00:00:57.960> Justin<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.649> trying<00:00:58.890> his

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and like I said Justin was trying his

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.310 
and like I said Justin was trying his
best<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.370> keep<00:00:59.579> stable<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.300> look<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.170> though

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
best to keep stable and look as though

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.900 
best to keep stable and look as though
he's<00:01:01.530> frozen<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.010> time<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:02.579> as<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.730> play

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
he's frozen in time now as we play

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.789 
he's frozen in time now as we play
through<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.629> walk<00:01:03.870> over<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
through you can see I walk over and I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.100 
through you can see I walk over and I
swipe<00:01:05.339> over<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.420> was<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> simple

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
swipe over and this was just a simple

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
swipe over and this was just a simple
anima<00:01:07.439> 2d<00:01:07.770> animation<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> made<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.820> After

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
anima 2d animation I made in After

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.060 
anima 2d animation I made in After
Effects<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.659> added<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.500> some<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> stock

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
Effects and added in some of the stock

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.530 
Effects and added in some of the stock
footage<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.610> when<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.850> drag<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.270> over<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
footage and when I drag it over I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.660 
footage and when I drag it over I
applied<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> grid<00:01:13.710> effect<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.340> make<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> look

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
applied a grid effect to make it look

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.640 
applied a grid effect to make it look
like<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> was<00:01:15.030> almost<00:01:15.360> loading<00:01:15.930> initializing

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
like it was almost loading initializing

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.649 
like it was almost loading initializing
it<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.040> drag<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> over<00:01:17.610> onto<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> ground<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it as I drag it over onto the ground and

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.600 
it as I drag it over onto the ground and
adding<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.290> quick<00:01:19.500> grid<00:01:19.860> wipe<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.250> make<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.460> look

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
adding a quick grid wipe to make it look

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.480 
adding a quick grid wipe to make it look
like<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.000> tracked<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.110> scene<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.680> track<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
like it tracked the scene and track the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.240 
like it tracked the scene and track the
geometry<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:24.960> able<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.320> put<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
geometry and then I was able to put in a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
geometry and then I was able to put in a
simulation<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.090> made<00:01:27.330> from<00:01:27.750> fume<00:01:28.110> effects

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
simulation I made from fume effects

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350 
simulation I made from fume effects
which<00:01:28.860> was<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.400> smoke<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.939> then

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
which was just the smoke and then

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.999 
which was just the smoke and then
tracked<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.869> footage<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.320> had<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.650> 3d

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
tracked in the footage I had this 3d

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.550 
tracked in the footage I had this 3d
smoke<00:01:32.700> plume<00:01:33.090> which<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.049> able<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
smoke plume which I was then able to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
smoke plume which I was then able to
render<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.920> as<00:01:35.040> e-pass<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.820> put<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.390> other

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
render out as e-pass and put in other

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
render out as e-pass and put in other
elements<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.320> real<00:01:37.650> stock<00:01:38.130> footage<00:01:38.310> that's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
elements like real stock footage that's

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.270 
elements like real stock footage that's
only<00:01:38.820> 2d<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> smoke<00:01:41.040> it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
only 2d but because in the smoke it

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399 
only 2d but because in the smoke it
looks<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.640> though<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.150> 3d<00:01:42.630> now<00:01:43.079> same<00:01:43.259> goes

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
looks as though it is 3d now same goes

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.020 
looks as though it is 3d now same goes
with<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.590> lot<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.100> lot<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> other<00:01:44.640> effects

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
with a lot of a lot of the other effects

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.749 
with a lot of a lot of the other effects
such<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.890> dirt<00:01:46.890> hits<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> muzzle

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
such as the dirt hits in the muzzle

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.240 
such as the dirt hits in the muzzle
flare<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.420> those<00:01:48.630> are<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.840> 2d<00:01:49.500> elements<00:01:49.649> no

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
flare but those are just 2d elements no

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.899 
flare but those are just 2d elements no
fume<00:01:50.880> effects<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.420> no<00:01:51.630> 3d<00:01:52.229> required<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:53.670> the

with<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> muzzle<00:01:55.049> flare<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.229> actually<00:01:55.619> added<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
with a muzzle flare I actually added a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.639 
with a muzzle flare I actually added a
front<00:01:56.880> muzzle<00:01:57.119> flare<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:58.049> side<00:01:58.290> muzzle

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
front muzzle flare and a side muzzle

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.980 
front muzzle flare and a side muzzle
flare<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.420> rotate<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.540> front<00:02:00.630> muzzle<00:02:00.869> flare

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
flare and rotate the front muzzle flare

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.719 
flare and rotate the front muzzle flare
90<00:02:01.320> degrees<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:02.009> make<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.219> look<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.579> though

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
90 degrees to make it look as though

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.300 
90 degrees to make it look as though
it's<00:02:02.880> 3d<00:02:03.240> from<00:02:03.420> certain<00:02:03.840> angles<00:02:04.320> when<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.040> apply

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it's 3d from certain angles when I apply

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.010 
it's 3d from certain angles when I apply
the<00:02:05.369> proper<00:02:05.820> amount<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.030> glow<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.810> make<00:02:06.930> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
the proper amount of glow to make it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.630 
the proper amount of glow to make it
look<00:02:07.170> realistic<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.920> takes<00:02:08.220> away<00:02:08.399> from<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
look realistic it takes away from the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.449 
look realistic it takes away from the
hard<00:02:08.849> edges<00:02:09.090> which<00:02:09.539> make<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.810> look

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
hard edges which make it look

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.729 
hard edges which make it look
