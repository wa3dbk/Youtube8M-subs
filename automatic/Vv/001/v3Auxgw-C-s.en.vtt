you<00:00:11.219> could<00:00:11.400> try<00:00:11.610> waiting<00:00:12.120> for<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.360> game<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
you could try waiting for the game to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.570 
you could try waiting for the game to
finish<00:00:12.990> installing<00:00:13.590> before<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.280> start

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
finish installing before you start

finish installing before you start
playing<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.199> hard<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.730> console

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
playing that is so hard is the console

playing that is so hard is the console
grinding<00:00:18.600> if<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.160> problem<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
grinding if so the problem is the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.720 
grinding if so the problem is the
optical<00:00:21.449> drive<00:00:21.800> I've<00:00:22.800> heard<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.250> called<00:00:23.490> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
optical drive I've heard it called the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.330 
optical drive I've heard it called the
grinding<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.269> death<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.680> optical<00:00:25.859> drive

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
grinding of death if the optical drive

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.849 
grinding of death if the optical drive
is<00:00:26.760> malfunctioning<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.840> won't<00:00:28.260> read<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> disk

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
is malfunctioning it won't read the disk

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.910 
is malfunctioning it won't read the disk
and<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.699> won't<00:00:29.939> install<00:00:30.560> what<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> is

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
and then it won't install what if it is

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.580 
and then it won't install what if it is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
discs to see if the problem is the first

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.920 
discs to see if the problem is the first
disc<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.469> disk<00:00:37.770> drive<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
disc or the disk drive I do not have the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.380 
disc or the disk drive I do not have the
problem<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> discs<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.820> sometimes

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
problem on all the discs but sometimes

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.110 
problem on all the discs but sometimes
see<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.739> use<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.160> those<00:00:44.340> disk<00:00:44.640> cleaners

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
see it so use one of those disk cleaners

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.479 
see it so use one of those disk cleaners
to<00:00:45.600> clean<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.079> gunk<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.500> dirt<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> inside

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
to clean the gunk and dirt on the inside

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.819 
to clean the gunk and dirt on the inside
of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.760> machine<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.390> may<00:00:49.320> clean<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
of the machine that may clean the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
of the machine that may clean the
optical<00:00:50.370> head<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.730> guts<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> console<00:00:51.780> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
optical head and guts of the console so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.930 
optical head and guts of the console so
it<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.469> likely<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.070> read<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.430> disk<00:00:53.640> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
it is more likely to read the disk so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.180 
it is more likely to read the disk so
you<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.239> play<00:00:54.449> I've<00:00:55.440> heard<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> could<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you can play I've heard it could be a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.760 
you can play I've heard it could be a
network<00:00:56.460> connection<00:00:57.109> you<00:00:58.109> could<00:00:58.320> check<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
network connection you could check to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.069 
network connection you could check to
make<00:00:58.890> sure<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.370> Wi-Fi<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.850> working<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
make sure the Wi-Fi is working and that

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.990 
make sure the Wi-Fi is working and that
it<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.530> slowed<00:01:01.859> down<00:01:02.160> by<00:01:02.399> someone<00:01:02.850> else

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it is not slowed down by someone else

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.750 
it is not slowed down by someone else
downloading<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> movie<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:05.040> make<00:01:05.339> sure<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
system is connected to the network it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.039 
system is connected to the network it
cannot<00:01:17.490> load<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> game<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.390> communicate
