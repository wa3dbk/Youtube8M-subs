00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.739
 God arranges the selection then we go to London Â» 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:04.890
 not personally 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.720
 around 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.720
 that my experiences are easy on them 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.699
 the exact volume too 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.550
 to take part in a small planet in our world under conditions 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
 August select misses 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 forward 5 percent 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.920
 yes this is our friend 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.080
 probably will not be easy to come to the space port of IZ now 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.840
 I'm not right in the back 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.420
 I do not feel a disturbance here and on the plan also I treasures 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.559
 This blockade is a symptom of much bigger problems 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.460
 we will know soon 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.140
 I am just receiving a message from someone so I can stand still 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.690
 becomes 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.430
 more 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.430
 more 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.130
 another place in the clinics every 20 was not good 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.540
 how complex air 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.160
 so discuss aesthetic 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.420
 it was 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.890
 something like that has happened already we can become or start and us 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.620
 imputed on these zones 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.960
 his decision 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.320
 I'm all very sad about the business 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.070
 because that is now funny the Carmelites introduces with inheritance 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.770
 that pull our lessons 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.770
 his supporters 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.480
 Bundesliga ladies run 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.929
 that hits the nerve 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.929
 not yet he is not a bad food 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.979
 this is supposed to be a chasm 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.709
 that's it 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.979
 but what do you actually do that they are not good anymore 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.669
 I'm really not a spoilsport but we have to reap now I'm going 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.999
 on these hums and down 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.999
 why some rounds 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 It will be exciting again 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.419
 Get lots 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.649
 been weird in the terrain 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.329
 that looks like a little bit 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.579
 Case is 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.579
 right is speaking 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.739
 at least maybe yes 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.939
 because this is already here 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.799
 or something like that 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.799
 the interval at the place 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.079
 only once i wish i ever wanted to see us but no 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.149
 if you do not give us any data on your temples visit us 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.489
 to join 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.299
 I was so badly damaged it is only slightly damaged 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.979
 nothing serious 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:28.489
 I consider their repair all unimportant system for the 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.479
 next goals 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.519
 Brussels wants value looks like one of Mondeo's other but I know 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.350
 not what 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.820
 Knut young Lundberg I have the remains of an old outpost nearby 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.119
 lowered 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:44.979
 maybe the goals set are not 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:48.519
 that could only have been a victory in here there were no settlements 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.339
 this direction is likely to change 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:56.369
 where the conclusion stand kick off that is just fine 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.529
 Here began the crusade of the man of the loyal against the republic 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.119
 the rights of the Focus 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:05.819
 The IT has discovered military costs 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.079
 We should be on the alert here, because you can mix Gloria with him 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.029
 started 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:16.549
 does not look like a battlefield much is buried here and much 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.789
 should also stay buried 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.189
 enough how far can we go as long as the ship is not repaired 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:28.229
 in the first ten if I find another way to London 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:28.910
 stuck here 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.919
 maybe there is another way night hikers 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.070
 the power has brought us here for a reason we should 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.680
 explore surroundings 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.139
 is something 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.789
 Florian Mayer is really something 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.259
 predators 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.129
 big sneaky greedy caterpillar pulls anyway we should the environment 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.439
 explore 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:54.439
 unlike the protests beginning 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.830
 It is not a good idea to be young 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.499
 to go alone writes one after another 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:04.830
 especially if there is no reason Evita looks different from his mouth 

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:08.680
 No offense if we want one another and leave this courage 

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:09.319
 more 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.770
 we are each other and see 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.469
 we landed here for a reason 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.710
 that's for sure 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.710
 okay genes okay but be careful 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:22.829
 you never know who else has crashed here I have the feeling 

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:26.120
 that the ship will not be repaired until we are done 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.539
 I have clearly expressed myself Dr understand 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.279
 This is very important in this nonsense here, which you harm the loyal 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.309
 once he had ever fought 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:39.150
 he has to see some things 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.969
 he fought her 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.809
 that's why he said nothing about it ddp he about an old box 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:50.030
 some of them do not never eat better today 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.439
 free newsletter 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.089
 okay percent 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:58.299
 But that was the next time that was so that you again for space too 

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:00.860
 Rolf Erb will be possible 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.800
