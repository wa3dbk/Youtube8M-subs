00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
like I didn't think my archers and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.220 
like I didn't think my archers and
warriors<00:02:18.310> would<00:02:18.550> do<00:02:18.790> much<00:02:19.030> damage<00:02:19.330> but

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
warriors would do much damage but

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.440 
warriors would do much damage but
they're<00:02:20.350> actually<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.740> pretty<00:02:21.220> good

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
they're actually a pretty good

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.910 
they're actually a pretty good
way<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.510> get<00:02:24.129> money<00:02:25.129> I<00:02:25.659> first<00:02:26.659> learned<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.560> to

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
way to get money I first learned this to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.509 
way to get money I first learned this to
use<00:02:28.099> archers<00:02:28.639> and<00:02:29.590> whatever<00:02:30.590> from<00:02:31.040> my<00:02:31.189> friend

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
use archers and whatever from my friend

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.789

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
because that's all he uses and he does a

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.099 
because that's all he uses and he does a
pretty<00:02:33.920> good<00:02:34.219> job<00:02:34.400> at<00:02:34.730> using<00:02:35.209> them<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:35.810> yeah
