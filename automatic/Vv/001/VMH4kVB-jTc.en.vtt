00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
which is the USB into data and charging

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.180 
which is the USB into data and charging
at<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> same<00:02:31.660> time<00:02:31.840> it'll<00:02:32.260> be<00:02:32.350> orange<00:02:32.860> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
you could put it on a dock or a tripod

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.190 
you could put it on a dock or a tripod
like<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.370> $15<00:02:46.209> tripod

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
like this is $15 tripod

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.320 
like this is $15 tripod
okay<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:49.849> just<00:02:49.880> screws<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.720> bottom<00:02:52.330> this

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
okay you just screws on the bottom this

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.410 
okay you just screws on the bottom this
is<00:02:53.390> more<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.959> waterproof<00:02:54.380> camera<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.760> the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
is more of a waterproof camera and the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.210 
is more of a waterproof camera and the
reason<00:02:56.630> why<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.750> say<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.200> than<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.680> old<00:02:57.800> one

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
reason why I say that than the old one

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.180 
reason why I say that than the old one
the<00:02:59.030> reason<00:02:59.239> why<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.360> say<00:02:59.630> that<00:02:59.660> is<00:03:00.080> because<00:03:00.380> it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
the reason why I say that is because it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.559 
the reason why I say that is because it
has<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.459> rubber<00:03:01.610> skin<00:03:01.940> right<00:03:02.120> here<00:03:02.390> and

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
has the rubber skin right here and

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.710 
has the rubber skin right here and
wrapped<00:03:02.900> around<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.349> frame<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.069> there's<00:03:04.280> less

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
wrapped around the frame so there's less

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.970 
wrapped around the frame so there's less
creases<00:03:06.550> all<00:03:07.550> right<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.230> just<00:03:09.440> close<00:03:09.800> it

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
creases all right and you just close it

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.530 
creases all right and you just close it
up<00:03:10.069> like<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.870> or<00:03:11.870> not<00:03:12.050> like<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:13.510> there<00:03:14.510> you

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
up like that or not like that there you

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.080 
up like that or not like that there you
go<00:03:14.750> like<00:03:14.989> that<00:03:15.170> now<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.160> use<00:03:16.340> one<00:03:16.580> hand

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
go like that now to use one hand

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.839 
go like that now to use one hand
so<00:03:17.870> unlatches<00:03:18.470> like<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:18.980> just<00:03:19.160> turn<00:03:19.370> a

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
so unlatches like that you just turn a

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.220 
so unlatches like that you just turn a
little<00:03:20.120> bit<00:03:20.269> that<00:03:20.450> way<00:03:20.769> pops<00:03:21.769> out<00:03:22.010> very<00:03:22.190> easy

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
little bit that way pops out very easy

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.670 
little bit that way pops out very easy
same<00:03:24.230> thing<00:03:24.440> goes<00:03:24.590> for<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:26.080> little<00:03:27.080> locks

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
same thing goes for that little locks

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.460 
same thing goes for that little locks
and<00:03:28.040> latches<00:03:28.160> right<00:03:28.730> there<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:31.720> as<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.810> fog

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
and latches right there and as a fog

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.630 
and latches right there and as a fog
anti<00:03:34.190> fog<00:03:34.430> lens<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:36.530> water<00:03:36.739> just<00:03:37.040> drips

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640

okay and let's go over here and the
white<00:04:31.560> balance<00:04:31.880> smart<00:04:32.880> filter<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.970> change

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
white balance smart filter you change

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.939 
white balance smart filter you change
you<00:04:36.360> two<00:04:36.479> different<00:04:36.660> textures

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949
