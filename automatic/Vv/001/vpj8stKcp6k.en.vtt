00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay this is the next step on how to

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.340 
okay this is the next step on how to
solve<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.689> three<00:00:04.470> by<00:00:04.620> three<00:00:04.830> Rubik's<00:00:05.130> cube<00:00:05.370> in

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
solve the three by three Rubik's cube in

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.190 
solve the three by three Rubik's cube in
this<00:00:07.350> step<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:07.890> will<00:00:08.130> be<00:00:08.340> finishing<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.849> cube

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
this step you will be finishing the cube

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.530 
this step you will be finishing the cube
you<00:00:10.200> will<00:00:10.349> be<00:00:11.150> solving<00:00:12.150> these<00:00:12.679> last

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
you will be solving these last

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.250 
you will be solving these last
centerpieces<00:00:15.540> or<00:00:15.780> corner<00:00:16.770> pieces<00:00:16.949> sorry<00:00:17.369> um

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
centerpieces or corner pieces sorry um

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.189 
centerpieces or corner pieces sorry um
and<00:00:21.949> it's<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.730> edge<00:00:24.060> pieces<00:00:24.449> correction<00:00:25.109> I'm

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
and it's so edge pieces correction I'm

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.450 
and it's so edge pieces correction I'm
sorry<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.830> took<00:00:25.920> me<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> second<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.369> realize

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
sorry it took me a second to realize

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.650 
sorry it took me a second to realize
what<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:26.939> said<00:00:27.300> kind<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.320> slow<00:00:28.560> today<00:00:28.769> um

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
what I just said kind of slow today um

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.780 
what I just said kind of slow today um
but<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.109> your<00:00:31.769> cube<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.189> either<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> look

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
but so your cube is either going to look

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.100 
but so your cube is either going to look
like<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.300> with<00:00:33.930> no<00:00:35.120> faces<00:00:36.120> complete<00:00:36.570> or<00:00:36.960> it's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
like this with no faces complete or it's

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.139 
like this with no faces complete or it's
going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.620> one<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.670> one

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
going to look like this one with one

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.020 
going to look like this one with one
complete<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.340> impossible<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.000> to

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
complete it is impossible for you to

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.119 
complete it is impossible for you to
have<00:00:42.360> two<00:00:42.840> or<00:00:43.110> three<00:00:43.140> complete<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.920> either

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
have two or three complete it's either

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.350 
have two or three complete it's either
going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.789> or<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:46.820> so<00:00:47.820> we'll<00:00:48.180> start

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
going to be one or all so we'll start

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.910 
going to be one or all so we'll start
with<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.629> cube<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.440> doesn't<00:00:49.739> have

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
with this cube because it doesn't have

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.430 
with this cube because it doesn't have
any<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> faces<00:00:50.550> salt<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
any of the faces salt so this is the I

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.540 
any of the faces salt so this is the I
believe<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.710> algorithm<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.280> called<00:00:56.399> an

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
believe this algorithm is called an

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.709 
believe this algorithm is called an
Allen<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.859> does<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
Allen and what it is what it does is it

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.039 
Allen and what it is what it does is it
rotates<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.940> pieces<00:01:03.049> counterclockwise

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
rotates the pieces counterclockwise

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.700 
rotates the pieces counterclockwise
without<00:01:04.920> messing<00:01:05.369> any<00:01:05.519> else<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.240> cube<00:01:06.450> up

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
without messing any else of the cube up

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.280 
without messing any else of the cube up
so<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> algorithm<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:10.549> left<00:01:11.549> 180<00:01:12.479> top

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
so if the algorithm is left 180 top

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.270 
so if the algorithm is left 180 top

can<00:01:25.979> pause<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> video<00:01:26.580> write<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.150> down<00:01:27.330> do

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
can pause the video write that down do

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.999 
can pause the video write that down do
you<00:01:27.659> need<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.729> but<00:01:29.729> um<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.829> one

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you need to do but um so for this one

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
you need to do but um so for this one
since<00:01:32.310> they<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.759> any<00:01:33.119> sides<00:01:33.810> complete

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
since they don't have any sides complete

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.760 
since they don't have any sides complete
you<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:35.939> ahead<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.290> do<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.320> algorithm

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
you just go ahead and do that algorithm

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
you just go ahead and do that algorithm
doesn't<00:01:38.130> matter<00:01:38.340> which<00:01:38.579> side<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.720> left

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
doesn't matter which side is on the left

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
still three left so what you're going to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.590 
still three left so what you're going to
do<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.650> you're<00:02:15.640> going<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.880> pick<00:02:16.150> you're<00:02:16.450> going

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
do is you're going to pick you're going

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.230 
do is you're going to pick you're going
to<00:02:16.660> find<00:02:16.960> which<00:02:17.530> one<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:17.890> complete<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.580> you're

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
to find which one is complete and you're

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.210 
to find which one is complete and you're
going<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.450> put<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.660> on<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.870> right<00:02:20.200> side<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
going to put it on the right side the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.910 
going to put it on the right side the
right<00:02:21.250> face<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:23.110> you're<00:02:23.650> going<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.830> do

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
right face and then you're going to do

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.680 
right face and then you're going to do
that<00:02:24.040> algorithm<00:02:24.310> again<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.150> algorithm

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
that algorithm again so that algorithm

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.830 
that algorithm again so that algorithm
is<00:02:26.140> left<00:02:27.130> 180<00:02:27.910> top<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.110> Vernon<00:02:29.730> back<00:02:30.840> front

top inverted and left hundred eighty so
now<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:45.790> have<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.710> do<00:02:47.710> it<00:02:47.830> one<00:02:47.950> more<00:02:48.010> time

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
now you have to do it one more time

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.090 
now you have to do it one more time
because<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.990> can<00:02:50.110> see<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.470> piece<00:02:50.860> has

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
because you can see that that piece has

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.530 
because you can see that that piece has
to<00:02:51.220> go<00:02:51.310> there<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.790> one<00:02:51.910> has<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.060> go<00:02:52.270> there

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
to go there and that one has to go there

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.340 
to go there and that one has to go there
and<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.900> one<00:02:52.990> has<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.140> go<00:02:53.320> there<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:55.260> let's<00:02:56.260> go

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
and that one has to go there so let's go

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.730 
and that one has to go there so let's go
and<00:02:56.470> do<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.620> one<00:02:56.740> more<00:02:56.770> time<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:58.120> it's<00:02:58.330> left<00:02:58.930> 180

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
and do it one more time so it's left 180

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.440

ah<00:03:17.860> this<00:03:18.640> algorithm<00:03:19.000> is<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.709> hardest<00:03:21.040> one<00:03:21.340> to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
ah this algorithm is the hardest one to

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.840 
ah this algorithm is the hardest one to
memorized<00:03:21.820> except<00:03:22.330> it's<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:23.160> I'm<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.670> visual

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.850 
memorized except it's I I'm a visual
learner<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:25.840> kind<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.200> memorize<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.680> like

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860

you<00:03:27.580> start<00:03:27.910> off<00:03:28.030> with<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.269> left<00:03:29.019> um<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:31.269> start

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
you start off with the left um you start

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.060 
you start off with the left um you start
off<00:03:31.540> with<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.870> one<00:03:32.080> and<00:03:32.410> then<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.650> do<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:32.920> in

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
off with that one and then you do it in

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.290 
off with that one and then you do it in
the<00:03:33.130> middle<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.519> do<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.700> at<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.880> end<00:03:34.060> and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
the middle and you do it at the end and

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.729 
the middle and you do it at the end and
then<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:34.510> had<00:03:34.660> these<00:03:34.810> three<00:03:35.110> step<00:03:35.350> things<00:03:35.560> in

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
then you had these three step things in

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.770 
then you had these three step things in
the<00:03:35.800> middle<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:37.150> really<00:03:37.330> wasn't<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.630> hard

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780
