which<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.829> think<00:00:59.160> has<00:00:59.309> been<00:00:59.520> lacking<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
which I think has been lacking in the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
which I think has been lacking in the
last<00:01:00.570> two<00:01:01.109> games<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.640> maybe

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
last two games and I think that maybe

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.460 
last two games and I think that maybe
there's<00:01:03.210> something<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:03.989> there<00:01:04.260> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
there's something going on there that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
there's something going on there that
his<00:01:04.979> his<00:01:05.540> NFL<00:01:06.740> football<00:01:07.740> IQ<00:01:08.180> for<00:01:09.180> game

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
his his NFL football IQ for game

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.750 
his his NFL football IQ for game

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760

have they don't have a defensive line in
there<00:06:52.110> too<00:06:52.650> that<00:06:53.130> you<00:06:53.250> don't<00:06:53.400> have<00:06:53.690> Cutler<00:06:54.690> who

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
there too that you don't have Cutler who

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.380 
there too that you don't have Cutler who
even<00:06:55.770> though<00:06:55.830> he's<00:06:55.980> a<00:06:56.010> terrible<00:06:56.430> quarterback

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:57.390 
even though he's a terrible quarterback

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.420 
even though he's a terrible quarterback
and<00:06:57.600> cracks<00:06:57.840> under<00:06:58.020> pressure<00:06:58.250> they<00:06:59.250> don't

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
uh that's just my opinion but that's the

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.020 
uh that's just my opinion but that's the
way<00:07:06.510> it's<00:07:06.660> looking<00:07:06.720> and<00:07:07.910> hopefully<00:07:08.910> we're

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
way it's looking and hopefully we're

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.360 
way it's looking and hopefully we're
going<00:07:09.150> to<00:07:09.210> be<00:07:09.270> six<00:07:09.510> and<00:07:09.690> three<00:07:09.930> and<00:07:10.290> it's<00:07:11.220> going

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
going to be six and three and it's going

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.450 
going to be six and three and it's going
to<00:07:11.430> be<00:07:11.520> a<00:07:11.550> race<00:07:11.730> between<00:07:11.880> us<00:07:12.210> and<00:07:12.540> green<00:07:12.750> bay

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
to be a race between us and green bay

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.350 
to be a race between us and green bay
unfortunately<00:07:14.460> I<00:07:14.520> think<00:07:14.610> green<00:07:14.970> baby<00:07:15.120> has<00:07:15.330> a

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
unfortunately I think green baby has a

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.970 
unfortunately I think green baby has a
way<00:07:15.540> better<00:07:15.570> quarterback<00:07:16.140> an<00:07:16.290> heir<00:07:16.410> Roger<00:07:16.680> but

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:16.980 
way better quarterback an heir Roger but

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.450 
way better quarterback an heir Roger but
hopefully<00:07:17.760> we<00:07:18.480> get<00:07:18.600> some<00:07:18.660> brakeman<00:07:19.200> and<00:07:19.460> until

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
hopefully we get some brakeman and until

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.490 
hopefully we get some brakeman and until
next<00:07:20.580> time<00:07:20.730> but<00:07:21.060> you're<00:07:21.180> worth<00:07:21.330> this<00:07:21.600> I'll<00:07:22.320> see

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
next time but you're worth this I'll see

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.220 
next time but you're worth this I'll see
you<00:07:22.590> then<00:07:22.740> for<00:07:23.040> each
