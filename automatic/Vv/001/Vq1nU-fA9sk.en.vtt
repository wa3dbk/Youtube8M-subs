00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
is that sometimes you get this big gap

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.260 
is that sometimes you get this big gap

between second and third to the engine
fogs<00:02:06.539> down<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.710> stay<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:07.950> second

for<00:02:08.399> longer<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.239> ends<00:02:09.420> up<00:02:09.509> being

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
for longer and it ends up being

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.180 
for longer and it ends up being
counterproductive<00:02:10.140> because<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.739> use<00:02:10.920> more

counterproductive because you use more

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.819
