00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:34.190 

I<00:01:24.420> use<00:01:25.420> epoxy<00:01:29.010> to<00:01:30.010> make<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.280> cool<00:01:31.830> or<00:01:32.830> you<00:01:33.070> use

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
I use epoxy to make the cool or you use

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.690 
I use epoxy to make the cool or you use
all<00:01:35.200> you<00:01:35.650> can<00:01:35.800> use<00:01:35.920> which<00:01:36.160> is<00:01:36.280> stronger<00:01:36.610> than

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
all you can use which is stronger than

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.400 
all you can use which is stronger than
epoxy<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:38.190> three<00:01:39.190> o'clock<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:41.170> kind<00:01:41.380> of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
epoxy is three o'clock it's kind of

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.230 
epoxy is three o'clock it's kind of
tricky<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:41.770> use<00:01:41.860> this<00:01:42.190> one<00:01:42.370> but<00:01:42.520> it's<00:01:42.820> way

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
tricky to use this one but it's way

00:01:43.240 --> 00:02:57.160 
tricky to use this one but it's way
stumping<00:01:43.720> in<00:01:43.780> epoxy

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.410 

see<00:02:58.170> beyond<00:02:59.720> what<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.900> best<00:03:01.170> because<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:03.180> did
