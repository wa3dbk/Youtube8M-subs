00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.920
 hi everyone welcome to a 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.839
 new episode back on black ops 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.280
 julien g way to say black ops 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.840
 of no return on black ops 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.160
 of today I will play late om 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.719
 because I have not been around for a long time 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.460
 even played targe not very often late om 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.379
 right now and I figured it's 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.670
 rather a good man captain so 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.070
 we will test then we are on nick 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.600
 thorn 2025 and I put strict scores 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.650
 which is a bit unusual by 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.180
 compared to what I usually put 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.800
 necessarily if it's unusual it's not 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.560
 because I usually put hall where the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.740
 little ripple that goes well that makes 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.740
 pleasure 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.820
 to auch the little ammo I'm going to 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.550
 go 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.620
 oh no no damage I had 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.149
 almost I almost had my machine 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.030
 of death I started very well 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.500
 besides there is what he does kilo 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.820
 ok, come on let's hope we see something 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.860
 well, it's our little package 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.019
 jimmy death machine and then the camp 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.449
 is called never where he has failed 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.979
 to die with my package and I put the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.420
 dragon fire it would be that dragon fire 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.399
 it's really a very narrow score 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.140
 underrated also do not know why 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.960
 no more people do not use what he 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.479
 is really really very very good 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.429
 this is olala that spawn everywhere I still 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.970
 a strategic parcel by the parcels 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:24.660
 it really happens everywhere 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:28.890
 where you always go sporty enough from 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.040
 anyway on an autumn so in I 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.390
 I myself thought he was going camping 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.670
 hold a small date china will say 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.310
 it's been a pleasure to me the son 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.060
 something good little packages I 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.970
 know that you have the power 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.660
 yeah I'm not going to pity and sabha he 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.890
 there is a far worse feature film is 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.280
 maybe not put on the right side we're going 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.979
 try to live at 107 mans the spawn at 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.300
 Wood not I seen anything good bah is not 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.320
 terrible terrible but hey it's good 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.630
 I managed to unlock all 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.130
 series now it should roll that 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.869
 should roll to homes properly 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.680
 johannesburg it must have angels is 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.119
 good I think I'm going directly 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.490
 went in the spawn like that they're not going 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.720
 hide above and we 'll put the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.920
 dragonfly so this party then that's 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.959
 what steel orders that for 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.400
 climb it's gone a hell normally 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.540
 as a rule we really think of a 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.420
 very good score what can we do in 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.600
 the 8.9 aisles that he would put very 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.700
 easily with the good people y'a 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.930
 people so much a year they 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.209
 turn 20 - too fast to my fall 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.459
 and me you know me or it's just 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.390
 now I'm not even dead anymore 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.620
 I'm not even dead and not going 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.850
 find out how they can cope with 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.720
 polish people to this place there in 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.239
 actually they do not have their proofs and 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.530
 someone because I see to us there 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.860
 is inside I was also telling myself that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.239
 nothing by which I personally 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.000
 went to luff 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.630
 we did not even know there was a 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.860
 just below yeah good bah I know 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.420
 not where they are because in fact like 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.890
 I am a sport could not have had and spawn 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.360
 on the other side ba it fucks a little the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.350
 whorehouse 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.450
 we must turn too fast I am 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.180
 dead no i do not like makes me lower 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.810
 I do not think I really did not 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.799
 a lot of movies but that's 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.980
 mainly because I even came 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.880
 not found the enemies actually I say 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.160
 that I can see but I think that if in 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.299
 do ah if I'm dead but what makes me 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.260
 seemed to me I was also saying it's from 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.049
 to go on it's weird that I'm coming 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.340
 like that not now the machine of 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.660
 death the machine of death but when 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.890
 strict of the game 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.319
 that's where it'll go fast go that are 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.569
 enormous 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.840
 the names of god like that happens on 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.840
 problem 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.450
 oh well luckily that does not need 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.890
 to reload and this thing yeah 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.580
 we chained we chained guys it's 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.720
 left 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.840
 bitter I made a show not to 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.840
 die 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.340
 go I knew how I did the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.060
 knife trick oh there I knew that 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.349
 she has nothing behind me I have them 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.579
 heard actually he me he fell and 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.930
 then my hair pile rating when he is 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.400
 falls 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:10.030
 so I grill them right now yes 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.870
 he'll fall to President Victor then 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.090
 I do not put it right away because 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.229
 I think someone lost it 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.500
 I did a fucking series 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.060
 with the death machine has rather 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.430
 well spent in the end that we already have the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.479
 part 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.680
 this part was really very short 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.710
 like rice say like all 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.000
 parties on the foux I know faster and 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.080
 like all parties on a hector 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.970
 has anyway single tons this is 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.820
 really the map where you can do a 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.979
 part in less than 3 minutes 40 kg a 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.850
 still 43 I thought I had not done 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.110
 as much as he wants it's true that I have 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.889
 not at all looked at the table of 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.840
 scores during the game 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.160
 So I was not expecting to do 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.449
 so much good that was even a 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.250
 very good part with the machine of 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.810
 dead I think that's really the 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.850
 strict score par excellence machine 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.050
 of death finally short I hope this 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.970
 little part you will have liked we will 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.960
