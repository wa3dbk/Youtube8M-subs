as<00:01:07.890> usual<00:01:08.890> we'll<00:01:09.130> go<00:01:09.250> through<00:01:09.460> each<00:01:09.490> part<00:01:09.940> of

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
as usual we'll go through each part of

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.940 
as usual we'll go through each part of
the<00:01:10.120> song<00:01:10.360> playing<00:01:10.780> each<00:01:10.960> chord<00:01:11.350> in<00:01:11.560> its<00:01:11.740> root

the song playing each chord in its root
position<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:13.180> then<00:01:13.360> we'll<00:01:13.479> follow<00:01:13.750> that<00:01:13.840> up

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
position and then we'll follow that up

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.110 
position and then we'll follow that up
by<00:01:14.380> using<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.979> technique<00:01:15.370> of<00:01:15.400> finding<00:01:16.030> the

by using the technique of finding the

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.110 
by using the technique of finding the
nearest<00:01:16.360> inversion<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:18.040> now<00:01:18.850> we're<00:01:18.970> going<00:01:19.060> to

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
nearest inversion and now we're going to

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.280 
nearest inversion and now we're going to
go<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.299> an<00:01:19.479> a-flat

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
go to an a-flat

go to an a-flat
