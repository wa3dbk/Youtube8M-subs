00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.950 
like looking at my yellow little
triangle<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.329> move<00:01:33.509> rather<00:01:33.780> than

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
triangle there to move rather than

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.590 
triangle there to move rather than
actually<00:01:34.320> looking<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> screen<00:01:35.600> that's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
actually looking at the screen that's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.940 
actually looking at the screen that's
normally<00:01:36.900> what<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.499 
normally what I like to do and I get a
black<00:01:38.189> road<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.520> there<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.000> seems<00:01:39.240> easier

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
black road in there it just seems easier

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.990 
black road in there it just seems easier
or<00:01:40.020> either<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.680> kind<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.009> keep<00:01:41.670> one<00:01:41.700> eye

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
or either just kind of keep one eye

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.260 
or either just kind of keep one eye
constantly<00:01:42.960> staring<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.710> mini<00:01:44.070> map<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
constantly staring at that mini map and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.999 
constantly staring at that mini map and
the<00:01:45.780> other<00:01:45.930> obviously<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.860> your

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the other obviously like on your

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.139 
the other obviously like on your
character<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.579> whatever<00:01:49.189> but<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.850> with

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
character or whatever but because with

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.940 
character or whatever but because with
the<00:01:51.240> Blackbird<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.110> want<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> make<00:01:52.920> sure

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the Blackbird out you want to make sure

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.770 
the Blackbird out you want to make sure
that<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.640> overconfident<00:01:54.060> because

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that you don't get overconfident because

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.200 
that you don't get overconfident because
it<00:01:55.770> happens<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.189> me<00:01:56.340> sometimes<00:01:56.369> I'll<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
it happens to me sometimes I'll get that

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
it happens to me sometimes I'll get that
Blackbird<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.229> I'll<00:01:58.320> say<00:01:58.500> oh<00:01:58.530> good

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
Blackbird out and then I'll say oh good

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.740 
Blackbird out and then I'll say oh good
now<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.820> run<00:02:00.149> around<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.540> map

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
now I can just run around this map

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.940 
now I can just run around this map
freely<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.649> worry<00:02:01.799> about

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
freely and I have to worry about

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.620 
freely and I have to worry about
anything<00:02:02.780> but<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.790> you'll<00:02:05.790> underestimate

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
anything but you you'll underestimate

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.389 
anything but you you'll underestimate
that<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:07.049> say<00:02:07.350> your<00:02:07.530> teammates<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.129> killed

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
that like say your teammates have killed

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.420 
that like say your teammates have killed
some<00:02:08.580> people<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.090> their<00:02:09.360> mark<00:02:09.979> hasn't<00:02:10.979> really

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
some people but their mark hasn't really

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.200 
some people but their mark hasn't really
faded<00:02:11.670> away<00:02:11.910> off<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> UAV

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
faded away off of the UAV

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.030
