00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
accumulation then the second phase is

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.429

checked but it's Realtors Association
data<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.750> go<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> their<00:01:55.110> website<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.649> get

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
data you can go to their website and get

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.410 
data you can go to their website and get
the<00:01:55.920> data<00:01:57.079> but<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.350> know<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:59.030> gold<00:02:00.030> goes<00:02:00.119> where

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the data but you know if gold goes where

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.969 
the data but you know if gold goes where
I<00:02:00.450> think<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.229> silver<00:02:01.530> goes<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
I think it's going and silver goes to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.789 
I think it's going and silver goes to
the<00:02:02.159> 10:1<00:02:02.850> valuation<00:02:03.570> which<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.869> entirely

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the 10:1 valuation which is entirely

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.580 
the 10:1 valuation which is entirely
possible<00:02:05.299> it<00:02:06.299> could<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.259> couple

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
possible it could be that just a couple

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.050 
possible it could be that just a couple
hundred<00:02:07.710> ounces<00:02:08.129> like<00:02:08.310> two<00:02:08.520> hundred<00:02:08.580> ounces

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
hundred ounces like two hundred ounces

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.450 
hundred ounces like two hundred ounces

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
when I say these things I can't believe

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.100 
when I say these things I can't believe
I'm<00:02:23.640> saying<00:02:23.880> them<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:24.900> they're<00:02:25.080> just

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
I'm saying them but they're just

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.590 
I'm saying them but they're just
entirely<00:02:25.770> logical<00:02:26.520> things<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.510> just

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
entirely logical things and it's just

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.270 
entirely logical things and it's just
yeah<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:28.380> stuff<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.160> has

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
yeah and it's stuff like this has

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.460 
yeah and it's stuff like this has
happened<00:02:29.310> before<00:02:29.720> but<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.960> would<00:02:31.080> be<00:02:31.230> like

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
happened before but it would be like

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.650 
happened before but it would be like
you'd<00:02:32.040> set<00:02:32.280> aside<00:02:32.550> three<00:02:32.970> thousand<00:02:33.450> four

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
you'd set aside three thousand four

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.500 
you'd set aside three thousand four
thousand<00:02:34.050> dollars<00:02:34.320> today<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.490> silver<00:02:36.300> and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
thousand dollars today in silver and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.680 
thousand dollars today in silver and
trade<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.560> for<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.830> home<00:02:38.070> someday<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.210> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
trade it for a home someday in the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.000 
trade it for a home someday in the
future<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.260> don't<00:02:40.290> think<00:02:40.590> it's<00:02:40.830> going<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
future and I don't think it's going to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.830 
future and I don't think it's going to
be<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.310> long<00:02:41.550> it's<00:02:41.790> going<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.000> be<00:02:42.120> probably

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
be that long it's going to be probably

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.620 
be that long it's going to be probably
between<00:02:43.370> two<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.550> five<00:02:44.820> years<00:02:44.850> maybe<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
between two and five years maybe a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.130 
between two and five years maybe a
little<00:02:46.050> bit<00:02:46.230> longer<00:02:46.440> six<00:02:46.890> years<00:02:47.190> 2015<00:02:47.930> at<00:02:48.930> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
little bit longer six years 2015 at the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.230 
little bit longer six years 2015 at the
latest<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.650> think<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.130> just<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.850> know<00:02:50.940> that's

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
latest I think it just you know that's

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
latest I think it just you know that's
what<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.480> feels<00:02:51.750> like<00:02:56.660> if<00:02:57.660> they<00:02:57.960> are<00:02:57.990> not

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
what it feels like if they are not

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.110

difference<00:07:08.520> will<00:07:08.640> be<00:07:08.670> this<00:07:08.880> will<00:07:09.030> be<00:07:09.090> for<00:07:09.390> real

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
difference will be this will be for real

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.780 
difference will be this will be for real
and<00:07:09.840> that<00:07:09.900> was<00:07:10.140> you<00:07:11.100> know<00:07:11.130> that<00:07:11.340> really<00:07:11.490> was<00:07:11.760> a

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790 
and that was you know that really was a

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.160 
and that was you know that really was a
bubble<00:07:12.180> now<00:07:12.300> doesn't<00:07:12.660> mean<00:07:12.720> that<00:07:12.870> we<00:07:13.020> won't

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.170 
bubble now doesn't mean that we won't

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.720 
bubble now doesn't mean that we won't
have<00:07:13.290> a<00:07:13.410> bubble<00:07:13.740> in<00:07:13.830> the<00:07:13.920> gold<00:07:14.130> market<00:07:14.580> and

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.730 
have a bubble in the gold market and

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.390 
have a bubble in the gold market and
silver<00:07:15.360> markets<00:07:15.750> but<00:07:16.260> the<00:07:16.470> move<00:07:16.650> itself<00:07:17.010> will

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 
silver markets but the move itself will

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.450 
silver markets but the move itself will
be<00:07:17.520> intrinsically<00:07:18.030> real<00:07:18.330> and<00:07:18.660> and<00:07:18.930> I<00:07:19.460> believe

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
be intrinsically real and and I believe

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.490 
be intrinsically real and and I believe
that<00:07:20.490> this<00:07:20.970> is<00:07:21.030> the<00:07:21.270> next<00:07:21.540> big<00:07:21.720> bubble<00:07:22.110> as<00:07:22.290> the
