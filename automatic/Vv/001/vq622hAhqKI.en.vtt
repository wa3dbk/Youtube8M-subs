actually in a design for a digital SLR

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.920 
actually in a design for a digital SLR
with<00:00:37.170> maybe<00:00:37.380> one<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:37.920> spare<00:00:38.489> lenses<00:00:38.969> but

I've<00:00:40.020> actually<00:00:40.170> found<00:00:40.500> another<00:00:41.070> use<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
I've actually found another use for it

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.139 
I've actually found another use for it
and<00:00:42.540> I'll<00:00:42.690> show<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.870> guys<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.500> second

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
and I'll show you guys that in a second

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.250 
and I'll show you guys that in a second
so<00:00:45.149> let's<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> look<00:00:45.840> around<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> back

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so let's have a look around the back

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.529 
so let's have a look around the back
this<00:00:46.440> minute<00:00:46.710> that's<00:00:46.800> real<00:00:47.190> nice<00:00:47.550> material<00:00:48.360> I

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
this minute that's real nice material I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.680 
this minute that's real nice material I
don't<00:00:48.899> actually<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> material<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
don't actually know what the material is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.720 
don't actually know what the material is
but<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> ideas<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:53.699> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
but I think you get the ideas because a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.279 
but I think you get the ideas because a
lot<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.120> bags<00:00:54.270> are<00:00:54.510> actually<00:00:54.809> made<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.170> the

now

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.130 
now
first<00:02:28.959> things<00:02:29.170> first<00:02:30.360> your<00:02:31.360> pocket<00:02:31.900> there

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
and if we sort to a little this round

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.240 
and if we sort to a little this round
it's<00:02:37.900> actually<00:02:38.140> designed<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.709> have<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.160> a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
it's actually designed to have this in a

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.860 
it's actually designed to have this in a
different<00:02:39.400> layout<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:39.970> your<00:02:40.150> lenses<00:02:40.510> all<00:02:40.600> fit

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870

in there a lot nicer along with your
camera<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.630> actually<00:02:43.989> got<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.230> mounted<00:02:44.590> like

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
camera but actually got it mounted like

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.520 
camera but actually got it mounted like
this<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.250> it's<00:02:45.340> actually<00:02:45.959> velcroed<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.260> there

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
this and it's actually velcroed in there

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.960 
this and it's actually velcroed in there
like<00:02:47.769> that<00:02:47.799> because<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:48.430> welker<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:48.880> the

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
like that because as welker on the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.940 
like that because as welker on the
bottom<00:02:49.269> of<00:02:49.390> this<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.930> i'll<00:02:50.680> show<00:02:50.829> you<00:02:50.890> exactly

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
bottom of this and i'll show you exactly

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.210 
bottom of this and i'll show you exactly
why<00:02:51.700> I've<00:02:51.880> got<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.180> mounted<00:02:52.570> this<00:02:52.720> way<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:54.010> if

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
why I've got it mounted this way so if

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.110 
why I've got it mounted this way so if
we<00:02:54.340> look<00:02:54.489> down<00:02:54.670> there

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
we look down there

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.650 
we look down there
it<00:02:55.180> fits<00:02:55.750> my<00:02:56.170> Canon<00:02:56.859> 60d<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.850> always<00:02:58.510> like

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.820 
the inside of there as well but a
slightly<00:05:37.540> tougher<00:05:37.810> material<00:05:38.410> there<00:05:38.620> so<00:05:38.650> it

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
slightly tougher material there so it

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.800 
slightly tougher material there so it
doesn't<00:05:39.100> wear<00:05:39.190> through<00:05:39.550> and<00:05:40.150> this<00:05:40.300> does<00:05:40.510> move

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
doesn't wear through and this does move

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.900 
doesn't wear through and this does move
as<00:05:40.960> well<00:05:41.140> depending<00:05:42.040> on<00:05:42.310> how<00:05:42.490> you<00:05:42.550> want<00:05:42.850> to

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
as well depending on how you want to

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.210 
as well depending on how you want to
adjust<00:05:43.030> it<00:05:43.420> and<00:05:44.320> maybe<00:05:44.530> some<00:05:44.740> of<00:05:44.860> you<00:05:44.950> don't

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
adjust it and maybe some of you don't

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.680 
adjust it and maybe some of you don't
want<00:05:45.370> these<00:05:45.490> straps<00:05:45.850> they<00:05:46.090> do<00:05:46.150> come<00:05:46.540> off<00:05:46.660> very

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
want these straps they do come off very

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.720 
want these straps they do come off very
easily<00:05:47.110> just<00:05:47.410> by<00:05:47.680> squeezing<00:05:48.010> that<00:05:48.130> in<00:05:48.310> and

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
easily just by squeezing that in and

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.070 
easily just by squeezing that in and
they<00:05:48.820> pop<00:05:49.030> off<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:49.390> you<00:05:49.450> could<00:05:49.600> just<00:05:49.870> use<00:05:50.050> it

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
they pop off and you could just use it

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.960 
they pop off and you could just use it
as<00:05:50.230> a<00:05:50.290> bag<00:05:50.620> just<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:50.950> carry<00:05:51.190> around<00:05:51.370> like<00:05:51.760> that
