00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.240 
alright what's up Internet in today's
video<00:00:02.909> I<00:00:03.300> want<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.570> talk<00:00:03.659> about<00:00:03.810> using<00:00:04.620> raw<00:00:04.920> tag

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
video I want to talk about using raw tag

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.400 
video I want to talk about using raw tag
which<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.700> just<00:00:05.879> hitting<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.210> five<00:00:06.450> button<00:00:06.810> to

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
which is just hitting the five button to

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.430 
which is just hitting the five button to
evade<00:00:08.220> attacks<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:09.000> are<00:00:09.059> otherwise

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
evade attacks that are otherwise

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.850 
evade attacks that are otherwise
unavoidable<00:00:10.440> or<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.820> get<00:00:11.940> out<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> mix-ups

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
unavoidable or to get out of mix-ups

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.829 
unavoidable or to get out of mix-ups
this<00:00:13.860> did<00:00:14.070> exist<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.519> Tekken<00:00:14.820> Tag<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.509> think

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
this did exist in Tekken Tag one I think

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.230 
this did exist in Tekken Tag one I think
it<00:00:16.199> has<00:00:16.320> improved<00:00:16.710> slightly<00:00:17.039> because<00:00:17.400> when

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
it has improved slightly because when

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.820 
it has improved slightly because when
you<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:18.480> hit<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.930> way<00:00:19.020> out<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.619> game

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
you get hit on the way out in this game

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.920 
you get hit on the way out in this game
a<00:00:20.430> lot<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.910> times<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.359> doesn't<00:00:21.510> really<00:00:21.720> matter

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
a lot of times it doesn't really matter

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.109 
a lot of times it doesn't really matter
because<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.439> take<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.920> reduced<00:00:23.490> damage<00:00:23.699> and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
because you take a reduced damage and

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.460 
because you take a reduced damage and
your<00:00:24.510> inbound<00:00:25.320> character<00:00:26.160> comes<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.640> any<00:00:26.849> way

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
your inbound character comes in any way

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.339 
your inbound character comes in any way
so<00:00:28.470> let<00:00:29.400> me<00:00:29.490> explain<00:00:29.640> how<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> works<00:00:30.349> normally

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
so let me explain how it works normally

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.380 
so let me explain how it works normally
in<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.859> situation<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.520> let's<00:00:33.059> say<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.270> have

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
in a situation like let's say I have

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
in a situation like let's say I have
recorded<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.800> think<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.340> slash<00:00:35.640> kick

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
recorded here I think it's a slash kick

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.470 
recorded here I think it's a slash kick
into<00:00:36.800> lays<00:00:37.800> down<00:00:38.129> forward<00:00:38.520> three<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:39.300> is

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
into lays down forward three this is

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
into lays down forward three this is
otherwise<00:00:39.899> unavoidable<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.950> can't<00:00:41.190> back

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
otherwise unavoidable you can't back

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
otherwise unavoidable you can't back
that<00:00:41.460> shit<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.120> mid<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.780> can't<00:00:42.989> duck<00:00:43.260> it

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
that shit it's mid so you can't duck it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.310 
that shit it's mid so you can't duck it
and<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.040> can't<00:00:44.250> sidestep<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:46.110> this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and you can't sidestep it so in this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.029 
and you can't sidestep it so in this
situation<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.700> use<00:00:47.879> tag<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.989> tag<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.739> and

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
situation you can use tag to tag out and

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.709 
situation you can use tag to tag out and
you<00:00:50.460> know<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:50.940> not<00:00:51.210> sure<00:00:51.390> what's<00:00:51.600> um<00:00:52.219> what<00:00:53.219> is

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
you know I'm not sure what's um what is

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.880 
you know I'm not sure what's um what is
guaranteed<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.079> situation<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.829> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
guaranteed in this situation because I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
guaranteed in this situation because I
haven't<00:00:56.039> tried<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.340> yet<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.480> can

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
haven't tried it yet but you can

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.299 
haven't tried it yet but you can
definitely<00:00:57.870> punish<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.559> free<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
definitely punish for free and it's a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.910 
definitely punish for free and it's a
very<00:00:59.340> useful<00:00:59.760> tactic<00:01:00.390> another<00:01:01.140> example<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
very useful tactic another example of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.670 
very useful tactic another example of
how<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.879> use<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
how you can use it is to get out of

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.719 
how you can use it is to get out of
mix-ups<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.820> here<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:07.460> ladies<00:01:08.460> razor

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
mix-ups so here you have ladies razor

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.780 
mix-ups so here you have ladies razor
rush<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.409> actually<00:01:10.680> use<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.580> raw

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
rush and you can actually use the raw

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.660 
rush and you can actually use the raw
tag<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.810> get<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.860> mix-up<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.369> saw<00:01:14.520> how

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
tag to get out of the mix-up you saw how

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.520 
tag to get out of the mix-up you saw how
we<00:01:14.729> got<00:01:15.000> hit<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.110> doesn't<00:01:16.439> matter

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
we got hit there but it doesn't matter

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.100 
we got hit there but it doesn't matter
because<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:18.030> could<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.360> come<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.780> do

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
because you could just come in and do

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.719 
because you could just come in and do
whatever<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.590> want<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.040> either<00:01:20.189> mix<00:01:20.520> them<00:01:20.640> up

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
whatever you want to either mix them up

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
whatever you want to either mix them up
or<00:01:20.939> punish<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.450> notice<00:01:21.810> how<00:01:21.930> I'm<00:01:22.350> letting<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
or punish and notice how I'm letting the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.210 
or punish and notice how I'm letting the
razor<00:01:24.030> rush<00:01:24.299> hit<00:01:24.509> me<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.710> maximum

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
razor rush hit me so it can be maximum

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.690 
razor rush hit me so it can be maximum
frame<00:01:26.430> advantage<00:01:26.970> or<00:01:27.119> whatever<00:01:28.700> that's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
frame advantage or whatever that's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730 
frame advantage or whatever that's
another<00:01:30.060> way<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:30.780> raw<00:01:31.020> tag<00:01:31.290> now

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
another way you can use raw tag now

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.039 
another way you can use raw tag now
before<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.270> emphasize<00:01:33.659> that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
before we go on I have to emphasize that

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.020 
before we go on I have to emphasize that
this<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.560> only<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.130> only<00:01:35.400> works<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
this is only this only works with the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
this is only this only works with the
raw<00:01:36.180> tag<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.290> middle<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.829> field<00:01:38.009> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
raw tag in the middle of the field of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.030 
raw tag in the middle of the field of
battle<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.020> by<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> wall<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.920> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
battle so if you do it by a wall and you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.980 
battle so if you do it by a wall and you
get<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> raw<00:01:41.490> tag<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.939> jumps<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.750> I

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
get the raw tag that jumps in and out I

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.139 
get the raw tag that jumps in and out I
haven't<00:01:43.530> explored<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.189> yet<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.610> know<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.970> has

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
haven't explored that yet I know it has

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090 
haven't explored that yet I know it has
evasive<00:01:45.659> properties<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.259> well<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.710> i'll

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
evasive properties as well and i'll

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.560 
evasive properties as well and i'll
probably<00:01:47.340> make<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> video<00:01:47.850> about<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
probably make a video about that in the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.679 
probably make a video about that in the
future<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:50.549> i<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.119> wanted<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
future but as of now i just wanted to

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.830 
future but as of now i just wanted to
talk<00:01:51.930> about<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:53.040> just<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> open<00:01:54.240> ground<00:01:54.450> raw

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
talk about the just the open ground raw

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.780 
talk about the just the open ground raw
tag<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.610> how<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.969> use<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:58.399> to<00:01:59.399> evade

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
tag and how you can use it to to evade

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.060 
tag and how you can use it to to evade
otherwise<00:02:00.299> difficult<00:02:01.020> or<00:02:01.530> unavoidable

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
otherwise difficult or unavoidable

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.999 
otherwise difficult or unavoidable
attacks<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:03.810> i<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> couple<00:02:04.860> things

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
attacks now here i have a couple things

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.550 
attacks now here i have a couple things
recorded<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.610> well<00:02:05.850> with<00:02:06.060> law<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:07.469> of

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
recorded as well with law and one of

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.309 
recorded as well with law and one of
them<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.879> blocking<00:02:08.879> his<00:02:09.090> /<00:02:09.390> kick<00:02:09.720> into<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
them is blocking his / kick into the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.500 
them is blocking his / kick into the
homing<00:02:10.709> move<00:02:10.860> now<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.640> homing<00:02:12.060> move<00:02:12.209> just

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
homing move now that homing move just

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.790 
homing move now that homing move just
like<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.870> one<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.020> just<00:02:13.110> showed<00:02:13.319> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
like the one I just showed you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.390 
like the one I just showed you
lei<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:15.230> otherwise<00:02:16.230> unavoidable<00:02:17.190> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
lei is not otherwise unavoidable so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.550 
lei is not otherwise unavoidable so
you'd<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:18.570> something<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:18.930> counter

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
you'd have to do something like counter

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.490 
you'd have to do something like counter
it<00:02:19.710> or<00:02:19.830> Perry<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.310> or<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:21.330> use<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.900> extra

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
it or Perry it or you can use this extra

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.310 
it or Perry it or you can use this extra
option<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.070> exists<00:02:23.460> now<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:24.110> tagging<00:02:25.110> to

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
option that exists now of tagging to

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.640 
option that exists now of tagging to
make<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.620> with<00:02:25.830> um<00:02:26.270> it's<00:02:27.270> also<00:02:27.650> really

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
make it with um it's also really

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.000 
make it with um it's also really
interesting<00:02:29.430> using<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.060> against<00:02:31.010> situations

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
interesting using it against situations

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.610 
interesting using it against situations
like<00:02:32.280> let's<00:02:32.940> say<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.360> Paul<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.110> his

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
like let's say I have Paul here his

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.010 
like let's say I have Paul here his
shredder<00:02:35.040> kick<00:02:35.370> has<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:36.090> mixup<00:02:36.480> at<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.660> end<00:02:36.930> of

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
shredder kick has a mixup at the end of

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.090 
shredder kick has a mixup at the end of
it<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.560> can<00:02:37.770> do<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> low<00:02:38.220> or<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.150> do<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.330> mid

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
it you can do a low or you can do a mid

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.880 
it you can do a low or you can do a mid
and<00:02:41.100> raw<00:02:41.760> tagging<00:02:42.270> on<00:02:42.420> block<00:02:42.810> will<00:02:43.230> avoid<00:02:43.560> both

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
and raw tagging on block will avoid both

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.910 
and raw tagging on block will avoid both
of<00:02:44.160> those<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:46.110> situation<00:02:46.740> of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
of those so in the situation of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.890 
of those so in the situation of
defending<00:02:47.640> against<00:02:48.030> Paul<00:02:48.270> shredder<00:02:48.600> kicks

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
defending against Paul shredder kicks

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.900 
defending against Paul shredder kicks
normally<00:02:49.830> what<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.010> have<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.880> have

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
normally what you have to do is you have

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.810 
normally what you have to do is you have
to<00:02:51.180> use<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> 12<00:02:51.840> frame<00:02:52.140> mid<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:53.070> will<00:02:53.310> option

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
to use a 12 frame mid that will option

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.270 
to use a 12 frame mid that will option
select<00:02:54.210> between<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.840> hizmet<00:02:55.170> attack<00:02:55.710> it'll

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
select between the hizmet attack it'll

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.730 
select between the hizmet attack it'll
interrupt<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.960> will<00:02:58.140> beat<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.590> low

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
interrupt it and it will beat the low

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.290 
interrupt it and it will beat the low
attack<00:02:59.070> so<00:02:59.280> that's<00:02:59.460> why<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.640> got<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.850> use<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> 12

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
attack so that's why you got to use a 12

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.820 
attack so that's why you got to use a 12
frame<00:03:00.480> mid<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.840> punish<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.320> shredder<00:03:01.530> kicks

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
frame mid to punish the shredder kicks

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.510 
frame mid to punish the shredder kicks
but<00:03:02.520> if<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:03.390> decide<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.590> raw<00:03:04.920> tag<00:03:05.250> after

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
but if you decide to do a raw tag after

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.520 
but if you decide to do a raw tag after
the<00:03:05.790> second<00:03:06.180> hit<00:03:06.330> you're<00:03:06.840> going<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.230> literally

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
the second hit you're going to literally

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.520 
the second hit you're going to literally
beat<00:03:07.890> all<00:03:08.070> all<00:03:08.490> two<00:03:09.270> or<00:03:09.540> three<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.170> mix<00:03:10.350> ups

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
beat all all two or three of the mix ups

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.220 
beat all all two or three of the mix ups
because<00:03:10.650> there<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> high<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.600> people

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
because there is a high so but people

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.050 
because there is a high so but people
don't<00:03:13.320> normally<00:03:13.500> use<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.980> high<00:03:14.130> but<00:03:14.700> anyway

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
don't normally use the high but anyway

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.910 
don't normally use the high but anyway
you<00:03:15.360> can<00:03:15.600> beat<00:03:15.750> all<00:03:15.930> three<00:03:15.960> of<00:03:16.290> those<00:03:16.470> mix-ups

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
you can beat all three of those mix-ups

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.000 
you can beat all three of those mix-ups
with<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.160> raw<00:03:17.370> tag<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.910> punish<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.500> mean<00:03:19.830> it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
with a raw tag and punish so I mean it

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.160 
with a raw tag and punish so I mean it
is<00:03:20.160> risky<00:03:20.430> there<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.090> not<00:03:21.390> it's<00:03:21.690> not<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.020> this

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
is risky there is not it's not like this

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.130 
is risky there is not it's not like this
is<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.730> completely<00:03:23.730> foolproof<00:03:24.150> method<00:03:24.900> of

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
is a completely foolproof method of

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.190 
is a completely foolproof method of
beating<00:03:25.470> situations<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.550> but<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.690> does

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
beating situations like that but it does

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.220 
beating situations like that but it does
exist<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.830> is<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:29.010> universal<00:03:29.870> defensive<00:03:30.870> option

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
exist it is a universal defensive option

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.620 
exist it is a universal defensive option
every<00:03:31.500> character<00:03:31.890> can<00:03:32.070> use<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.550> I<00:03:33.270> think

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
every character can use it and I think

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.420 
every character can use it and I think
it's<00:03:33.750> very<00:03:34.020> effective<00:03:34.350> for<00:03:34.560> certain<00:03:35.040> setups

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
it's very effective for certain setups

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.930 
it's very effective for certain setups
and<00:03:35.520> situations<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:37.260> will<00:03:37.650> hopefully<00:03:37.940> research

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
and situations I will hopefully research

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.690 
and situations I will hopefully research
the<00:03:39.270> raw<00:03:40.050> tag<00:03:40.350> near<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.739> wall<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.190> make<00:03:41.670> a

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
the raw tag near the wall and make a

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.970 
the raw tag near the wall and make a
video<00:03:42.180> about<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.959> future<00:03:43.170> but

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
video about that in the future but

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.740 
video about that in the future but
hopefully<00:03:44.550> this<00:03:44.700> video<00:03:44.880> helped<00:03:45.270> you<00:03:45.270> guys<00:03:45.480> out
