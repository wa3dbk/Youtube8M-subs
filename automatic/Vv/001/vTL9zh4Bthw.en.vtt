00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.100 

I've<00:00:07.250> just<00:00:07.460> done<00:00:07.670> another<00:00:08.410> fish

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
I've just done another fish

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.560 
I've just done another fish
I'll<00:00:10.879> design<00:00:11.879> slightly<00:00:12.450> more<00:00:12.769> accurately

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
I'll design slightly more accurately

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.950 
I'll design slightly more accurately
just<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.719> show<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:15.990> another<00:00:16.949> way<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:18.119> another

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
just to show you another way of another

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.080 
just to show you another way of another
way<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.820> helping<00:00:20.820> your<00:00:21.439> designs<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.829> look

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
way of helping your designs to look

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.400 
way of helping your designs to look
three-dimensional<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.779> don't<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.110> to<00:00:25.259> do

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
three-dimensional you don't have to do

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.060 
three-dimensional you don't have to do
this<00:00:25.650> but<00:00:25.919> I<00:00:25.949> quite<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:27.239> it<00:00:27.509> and<00:00:27.800> if<00:00:28.800> you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
this but I quite like it and if you

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.150 
this but I quite like it and if you
think<00:00:29.430> about<00:00:29.579> these<00:00:32.960> strands<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.410> over<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
think about these strands going over the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.529 
think about these strands going over the
top<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.489> each<00:00:35.850> other<00:00:36.770> then<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:38.520> they<00:00:38.820> were<00:00:38.879> in

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
top of each other then if they were in

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.460 
top of each other then if they were in
real<00:00:40.289> life<00:00:40.649> they<00:00:40.890> would<00:00:41.039> be<00:00:41.250> casting<00:00:41.789> a<00:00:41.879> shadow

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
real life they would be casting a shadow

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.500 
real life they would be casting a shadow
and<00:00:44.540> so<00:00:45.540> if<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.530> put<00:00:46.740> a<00:00:46.770> shadow<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:48.930> can

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
and so if you put a shadow in you can

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.180 
and so if you put a shadow in you can
emphasize<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.780> under<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.260> over<00:00:52.470> effect<00:00:52.829> so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
emphasize this under and over effect so

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.080 
emphasize this under and over effect so
here<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.360> side<00:00:55.399> then<00:00:56.399> now<00:00:56.790> I'm

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
here just on one side then now I'm

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.940 
here just on one side then now I'm
putting<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:59.720> shadow<00:01:00.720> which<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.410> tailing

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
putting a shadow which is just tailing

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.609 
putting a shadow which is just tailing
off<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.130> little<00:01:02.399> bit<00:01:02.700> there<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:04.079> I<00:01:04.199> repeat

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
off a little bit there and if I repeat

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.210 
off a little bit there and if I repeat
that<00:01:04.649> on<00:01:06.380> all<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:10.369> do<00:01:11.369> very<00:01:12.030> carefully<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:14.100> can

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
that on all of do very carefully you can

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.030 
that on all of do very carefully you can
do<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.520> both<00:01:14.760> sides<00:01:15.120> of<00:01:15.360> your<00:01:15.479> eye<00:01:15.600> doesn't

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
do it on both sides of your eye doesn't

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.510 
do it on both sides of your eye doesn't
will<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.190> helped

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
will be helped

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.910 
will be helped
really

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.359 

so<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.040> helps<00:01:25.400> to<00:01:25.490> sort<00:01:25.820> of<00:01:25.909> lift<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:27.369> strand

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
so it helps to sort of lift the strand

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:38.820 
so it helps to sort of lift the strand
and<00:01:29.979> emphasize<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:33.340> hundred<00:01:34.340> over<00:01:35.740> aspect<00:01:36.740> of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
and emphasize the hundred over aspect of

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:53.320 
and emphasize the hundred over aspect of
these<00:01:41.950> designs<00:01:48.970> really<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.240> should<00:01:52.060> cut<00:01:53.060> now

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
these designs really I should cut now

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.490 
these designs really I should cut now
and<00:01:53.360> finish<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.990> off<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:55.810> show<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.869> complete

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
and finish it off and show you complete

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:08.169 
and finish it off and show you complete
but<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:57.950> can't<00:01:58.310> be<00:01:58.460> bothered

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:26.780 

so<00:02:09.549> maybe<00:02:10.549> there

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.819 

so<00:02:30.200> fish<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.439> trail<00:02:31.709> design<00:02:33.230> complete<00:02:34.230> you

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
so fish and trail design complete you

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:41.179 
so fish and trail design complete you
can<00:02:35.010> also<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:38.819> emphasize<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.840> these<00:02:40.709> designs

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
can also to emphasize the these designs

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.470 
can also to emphasize the these designs
you<00:02:41.489> can<00:02:41.840> put<00:02:42.840> anything<00:02:43.349> which<00:02:43.650> will

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
you can put anything which will

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.910 
you can put anything which will
accentuate<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.930> understand<00:02:46.349> over<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.739> if<00:02:46.829> I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
accentuate the understand over so if I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.009 
accentuate the understand over so if I
put<00:02:47.129> a<00:02:47.159> central<00:02:47.700> line<00:02:47.909> for<00:02:47.970> instance<00:02:51.019> through

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
put a central line for instance through

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.630 
put a central line for instance through
these<00:02:52.230> strands<00:02:52.590> stopping<00:02:53.159> where<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.430> goes

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
these strands stopping where it goes

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.500 
these strands stopping where it goes
under

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.789 

around<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:59.510> can<00:02:59.659> put<00:02:59.840> this<00:02:59.959> line<00:03:00.290> on<00:03:00.530> both

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
around you can put this line on both

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.009 
around you can put this line on both
edges<00:03:01.069> or<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.840> know<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:02.930> central<00:03:03.500> band<00:03:05.019> running

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
edges or you know a central band running

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:23.170 
edges or you know a central band running
around

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.080 

and<00:03:23.689> colors<00:03:24.110> of<00:03:24.290> course<00:03:24.620> once<00:03:25.549> you<00:03:25.730> get<00:03:25.909> into

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
and colors of course once you get into

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.350 
and colors of course once you get into
painting<00:03:26.659> these<00:03:26.810> things<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:28.400> possibilities

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
painting these things the possibilities

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:38.559 
painting these things the possibilities
are<00:03:29.829> infinite<00:03:30.829> raw<00:03:36.909> probably<00:03:37.909> literally

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
are infinite raw probably literally

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.900 
are infinite raw probably literally
infinite

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:50.470 

I'm<00:03:42.510> not<00:03:42.840> quite<00:03:43.260> sure<00:03:43.290> brother

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.940 

nearly<00:03:53.930> I'll<00:03:54.930> bubbled<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.470> bit<00:03:55.620> on<00:03:55.740> one<00:03:55.920> of

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
nearly I'll bubbled a bit on one of

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:04.610 
nearly I'll bubbled a bit on one of
those<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:57.440> never<00:03:58.440> mind<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.540> helps<00:04:04.290> to

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
those but never mind so that helps to

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.570 
those but never mind so that helps to
emphasize<00:04:05.610> just<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.860> single<00:04:07.860> line<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:10.910> now

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
emphasize just that single line so now

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.090 
emphasize just that single line so now
fish<00:04:14.580> on<00:04:14.820> trial<00:04:15.120> design<00:04:17.150> on<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:19.049> break<00:04:19.709> lines
