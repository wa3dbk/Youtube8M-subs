opportunity to see what it is actually
like<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.559> be<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.710> gem<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.280> bucking<00:00:11.550> a

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
like to be a gem of a bucking a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.850 
like to be a gem of a bucking a
cheerleader<00:00:12.030> because<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.960> come<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.830> a

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
cheerleader because we come in we do a

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.829 
cheerleader because we come in we do a
lot<00:00:14.130> we<00:00:14.370> warm<00:00:14.670> up<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.120> then<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.570> straight<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
lot we warm up and then it's straight to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.880 
lot we warm up and then it's straight to
choreography<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:18.380> think<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.619> little

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
choreography I think it's a little

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.130 
choreography I think it's a little
stressful<00:00:20.189> because<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.150> week<00:00:21.330> before<00:00:21.600> we

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
stressful because of the week before we

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.050 
stressful because of the week before we
only<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.680> 30<00:00:22.949> girls<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.550> now<00:00:23.670> we're<00:00:23.880> all

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
only have 30 girls and now we're all

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.290 
only have 30 girls and now we're all
together<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.660> 59<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.470> us<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:26.970> because

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
together all 59 of us and just because

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.300 
together all 59 of us and just because
it's<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.630> end<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.260> all<00:00:28.439> know<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.710> every

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
it's the end and we all know that every

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.099 
it's the end and we all know that every
little<00:00:29.760> move<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.330> every<00:00:30.510> dance<00:00:30.869> really

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
little move and every dance really

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.319 
little move and every dance really
counts<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:32.009> little<00:00:32.430> bit<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.700> extra<00:00:32.969> stress

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
counts so a little bit of extra stress

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.959 
counts so a little bit of extra stress
but<00:00:33.690> also<00:00:33.870> really<00:00:34.350> exciting<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.579> brought<00:00:35.790> them

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
but also really exciting we brought them

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.630 
but also really exciting we brought them
in<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.630> had<00:00:37.500> them<00:00:37.680> dance<00:00:37.890> side<00:00:38.219> by<00:00:38.399> side

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
in and had them dance side by side

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.790 
in and had them dance side by side
that's<00:00:39.510> important<00:00:40.050> too<00:00:40.260> because<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.770> only
