00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.630
 Hello today I am going to present you a small 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:12.309
 review about my knife there is all its 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:14.269
 black this knife is from a blade 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.939
 Spanish 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.680
 it was understood that it was designed in 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.039
 together with the Spanish army since 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.939
 It was custom made and has asked the army 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.369
 Spanish 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.550
 it's more copied knives and more 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:36.020
 invented the world and has been assigned 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.770
 to several to several armies of the world not 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.150
 this this knife costs around 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.280
 90 euros about 120 dollars 110 dollars 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.780
 It depends on when you buy it and where 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.180
 you buy it 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.120
 and good when eating the knife 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.140
 what really brings you is the knife 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.019
 and the case that is made of polycarbonate with 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.390
 fiberglass extras you see by 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:07.650
 I've been adding them here 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.310
 good as I told you the case is of 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.080
 polycarbonate has the typical closure that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.820
 uses the Spanish army there are 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.850
 many items of the Spanish army is 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.590
 very comfortable this closure since this one 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.030
 you can put you can hook the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.810
 knife in the belt without having to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.640
 drop off or take off your belt 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.250
 it's also a very safe closing we have 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.250
 the same closure for the handle is worth 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.080
 and the truth is that it is a very close 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.110
 sure I 've never had problems that 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.810
 the knife came out or moved 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.229
 we go to all the route that the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.229
 knife 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.969
 what you see here I have gone the way 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.539
 adding me this is a small 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:55.070
 lantern that I bought in the decathlon I think 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:58.159
 that it cost me five euros 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.130
 it's fixed and strobe goes with batteries 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.560
 button is tied by half 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.840
 of velcro that the lantern brings 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.600
 interesting this flashlight is that the 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.030
 you can take out and have a clip this 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.200
 I use it internally as much as 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.200
 You all know what I work 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.250
 well what I do many times is the 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.769
 I take out the knife and I hooked it on the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.200
 belt on in the back so if 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.140
 I'm working at night somewhere 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.840
 a bit complicated always always me 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.970
 there may be is not in addition to the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.880
 reflective that I carry over I like 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.310
 I like to carry the flashlight it becomes 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.640
 to place and it is very comfortable and I have three 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.970
 meters of for by 550 three meters 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.510
 ending inter meters and a half 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.320
 and in here I have the magnesium with 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.900
 his flint is worth and here behind his 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.530
 starter as you see the shortstop I've 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.260
 finished in washer just pulling 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.840
 here I have the three meters on hand 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.819
 very fast 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.099
 and well that's pretty much what what 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.620
 I have the case that I have in this 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.410
 knife two and a half or three years now 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.739
 I have used it in the field both in 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:21.319
 camped as in different activities 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:24.469
 first response humanitarian aid 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.239
 of the search and rescue unit or in 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:29.180
 recovery of corpses many times 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.640
 we have to work in the forest then 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.700
 good comes comes pretty good 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.680
 this is the knife itself 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.650
 you can see there are bulls or black 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.269
 there are two versions this is obviously the 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.950
 black bear and then you have the white bear 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.230
 the white bear the leaf is chrome to the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.379
 leaf is white and the mango I think is 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.420
 green is a very comfortable knife very hard 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.769
 very sharp the saw the truth is that 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.709
 it works very well I've had other 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.599
 knives where the saw is 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.010
 purely decorative 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.260
 saw the truth is that it works very 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.540
 well it works very well for how 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.909
 machetero knife or whatever I do to you 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.280
 lack does not have a chance to have 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.879
 which is to leave an animal but 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.040
 I think I would do it pretty well it's not a 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.660
 Full-blade knife is 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.019
 say the sheet ends here 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.810
 as you can see here you have the allen 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.670
 to release the handle that now we 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.560
 we will let you see it but 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.590
 You can also see that the mango is very 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.400
 hard already used it as a hammer and 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.400
 it works pretty well 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.060
 let's drop by here 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.180
 so you can see how it goes inside, not what 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.180
 I drop my eye even though I'm 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.550
 more in favor of having a knife that is 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.470
 full sheet this the truth has not 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:55.210
 disappointed at all 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.690
 we take the with the al in the handle and now 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.510
 is 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.850
 you see that it is not full sheet you do not see 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.990
 which makes you need is needed 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.180
 pinch 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.660
 but you can see that we are 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.070
 dirty is already a little spent today what 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.680
 We are disarming because I'm going to 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.070
 take advantage now between 15 and 20 minutes 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.450
 I'm going to take this opportunity to give you a 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.960
 good cleaning a row dita and oil 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.180
 what and save what I recommend you 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.340
 personally even though this is a 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.020
 knife that used it for work 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:36.760
 I do not like to oil it with oil 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:39.520
 double wb of 40 o with three in one yo 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.160
 I prefer to affect it with olive oil 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.500
 because because then if I have to 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.979
 use the knife for something that I 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.979
 I will eat 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.340
 Well, olive oil obviously does not 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.790
 it's not going to hurt me no and when 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.950
 you are inside in the bush a diarrhea or 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.090
 an upset stomach can be a 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.300
 very big problem 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.590
 and well, this is this is the knife 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.139
 very good knife I recommend it 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.030
 very much is quite big as you can 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.740
 see is a tactical knife 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.900
 and good I hope you liked the 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.900
 video and tell me what do you think
