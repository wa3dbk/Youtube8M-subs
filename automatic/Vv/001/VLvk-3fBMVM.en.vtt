00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:26.950 

target<00:01:23.229> hey<00:01:24.229> okay<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:24.789> you<00:01:25.789> saw<00:01:26.240> in<00:01:26.509> Conrad's

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
target hey okay so you saw in Conrad's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.559 
target hey okay so you saw in Conrad's
example<00:01:27.560> he<00:01:28.219> knew<00:01:28.399> what<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.759> distance<00:01:29.119> was<00:01:29.299> as

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
example he knew what the distance was as

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:34.090 
example he knew what the distance was as
calling<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:29.990> out<00:01:30.109> for<00:01:30.500> 25<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:32.030> 75<00:01:32.829> so<00:01:33.829> then<00:01:34.009> he

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
calling it out for 25 to 75 so then he

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.440 
calling it out for 25 to 75 so then he
was<00:01:34.219> able<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.549> validate<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:35.270> if<00:01:35.360> you

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
was able to validate it so if you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.899 
was able to validate it so if you
haven't<00:01:35.600> have<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.810> spotter<00:01:36.429> if<00:01:37.429> you're<00:01:37.759> hunting

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
haven't have a spotter if you're hunting

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.139 
haven't have a spotter if you're hunting
in<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.209> team<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.770> have<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:40.189> ability<00:01:40.969> for

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
in a team and you have the ability for

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.550 
in a team and you have the ability for
someone<00:01:41.390> have<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.659> laser<00:01:41.899> rangefinder<00:01:42.229> and

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
someone have a laser rangefinder and

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.020 
someone have a laser rangefinder and
validate<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.009> range<00:01:43.219> you<00:01:43.399> can<00:01:43.490> use<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.819> cam

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
validate the range you can use the cam

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.929 
validate the range you can use the cam
to<00:01:44.890> automatically<00:01:45.890> go<00:01:46.069> with<00:01:46.159> range<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:46.729> let's

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
to automatically go with range so let's

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.210 
to automatically go with range so let's
say<00:01:47.090> now<00:01:47.359> we're<00:01:47.959> going<00:01:48.049> to<00:01:48.109> do<00:01:48.289> it<00:01:48.470> where<00:01:48.709> I'm

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
say now we're going to do it where I'm

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.100 
say now we're going to do it where I'm
not<00:01:49.459> going<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.670> look<00:01:49.909> at<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.179> cam<00:01:50.390> I'm<00:01:50.869> going

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
not going to look at the cam I'm going

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.559 
not going to look at the cam I'm going
to<00:01:51.170> frame<00:01:51.880> framing<00:01:52.880> will<00:01:53.030> take<00:01:53.239> a<00:01:53.270> little<00:01:53.479> bit

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
to frame framing will take a little bit

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.569 
to frame framing will take a little bit
of<00:01:53.630> practice<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:54.229> get<00:01:54.469> used<00:01:54.709> to<00:01:54.920> the

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
of practice so you get used to the

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.459 
of practice so you get used to the
thickness<00:01:55.789> of<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.090> crosshairs<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:56.899> being

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
thickness of the crosshairs and being

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.809 
thickness of the crosshairs and being
able<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:58.060> get<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.349> good<00:02:00.349> frame<00:02:00.739> to<00:02:00.979> hit<00:02:01.189> but

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
able to get that good frame to hit but

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.059 
able to get that good frame to hit but
so<00:02:02.719> I'm<00:02:02.810> gonna<00:02:02.899> try<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.079> engage<00:02:03.379> these<00:02:03.560> targets

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
so I'm gonna try to engage these targets

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.819 
so I'm gonna try to engage these targets
successfully<00:02:04.879> without<00:02:05.750> looking<00:02:06.349> at<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.619> cam

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
successfully without looking at the cam

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.949 
successfully without looking at the cam
and<00:02:07.219> simply<00:02:07.640> using<00:02:07.849> the<00:02:08.000> framing<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:08.810> let's

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
and simply using the framing so let's

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:21.370 
and simply using the framing so let's
see<00:02:09.079> how<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.259> works

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:45.490 

at<00:02:22.380> 500<00:02:23.870> ya<00:02:24.870> long<00:02:25.170> reason

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:55.340 

it

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:33.290 

it

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:44.339 

a<00:03:34.300> lot<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.959> bad<00:03:35.140> guys<00:03:35.379> down<00:03:40.440> nice<00:03:42.420> sweet<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:44.200> in

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
a lot of bad guys down nice sweet so in

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.140 
a lot of bad guys down nice sweet so in
that<00:03:44.470> situation<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.459> was<00:03:45.730> going<00:03:45.940> back<00:03:46.120> and

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
that situation I was going back and

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.449 
that situation I was going back and
forth<00:03:46.450> back<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.690> forth<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.709> notice<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.130> kept

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
forth back and forth you notice I kept

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.910 
forth back and forth you notice I kept
my<00:03:48.610> hand<00:03:49.030> on<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:50.550> cam<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.580> entire<00:03:52.090> time<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.920> did

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
my hand on the cam the entire time I did

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.180 
my hand on the cam the entire time I did
not<00:03:53.950> use<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.970> tint<00:03:55.569> power<00:03:55.810> option<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.860> can

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
not use the tint power option I can

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.850 
not use the tint power option I can
disengage<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:58.299> then<00:03:58.870> zoom<00:03:59.170> into<00:03:59.349> ten<00:03:59.650> power

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
disengage and then zoom into ten power

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.740 
disengage and then zoom into ten power
I'm<00:04:00.310> going<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.519> do<00:04:00.640> one<00:04:00.849> with<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.180> as<00:04:01.360> well<00:04:01.510> so

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
I'm going to do one with that as well so

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.300 
I'm going to do one with that as well so
you<00:04:01.810> can<00:04:01.870> kind<00:04:02.049> of<00:04:02.080> see<00:04:02.260> if<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:02.860> had<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.010> little

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
you can kind of see if I had a little

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.180 
you can kind of see if I had a little
bit<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.459> time<00:04:03.670> by<00:04:04.510> by<00:04:05.230> having<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.680> do<00:04:05.830> that<00:04:05.980> and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
bit of time by by having to do that and

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.600 
bit of time by by having to do that and
zoom<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.580> but<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:07.530> was<00:04:08.530> able<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.769> successfully

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
zoom it but I was able to successfully

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.089 
zoom it but I was able to successfully
engage<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.329> targets<00:04:10.810> back<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.739> forth<00:04:11.890> back

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
engage the targets back and forth back

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.460 
engage the targets back and forth back
and<00:04:12.130> forth<00:04:12.340> without<00:04:13.180> looking<00:04:13.660> at<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> cam<00:04:14.079> and

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
and forth without looking at the cam and

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.420 
and forth without looking at the cam and
simply<00:04:14.980> using<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.180> framing<00:04:16.630> mechanism

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
simply using the the framing mechanism

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.080 
simply using the the framing mechanism
so<00:04:18.430> let's<00:04:18.760> do<00:04:18.880> one<00:04:19.120> more<00:04:19.329> with<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:21.000> where<00:04:22.000> I'm

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
so let's do one more with the where I'm

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.180 
so let's do one more with the where I'm
going<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.330> use<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.930> manual<00:04:23.380> mode<00:04:23.590> or

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
going to use the manual mode or

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.830 
going to use the manual mode or
basically<00:04:24.550> use<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:24.970> cam<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.419> frame<00:04:25.660> the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
basically use the cam to frame the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.379 
basically use the cam to frame the
target<00:04:26.260> or<00:04:26.410> if<00:04:26.620> I<00:04:26.710> had<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.860> spotter<00:04:27.300> telling<00:04:28.300> me

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
target or if I had a spotter telling me

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.230 
target or if I had a spotter telling me
the<00:04:28.510> known<00:04:28.690> distance<00:04:29.110> then<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:29.770> can<00:04:30.010> zoom<00:04:30.970> back

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
the known distance then I can zoom back

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.650 
the known distance then I can zoom back
and<00:04:31.450> forth<00:04:32.370> using<00:04:33.370> this<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.150> how<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.479> do

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
and forth using this and and how to do

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.520 
and forth using this and and how to do
it<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.380> trick<00:04:35.620> is<00:04:35.650> real<00:04:36.340> quick<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:37.600> has<00:04:38.289> to

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
it so the trick is real quick it has to

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.060 
it so the trick is real quick it has to
be<00:04:38.680> coupled<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:40.300> notice<00:04:40.720> here<00:04:41.080> how<00:04:41.260> I've<00:04:41.770> got

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
be coupled so notice here how I've got

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.779 
be coupled so notice here how I've got
the<00:04:43.530> how<00:04:44.530> they're<00:04:44.740> coupled<00:04:44.979> there<00:04:45.340> that

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
the how they're coupled there that

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.270 
the how they're coupled there that
allows<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.570> actually<00:04:46.720> turn<00:04:47.139> the<00:04:47.830> camming

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
allows you to actually turn the camming

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.590 
allows you to actually turn the camming
system<00:04:48.780> now<00:04:49.780> when<00:04:50.440> I<00:04:50.470> disengage<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.610> can<00:04:52.389> just

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
system now when I disengage I can just

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.719 
system now when I disengage I can just
pull<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:52.930> back<00:04:53.080> towards<00:04:53.530> me<00:04:53.680> and<00:04:54.100> then<00:04:54.370> use<00:04:54.550> the

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
pull it back towards me and then use the

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.770 
pull it back towards me and then use the
zoom<00:04:54.970> ring<00:04:56.639> independently<00:04:57.639> of<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.030> cam<00:04:58.270> so

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
zoom ring independently of the cam so

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
zoom ring independently of the cam so
that's<00:04:58.960> what<00:04:59.080> I'm<00:04:59.169> going<00:04:59.289> to<00:04:59.350> do<00:04:59.470> in<00:04:59.620> this<00:04:59.740> next

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
that's what I'm going to do in this next

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.210 
that's what I'm going to do in this next
one<00:05:00.250> I'm<00:05:00.910> gonna<00:05:01.120> I'll<00:05:02.050> frame<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.560> target<00:05:03.039> and

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
one I'm gonna I'll frame the target and

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.159 
one I'm gonna I'll frame the target and
then<00:05:03.789> I<00:05:03.820> will<00:05:05.610> disengage<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.150> use<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.960> zoom

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
then I will disengage and use the zoom

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.159 
then I will disengage and use the zoom
so<00:05:08.860> all<00:05:09.760> right

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
so all right

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:24.029 
so all right
so<00:05:11.430> let's<00:05:12.430> try<00:05:12.669> this<00:05:19.560> okay<00:05:20.590> targets<00:05:21.129> up<00:05:21.340> at<00:05:23.039> 425

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
so let's try this okay targets up at 425

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:34.170 
so let's try this okay targets up at 425
meters<00:05:24.490> go<00:05:25.270> on<00:05:25.419> to<00:05:25.539> ten<00:05:25.779> power<00:05:32.909> probably<00:05:33.909> need

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
meters go on to ten power probably need

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:44.260 
meters go on to ten power probably need
safety<00:05:34.509> off

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:51.100 

target<00:05:45.410> okay<00:05:46.410> going<00:05:46.620> back<00:05:47.300> engaging<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.540> cam

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:06:02.980 

coming<00:05:52.110> back<00:05:52.260> to<00:05:52.380> short<00:05:52.620> range<00:05:55.010> I'll<00:05:56.010> zoom<00:05:56.400> in

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:10.250 

Donegan<00:06:04.340> reengage<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.520> cam<00:06:06.860> turn<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:09.020> cam<00:06:10.020> to

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
Donegan reengage the cam turn the cam to

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:19.040 
Donegan reengage the cam turn the cam to
frame<00:06:10.470> the<00:06:10.620> target<00:06:16.460> get<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:17.490> good<00:06:17.700> frame<00:06:18.050> turn

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
frame the target get a good frame turn

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:34.480 
frame the target get a good frame turn
it<00:06:19.230> to<00:06:19.290> 10<00:06:19.500> power<00:06:30.590> target<00:06:32.330> come<00:06:33.330> back

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
it to 10 power target come back

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:43.010 
it to 10 power target come back
engage<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:35.700> can<00:06:39.620> came<00:06:40.620> out<00:06:41.870> get<00:06:42.870> it<00:06:42.990> good

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
engage the can came out get it good

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:53.210 
engage the can came out get it good
frame<00:06:43.880> zoom<00:06:44.880> into<00:06:45.150> 10<00:06:50.150> target<00:06:51.150> go<00:06:51.450> back<00:06:52.220> engage

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
frame zoom into 10 target go back engage

00:06:53.220 --> 00:07:11.410 
frame zoom into 10 target go back engage
the<00:06:53.430> cam<00:06:55.580> get<00:06:56.580> a<00:06:56.610> good<00:06:56.820> frame<00:07:03.020> zoom<00:07:04.020> in

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:11.420 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.800 

and<00:07:12.420> hit<00:07:12.660> the<00:07:12.690> target<00:07:14.180> so<00:07:15.180> you<00:07:15.240> can<00:07:15.570> see<00:07:15.720> it

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810 
and hit the target so you can see it

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.930 
and hit the target so you can see it
added<00:07:15.990> a<00:07:16.170> little<00:07:16.230> bit<00:07:16.410> of<00:07:16.470> time<00:07:16.790> but<00:07:17.790> the

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
added a little bit of time but the

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.450 
added a little bit of time but the
options<00:07:18.300> there<00:07:18.540> of<00:07:19.110> being<00:07:19.410> able<00:07:19.590> to<00:07:19.770> either

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
options there of being able to either

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.320 
options there of being able to either
use<00:07:20.850> it<00:07:21.110> with<00:07:22.110> the<00:07:22.290> cam<00:07:22.770> ring<00:07:23.070> and<00:07:23.400> the<00:07:24.030> zoom

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330 
use it with the cam ring and the zoom

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.350 
use it with the cam ring and the zoom
ring<00:07:24.540> slave<00:07:24.900> to<00:07:25.260> each<00:07:25.350> other<00:07:25.590> or<00:07:26.070> you<00:07:27.030> can<00:07:27.180> use

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 
ring slave to each other or you can use

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.200 
ring slave to each other or you can use
them<00:07:27.480> independently<00:07:28.550> let's<00:07:29.550> say<00:07:29.730> I<00:07:29.760> knew<00:07:30.060> out

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
them independently let's say I knew out

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.180 
them independently let's say I knew out
what<00:07:30.540> distance<00:07:30.930> I<00:07:31.050> was<00:07:31.170> shooting<00:07:31.560> at<00:07:31.740> if<00:07:32.040> I

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.190 
what distance I was shooting at if I

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.810 
what distance I was shooting at if I
wanted<00:07:32.610> to<00:07:33.350> tighten<00:07:34.350> down<00:07:34.670> make<00:07:35.670> sure<00:07:35.700> I

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:35.820 
wanted to tighten down make sure I

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.050 
wanted to tighten down make sure I
didn't<00:07:36.120> accidentally<00:07:36.860> move<00:07:37.860> the<00:07:38.040> cam<00:07:38.280> when<00:07:39.030> I

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
didn't accidentally move the cam when I

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.240 
didn't accidentally move the cam when I
was<00:07:39.300> playing<00:07:39.600> with<00:07:39.690> the<00:07:39.900> zoom<00:07:40.110> ring<00:07:40.350> I<00:07:40.710> can<00:07:40.890> use

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.250 
was playing with the zoom ring I can use

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.990 
was playing with the zoom ring I can use
the<00:07:41.430> locking<00:07:42.090> screw<00:07:42.980> codenamed<00:07:43.980> Bolan<00:07:44.550> screw

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 
the locking screw codenamed Bolan screw

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.950 
the locking screw codenamed Bolan screw
but<00:07:46.100> you<00:07:47.100> can<00:07:47.280> lock<00:07:47.460> down<00:07:47.640> the<00:07:47.880> the<00:07:48.390> the

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 
but you can lock down the the the

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.420 
but you can lock down the the the
locking<00:07:49.320> screw<00:07:49.440> here<00:07:49.680> which<00:07:49.740> locks<00:07:50.130> the<00:07:50.220> cam

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.430 
locking screw here which locks the cam

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.400 
locking screw here which locks the cam
and<00:07:50.700> that<00:07:50.820> way<00:07:50.940> it<00:07:51.120> won't<00:07:51.240> accidentally<00:07:51.960> or

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.410 
and that way it won't accidentally or

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.260 
and that way it won't accidentally or
inadvertently<00:07:53.070> twist<00:07:53.460> when<00:07:54.030> you're

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:54.270 
inadvertently twist when you're

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.260 
inadvertently twist when you're
disengaging<00:07:55.020> the<00:07:55.380> cam<00:07:55.680> ring<00:07:55.890> but<00:07:56.460> obviously<00:07:57.180> I

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:57.270 
disengaging the cam ring but obviously I

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.350 
disengaging the cam ring but obviously I
didn't<00:07:57.600> do<00:07:57.690> that<00:07:57.720> I<00:07:58.680> was<00:07:59.220> trying<00:07:59.520> to<00:07:59.700> go<00:08:00.120> for<00:08:00.330> a

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 
didn't do that I was trying to go for a

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.530 
didn't do that I was trying to go for a
little<00:08:00.540> bit<00:08:00.630> of<00:08:00.720> speed<00:08:00.990> there<00:08:01.370> but<00:08:02.370> again<00:08:02.640> the

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:03.540 
little bit of speed there but again the

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.120 
little bit of speed there but again the
value<00:08:03.900> of<00:08:04.020> the<00:08:04.140> cam<00:08:04.350> the<00:08:04.530> value<00:08:04.950> of<00:08:05.040> the

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.130 
value of the cam the value of the

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.560

math<00:08:07.230> we've<00:08:07.800> got<00:08:07.980> the<00:08:08.100> no<00:08:08.250> mass<00:08:08.430> mil-dot<00:08:08.910> in

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 
math we've got the no mass mil-dot in

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.720 
math we've got the no mass mil-dot in
here<00:08:09.420> so<00:08:10.050> you<00:08:10.110> frame<00:08:10.410> that<00:08:10.530> 18<00:08:10.830> inches<00:08:11.100> you<00:08:11.580> can

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:11.730 
here so you frame that 18 inches you can

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.310 
here so you frame that 18 inches you can
look<00:08:11.970> at<00:08:12.120> the<00:08:12.270> top<00:08:12.600> of<00:08:12.630> the<00:08:12.780> scope<00:08:13.020> and<00:08:13.170> it'll

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.320 
look at the top of the scope and it'll

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.790 
look at the top of the scope and it'll
tell<00:08:13.470> you<00:08:13.590> what<00:08:13.710> the<00:08:13.860> range<00:08:14.040> is<00:08:14.250> so<00:08:15.030> a<00:08:15.770> lot<00:08:16.770> of

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 
tell you what the range is so a lot of

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.300 
tell you what the range is so a lot of
fun<00:08:17.070> hope<00:08:17.700> you<00:08:17.820> guys<00:08:17.970> enjoyed
