to sleep really well if you see better
than<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.579> thought<00:01:00.680> this<00:01:01.680> stem<00:01:01.980> end<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.370> even

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
than I thought this stem end and even

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.250 
than I thought this stem end and even
with<00:01:02.670> two<00:01:02.850> pair<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> glasses<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.600> can't<00:01:03.629> see<00:01:03.960> any

with two pair of glasses I can't see any

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.950 
with two pair of glasses I can't see any
hair<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:04.909> roots<00:01:05.909> coming<00:01:06.299> out<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.720> year

hair like roots coming out of this year

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.289 
hair like roots coming out of this year

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
so I have not yet determined what I'm

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.990 
so I have not yet determined what I'm
not<00:01:09.510> doing<00:01:09.810> right<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.439> know<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.430> temperatures

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
not doing right I know the temperatures

got<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> lot<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> why<00:01:13.979> I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
got a lot to do with it which is why I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.340 
got a lot to do with it which is why I
brought<00:01:14.070> him<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> house<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.689> did<00:01:16.080> get

I went outside and 30 getting my tennis
shoes<00:01:56.880> wet<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.570> grass<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> backyard

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
shoes wet in the grass in the backyard

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.969 
shoes wet in the grass in the backyard
but<00:01:58.740> um<00:01:59.869> took<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> look<00:02:01.140> at<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> grapevine

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
but um took a look at the grapevine

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.340 
but um took a look at the grapevine
outside<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.969> see<00:02:03.090> if<00:02:03.119> there's<00:02:03.360> any<00:02:03.509> buds

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
outside to see if there's any buds

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.609 
outside to see if there's any buds
breaking<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.570> vine<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.020> even<00:02:07.380> though<00:02:07.469> we

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
breaking on the vine and even though we

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.619 
breaking on the vine and even though we
had<00:02:07.829> 62<00:02:08.250> degrees<00:02:08.520> yesterday<00:02:08.940> they<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.479> not

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
had 62 degrees yesterday they are not

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.979 
had 62 degrees yesterday they are not
starting<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> break<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.760> so<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:12.390> think<00:02:12.810> it's

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
starting to break you so I think it's

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.520 
starting to break you so I think it's
probably

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
probably

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.680 
probably
not<00:02:14.040> too<00:02:14.580> late<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.030> probably<00:02:15.360> should<00:02:15.420> have

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
not too late it probably should have

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.960 
not too late it probably should have
pruned<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.290> little<00:02:16.530> earlier<00:02:16.920> somebody<00:02:17.670> fill<00:02:17.940> me

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
pruned a little earlier somebody fill me

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.260 
pruned a little earlier somebody fill me
in<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.420> if<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.900> will<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:20.940> don't<00:02:21.180> think

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
in on that if you will but I don't think

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.270 
in on that if you will but I don't think
it's<00:02:21.450> too<00:02:21.630> late<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.959> prune<00:02:22.260> my<00:02:22.410> grapevine<00:02:22.650> so

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
it's too late to prune my grapevine so

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.840 
it's too late to prune my grapevine so
i'll<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.520> doing<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.300> when<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.860> fir

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
i'll be doing that and when the the fir

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.240 
i'll be doing that and when the the fir
trees<00:02:26.880> are<00:02:27.300> pruned<00:02:27.630> i<00:02:27.900> think<00:02:28.410> i<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:28.890> there's

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
trees are pruned i think i think there's

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.050 
trees are pruned i think i think there's
a<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.959> two<00:02:30.959> different<00:02:31.319> apple<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.069> cherry<00:02:32.910> i

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
a and two different apple and a cherry i

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.309 
a and two different apple and a cherry i
would<00:02:33.300> really<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.750> have<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.900> beach<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.230> a

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
would really like to have a beach in a

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.010 
would really like to have a beach in a
pair<00:02:34.560> i<00:02:35.180> think<00:02:36.180> i'm<00:02:36.300> going<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.480> try<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> same

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
