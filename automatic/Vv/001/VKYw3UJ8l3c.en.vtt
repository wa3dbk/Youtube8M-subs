00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.220

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.760
 there 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.630
 Today's video is a super hair 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.830
 super feminine so it is easy to do and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.500
 It's the hair that I think a lot of people 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.200
 You'll like it because it's loose hair and it 's not 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.080
 loose hair loose hair easy but 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.540
 with face to comb the lateral hair with 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.720
 dengue so neither perfect on the side 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.689
 all pulled by the side with curls 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 evolved and finished to go to a 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.340
 wedding at graduation I used hair already 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.930
 I used it several times for this kind of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.790
 party and I think it's beautiful 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.860
 then comes to talk with us come 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.079
 tutorial then start girls go 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.850
 start with a babyliss in which a micron 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.250
 and if you can be drunk you have 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.880
 home, will you try to play hair? 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.560
 most you get left already 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.850
 thinking of a result that you 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.649
 either end 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.740
 in my case Finland will see that I 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.659
 I do in the end I left everything 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.149
 the decon mirror and leave a little bit to 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.090
 here too but the important thing is you get 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.149
 the hair but there all to the side that 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.459
 You want it to look good, but to 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.040
 the right side is important for whom 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.590
 There is a lot of hair, it's important that you 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.750
 have to turn as much as you can 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.830
 hair to the side of here 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.200
 How much less hair do you have on this side? 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.470
 The harder it is to stay coming back then 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.140
 who has a lot of hair is have to look for 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.650
 try to do this, I will not use my self 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.569
 I'm going to put it, just go to 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.549
 left because when I chose the side 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.840
 left eye hair for 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.730
 out 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.400
 the same thing that makes you choose the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.510
 opposite right to health is out 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.000
 on the right side 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.549
 if your normal beauty you will only 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.489
 simply make your probe is off 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.940
 So I'm going to get a lock of the 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.549
 hair start coming in 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.750
 I'm going to make the bunch just in the 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.840
 trim 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.780
 so if I do now only if I do 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.510
 babyliss one're down here taking the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.390
 root at the time I knew bunch here 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.400
 in sinop it will be curly and will not 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.350
 give an element that I want 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.560
 so I 'll get a good air cache 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.970
 only what I perceive I see 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.970
 That will be quiet here. 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.120
 Now we 're getting here in the 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.040
 front 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.040
 here we give a whimsy in 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.710
 and the last strand neither in front 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.490
 so people look people look here too 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.540
 here is a piece of my hair is 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.430
 smooth because at the time we had seen 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.609
 this area here 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.130
 he tries to box back here until the hair 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.170
 It 's important that you turn around. 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.930
 I'll let the hair cool a little 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.510
 not to lose the curls and to hold 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.520
 cashew is not to touch his hair while he 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.160
 throw the people ready now the hair 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.890
 chilled and itaú another dog says no hair 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.040
 is back we talk moves to 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.980
 head and does not tend to come back and fall 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.310
 back then following another car you will 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.100
 see the hair all over and get this 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.240
 first wick than the next max in your 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.090
 also a thick little march 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.910
 until nothing too thin because that hair 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.850
 need to be weighed because when this 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.490
 first mecha weighs down here 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.950
 she will not let the rest of her hair come back 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.460
 I'll get the name of silicone I think 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.410
 that silicone and I'll learn it well 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.100
 close to the neck so it does not 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.100
 show up 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.480
 Then he mixes down the beautiful one. 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.940
 very close to the neck and in my case people 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.390
 As my fringe is short I go 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.580
 play all the way and I'll hit the spray 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.520
 for her to fix the same place I did not 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.460
 I want to get you falling over the party. 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.190
 use and if it spreads that if the key at 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.740
 of the safe which is very good in supernatural 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.560
 I will play all the hair there pinching 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.560
 he leave the way I want 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:00.600
 from a distance I 'm going to loose a little bit 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:06.330
 these bunches just a little bit and I'm going to hit 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:09.240
 lurks them firmly in place and 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.030

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.900
 so that this side that looks good 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:28.040
 Latin without war in the head 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:28.040
 Even the rain comes very well . 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.790
