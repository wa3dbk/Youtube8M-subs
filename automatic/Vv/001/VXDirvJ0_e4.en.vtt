00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.660 
set or intrigue you can buy prosperity
and<00:02:38.840> that's<00:02:38.960> your<00:02:39.110> only<00:02:39.260> set<00:02:39.710> I<00:02:39.920> don't<00:02:40.460> know<00:02:40.580> if

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
and that's your only set I don't know if

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.640 
and that's your only set I don't know if
I<00:02:40.760> would<00:02:40.940> recommend<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:41.990> or<00:02:42.290> if<00:02:42.350> that's<00:02:42.440> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
I would recommend that or if that's the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.190 
I would recommend that or if that's the
best<00:02:42.770> thing<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.250> do<00:02:43.430> but<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.300> is<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.840> neat

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
best thing to do but it is it is a neat

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.850 
best thing to do but it is it is a neat
addition<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:47.080> possibility<00:02:48.080> but<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.680> would

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
addition that possibility but I would

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.080 
addition that possibility but I would
assume<00:02:49.040> most<00:02:49.100> people<00:02:49.610> will<00:02:49.700> do<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:49.940> just

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
assume most people will do it just

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.970 
assume most people will do it just
because<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.390> how<00:02:50.600> nice<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.200> new<00:02:51.320> cards<00:02:51.710> look

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
because of how nice the new cards look

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.830 
because of how nice the new cards look
and<00:02:52.190> how<00:02:52.670> also<00:02:53.030> well<00:02:53.180> they're<00:02:53.300> not<00:02:53.390> all<00:02:53.450> beat

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
and how also well they're not all beat

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.260 
and how also well they're not all beat
up<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.620> from<00:02:55.340> all<00:02:55.610> those<00:02:55.790> times<00:02:56.120> that

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
up and and from all those times that

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.850 
up and and from all those times that
you've<00:02:56.450> shuffled<00:02:56.690> your<00:02:56.990> copper<00:02:57.350> rosin<00:02:57.620> near

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
you've shuffled your copper rosin near

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.640 
you've shuffled your copper rosin near
your<00:02:58.340> silver<00:02:58.850> because<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.870> cards<00:03:00.200> do<00:03:00.410> get

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
your silver because the cards do get

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.050 
your silver because the cards do get
beat<00:03:00.860> up<00:03:01.010> after<00:03:01.190> everyday<00:03:01.700> you're<00:03:01.850> shuffling

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
beat up after everyday you're shuffling

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.350 
beat up after everyday you're shuffling
them<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.720> but<00:03:03.470> now<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.710> the<00:03:04.310> nicer<00:03:04.760> ones<00:03:05.030> I

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
them and but now the the nicer ones I

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.120 
them and but now the the nicer ones I
think<00:03:05.750> will<00:03:06.110> fit<00:03:06.260> into<00:03:06.410> your<00:03:06.560> deck<00:03:06.800> much

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
think will fit into your deck much

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.480 
think will fit into your deck much
better<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:08.630> is<00:03:09.170> worth<00:03:09.470> getting<00:03:09.770> well<00:03:10.310> for

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
better so it is worth getting well for

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.970 
better so it is worth getting well for
me<00:03:10.580> yes<00:03:10.940> for<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.480> functionality<00:03:11.960> or<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:12.920> a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
me yes for the functionality or just a

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.800 
me yes for the functionality or just a
prettiness<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.790> makes<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.300> game<00:03:14.450> look<00:03:14.630> so

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
prettiness it makes it the game look so

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.810 
prettiness it makes it the game look so
much<00:03:14.930> better<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.440> force<00:03:16.340> if<00:03:16.490> someone<00:03:16.730> has

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
much better and force if someone has

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.610 
much better and force if someone has
never<00:03:16.880> played<00:03:17.090> before<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:18.320> they<00:03:18.410> want<00:03:18.590> to

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
never played before but they want to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.290 
never played before but they want to
start<00:03:18.830> with<00:03:19.010> prosperity<00:03:19.700> that's<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.120> good

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
start with prosperity that's a good

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.850 
start with prosperity that's a good
choice<00:03:20.480> although<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.870> think<00:03:21.170> that's<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.440> smaller

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
choice although I think that's a smaller

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.770 
choice although I think that's a smaller
subset<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.430> people<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.850> think<00:03:23.330> most<00:03:23.510> people<00:03:23.720> are

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
subset of people I think most people are

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.850 
subset of people I think most people are
gonna<00:03:23.870> get<00:03:24.050> them<00:03:24.170> just<00:03:24.350> because<00:03:24.470> they<00:03:24.650> look<00:03:24.830> so

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
gonna get them just because they look so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.100 
gonna get them just because they look so
good<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.430> or<00:03:26.000> because<00:03:26.150> their<00:03:26.510> cards<00:03:26.810> are<00:03:26.930> all

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
good and or because their cards are all

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.590 
good and or because their cards are all
beat<00:03:27.320> up<00:03:27.350> if<00:03:28.040> that's<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.520> then<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.240> want<00:03:29.510> this

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
beat up if that's you then you want this
