can use this one instead so for games

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.960

like<00:01:07.210> Call<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.630> Duty<00:01:08.140> that<00:01:08.530> are<00:01:08.680> played<00:01:08.970> this

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
like Call of Duty that are played this

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.240 
like Call of Duty that are played this
is<00:01:10.210> actually<00:01:10.570> easier<00:01:10.990> than<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:11.409> one<00:01:11.710> but<00:01:12.100> if

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
is actually easier than this one but if

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.760 
is actually easier than this one but if
you<00:01:12.280> really<00:01:12.790> like<00:01:12.939> let's<00:01:13.240> say<00:01:13.450> Pokemon<00:01:14.260> then

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
you really like let's say Pokemon then

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.730 
you really like let's say Pokemon then
maybe<00:01:15.189> you<00:01:15.640> would<00:01:15.760> like<00:01:15.939> to<00:01:16.000> keep<00:01:16.420> this<00:01:16.659> one<00:01:16.740> so

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
maybe you would like to keep this one so

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.969 
maybe you would like to keep this one so
I<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.299> bit<00:01:19.540> skeptical<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.290> it<00:01:20.380> comes<00:01:20.650> to

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
I was a bit skeptical and it comes to

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.100 
I was a bit skeptical and it comes to
the<00:01:21.189> 3d<00:01:21.610> thing<00:01:22.000> because<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.360> was<00:01:22.479> like<00:01:22.659> okay<00:01:23.080> so

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
the 3d thing because I was like okay so

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.770 
the 3d thing because I was like okay so
how<00:01:23.500> could<00:01:23.740> they<00:01:23.860> actually<00:01:24.009> put<00:01:24.490> such<00:01:24.759> a<00:01:24.790> small

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
how could they actually put such a small

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.469 
how could they actually put such a small
3d<00:01:26.320> effect<00:01:26.950> in<00:01:27.250> something<00:01:27.759> like<00:01:27.909> this<00:01:28.150> and

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
3d effect in something like this and

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.840 
3d effect in something like this and
then<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.909> one<00:01:31.119> of<00:01:31.240> my<00:01:31.390> classmate<00:01:31.900> had<00:01:32.200> the

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.690 
yeah but I got the Freedia somehow and
the<00:01:58.380> good<00:01:58.590> thing<00:01:58.800> about<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.190> is<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the good thing about it is that if you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.690 
the good thing about it is that if you
lift<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.360> button<00:02:00.810> up<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.440> turns<00:02:01.800> on<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.550> now

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
lift this button up it turns on so now

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.270 
lift this button up it turns on so now
it's<00:02:02.820> actually<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.170> lift<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.680> down

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
it's actually on and if you lift it down

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.480 
it's actually on and if you lift it down
then<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.820> off<00:02:06.120> and<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:07.470> only<00:02:07.770> trick<00:02:08.070> with<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
then it's off and the only trick with it

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.880 
then it's off and the only trick with it
is<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.880> basically<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.660> put<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.050> at<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
is to basically just put it like at the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.540 
is to basically just put it like at the
right<00:02:11.720> distance<00:02:12.720> from<00:02:13.440> your<00:02:13.620> eyes<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.310> then

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
right distance from your eyes and then

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.730 
right distance from your eyes and then
like<00:02:14.850> look<00:02:15.210> straight<00:02:15.600> because<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.500> sure

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
like look straight because it's sure

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.560 
like look straight because it's sure
that<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.160> look<00:02:17.370> from<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:17.880> one<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.390> the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
that if you look from like one of the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.170 
that if you look from like one of the
sides<00:02:18.840> then<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.710> looks<00:02:20.010> really<00:02:20.370> blurry<00:02:20.730> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
sides then it looks really blurry and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.000 
sides then it looks really blurry and
not<00:02:21.390> clear<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:21.900> if<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.200> look<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.590> straight

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
not clear but if you look it straight

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.880 
not clear but if you look it straight
and<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.700> at<00:02:24.150> least<00:02:24.600> 20<00:02:25.050> centimeters<00:02:25.680> away

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
and like at least 20 centimeters away

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.130 
and like at least 20 centimeters away
then<00:02:26.310> it's<00:02:26.459> really<00:02:26.730> fine<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.690> actually

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
then it's really fine and it's actually

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.449 
then it's really fine and it's actually
a<00:02:28.170> really<00:02:28.260> really<00:02:28.709> good<00:02:30.560> 3d<00:02:31.560> effect<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.250> it's

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
a really really good 3d effect and it's

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.270 
a really really good 3d effect and it's
I<00:02:33.000> don't<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.930> anything<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.470> say<00:02:34.650> about<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:35.070> I
