00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.190
 runs to think it is this week to take a look at the five women 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.869
 you can check walking in the netherlands 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:12.969
 and welcome the freedom of the press and a little team to ride that is really awful 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.449
 ill 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.150
 deventer own keeper 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.150
 and we would like to show why 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.349
 I'm actually getting a bit out of hand 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.029
 the owners wanted to crawl that means that companies like in the Netherlands 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.210
 stay 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.749
 I think the card 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.580
 hr but who want to look, says meijer 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.060
 use of computer center at a good time the market overlooks club art 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.090
 which are then very easy back to enjoy beautiful 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.920
 materials the court present at yes I recommend the internet 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.250
 we know each other what i have both times in each other then get the name can 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.700
 being refused within the church should the card be here is not me 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 used interior spreading the driving 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.030
 so you can also do that very annoyingly the suspected victim the room 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.820
 is about powers that threaten 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.560
 we follow madonna for a different appearance being refused i have one 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.740
 large group is produced Sint Truiden time to make the items 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.380
 but then take some time yes 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.620
 that had been too large as the main color apparently a closed door was this one 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.689
 we noticed that there is also a lot of power because then you get that one 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.100
 Little bit to set up once you are there is no question of more than twice 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.380
 yellow yes seems very nice 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.380
 wait there 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.740
 If you start running and you have never done it very wisely 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.770
 to bring a contract I once made a demonstration model respectfully 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.140
 then not decided 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.009
 then say about, for example, during a game 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.150
 run on it 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 knitting the pearl 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.580
 try it out first 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.260
 know then be achieved 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.590
 this is thanks to his victory where it was an evening approach and it all seems 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.940
 very complicated actually it is incredibly simple what there are several 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.020
 prizes with two voices rightly henk hagoort 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.909
 if you choose etc ect it can no longer piece who has been time out for a while 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.730
 The first action you need to do is to stop the lex stitches 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.979
 after all and lierse 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.689
 woods faithful 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.359
 the committee naked 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.439
 the list that the reason 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.580
 the traffic is diverted 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.549
 cap off 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.620
 those two days later so they are sitting there against the elements it touches and 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.150
 jazz they find utrecht another salt on March 3 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.249
 you first get through the project support for a while 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.539
 also attainable with the two osn 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.759
 I've got it will look like 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.119
 i think i say objective or not 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:01.859
 the first half of a number of prizes did not matter the first 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.299
 On line they always had a mess of suspicion from the hotel 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:05.769
 has 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.949
 the other to the fact that is the approach anyone can vote through quarterly 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.239
 it can know 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.509
 the first stitch jack sweres 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.069
 in stabbing 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.829
 fired by earth 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.840
 I looked at the square very very rich you can in this time 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.090
 view it yourself and the number of places is limited to those that include pain 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.019
 top 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.310
 8 I have lost time at over percent 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.950
 talking to other people 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.039
 coffee drink wine coffee 3 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.579
 but watch TV 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.489
 the computer can 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.700
 first speaks of a separate orphan just nice tea on the a4 is just the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.059
 willingness to move in the direction of utrecht 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:52.409
 yes i was late 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.409
 clear and the front the work 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.349
 it actually touches the design 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.469
 we stick the needle 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.469
 who is the same as an extreme 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.729
 so everything else is 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.909
 she had to explain 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.150
 since the dragon sails again just among those perpetrators 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.889
 so pull it down 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.329
 perform this act 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.069
 so have saturday 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:26.139
 plugging in at the back saving going backwards clearing 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.590
 it even seems very simple to me and Schede does not find it simple at all 

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:35.379
 almost every city and certainly the major cities of Kerkdijk seemed like a party for a while 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.180
 come together that day everyone is welcome there sit madam they like them 

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:43.740
 here also to sit one and I drink much better in another and also a lot 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.800
 better was the pain that did not fall in prices and I am always willing to help you 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.490
 to explain ultimately must do
