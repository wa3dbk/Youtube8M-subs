 the interior fittings are available only in color

 increase protection in the event of a side impact 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.400
 911 gt3 rs is driven by the same engine that has already shown all the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.129
 its potential 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.869
 6-liter boxer box film engine

 415 tripod 105 kilovat of maximum torque of 400 5 mm 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.369
 the maximum speed of both models 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.369
 edit 110 kilometers per hour 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.069
 911 gt3 rs weighs about 20 kilograms - of the 911 gt3 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.750
 the weight power ratio and therefore of sonic 3, 31 kilograms horse 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.109
 to shoot from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.790
 I need a tenth of a second less than just four, two seconds 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.999
 in both models these new powers are transferred to the road 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:25.279
 thanks to a precise 6-speed manual gearbox 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:31.579
 while 911 gt3 is equipped with a dual mass flywheel 911 gt3 rs is used 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.359
 a mono-mass flywheel that is particularly suited to withstand the strong 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.279
 stresses 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:36.349
 the news on the track 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.769
 its extremely reduced weight significantly increases the high efficiency of the 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:40.290
 engine 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.010
 especially in the first 3 marches 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.770
 the engine runs even more dynamically up to the maximum number of standings 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.759
 further enhance deceleration 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:52.329
 compared to the double mass flywheel the mono-mass flywheel involves an increase of the 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.769
 noise level 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.609
 - 911 gt3 also designed for occasional use on the track 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.859
 the 911 gt3 rs has a chassis specifically designed for track use 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:10.439
 the roadway to the rear axle wider than 911 gt3 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.239
 to increase the transversal deceleration potential 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.399
 cornering speed to improve roll stability 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.509
 as in the 911 gt3 height and inclination roadway bars 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.909
 stabilizers on the rear front axle are adjustable 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.569
 also 911 gt3 rs 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.919
 the adjustment of the arms to the separate rear axle to allow 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.129
 an even more precise setting of geometry based on the requirements of the

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.529
 even the longest step about 5 mm faithfully increases the 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.529
 pomace stability and performance potential 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.600
 the 911 gt3 rs just like 911 gt3 comes standard with 19-inch gt3 in wheels 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.529
 light alloy 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:03.029

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.370
 sports tires 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.740
 homologated for road use guarantee the necessary fraction 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.270
 in models 911 gt3 the same braking system is used 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.969
 power 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:18.529
 on request both models are available with a braking system that 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.049
 exceeded more stringent requirements imposed by sports competitions such as the

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.650
 particularly generous 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.129
 for this 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.129
 worthy of respect 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.059
