hello and welcome to Professor
pincushion<00:00:07.870> in<00:00:08.290> this<00:00:08.650> tutorial<00:00:08.860> I'm<00:00:09.400> going<00:00:09.610> to

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
pincushion in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.310 
pincushion in this tutorial I'm going to
show<00:00:09.760> you<00:00:09.879> how<00:00:10.090> you<00:00:10.150> can<00:00:10.389> incorporate<00:00:10.660> piping

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
show you how you can incorporate piping

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.379 
show you how you can incorporate piping
into<00:00:11.650> your<00:00:11.799> garment<00:00:12.219> seams<00:00:12.520> in<00:00:12.790> order<00:00:13.150> to<00:00:13.240> add

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
into your garment seams in order to add

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.419 
into your garment seams in order to add
extra<00:00:13.840> detail<00:00:14.320> let's<00:00:14.860> go<00:00:15.040> ahead<00:00:15.130> and<00:00:15.340> get

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
extra detail let's go ahead and get

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:15.780 
extra detail let's go ahead and get

as<00:00:16.680> far<00:00:17.680> as<00:00:17.710> piping<00:00:18.189> is<00:00:18.310> concerned<00:00:18.700> you<00:00:18.939> can

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
as far as piping is concerned you can

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.389 
as far as piping is concerned you can
either<00:00:19.390> make<00:00:20.050> your<00:00:20.230> own<00:00:20.380> piping<00:00:20.860> and<00:00:21.070> we<00:00:21.250> do

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:21.399 
either make your own piping and we do

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:23.130 
either make your own piping and we do
have<00:00:21.550> a<00:00:21.579> tutorial<00:00:22.149> called<00:00:22.450> piping<00:00:22.899> which

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
have a tutorial called piping which

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.659 
have a tutorial called piping which
shows<00:00:23.410> you<00:00:23.560> how<00:00:23.590> to<00:00:23.829> create<00:00:23.950> your<00:00:24.220> own<00:00:24.369> from

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
shows you how to create your own from

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.999 
shows you how to create your own from
scratch<00:00:24.730> or<00:00:25.239> you<00:00:25.720> can<00:00:25.840> get<00:00:26.020> premade<00:00:26.619> from<00:00:26.890> the

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
scratch or you can get premade from the

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.950 
scratch or you can get premade from the
store<00:00:27.220> I<00:00:27.250> found<00:00:27.640> this<00:00:27.790> near<00:00:28.119> where<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.750> bias

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
store I found this near where the bias

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.790 
store I found this near where the bias
tape<00:00:29.290> is<00:00:29.559> kept<00:00:29.950> now<00:00:30.579> if<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.849> do<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.239> pre-made

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
tape is kept now if you do the pre-made

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.590 
tape is kept now if you do the pre-made
piping<00:00:32.800> just<00:00:33.220> be<00:00:33.460> aware<00:00:33.730> that<00:00:33.790> you're<00:00:34.360> pretty

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
piping just be aware that you're pretty

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.810 
piping just be aware that you're pretty
much<00:00:34.780> limited<00:00:35.170> in<00:00:35.440> size<00:00:35.829> this<00:00:36.130> is<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.309> really

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
much limited in size this is a really

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.570 
much limited in size this is a really
small<00:00:36.880> one<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:37.630> it's<00:00:37.900> a<00:00:38.020> half<00:00:38.230> inch<00:00:38.530> in<00:00:38.800> width

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
small one and it's a half inch in width

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.820 
small one and it's a half inch in width
and<00:00:39.790> also<00:00:40.630> in<00:00:40.930> color<00:00:41.170> you're<00:00:41.380> only<00:00:41.530> going<00:00:41.740> to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
and also in color you're only going to

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.710 
and also in color you're only going to
get<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.190> most<00:00:42.340> basic<00:00:42.880> colors<00:00:43.180> but<00:00:43.450> the<00:00:43.540> nice

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
get the most basic colors but the nice

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.840 
get the most basic colors but the nice
thing<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:43.990> because<00:00:44.740> it<00:00:44.920> is<00:00:45.070> cut<00:00:45.490> on<00:00:45.700> the<00:00:45.730> bias

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
thing is because it is cut on the bias

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.450 
thing is because it is cut on the bias
it<00:00:46.360> does<00:00:46.990> have<00:00:47.320> a<00:00:47.530> little<00:00:47.800> bit<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.040> stretch<00:00:48.430> to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
it does have a little bit of stretch to

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.090 
it does have a little bit of stretch to
it<00:00:48.730> so<00:00:49.450> it'll<00:00:49.900> be<00:00:50.050> easier<00:00:50.440> for<00:00:50.470> going<00:00:50.920> around

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
it so it'll be easier for going around

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.660 
it so it'll be easier for going around
curves<00:00:52.530> we're<00:00:53.530> going<00:00:53.680> to<00:00:53.770> start<00:00:53.980> off<00:00:54.160> with<00:00:54.190> an

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
curves we're going to start off with an

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.060 
curves we're going to start off with an
easy<00:00:54.910> example<00:00:55.750> first<00:00:56.020> so<00:00:56.260> I'm<00:00:56.530> just<00:00:56.860> going<00:00:57.040> to

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
easy example first so I'm just going to

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.100 
easy example first so I'm just going to
have<00:00:57.310> piping<00:00:57.910> on<00:00:58.090> this<00:00:58.510> edge<00:00:58.780> this<00:00:59.050> is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
have piping on this edge this is

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.780 
have piping on this edge this is
eventually<00:00:59.500> going<00:00:59.890> to<00:00:59.980> be<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.190> seam<00:01:00.550> but

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
eventually going to be a seam but

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.790 
eventually going to be a seam but
instead<00:01:01.060> of<00:01:01.120> putting<00:01:01.840> your<00:01:02.079> piping<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:02.590> then

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
instead of putting your piping in then

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.499 
instead of putting your piping in then
putting<00:01:03.100> another<00:01:03.310> fabric<00:01:03.730> on<00:01:03.850> top<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.239> so<00:01:04.360> on

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
putting another fabric on top and so on

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:05.039 
putting another fabric on top and so on
your<00:01:04.629> seam

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
your seam

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.710 
your seam
the<00:01:05.439> piping<00:01:05.829> always<00:01:06.189> gets<00:01:06.460> sewn<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:07.119> one<00:01:07.390> side

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
the piping always gets sewn to one side

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.990 
the piping always gets sewn to one side
first<00:01:08.079> that<00:01:08.830> way<00:01:09.010> we<00:01:09.190> can<00:01:09.370> make<00:01:09.490> sure<00:01:09.550> of<00:01:09.850> the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
first that way we can make sure of the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.630 
first that way we can make sure of the
placement<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.690> piping<00:01:11.080> now<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.040> problem

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
placement of the piping now the problem

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.719 
placement of the piping now the problem
is<00:01:12.820> let<00:01:13.270> me<00:01:13.330> bring<00:01:13.540> this<00:01:13.690> back<00:01:13.930> in<00:01:14.170> my<00:01:14.729> pre-made

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
is let me bring this back in my pre-made

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.020 
is let me bring this back in my pre-made
piping<00:01:16.240> is<00:01:16.500> only<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.650> half<00:01:18.010> inch<00:01:18.310> in<00:01:18.490> width<00:01:18.729> and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
piping is only a half inch in width and

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.360 
piping is only a half inch in width and
my<00:01:19.240> seam<00:01:19.510> allowance<00:01:19.930> is<00:01:20.020> five<00:01:20.799> eighths<00:01:21.070> of<00:01:21.220> an

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
my seam allowance is five eighths of an

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.300 
my seam allowance is five eighths of an
inch<00:01:21.460> for<00:01:21.790> my<00:01:21.970> seam<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:22.900> if<00:01:23.049> I<00:01:23.229> just<00:01:23.500> place<00:01:23.979> this

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
inch for my seam so if I just place this

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.350 
inch for my seam so if I just place this
on<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:25.570> raw<00:01:25.810> edge<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.700> sew<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:27.880> into<00:01:28.030> place

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
on the raw edge and sew it into place

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.000 
on the raw edge and sew it into place
I'm<00:01:28.630> going<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.870> have<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.020> problem<00:01:29.320> when<00:01:29.620> I<00:01:29.650> do<00:01:29.770> my

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
I'm going to have a problem when I do my

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.410 
I'm going to have a problem when I do my
5/8<00:01:30.370> seam<00:01:30.520> allowance<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.970> might<00:01:31.150> be<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:31.390> the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
5/8 seam allowance it might be on the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.520 
5/8 seam allowance it might be on the
other<00:01:31.630> side<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.020> then<00:01:32.110> we're<00:01:32.229> not<00:01:32.350> going<00:01:32.500> to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
other side and then we're not going to

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.340 
other side and then we're not going to
see<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.799> piping<00:01:33.159> at<00:01:33.400> all<00:01:33.700> in<00:01:34.060> order<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.020> prep

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
see the piping at all in order to prep

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.010 
see the piping at all in order to prep
for<00:01:35.830> my<00:01:35.890> piping<00:01:36.520> placing<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.750> give<00:01:37.900> me<00:01:37.990> a

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
for my piping placing and to give me a

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.330 
for my piping placing and to give me a
visual<00:01:38.200> guide<00:01:38.470> line<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.860> first<00:01:39.010> thing<00:01:39.159> I'm

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
visual guide line the first thing I'm

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.469 
visual guide line the first thing I'm
going<00:01:39.369> to<00:01:39.520> do<00:01:39.610> is<00:01:39.729> I'm<00:01:39.909> just<00:01:39.940> going<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.299> take

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
going to do is I'm just going to take

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.060 
going to do is I'm just going to take
the<00:01:40.690> piece<00:01:40.930> that<00:01:41.110> I'm<00:01:41.229> going<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.740> base<00:01:42.040> my

be to the left of my stitches so that

do our seam again the basting stitch is

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.490 
do our seam again the basting stitch is
just<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:52.210> temporary<00:02:52.570> stitch<00:02:52.840> we're<00:02:53.260> just

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
just a temporary stitch we're just

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.130 
just a temporary stitch we're just
securing<00:02:54.310> our<00:02:54.550> piping<00:02:54.970> into<00:02:55.210> place<00:02:55.450> before<00:02:55.750> we

securing our piping into place before we

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.290 
securing our piping into place before we
do<00:02:56.350> our<00:02:56.380> actual<00:02:56.950> seam<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.460> our<00:02:57.610> other<00:02:57.790> piece

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
do our actual seam with our other piece

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.720 
do our actual seam with our other piece
now<00:02:59.050> you<00:02:59.110> can<00:02:59.440> see<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.680> switch<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> different

piping as I can and also if you can

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.940 
piping as I can and also if you can
adjust<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.630> placement<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:11.260> your<00:03:11.290> needle<00:03:11.800> if

adjust the placement of your needle if
you<00:03:12.040> can<00:03:12.160> get<00:03:12.280> even<00:03:12.520> closer<00:03:12.760> even<00:03:13.360> better<00:03:13.660> so

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
you can get even closer even better so

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.900 
you can get even closer even better so
I'm<00:03:14.680> just<00:03:14.890> doing<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.250> longest<00:03:15.670> stitch<00:03:15.790> again

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
I'm just doing the longest stitch again

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:23.280 
I'm just doing the longest stitch again
no<00:03:16.270> back<00:03:16.480> stitching<00:03:21.750> now<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:22.990> we<00:03:23.080> know<00:03:23.260> that

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
no back stitching now that we know that

our piping isn't going to go anywhere we

can go ahead and start creating our
normal<00:03:27.250> seams<00:03:27.580> so<00:03:28.330> I'm<00:03:28.420> going<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.630> grab<00:03:28.870> the

normal seams so I'm going to grab the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.710 
normal seams so I'm going to grab the
other<00:03:29.170> piece<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.530> goes<00:03:29.920> with<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.340> and

other piece that goes with this and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.550 
other piece that goes with this and
we're<00:03:31.720> just<00:03:31.810> going<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.080> pretend<00:03:32.200> like<00:03:32.350> we're

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
we're just going to pretend like we're

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.380 
we're just going to pretend like we're
doing<00:03:32.740> a<00:03:32.800> normal<00:03:32.950> seen<00:03:33.340> by<00:03:33.550> lining<00:03:33.970> up<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.210> raw

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
doing a normal seen by lining up the raw

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.200 
doing a normal seen by lining up the raw
edges<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:35.560> ends<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.130> any<00:03:36.310> notches<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.000> then

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
edges the ends and any notches and then

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.180 
edges the ends and any notches and then
pin<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.510> into<00:03:37.660> place<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:38.410> do<00:03:38.590> our<00:03:38.800> 5/8

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
pin it into place so we can do our 5/8

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.530 
pin it into place so we can do our 5/8
seam<00:03:39.370> allowance<00:03:41.790> even<00:03:42.790> though<00:03:42.910> I'm<00:03:43.030> doing<00:03:43.360> a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
seam allowance even though I'm doing a

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.930 
seam allowance even though I'm doing a
regular<00:03:43.780> straight<00:03:44.350> stitch<00:03:44.410> for<00:03:45.070> my<00:03:45.310> seam<00:03:45.670> I'm

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
regular straight stitch for my seam I'm

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.970 
regular straight stitch for my seam I'm
still<00:03:46.570> using<00:03:46.810> my<00:03:47.020> zipper<00:03:47.410> foot<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.740> I'm

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
still using my zipper foot and I'm

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.460 
still using my zipper foot and I'm
butting<00:03:48.340> right<00:03:48.610> up<00:03:48.790> next<00:03:49.270> to<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.780> piping<00:03:50.230> here

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
butting right up next to the piping here

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.590 
butting right up next to the piping here
you<00:03:51.010> can<00:03:51.160> also<00:03:51.310> see<00:03:51.550> I<00:03:51.580> moved<00:03:51.820> over<00:03:52.000> my<00:03:52.300> needle

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
you can also see I moved over my needle

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600 
you can also see I moved over my needle
so<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.780> can<00:03:52.930> get<00:03:53.080> as<00:03:53.230> close<00:03:53.620> as<00:03:53.920> possible<00:03:54.040> to

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
so I can get as close as possible to

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.240 
so I can get as close as possible to
that<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.660> don't<00:03:55.750> forget<00:03:55.990> to<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.140> back<00:03:56.320> stitch

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.160

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
for my seams that contain the piping

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.900 
for my seams that contain the piping
instead<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.680> pressing<00:04:04.040> them<00:04:04.160> open<00:04:04.489> like<00:04:04.700> my

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
instead of pressing them open like my

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.729 
instead of pressing them open like my
normal<00:04:04.970> seam<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.690> keep<00:04:05.989> them<00:04:06.170> closed<00:04:06.470> and

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
normal seam I keep them closed and

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.100

here's<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.780> view<00:04:15.019> of<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.290> right<00:04:15.500> side<00:04:15.830> now<00:04:16.130> as

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
here's a view of the right side now as

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.860 
here's a view of the right side now as
an<00:04:16.639> option<00:04:17.180> I'm<00:04:17.269> not<00:04:17.419> going<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.600> do<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:17.720> with

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
an option I'm not going to do it with

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.629 
an option I'm not going to do it with
mine<00:04:18.079> but<00:04:18.320> what<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:18.620> can<00:04:18.889> do<00:04:19.130> if<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.400> want<00:04:19.549> it

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
mine but what you can do if you want it

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.759 
mine but what you can do if you want it
to<00:04:19.760> look<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:20.030> little<00:04:20.150> bit<00:04:20.389> nicer<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.500> can<00:04:21.650> do

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
to look a little bit nicer so you can do

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.690 
to look a little bit nicer so you can do
a<00:04:21.799> top<00:04:22.130> stitch<00:04:22.540> right<00:04:23.540> along<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.560> edge<00:04:24.740> now

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
a top stitch right along the edge now

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.070 
a top stitch right along the edge now
you<00:04:25.760> just<00:04:26.090> don't<00:04:26.389> have<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.660> do<00:04:26.780> them<00:04:26.870> on<00:04:26.960> both

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
you just don't have to do them on both

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.409 
you just don't have to do them on both
sides<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.470> just<00:04:27.560> do<00:04:27.979> it<00:04:28.130> on<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.370> side<00:04:28.639> where

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
sides you just do it on the side where

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.450 
sides you just do it on the side where
your<00:04:29.570> seam<00:04:29.840> allowance<00:04:30.229> is<00:04:30.320> underneath<00:04:30.889> so<00:04:31.370> you

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
your seam allowance is underneath so you

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.070 
your seam allowance is underneath so you
see<00:04:31.610> my<00:04:31.760> seam<00:04:31.940> allowance<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.240> on<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:32.479> side<00:04:32.720> so

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
see my seam allowance is on this side so

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.500 
see my seam allowance is on this side so
I<00:04:33.110> would<00:04:33.380> do<00:04:33.530> my<00:04:33.680> top<00:04:33.740> stitch<00:04:34.220> right<00:04:35.030> along<00:04:35.360> the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
I would do my top stitch right along the

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.690 
I would do my top stitch right along the
edge<00:04:35.630> here<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:36.169> if<00:04:36.770> I<00:04:36.889> was<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.070> look<00:04:37.250> this<00:04:37.490> side

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
edge here and if I was to look this side

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.580 
edge here and if I was to look this side
you<00:04:38.090> see<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.720> seam<00:04:38.900> allowance<00:04:39.139> is<00:04:39.229> on<00:04:39.380> this

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
you see the seam allowance is on this

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.230 
you see the seam allowance is on this
part<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:40.160> then<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.400> would<00:04:40.580> do<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.729> top<00:04:41.000> stitch

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
part so then I would do the top stitch

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.909 
part so then I would do the top stitch
along<00:04:41.630> here<00:04:42.250> if<00:04:43.479> you<00:04:44.479> create<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:44.900> seam<00:04:45.229> that<00:04:45.530> has

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
along here if you create a seam that has

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.340 
along here if you create a seam that has
a<00:04:45.950> curve<00:04:46.580> it<00:04:46.850> is<00:04:47.090> very<00:04:47.419> important<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.200> you

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
a curve it is very important that you

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.920 
a curve it is very important that you
then<00:04:48.590> trim<00:04:49.280> your<00:04:49.430> seam<00:04:49.669> allowance<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.270> cut

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
then trim your seam allowance and cut

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.080 
then trim your seam allowance and cut
these<00:04:51.110> little<00:04:51.320> notches<00:04:51.830> which<00:04:52.370> are<00:04:52.550> inverted

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
these little notches which are inverted

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.120 
these little notches which are inverted
triangles<00:04:53.600> don't<00:04:54.200> cut<00:04:54.470> into<00:04:54.740> your<00:04:54.830> stitches

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
triangles don't cut into your stitches

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.469 
triangles don't cut into your stitches
because<00:04:55.430> we<00:04:55.639> don't<00:04:55.790> want<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:55.970> create<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.210> hole

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
because we don't want to create a hole

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.540 
because we don't want to create a hole
you<00:04:57.080> just<00:04:57.260> get<00:04:57.380> as<00:04:57.500> close<00:04:57.740> as<00:04:57.950> you<00:04:58.070> can<00:04:58.310> so<00:04:58.520> you

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
you just get as close as you can so you

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.040 
you just get as close as you can so you
can<00:04:58.700> see<00:04:58.820> I<00:04:58.850> already<00:04:59.000> did<00:04:59.210> on<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.510> side<00:04:59.720> and<00:04:59.930> I

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
can see I already did on the side and I

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.110 
can see I already did on the side and I
still<00:05:00.320> need<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.710> do<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:00.979> on<00:05:01.100> this<00:05:01.310> side<00:05:01.550> as<00:05:01.790> well

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
still need to do it on this side as well

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.150 
still need to do it on this side as well
this<00:05:02.660> will<00:05:02.870> help<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.350> seam<00:05:03.590> light<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.860> little

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
this will help the seam light a little

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
this will help the seam light a little
bit<00:05:04.310> flatter<00:05:04.789> once<00:05:05.750> we<00:05:06.080> open<00:05:07.039> this<00:05:07.160> up<00:05:07.400> so<00:05:08.030> we

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
bit flatter once we open this up so we

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.450 
bit flatter once we open this up so we
can<00:05:08.330> see<00:05:08.570> the<00:05:08.930> right<00:05:09.139> side<00:05:11.830> here<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:13.010> can<00:05:13.039> see

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
can see the right side here you can see

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.640 
can see the right side here you can see
an<00:05:13.700> example<00:05:14.240> of<00:05:14.330> some<00:05:14.539> piping<00:05:14.960> work<00:05:15.139> on<00:05:15.350> my
