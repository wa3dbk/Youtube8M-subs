00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.150
 I hope you have good and 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.340
 today we find ourselves for this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.050
 8th tutorial in which I am going 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.309
 show how to get the pokemon 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.230
 legendary ithrane that's all so is 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.720
 it's gone so that drags and three 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.520
 years at most as he intervened 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.510
 several pronunciation for this pokemon 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.619
 I've heard so many 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.510
 pronunciations for this brief pokemon so 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.369
 there I sat but tronel so 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.470
 I started from there because 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.219
 where to find itra can not find 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.239
 Very far from here 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.680
 so here is the why of how 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:43.800
 so then you have to go on the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.930
 road 120 on the road 120d penally 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.210
 the cave under too much vitran is not 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.469
 very world here so we'll go two 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.190
 journalists do not care a bit 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:58.079
 we will avoid the super fights thank you the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:05.070
 small mine that makes me waste time 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:08.530
 puree that's like a game well there 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.080
 holds a small landslide quickly 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.619
 so that we forget neons you move from the 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:21.220
 thank you next time I will put some 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:22.840
 regrowth so here I am going to put some 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.090
 regrowth anyway in case we do not 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.600
 never know here are redheads that tale 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.610
 pleasure percent but rest but they 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.950
 are there but regrows that's ok so 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.549
 let's continue and so yes I 'll go 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.429
 how to capture ithrane he betrayed that a 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.979
 pokemon very children easy to capture 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.710
 alive I will not say that but we will 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.149
 tell the event for the event the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.539
 floors to capture it is really 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.039
 very easy to triggered so here 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.920
 you're on the road 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.880
 120 you use surf at the place where 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.259
 just did it and you will find yourself 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.429
 facing a small crown 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.720
 right there you can get in and 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.369
 in this cave we will find 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.360
 objects not bad interesting us already a 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.670
 city ​​which contains a zenith justice and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.920
 which is relatively cool I you 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.430
 also advise to use the search 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.690
 objects to chaos to find stuff 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.140
 interesting because we will find 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.570
 interesting stuff I assure you already 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.950
 that knows the right there there is a total care 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.840
 that's wonderful 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.610
 not very far there would be a rope 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:41.070
 normally left on the other side of the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.070
 goal this is a rope out 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.240
 here we are even going to find a mega james 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.220
 to tell you and here we will do the 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:55.750
 meeting people you 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.700
 know very well I think it's ok 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.880
 not be possible 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:06.220
 yeah our dear adrian the 4th 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.360
 champion of owen you scared me that 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.850
 not going to get close to people without 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.000
 make noise like this to not tell me 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.780
 that everything if you look for this rare pokemon 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.520
 what are we saying yes or no 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.100
 good so we're not supposed to be at 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.750
 current let's say no how are you 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.640
 have not heard about it let me 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.800
 explain to you my grandfather was telling me 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.750
 a pokemon fire in this cave 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.730
 for longer than any man 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.890
 remember he would have a body of 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.790
 burning magma and big big 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.130
 sharp claws 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.470
 but without flash impossible to continue 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.650
 more before good it's a command ya 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.700
 flash 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.380
 finally it's not mandatory to have 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.390
 flash 1 to continue it's not so 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.250
 dark than that so it's dark 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.870
 impossible to know what we have in front 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.700
 what falls on us 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.470
 it's not reassuring I prefer 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.720
 turn back up to around 1000 at va 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.890
 to equip me more seriously if you 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.530
 decide to continue it's good 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.730
 watch out for the terminal where you do not have 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.709
 need flash because we are 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.690
 warriors you see we are not the 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.239
 little women and not the ten men of 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.120
 cool warriors are going at once and without 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:12.370
 flash you see short stop with my 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:16.709
 sexist remarks so here you are so the 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.810
 mt pitt which is huge 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.320
 it's really huge 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:28.300
 everything is stubborn and the megan I like we're going 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.860
 put another at the reefs there and the mega 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.630
 gym that is right here as raw 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.450
 duty 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.680
 and it's a draco fit there so here it is 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.370
 little bonus of the video 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.110
 even if it's not you in this 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.970
 video how to support the mega g but 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.920
 good there will be a small bonus of 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:51.710
 justiciers a layering that's it me 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.210
 seems that is one last thing I 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.610
 really not sure no there you can 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.610
 use force to move the rocks 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.410
 here 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.600
 ok and at banias nothing else ok he's me 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.330
 seemed like something was still 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.390
 apparently not so brief you continue 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.670
 paris if you go down there then a 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.290
 violent heat wave covers you from 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.430
 sweat the atmosphere becomes almost 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.550
 unbreathable 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:26.750
 so we will remove these ridiculous stuff and 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.760
 caron we just there a portal so 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.570
 before throwing me headlong into the 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.880
 battle I'm going to do a little switch 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.930
 or put a junkie in front to be 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.920
 sure not to be able to kill 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.480
 itron is so a circle and mysterious 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.040
 floats in the air a shape seems 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.520
 appear on the other side do you want 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:58.160
 look closely and who sees there and who 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:59.920
 this is our dear title end here is that is 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.020
 I believe one of the few pokemon to be 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.730
 sitting on it and not that they were 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.560
 shaved I mean enough on it is 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:12.440
 when there is none there I mix everything 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:19.520
 but yes one of the only pokemon to have a 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:21.650
 dry so it's a bad turn so we 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.940
 puts gayet mutua volume are I think 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.080
 not be able to kill him with the amf and there 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.250
 had clearly no there I 'm not 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.250
 at all and bully asthma 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.620
 awa it hurts aiea down it is super 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.520
 wrong 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.660
 what are we going to use strong exploit 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.530
 it should not do too much damage 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.530
 well I think 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.960
 sèmassi hockey, but frankly 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.970
 month and my legendary luck I you 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.870
 sworn 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:03.910
 and here I kill them is super it's 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.390
 huge it's huge 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.550
 finally brief again good limit I 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.020
 I expected because it's good sky 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.230
 who does not kill legendary pokemon 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.850
 sinico impossible so I do not even count 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.210
 longer pokemon impetus towards the 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.680
 kill 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:23.230
 in short so it's okay and so 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.180
 here I showed you how to get 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.360
 ithrane and I hope this video 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.880
