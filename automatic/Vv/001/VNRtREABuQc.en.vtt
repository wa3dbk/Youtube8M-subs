aura<00:02:55.840> outwards<00:02:56.349> okay<00:02:57.069> so<00:02:57.760> how<00:02:57.909> does<00:02:57.969> this

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
aura outwards okay so how does this

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.989 
aura outwards okay so how does this
relate<00:02:58.359> to<00:02:59.040> seeing<00:03:00.040> angels<00:03:00.989> well<00:03:02.639> once<00:03:03.639> you

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:03.999 
relate to seeing angels well once you

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:07.770 
relate to seeing angels well once you
get<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:05.200> visuals<00:03:05.739> down<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.689> learning<00:03:07.689> how

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
get the the visuals down of learning how

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.920 
get the the visuals down of learning how
to<00:03:07.810> see<00:03:08.139> that<00:03:08.319> final<00:03:08.790> vibration<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.750> good

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
to see that final vibration and a good

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.750 
to see that final vibration and a good
analogy<00:03:11.319> which<00:03:11.889> I<00:03:12.010> put<00:03:12.159> on<00:03:12.219> my<00:03:12.370> book<00:03:12.519> teen

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
analogy which I put on my book teen

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.140 
analogy which I put on my book teen
goddess<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.379> when<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.590> light<00:03:14.859> is<00:03:15.250> coming

goddess is when the light is coming

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.819 
goddess is when the light is coming
through<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.540> windows<00:03:16.930> at<00:03:17.200> certain<00:03:17.500> times<00:03:17.709> of

through the windows at certain times of
the<00:03:17.889> day<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:19.000> can<00:03:19.030> see<00:03:19.329> dust<00:03:19.540> particles

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
the day and you can see dust particles

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.420 
the day and you can see dust particles
that's<00:03:20.950> kind<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.609> the<00:03:22.030> vibrational<00:03:23.019> frequency

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
that's kind of the vibrational frequency

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.610 
that's kind of the vibrational frequency
that<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.549> can<00:03:24.730> see<00:03:25.000> angels<00:03:25.510> people<00:03:26.500> who've

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
slight vibration so with that knowledge

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.610 
slight vibration so with that knowledge
you<00:03:40.060> can<00:03:40.239> start<00:03:40.510> looking<00:03:40.599> around<00:03:40.840> people<00:03:41.349> and

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
you can start looking around people and
