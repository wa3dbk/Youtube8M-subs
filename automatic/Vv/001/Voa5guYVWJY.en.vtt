00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.360
 let's learn in windows vista and 7 and 8 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.640
 ie windows xp as it does not have 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.460
 more platform support microsoft it 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.560
 it is very old and is not recommended 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.330
 use it and so we will not go either 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.230
 give support we're using here 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.240
 many 8.1 the latest version what 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.700
 happens when they escape into it. 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.579
 you will tweak the settings of the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.170
 your objects I want to create here a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.680
 beauty rectangle 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.710
 if you see here the shift control efe 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.140
 and in the base in a contour you move in the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.140
 contour it, you do not apply a font 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.660
 told red for example and can 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.030
 to turn a round the blood 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.360
 what happens when you go to work 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.920
 your items here in the menu be it 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.799
 a rectangle be it a circus it ends 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.229
 recognizing its winx configuration which 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.000
 When you open it has its 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.320
 Default setting 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.240
 Look, you're going to multiply on the object. 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.229
 worked star with objects here 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.920
 O 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.360
 10 these settings that you apply 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.060
 to objects 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.850
 it will be recognized as always by 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.710
 Again it is no longer offers a standard 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.180
 so I figure you move and 10 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.820
 lots of things here in the menu 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.310
 tools and when you open it 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.560
 you have to there by hand one by one 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.799
 apÃª da ship versus the apple for example 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.770
 Come and tell me the way you 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.439
 either standard to do these things is 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.659
 to save the default settings as 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.420
 that you simplify this makes if a mother 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.360
 I'm just closing the escape I'm not going to save. 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.820
 closed save if I open the range of 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.390
 new initials you saw in escape 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:09.820
 I'm going to have to escape again. 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.830
 O is opening April beauty that is 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.910
 here is open I will create a 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.490
 rectangle 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.040
 Look, he recognized the last one. 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.150
 color and contour setting 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.610
 of the object 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.310
 if the black background had been defeated 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.930
 for example what would happen when the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.030
 escape bug 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.010
 it is well in that same configuration as 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.500
 that you reserve all the settings 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.239
 from the exhaust to the standard so that you 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.600
 do not do this every time you 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.390
 sometimes it opens this setting here 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.850
 there is a certain type of drawing that 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.459
 You 're going to work, it 's cool. 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.030
 beauty you modify with the key 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.100
 that the outline is nice for you 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.870
 in this job when you start a 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.209
 new work is interesting that the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.760
 Skype configuration standard is not 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.860
 It's because you missed a confirmation of 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.640
 will get around to each other no longer 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.050
 is valid 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.720
 then you get the default setting 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.519
 and not be reciting manually as 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.860
 That's what we do, I 'll close the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.980
 escape that I already showed as 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.549
 example I 'm going to do here in your 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.310
 windows folder my computer you go 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.739
 to stop the disc you have there is a 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.410
 solution less in my case says cocal c 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.519
 You try to get married and go into 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.900
 users folder in the users folder 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.049
 he will be all eyes if the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.120
 computer the leg in the initial menu gave 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.630
 you find out who your user is 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.510
 in my case it's nobody's 011 entered the 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.120
 and here I have the back of 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.810
 user beauty which is the only detail 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.049
 on here 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.030
 The only detail here is you access the 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.700
 properties of your folder 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.720
 here in windows 8 it has this option 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.790
 zink display and you have this shortcut zinho 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.770
 that it shows you intense 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.520
 You have two ways to do this. 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.430
 or you click here and it shows you this 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.030
 hidden folder then you create use 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.530
 minimum 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.870
 you have to know which show steps 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.940
 hidden as you do so they accessed the 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.780
 properties of beauty folder 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.639
 Look, he shows me that I say he's 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.730
 do not show this hidden peace 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.470
 if I turn folder options on there 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.740
 practically any version of windows 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.130
 Here are some folder options 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.700
 you go view this bar 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.900
 and here you have to show files and 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.419
 hidden folders apply it applies the 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.330
 same effect with the difference of the two 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.880
 no single difference is that here is a 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.200
 easier shortcut instead of you access 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.080
 higher 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.410
 You enter here, do not click on it, and he already 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.200
 it shows hidden goes very easy right 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.810
 if you want to restore patterns you 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.229
 You can mark it here or not show it 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.960
 will restore can show you 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.720
 shows only that and only shows a peace 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.970
 Hiding because this one passes here. 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.640
 were different from their 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.030
 applications that you use if you 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.190
 access to it does not know you 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.530
 lethal here because he can not he will know 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.600
 if preferences do not 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.500
 I would like to know how it is 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.419
 making 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.560
 we are going to have no problem 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.540
 for us 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.380
 have you been there? 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.170
 here is the man in here has several 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.800
 files you have in the escape folder and 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:44.040
 It looks cool and in the exhaust folder has 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.280
 this file is here preferences 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:53.940
 this file here you can delete it 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:56.430
 Right exclude deleted pay 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.230
 attention to delete files right here 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.010
 it shows you space you can be 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.600
 only your app user date the man in 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.820
 escape is just that 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.310
 you went here you can also have 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.010
 a little piece of paper because it will take time to do 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.380
 This is not much faster to enter 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.300
 in this match of the cup file than 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.140
 you every time you reconfiguring it 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.910
 exhaust 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.550
 so the configuration of it will be 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.730
 default when you access here your 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.920
 start menu and abrinq escape it again 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.350
 will not have more than the settings and 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.210
 let's see in practice look only from the 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.210
 When you find an escape 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.380
 he creates this file, you see only that 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.840
 this file 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.480
 if I put the right button open with a 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.690
 notepad that has this lot of 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:46.650
 name is that brands settings 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.240
 object value values ââpatterns 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.760
 in xml 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.590
 then it will only generate according to 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.390
 that you were changing it has its 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.900
 with values and standards 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:00.120
 when I'm going to create an object it already 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.460
 default setting was it not okay 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.270
 but in that giant outline in which I 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:09.090
 I have put all the settings here 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.060
 that you work on tools will 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:14.700
 it's in the standard it 's not hard to do this 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.760
 and after you save this folder to the 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:21.360
 your windows and you know how you are here 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.370
 you access very easy by 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.280
 example now that the time would bring the 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.380
 time it takes into account that annual basis 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.100
 I work today, beauty. 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:35.990
 my computer says put users 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:40.040
 my user app date man 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:45.780
 where is escape and this one is going to delete 

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:47.880
 Soon this is very easy. Neither leads nor 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.950
 one minute to access it sees few 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.680
 seconds and you reserve with force 

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:55.200
 very easy staff 

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:58.530
