00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.099
 next example let's see how we make a hdd rehn 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.829
 we see the archives 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.209
 are these and the result will be similar to this one 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.259
 we select the 4 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.929
 files we are going to also tas 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.060
 another shock 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.390
 combine for hdr 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.320
 we have four images in raw to 16 bits are pretty heavy images 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.410
 are from a compact camera notes the most ideal but for example to be equal 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.280
 Good 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.280
 we accept is because the clouds are moved 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.630
 we see the image we have 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.380
 a pretty high range 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.690
 we chop the option to remove ghosts and it will leave us better the van was going to 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.139
 try to polish a bit 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:52.570
 clouds 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.280
 I am always in favor of leaving a little bit more 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.370
 we accept 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.979
 and then now in contusion we will be able to outline 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.580
 definitely the h 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.520
 we have the advantage when we talk about hdr 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.049
 that we have a lot of information 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.140
 amazing we can take out 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.900
 wonders and we are now going to convert the image to 16 bits and this box does not come out 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.020
 Dialog 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.500
 procuro party go from the middle 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.690
 and then today, more or less, the results 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.640
 let's give it a little range 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.640
 the range what it does is give them more importance 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.360
 doing because up 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.600
 basically we have to be careful with this tool what makes 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.190
 edge glow 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.520
 we will see it now better 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.460
 be more profiles to the image but the detail also 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.620
 like a paper with that 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.620
 let's turn a little 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.620
 and we are going to start to give you some detail 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.480
 accents shadows 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.480
 we took it a little 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.510
 two men we leave you a little lower 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.739
 highlight it, we leave it a little higher and we will see how the image 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.930
 taking a little bit of shape, let's slowly outline 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.029
 let's go dublin a little bit more here 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.849
 the detail how we see 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.359
 is what can give us away 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.040
 it can make us sing when it comes to stop problems 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.499
 posadas a little more detail we will reach up to 100 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.889
 we see that the image begins to take we give a little 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.889
 saturation so that it starts to pick up a little bit of color 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.249
 also care moscon 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.249
 we take a little in the shadows 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.759
 nr jumped we also go carefully 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:56.489
 that what would provide us highlighted this is what we have in the church 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.640
 we give a little bit of light with the tone curve 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.640
 and we have a ready image 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.609
 to then go to 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.479
 foto cedoc in the photoshop finish polishing the 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:14.009
 with care especially with the detail that is when we are going to plow a little 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.429
 curves layer 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:21.529
 and what we do is help a little in the exhibition 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.529
 especially asphalt and houses 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.730
 curves layer of curves we hit a free shot we give a brush with opacity to 10 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:37.539
 we take a little more 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.539
 church 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.989
 we invest again 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.479
 contrast 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.839
 to the asphalt 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.249
 then let's give a little bit of volume 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:54.289
 to the houses layer of curves again 

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:56.019
 we give all 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.019
 and then we close the shadows to give the contrast 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.269
 we only have data a bit 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.139
 more to heaven 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.599
 especially in the part farthest from the church 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.789
 we see how it is 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.650
 now we make a layer of levels 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.720
 we have a layer of levels we make sure that 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.889
 the black is 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:36.779
 ideye 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.689
 in the survey 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.379
 and vesubio is the exhibition 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.370
 I am not very supportive of raising the exposure in levels 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.860
 but in this case there is no unemployment 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.990
 our image 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.289
 we will see 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.590
 with hd r with a lot of range 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.210
 from this bike photo it was practically impossible to take in one shot and thanks to 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.040
 the hr we have created 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.030
 this picture 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.870
 let's make a save as the bear compare with the other images that 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.210
 we have 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.949
 at the time of closing cerac is what we have to take into account 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:14.019
 is that with the hdr it is very easy to create surreal effects 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.550
 obviously this image is surreal 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:24.019
 but it has stayed better this time that the time is tested previously 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.469
 we see the first take the second shot 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.099
 third 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.029
 and this has been with the hdr 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:38.080
 the image has a lot of depth of field, all the details 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.510
 just some pretty tough shooters and adjust 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.360
 those of the hdr 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.479
 we see that it is a final moron is pretty good 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.629
 we take three or four shots of the same image and we create the accesses to networks but 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.349
 We are careful especially with the detail to not give too much volume to 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.169
 the image and that is very surreal
