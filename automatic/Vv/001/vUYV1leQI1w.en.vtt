00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.359
 whales trained assassin and has with 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.680
 Pirates are not much on the hat anymore 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:33.420
 namely make only on behalf of the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.829
 but ordens primarily it comes 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.290
 therefore slaves from the French 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.059
 to liberate colonies in the caribbean and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.780
 Give them a self-determined life 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.239
 enable 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.719
 already long under can race 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.059
 and if it works for his own 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.530
 Landers reach and fight 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.629
 is mocked as well as in the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.340
 main game out of the shadows or 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.680
 in the middle of fighting with fleet counter 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.690
 moves a while but does not 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.520
 on a big weapon selection in addition to the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.339
 he now fights usual assassin tricks 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.840
 with machetes and thunder boxes that cares 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.760
 for a slightly different feeling than 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.619
 with adwords because we have the thunderbox in the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.020
 fight only once before you can fire 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.670
 We also invite you to everyone else 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.170
 important core elements like the free one 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.970
 climb and the impressive 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.299
 Sea battles could abound here 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.299
 addon 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.130
 in addition to the well-known there are also 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.410
 some innovations 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.420
 since we are on freedom mission find 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.430
 We blow on all corners and ends 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.710
 they can free themselves from their tormentors 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.930
 on the streets at auctions or 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:43.240
 public punishments or we over 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.130
 catch a plantation in one 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.380
 Overseer after the other and save so 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.190
 up to 30 forced laborers at once 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.810
 important to be seen if 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.399
 We catch the guards by catching the alarm 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.289
 immediately to the innocent 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.149
 slaughtering plantation workers 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.539
 And we want that in any case 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.710
 avoid the slaves in majak brings 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.600
 but not only in history 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.910
 ahead but also ensures bonuses like 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 new ammo bags and discounts at the 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.940
 dealers 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.590
 to dust off properly we should 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.280
 urgently also slave ships at sea 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.440
 to free 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.250
 there are up to 100 people here 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.250
 rescue per ship 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.189
 which also with this 7 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.220
 which is then but 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.620
 new are also some game elements 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.570
 like the slaves fingers this strong 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.490
 opponent sort strikes immediately when alarm 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.920
 you will see the wave even if we look 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.150
 not looked're in enemy territory 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.860
 to act out of the shadows 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.870
 So again plays a bigger role 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.520
 as for a real assassin 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.200
 usual even if the action is some 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.480
 gaps has captivate the new ones 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.280
 missions just under five hours we like 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.450
 everything with it and discovered doubles the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.460
 even play time 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.050
 because in addition to the story, there are also 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.670
 to find lots of treasures and 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.480
 side missions catch fish again 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.480
 again with it 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.380
 single assassin or marine orders 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.060
 that is missing but that does not matter 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.590
 the carpenter contains freedom 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.990
 actually everything is the main game 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.880
 just matters in a smaller frame 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.430
 nice graphics and solid sound 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.080
 but unfortunately the shantys are missing 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.090
 so that longer crossings with the 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.090
 Expert cranes will become drab in the long term 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.490
 at some places plan similar 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.420
 bats ki weaken as in the main game in the 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.610
 freedom fight 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.560
 but that rarely happens and therefore can 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.930
 to strike for 10 euros without hesitation 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.100
 around all wales history according to currently 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.100
 with about to experience
