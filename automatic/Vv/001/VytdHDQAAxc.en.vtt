00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
I listened to watching learner clips

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.779 
I listened to watching learner clips
like<00:00:28.769> my<00:00:28.890> second<00:00:29.189> favorite<00:00:29.310> off<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> album

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
like my second favorite off the album

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
like my second favorite off the album
but<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.240> most<00:00:30.390> part<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:31.019> album<00:00:31.349> is

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
but for the most part the album is

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500 
but for the most part the album is
shelved<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.189> didn't<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.120> I

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
shelved I didn't really like it I

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.700 
shelved I didn't really like it I
thought<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.020> was<00:00:34.110> kind<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.320> thrown<00:00:34.559> together

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
thought it was kind of thrown together

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.430 
thought it was kind of thrown together
this<00:00:35.579> album<00:00:35.969> was<00:00:36.090> very<00:00:36.390> good<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.870> starts<00:00:37.320> off

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
this album was very good it starts off

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.770 
this album was very good it starts off
it<00:00:37.950> kicks<00:00:38.219> off<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.700> fresh<00:00:39.059> off<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> runway

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
it kicks off with fresh off the runway

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.729 
it kicks off with fresh off the runway
which<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> very<00:00:40.700> poppy<00:00:41.700> tune<00:00:42.290> it's<00:00:43.290> generic

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
which is a very poppy tune it's generic

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.650 
which is a very poppy tune it's generic
it's<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.460> good<00:00:44.670> way<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.820> start<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> album<00:00:45.539> I
