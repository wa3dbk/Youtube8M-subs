00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.109
 ask why you need such a cancer from 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.390
 material like in a jacket Wait 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.050

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.480
 changes 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.490
 he pretty well pulled down at the bottom of his 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.119
 the idea should not miss our friends 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.760
 mosquitoes 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.910
 or our enemies mosquitoes sworn friends 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.780
 You can say here there are pockets 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.420
 somewhere here is pocket pocket silent 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.950
 just just pockets but yes and no not 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 I can pocket up to 2 pockets right here 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.719
 still there is a jumper there is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.219
 such a huge chest pocket by the way 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.750
 where you can carry a card perfectly 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.920
 some or where I'll even be a little bit 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.570
 I do not know there is a good hood went with 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.670
 visor 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.670
 it fastens well now 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.030
 here 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.640
 there is a button fastener 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.790
 everything is very good there are couplers but 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.410
 This costume on cancer there is one 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.470
 awesome especially what to do something just 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.170
 ideal for forest taiga and and beekeepers 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.300
 I also think especially 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.950
 when we all unzipped it here 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.860
 here is a secret branch of it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.080
 gets what do you think a of him 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.200
 gets such turns 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.100
 mosquito as mosquito nose 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.170
 turns so turns on 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.940
 tire romance is wonderful we have it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.710
 neatly here we cling to vapors 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:51.290
 gadfly Chukotka hair and other volatile 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:55.650
 parasites do to you like this 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.550
 from leaf flying into eyes from sparks i 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.550
 I'm afraid we are burning 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.830
 know from escada from foliage not from elevator 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.790
 and answers but if someone is in you 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.970
 throws 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.090
 fresh fallen yellow leaves here 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.700
 for now, then after that, all this protection 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.320
 love back and everything seemed to be 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.489
 generally just a super solution 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.590
 actions that here all the same 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.450
 mosquito on the nose can sit like that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.250
 sensations but it may be because 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.799
 the hood is not adjusted well, that is, here 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.330
 you can play a tightening force is not yet 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.040
 very awesome in it you can lie down on 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.590
 I clarify once and so lay in and 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.959
 cuba accidentally touched the grid woke up 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.930
 just negro guboshlep am karelian 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.640
 mosquitoes are evil here but really the solution 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.040
 very cool not hats do not like but 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.230
 in this form it seems to me to wander for a walk 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.570
 It is possible to gum that a little bit of course 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.840
 review dims it all turns out 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.489
 a little bit alien but if you 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.489
 it suits you don't like mosquitoes 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.350
 the main thing and try to eat through it until 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.730
 hanha very good fit socks and pieces 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.980
 in any case at the command place 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.200
 takes a little pocket doesn't pull on cancer 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.239
 very good very practical solution 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.940
 for the forest we like shanti shanti rf 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.300
