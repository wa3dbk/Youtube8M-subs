00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 number two video master class 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.820
 exterior visualization let's 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.559
 analyze in detail 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.100
 course topics first building model creation 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.350
 look at this topic and 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.039
 Next we will study the principle in detail. 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.900
 modeling using edit poly if 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.900
 you take the first steps in modeling 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.980
 these lessons will help you improve 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.980
 of your mastery 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.120
 the second theme we will engage in 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.420
 this course is modeling 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.270
 environment of the building what is there 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.550
 meaning building surrounds slabs 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.690
 surround the lamps that we will 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.160
 to model 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.510
 also surround some kind of rocky shape 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.030
 which we will also manually do 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.989
 handles on the door of the building 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.540
 frames fine detail we are sure with 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.540
 you will simulate and you will learn 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.100
 This process and of course 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.119
 will be able to further use these 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.670
 skills gained in this training in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.659
 to your work so let's go to 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.710
 topic number 3 in topic number three we will 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.670
 to model 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 two types of grass and bushes that are similar 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.810
 on agave 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.680
 if you look at the drawing on 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.119
 videotapes 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.619
 we have a big green here 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.960
 plant 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.450
 here and I will show how it 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.829
 model and also of course you 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:54.540
 see small and tall grass for example 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:59.380
 reeds and so with those number 3 given 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.560
 course we will learn to model 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.250
 different grass reeds bushes and apply to 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.329
 him or 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:11.019
 sweep in in the fourth lesson in this 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:15.370
 course we will create materials to 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.660
 grass and the rest of the plants so let's 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.950
 move on to 5 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.849
 the topic of this course is the transformation 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.370
 grass door proxies and placement and on 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.959
 surfaces in the exterior actually 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.700
 it is necessary for it not to be 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.489
 a huge number of polygons in from 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.220
 scene if you don't or not 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.280
 know what to do like that 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.650
 way unfortunately you have in the end 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.769
 nothing will come of it as colitis 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.110
 the number of polygons will be very 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.480
 big and your computer just hung 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:59.739
 no therefore you will acquire the skill in 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:05.410
 placement and positioning of small 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:07.450
 objects in the scene and then you calmly 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.200
 will do love visualization 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.850
 using many objects and in doing so 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.720
 this process does not complicate the work 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.870
 computer so subject number six given 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.459
 the course is an example of creation 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.480
 the tree is all just well, let's be from scratch 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.250
 create 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.750
 tree and you have to step by step 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.579
 make a tree column make branches 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.650
 make leaves make texture 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:43.060
 sweep and actually recreate 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.130
 any tree you can of course you 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.799
 art of sky and wood for example 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.920
 fantastic for some reason 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:55.500
 this technology which i will show in 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:59.790
 this course is also a topic 6 we will 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.500
 place vegetation in the background 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.489
 ok and let's get to the topic 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.180
 number seven is making materials to 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.250
 objects in the scene that is 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.580
 texturing house text and 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.799
 texturing frames texturing 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.410
 glass that is how to make glass we 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.980
 we will consider and so on and so on 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:29.050
 the like, that is, we will completely 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.380
 finish creating materials on our 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.380
 objects 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:41.950
 8 8 theme is the subject of lighting creation 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.960
 building interior lighting types 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.620
 lighting that we will use 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.770
 this 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.570
 faith light and flat faith light 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.070
 spherical as well 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.570
 the doors of a and of faith a have it if you 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.570
 know analog 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.210
 photometry photometric fixtures 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:07.840
 which are present in the standard 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:10.900
 light supply as well as we will light 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.890
 the whole scene with the help of a material 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.580
 light how is all this done you 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:21.430
 learn in topic number 8 so go to 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.820
 9 topic here we will customize 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.360
 visualization parameters in gamma 2 and 2 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:32.110
 if you heard about this scale but not yet 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.650
 know how to work in it how to configure 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.280
 all advanced options to 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:42.070
 I finally played visualization you 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.850
 will now use this 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.760
 features as well as in topic number nine you 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.900
 get familiar with setting up physical 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.729
 cameras and final setup 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.700
 parameters by faith before from the ultimate 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:00.370
 visualization well and move on to the final 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.950
 parts of our training 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.550
 this is the final processing of photoshop 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:10.219
 the resulting image need it 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:16.009
 necessarily to give a gloss 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:18.749
 final render.ru so what was it 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.580
 video workshop exterior 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.580
 visualization number 2
