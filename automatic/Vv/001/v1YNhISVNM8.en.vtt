that just came to my brain I thought was

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.020

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.750 
similar to this picture which is a man
on<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.899> table<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> beard<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.039> his<00:00:50.430> brains

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
on the table with a beard and his brains

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639

this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.399> food<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:56.789> thought<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
this is food for thought just because it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.470 
this is food for thought just because it
very<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.199> could<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.149> armored<00:01:00.149> guy<00:01:00.300> we

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
very well could be the armored guy we

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.430 
very well could be the armored guy we
saw<00:01:00.629> at<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> beginning<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> trailer

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
saw at the beginning of the trailer

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.110 
saw at the beginning of the trailer
which<00:01:01.559> I'll<00:01:01.680> show<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.859> right<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.520> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
which I'll show you right now and it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.570 
which I'll show you right now and it
most<00:01:03.300> likely<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.680> I'd<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> kind<00:01:05.519> of

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
most likely is but I'd like to kind of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640

don't know what your guys opinions are

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
don't know what your guys opinions are
are<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.790> actually<00:01:18.180> being<00:01:18.390> Maxis<00:01:18.840> could

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
are on this actually being Maxis could

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.660 
are on this actually being Maxis could
that<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.320> max<00:01:19.530> s<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> table<00:01:20.189> table<00:01:20.460> because

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
that be max s on the table table because

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.399 
that be max s on the table table because
it<00:01:20.759> looks<00:01:20.909> very<00:01:20.970> very<00:01:21.390> similar<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.049> him<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
it looks very very similar to him in the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.020 
it looks very very similar to him in the
picture<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.830> pay<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.580> real<00:01:23.820> close

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
picture if you pay like real close

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.300 
picture if you pay like real close
attention<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:25.229> way<00:01:25.350> his<00:01:25.500> nostrils<00:01:26.070> curve

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
attention to the way his nostrils curve

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
attention to the way his nostrils curve
up<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> shape<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.270> his<00:01:27.360> beard<00:01:27.659> how<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
up and the shape of his beard how it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
up and the shape of his beard how it
comes<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> point<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.220> would<00:01:29.369> say<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
comes to a point and I would say the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.980 
comes to a point and I would say the
beard<00:01:29.939> would<00:01:30.119> be<00:01:30.270> more<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.630> factor<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
beard would be more of a factor to the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.530 
beard would be more of a factor to the
zombie<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> beginning<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.329> you<00:01:36.329> can't

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
zombie at the beginning but you can't

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.580 
zombie at the beginning but you can't
really<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.810> his<00:01:37.049> nose<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> beginning

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
really see his nose in the beginning

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
really see his nose in the beginning
either<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.430> kind<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.850> probably<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
either so it's kind of it's probably the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.910 
either so it's kind of it's probably the
same<00:01:39.509> model<00:01:39.869> I'm<00:01:39.990> probably<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.439> thinking

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
same model I'm probably just thinking

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.469 
same model I'm probably just thinking
too<00:01:41.100> hard<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.549> thinking<00:01:41.850> too<00:01:42.000> deep<00:01:42.180> into<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
too hard and thinking too deep into it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
30 minutes straight so i decided to see

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
what it looked like and it looks similar

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.020 
what it looked like and it looks similar
to<00:02:04.770> me<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.979> know<00:02:05.100> he's<00:02:05.219> bald<00:02:05.460> his<00:02:05.700> brains

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
to me you know he's bald his brains

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
to me you know he's bald his brains
missing<00:02:06.420> which<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.930> very<00:02:07.409> very

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
missing which is and very very

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.930 
missing which is and very very
interesting<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.459> were

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
interesting if it were

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.550 
interesting if it were
access<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:09.390> his<00:02:09.540> brain<00:02:09.810> was<00:02:09.990> missing<00:02:10.380> there

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
access and his brain was missing there

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.110 
access and his brain was missing there
on<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> table<00:02:11.070> right<00:02:11.430> there<00:02:11.640> when<00:02:11.880> they<00:02:11.970> all

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
on the table right there when they all

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.000 
on the table right there when they all
met<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.990> would<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.260> really<00:02:13.440> interesting

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
met that would be really interesting

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.920 
met that would be really interesting
because<00:02:14.130> obviously<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.240> crews<00:02:15.420> never<00:02:15.690> met

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
because obviously the crews never met

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.570 
because obviously the crews never met
Maxis<00:02:16.380> they<00:02:16.560> don't<00:02:16.740> know<00:02:16.830> who<00:02:16.980> max<00:02:17.220> well<00:02:17.460> they

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
Maxis they don't know who max well they

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.890 
Maxis they don't know who max well they
know<00:02:17.670> whom<00:02:17.820> access<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.300> but<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:18.660> don't

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
know whom access is but they don't

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.320 
know whom access is but they don't
they've<00:02:19.890> never<00:02:20.070> seen<00:02:20.340> him<00:02:20.460> other<00:02:20.910> than<00:02:21.060> right

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
they've never seen him other than right

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.550 
they've never seen him other than right
there<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.930> him<00:02:22.140> which<00:02:22.350> would<00:02:22.440> be

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
there if that is him which would be

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.320 
there if that is him which would be
really<00:02:22.710> interesting<00:02:23.190> as<00:02:23.310> well<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.490> mean<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:24.300> a

really interesting as well I mean it's a
really<00:02:24.510> good<00:02:24.720> loophole<00:02:25.590> plot<00:02:25.860> which<00:02:26.100> type

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
thing if that were to be him that'd be

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.050 
thing if that were to be him that'd be
really<00:02:28.170> cool<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.130> kind<00:02:29.490> of<00:02:29.520> like<00:02:29.670> hope<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:29.970> is
