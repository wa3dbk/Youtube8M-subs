00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
critical thinking and when I say

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.310 
critical thinking and when I say
critical<00:01:19.320> thinking<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.950> um<00:01:20.899> to<00:01:21.899> break<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
critical thinking that um to break it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.139 
critical thinking that um to break it
down<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.740> seems<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.550> everybody<00:01:23.910> with<00:01:24.060> their

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
down it seems like everybody with their

about<00:01:26.970> solution<00:01:27.660> solution<00:01:27.869> solutions<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.580> I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
about solution solution solutions but I

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.279 
about solution solution solutions but I
don't<00:01:29.880> think<00:01:30.090> when<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:30.630> come<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> these

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
don't think when they come to these

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.680 
don't think when they come to these
solutions<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:32.039> they<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:32.820> looked

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
solutions that they have really looked

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.410 
solutions that they have really looked
within<00:01:34.140> themselves<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:35.240> identified<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
within themselves and identified and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.029 
within themselves and identified and
understand<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> problem<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.830> the

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
understand what the problem is the

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.760 
understand what the problem is the
problem<00:01:38.190> a<00:01:38.610> lot<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.300> times<00:01:39.539> is<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:40.050> I<00:01:40.320> mean<00:01:40.530> we

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
problem a lot of times is not I mean we

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.700 
problem a lot of times is not I mean we
just<00:01:41.190> look<00:01:41.310> at<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.520> surface<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.410> eat<00:01:43.410> too<00:01:43.560> much

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710

I'm<00:01:44.009> overweight<00:01:44.430> or<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.670> eat<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.940> wrong<00:01:45.090> things

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
I'm overweight or I eat the wrong things

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.230 
I'm overweight or I eat the wrong things
that's<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> problem<00:01:46.289> well<00:01:47.250> I'm<00:01:47.849> going<00:01:48.179> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
that's the problem well I'm going to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.490 
that's the problem well I'm going to
tell<00:01:48.539> you<00:01:48.569> it's<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> little<00:01:49.020> deeper<00:01:49.319> than<00:01:49.380> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
tell you it's a little deeper than that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.990 
tell you it's a little deeper than that
and<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:51.060> say<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:52.170> year<00:01:52.399> 2013<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.789> year

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and as I say the year 2013 is the year

much different than the next person and
because<00:02:19.739> yeah<00:02:20.099> like<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.370> said<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.700> eating

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
because yeah like I said that eating

because yeah like I said that eating
plan<00:02:21.300> he<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:22.260> far<00:02:22.440> as<00:02:22.590> I'm<00:02:22.709> concerned<00:02:22.739> it's

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
plan he is as far as I'm concerned it's

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.699 
plan he is as far as I'm concerned it's
a<00:02:23.370> little<00:02:23.580> piece<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.510> paper<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.230> chart<00:02:25.530> you

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
a little piece of paper it's a chart you

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.699 
a little piece of paper it's a chart you
made<00:02:25.890> its<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.500> not<00:02:28.680> what

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
made its this and that that is not what

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.729 
made its this and that that is not what
makes<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.760> plan<00:02:30.000> successful<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.349> the

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
makes the plan successful it is the

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.870 
makes the plan successful it is the
person<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.650> brings<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.819> to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
person it is you that brings that to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.420 
person it is you that brings that to
life<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.540> makes<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.930> special<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.770> makes<00:02:38.250> it

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
life that makes it special and makes it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.030 
life that makes it special and makes it
work<00:02:38.640> for<00:02:38.879> you<00:02:38.970> if<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.300> makes<00:02:39.480> sense<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.440> the

work for you if that makes sense so the
question<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:42.530> what<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.709> stopping<00:02:44.010> us<00:02:45.290> because

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
question is what is stopping us because

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.449 
question is what is stopping us because
when<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.530> think<00:02:46.560> about<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.160> can<00:02:47.310> do

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
when you think about it you can do

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.710 
when you think about it you can do
everybody<00:02:47.879> says<00:02:48.060> great<00:02:48.270> what<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.540> what

the exact exercise plan you can do the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.550 
the exact exercise plan you can do the
exact<00:02:52.380> eating<00:02:53.100> plan<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.580> somebody<00:02:54.210> that

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
exact eating plan is somebody that

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.500 
exact eating plan is somebody that
you<00:02:56.560> want<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:56.830> consider<00:02:57.640> your<00:02:57.820> mentor<00:02:58.240> or

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
you want to consider your mentor or

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.070 
you want to consider your mentor or
whatever<00:02:59.490> and<00:03:00.490> you're<00:03:00.790> still<00:03:01.030> finding<00:03:01.900> ways

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
whatever and you're still finding ways

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.210 
whatever and you're still finding ways
to<00:03:03.010> fall<00:03:03.220> down<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.690> when<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.380> say<00:03:05.650> look<00:03:05.980> at

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
to fall down and so when I say look at

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.420 
to fall down and so when I say look at
the<00:03:06.370> problem<00:03:06.820> with<00:03:07.000> when<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.570> say<00:03:07.750> 2013<00:03:08.740> is<00:03:09.010> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
the problem with when I say 2013 is the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.570 
the problem with when I say 2013 is the
year<00:03:09.610> of<00:03:09.640> critical<00:03:10.180> thinking<00:03:10.210> I<00:03:11.580> think

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
year of critical thinking I think

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.560 
year of critical thinking I think
universally<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:15.190> cause<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.700> weight<00:03:16.360> loss

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
universally the cause of weight loss

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.550 
universally the cause of weight loss
failure<00:03:16.959> is<00:03:17.340> can<00:03:18.340> be<00:03:19.050> summed<00:03:20.050> up<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.320> one<00:03:20.380> word

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
failure is can be summed up in one word

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.760 
failure is can be summed up in one word
and<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.040> word<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.430> apathy<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.930> could<00:03:23.110> be<00:03:23.260> week

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
and that word is apathy it could be week

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.920 
and that word is apathy it could be week
long<00:03:24.040> stretch<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.670> could<00:03:24.820> be<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:24.970> one<00:03:25.390> moment

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
long stretch it could be that one moment

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.680 
long stretch it could be that one moment
of<00:03:26.230> apathy<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:26.709> one<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.340> don't<00:03:27.850> care<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.300> moment
