and then and this I'm still frozen just

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.590 
and then and this I'm still frozen just
crushing<00:01:36.680> damage<00:01:37.070> which<00:01:37.250> is<00:01:37.430> better<00:01:37.640> for<00:01:40.600> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
crushing damage which is better for the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.340 
crushing damage which is better for the
missile<00:01:41.869> attack<00:01:42.110> area<00:01:43.450> due<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.479> well<00:01:44.930> since<00:01:45.259> it

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
it goes all right I'm just gonna try to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.419 
it goes all right I'm just gonna try to
finish<00:01:57.440> up<00:01:57.710> this<00:01:57.860> battle<00:01:58.220> as<00:01:58.340> fast<00:01:58.610> as<00:01:58.789> I<00:01:58.910> can

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:10.749 

all<00:02:04.429> right<00:02:08.500> earlier<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:09.800> lost<00:02:10.009> one<00:02:10.429> because

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
all right earlier and I lost one because

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.910 
all right earlier and I lost one because
of<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:12.430> all<00:02:13.430> right<00:02:13.870> now<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.290> missiles<00:02:15.680> take

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
of that all right now the missiles take

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.590 
of that all right now the missiles take
a<00:02:15.950> while<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:17.780> can't<00:02:18.080> just<00:02:18.200> use<00:02:18.680> them<00:02:19.600> last

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
a while so you can't just use them last

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:34.190 
a while so you can't just use them last
things<00:02:20.900> away

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.660 

that's<00:02:35.200> really<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.650> most<00:02:35.860> useful<00:02:36.099> thing<00:02:36.340> they

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
that's really the most useful thing they

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.220 
that's really the most useful thing they
can<00:02:36.819> take<00:02:37.000> out<00:02:37.150> air<00:02:42.629> so<00:02:43.629> you<00:02:43.689> can<00:02:43.900> pretty<00:02:44.140> much

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
can take out air so you can pretty much

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.720 
can take out air so you can pretty much
shut<00:02:44.709> off<00:02:44.890> air<00:02:45.189> units<00:02:50.189> unless<00:02:51.189> is<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.459> sky

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
shut off air units unless is the sky

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.970 
shut off air units unless is the sky
Boston<00:02:52.269> nothing<00:02:52.390> will<00:02:52.750> die<00:02:53.019> within<00:02:53.319> a<00:02:53.500> second

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
Boston nothing will die within a second

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.970 
Boston nothing will die within a second
because<00:02:54.519> as<00:02:55.269> many<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.140> know<00:02:56.170> sky<00:02:56.530> buses

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
because as many of you know sky buses
