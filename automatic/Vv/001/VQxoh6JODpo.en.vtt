00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Kumla, a place where time passes more slowly.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.500
Some 14,000 people live here, about a two-hour drive west of Stockholm!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.500
Marcus: “I made my decision myself to still have my place here in Kumla."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.180
"Always a good recharge for me and I always like being home."

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.500
"Even if it is cold and snowy sometimes.”

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Everything is close together here, like his old school.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.900
Marcus: "Good morning" Marika: "Welcome back!"

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.500
Marika: “It’s been a long time.” Marcus: “Nice to see you!”

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Marika Rohlin was his fourth and fifth grade teacher!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.500
Everyone here is proud of their most famous former student!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.500
Marika: “Whenever you need a little flashback, you can come here and have a look at these photos.”

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.500
While life has changed dramatically for Marcus, here things are still the same.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.500
Marcus: “Where did I sit?” Marika: “Your desk was there in the corner.”

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.500
Marika: “I remember when Marcus started driving a go-kart."

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.500
"There was a big article about him in our regional newspaper."

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.500
"One of the other students brought that article into class."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.500
"But Marcus didn’t really want to talk about it."

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.500
"He was rather shy and reserved, and didn’t need to tell everyone what he was good at."

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.500
"The article was about a big race he had won."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.500
"And that kind of behavior was typical for Marcus."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.500
"He never needed to be a big shot.”

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.500
His parents still live in Kumla, as do his best friends Robin and Kristoffer!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.500
Marcus has known them all his life.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.500
“I always knew he would be a big star. Because he was so good at go-kart.”

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.500
“He’s still the same guy.”

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.500
The same guy who also prefers winning to losing when it comes to video games.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.500
Afraid for him, they aren’t.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.500
“Even if he crashes, it seems quite safe...”

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.500
“His cars don’t go that fast anyway… Can I say that?!”

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.500
Marcus: “I love to come back to Kumla and see my friends, my family and just be a normal guy!”

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.500
For Marcus, it’s like time stood still In Kumla – a strong contrast to the race track!
