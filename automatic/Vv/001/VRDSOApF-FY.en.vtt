00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.620
 September is the peak of the whale season 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.799
 is a chance for the 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.019
 researchers will know the recovery of 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.140
 the house almost led to the 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.600
 extinction 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.500
 helicopter it flew over a 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.410
 distance of 3 thousand and 400 km between punta 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.180
 from east in uruguay to macaé littoral 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.160
 north of rio de janeiro 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.369
 the largest was the monitoring of 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.680
 whales already made in the world only from above is 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.870
 possible to identify the pullets 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.079
 the warts on the head are like 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.600
 fingerprints so every animal 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.540
 Uruguayan was photographed 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.629
 the researchers counted 32 whales 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.030
 adult males and females what makes the 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.969
 the neighboring country an area of 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.840
 species mating on the Grand River of 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:59.350
 48 whales were spotted over the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.199
 true females accompanied by puppies 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.199
 the overflight confirmed the preference of 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.960
 whales franca by the coast of Santa Catarina 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.750
 of warmer waters cut out of bays 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.690
 is the species nursery says 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.080
 biologists with 117 whales 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.130
 the vast majority of areas of mother and cub 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.759
 a phenomenon intrigues researchers 50 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 whales 60% of all that were sighted 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.829
 were concentrated in this flight. 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.079
 short seven-mile stretch of 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.100
 cove of debt that was that holy 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.960
 Catherine 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.000
 we suspect that the cast of the fund 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.950
 of the sea that eliminates that era and movement 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.229
 of the chains creates a favorable environment 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.299
 the permanence of polenta here with its 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.299
 puppies in after each list 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.009
 the spectacle of a plan of more than 100 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.340
 dolphin on the paulista coast 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.189
 the registration of two bryde whales but 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.950
 to the disappointment of the researchers in a 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.090
 franca was seen at paraná são paulo and 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.479
 rio de janeiro 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.710
 in the past the species is found until the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.019
 Bahia coast 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.970
 we are a joy with species support 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.769
 which not only continues to recover with the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.680
 appearance of many puppies 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.390
 but in southeastern Brazil still had a 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.980
 example of whales, which makes the 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.049
 We have to work hard for the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.049
 species is actually considered to be strong 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.879
