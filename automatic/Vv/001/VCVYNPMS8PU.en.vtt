00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:03.639 
hi there my name is Matt lawless I'm one

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:05.339 
hi there my name is Matt lawless I'm one
of<00:00:03.730> the<00:00:03.879> directors<00:00:04.210> here<00:00:04.689> at<00:00:04.750> the<00:00:04.899> mic<00:00:05.080> store

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:05.349 
of the directors here at the mic store

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:06.870 
of the directors here at the mic store
and<00:00:05.680> today<00:00:06.069> I<00:00:06.220> want<00:00:06.370> to<00:00:06.430> talk<00:00:06.580> to<00:00:06.700> you<00:00:06.790> about

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
and today I want to talk to you about

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.690 
and today I want to talk to you about
wireless<00:00:07.479> mics<00:00:08.010> there<00:00:09.010> you<00:00:09.129> may<00:00:09.250> know<00:00:09.429> them<00:00:09.610> as

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
wireless mics there you may know them as

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.619 
wireless mics there you may know them as
radio<00:00:10.059> mics<00:00:10.360> but<00:00:11.290> wireless<00:00:11.740> mics<00:00:11.950> radio<00:00:12.339> mics

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:12.629 
radio mics but wireless mics radio mics

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.999 
radio mics but wireless mics radio mics
effectively<00:00:13.629> all<00:00:13.780> they<00:00:13.900> are<00:00:14.079> is<00:00:14.200> a<00:00:14.349> microphone

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
effectively all they are is a microphone

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.640 
effectively all they are is a microphone
which<00:00:15.190> allows<00:00:15.459> you<00:00:15.669> to<00:00:16.080> perform<00:00:17.080> or<00:00:17.440> to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
which allows you to perform or to

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.720 
which allows you to perform or to
present<00:00:18.640> on<00:00:19.060> stage<00:00:19.530> without<00:00:20.530> wires<00:00:21.310> getting

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
present on stage without wires getting

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.870 
present on stage without wires getting
in<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:21.940> way<00:00:22.090> of<00:00:22.120> of<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.080> performance<00:00:23.880> now

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
in the way of of the performance now

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.430 
in the way of of the performance now
there<00:00:25.510> seems<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:25.780> be<00:00:25.840> a<00:00:25.870> lot<00:00:25.990> of<00:00:26.050> confusion

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
there seems to be a lot of confusion

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.650 
there seems to be a lot of confusion
about<00:00:26.620> what<00:00:27.250> makes<00:00:27.430> up<00:00:27.670> a<00:00:27.760> wireless<00:00:28.000> mic<00:00:28.330> so<00:00:28.630> I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
about what makes up a wireless mic so I

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.360 
about what makes up a wireless mic so I
just<00:00:28.780> want<00:00:28.960> to<00:00:29.050> go<00:00:29.140> through<00:00:29.380> very<00:00:29.650> basics<00:00:30.160> and

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.370 
just want to go through very basics and

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.580 
just want to go through very basics and
essentially<00:00:31.360> how<00:00:31.540> to<00:00:31.600> help<00:00:31.870> you<00:00:32.050> choose<00:00:32.320> the

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
essentially how to help you choose the

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.400 
essentially how to help you choose the
right<00:00:32.770> one<00:00:33.010> for<00:00:33.039> your<00:00:33.309> application<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.899> first

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
right one for your application so first

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.509 
right one for your application so first
of<00:00:35.559> all<00:00:35.679> we'll<00:00:36.670> talk<00:00:36.879> about<00:00:37.179> the<00:00:37.929> receiver<00:00:38.519> now

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
of all we'll talk about the receiver now

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.209 
of all we'll talk about the receiver now
this<00:00:39.969> is<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.149> receiver<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.920> one's<00:00:42.159> a<00:00:42.309> cam<00:00:42.820> kwm

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
this is a receiver this one's a cam kwm

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.250 
this is a receiver this one's a cam kwm
1960<00:00:45.390> essentially<00:00:46.390> what<00:00:46.510> this<00:00:46.659> does<00:00:46.989> this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
1960 essentially what this does this

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.829 
1960 essentially what this does this
terminates<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.219> wireless<00:00:48.640> signal<00:00:49.059> that's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
terminates the wireless signal that's

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.989 
terminates the wireless signal that's
been<00:00:50.019> sent<00:00:50.289> by<00:00:50.409> the<00:00:50.469> transmitter<00:00:51.129> so<00:00:51.819> for

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
been sent by the transmitter so for

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:53.099 
been sent by the transmitter so for
every<00:00:52.179> wireless<00:00:52.600> mic<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.960> have<00:00:53.079> a

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
every wireless mic you have a

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.799 
every wireless mic you have a
transmitter<00:00:53.679> and<00:00:53.979> you<00:00:54.129> have<00:00:54.219> a<00:00:54.249> receiver<00:00:54.809> and

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
transmitter and you have a receiver and

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.410 
transmitter and you have a receiver and
this<00:00:56.289> is<00:00:56.499> essentially<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.129> thing<00:00:57.370> that<00:00:57.609> ends

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
this is essentially the thing that ends

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.619 
this is essentially the thing that ends
the<00:00:58.600> chain<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.949> effectively<00:01:00.460> like<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.239> normal

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
the chain and effectively like a normal

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.410 
the chain and effectively like a normal
mic<00:01:01.839> has<00:01:02.289> a<00:01:02.319> microphone<00:01:03.309> socket<00:01:03.609> where<00:01:04.330> it

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
mic has a microphone socket where it

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.910 
mic has a microphone socket where it
comes<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:04.809> you<00:01:04.960> plug<00:01:05.199> it<00:01:05.320> into<00:01:05.469> your

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
comes and you plug it into your

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.969 
comes and you plug it into your
amplification<00:01:06.700> system<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:08.170> that's<00:01:08.770> your

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
amplification system so that's your

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.100 
amplification system so that's your
receiver<00:01:09.340> these<00:01:09.850> come<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.719> lots<00:01:10.899> of<00:01:11.049> different

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
receiver these come in lots of different

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.310 
receiver these come in lots of different
forms<00:01:12.119> you'll<00:01:13.119> notice<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.630> this<00:01:13.780> one<00:01:13.840> has

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
forms you'll notice that this one has

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.590 
forms you'll notice that this one has
two<00:01:14.829> aerials<00:01:15.219> on<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:15.969> these<00:01:16.119> areas<00:01:16.329> are

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
two aerials on and these areas are

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.850 
two aerials on and these areas are
actually<00:01:16.719> detachable<00:01:17.409> you<00:01:17.619> can<00:01:17.740> actually

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
actually detachable you can actually

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.289 
actually detachable you can actually
unscrew<00:01:18.490> them<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:20.259> remove<00:01:20.950> them<00:01:21.250> which<00:01:22.119> may

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
unscrew them and remove them which may

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.149 
unscrew them and remove them which may
sound<00:01:22.509> a<00:01:22.630> bit<00:01:22.659> daft<00:01:22.960> but<00:01:23.259> if<00:01:23.680> you're<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.009> a

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
sound a bit daft but if you're in a

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.219 
sound a bit daft but if you're in a
difficult<00:01:24.759> reception<00:01:25.509> area<00:01:25.719> you<00:01:25.750> may<00:01:25.930> want<00:01:26.140> to

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
difficult reception area you may want to

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.010 
difficult reception area you may want to
basically<00:01:27.039> get<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:27.820> aerial<00:01:28.210> further<00:01:28.570> away

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
basically get this aerial further away

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.490 
basically get this aerial further away
from<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.850> box<00:01:31.030> itself<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.689> improve<00:01:32.380> your

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
from the box itself and improve your

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.859 
from the box itself and improve your
reception<00:01:32.950> capabilities<00:01:33.609> you<00:01:34.329> could<00:01:34.479> also<00:01:34.600> go

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
reception capabilities you could also go

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.920 
reception capabilities you could also go
as<00:01:34.990> far<00:01:35.170> as<00:01:35.369> an<00:01:36.369> antenna<00:01:36.789> distribution<00:01:37.539> system

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
as far as an antenna distribution system

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.749 
as far as an antenna distribution system
which<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.289> could<00:01:38.439> use<00:01:38.469> one<00:01:38.890> pair<00:01:39.219> of<00:01:39.250> antenna

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
which you could use one pair of antenna

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.760 
which you could use one pair of antenna
or<00:01:40.180> even<00:01:40.659> sort<00:01:40.869> of<00:01:40.960> paddle<00:01:41.380> antenna<00:01:41.649> which

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
or even sort of paddle antenna which

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.179 
or even sort of paddle antenna which
like<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.420> high-powered<00:01:43.710> receiving<00:01:44.710> antennas

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
like a high-powered receiving antennas

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.020 
like a high-powered receiving antennas
to<00:01:46.149> feed<00:01:46.329> like<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.539> number<00:01:46.899> of<00:01:47.020> different

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to feed like a number of different

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.539 
to feed like a number of different
receivers<00:01:49.030> or<00:01:49.210> wireless<00:01:50.109> systems<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:51.399> that

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
receivers or wireless systems so that

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.520 
receivers or wireless systems so that
that's<00:01:51.969> your<00:01:52.149> receiver<00:01:52.479> that's<00:01:53.289> what

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
that's your receiver that's what

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.410 
that's your receiver that's what
terminates<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.280> signal<00:01:54.640> because<00:01:55.270> you're

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
terminates the signal because you're

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.609 
terminates the signal because you're
going<00:01:55.539> to<00:01:55.600> send<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.929> signal<00:01:56.049> in<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.380> first

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
going to send the signal in the first

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.469 
going to send the signal in the first
place<00:01:56.829> and<00:01:57.039> there<00:01:57.520> you've<00:01:57.670> got<00:01:57.700> some<00:01:57.820> choices

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
place and there you've got some choices

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.219 
place and there you've got some choices
now<00:01:59.219> most<00:02:00.219> people<00:02:00.630> associate<00:02:01.630> something<00:02:01.929> like

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
now most people associate something like

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.919 
now most people associate something like
this<00:02:02.499> with<00:02:03.429> a<00:02:03.460> wireless<00:02:03.850> mic<00:02:04.060> it's<00:02:04.630> something

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
this with a wireless mic it's something

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:05.940 
this with a wireless mic it's something
that<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.079> hold<00:02:05.200> in<00:02:05.380> your<00:02:05.409> hand<00:02:05.679> there's<00:02:05.920> no

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
that you hold in your hand there's no

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.919 
that you hold in your hand there's no
wires<00:02:06.369> coming<00:02:06.670> out<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.939> bottom<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.420> that's

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
wires coming out the bottom and that's

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.270 
wires coming out the bottom and that's
what<00:02:08.050> we<00:02:08.110> call<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.350> transmitter<00:02:08.890> the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
what we call the transmitter the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.490 
what we call the transmitter the
transmitting<00:02:09.879> parties<00:02:10.330> typically<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.319> this

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
transmitting parties typically in this

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.920 
transmitting parties typically in this
part<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:12.010> of<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.909> mic<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.150> that's<00:02:13.420> that's<00:02:13.720> a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
part of of this mic and that's that's a

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.170 
part of of this mic and that's that's a
handheld<00:02:14.379> transmitter<00:02:14.849> there<00:02:15.849> come<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.120> a

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
handheld transmitter there come in a

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.940 
handheld transmitter there come in a
variety<00:02:16.329> of<00:02:16.750> shapes<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.469> sizes

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
variety of shapes and sizes

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.860 
variety of shapes and sizes
people<00:02:18.519> manufacturers<00:02:19.150> different<00:02:19.299> brands

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
people manufacturers different brands

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.660 
people manufacturers different brands
but<00:02:20.019> in<00:02:20.560> essence<00:02:20.920> what<00:02:21.129> it's<00:02:21.250> doing<00:02:21.519> is<00:02:21.579> it's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
but in essence what it's doing is it's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.130 
but in essence what it's doing is it's
picking<00:02:22.000> up<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.209> voice<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.870> have<00:02:22.989> to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
picking up the voice you have to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.349 
picking up the voice you have to
normally<00:02:23.530> get<00:02:23.680> quite<00:02:23.920> close<00:02:24.189> to<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.299> then

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
normally get quite close to it and then

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.149 
normally get quite close to it and then
sending<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.840> through<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.709> receiver

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
sending that through to the receiver

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.399 
sending that through to the receiver
that<00:02:27.189> I<00:02:27.340> showed<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.760> earlier<00:02:27.790> on<00:02:28.260> there<00:02:29.260> are

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
things and they'll just clip typically

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.979 
things and they'll just clip typically
with<00:03:36.159> a<00:03:36.189> little<00:03:36.489> clip<00:03:36.729> here<00:03:37.060> where<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:37.870> can

again one thing just to be aware of
there<00:05:13.279> are<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.400> couple<00:05:13.550> of<00:05:13.699> differences<00:05:14.060> with

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
there are a couple of differences with

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.779 
there are a couple of differences with
these<00:05:14.569> that<00:05:14.779> you<00:05:14.840> can<00:05:15.020> pick<00:05:15.229> up<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:16.520> do<00:05:16.639> with

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
these that you can pick up to do with

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.029 
these that you can pick up to do with
how<00:05:17.029> they<00:05:17.240> actually<00:05:17.389> pick<00:05:17.810> up<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.169> sound<00:05:18.439> just

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
how they actually pick up the sound just

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.939 
how they actually pick up the sound just
cover<00:05:19.340> that<00:05:19.430> off<00:05:19.639> very<00:05:19.669> briefly<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:21.650> can<00:05:21.680> buy

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
cover that off very briefly you can buy

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.010 
cover that off very briefly you can buy
these<00:05:22.009> in<00:05:22.189> what's<00:05:22.699> called<00:05:22.849> cardioid<00:05:23.419> form<00:05:23.810> or

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
these in what's called cardioid form or

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.950 
these in what's called cardioid form or
omnidirectional<00:05:24.979> form<00:05:25.699> and<00:05:26.300> then<00:05:26.389> cardioid

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
omnidirectional form and then cardioid

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.110 
omnidirectional form and then cardioid
that<00:05:27.110> basically<00:05:27.469> is<00:05:27.620> a<00:05:27.680> directional<00:05:28.370> pickup

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
that basically is a directional pickup

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.779 
that basically is a directional pickup
so<00:05:29.479> it<00:05:30.020> would<00:05:30.139> pick<00:05:30.349> me<00:05:30.500> up<00:05:30.620> if<00:05:30.889> it's<00:05:31.250> pointing

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
so it would pick me up if it's pointing

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.329 
so it would pick me up if it's pointing
towards<00:05:31.940> my<00:05:32.449> mouth<00:05:32.629> though<00:05:33.349> away<00:05:33.860> from<00:05:34.099> it<00:05:34.219> and

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:34.339 
towards my mouth though away from it and

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.129 
towards my mouth though away from it and
it's<00:05:34.430> going<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:34.669> do<00:05:34.759> its<00:05:34.909> best<00:05:35.089> to<00:05:35.300> reject<00:05:35.990> the

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
it's going to do its best to reject the

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.839 
it's going to do its best to reject the
sound<00:05:36.379> that's<00:05:36.529> it's<00:05:36.830> picking<00:05:37.129> up<00:05:37.219> from<00:05:37.400> behind

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
sound that's it's picking up from behind

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.430 
sound that's it's picking up from behind
that's<00:05:38.240> a<00:05:38.330> cardioid<00:05:38.810> to<00:05:38.990> pick<00:05:39.110> up<00:05:39.259> and

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
that's a cardioid to pick up and

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.100 
that's a cardioid to pick up and
cardioid<00:05:39.919> heart-shaped<00:05:40.610> is<00:05:41.389> where<00:05:41.990> that

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
cardioid heart-shaped is where that

cardioid heart-shaped is where that
comes<00:05:42.169> from<00:05:42.469> and<00:05:42.620> will<00:05:42.919> pick<00:05:43.039> up<00:05:43.219> something

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
comes from and will pick up something

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.790 
comes from and will pick up something
like<00:05:43.580> that<00:05:44.120> in<00:05:44.930> terms<00:05:45.199> of<00:05:45.349> where<00:05:45.469> the<00:05:45.589> mics

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
like that in terms of where the mics

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.950 
like that in terms of where the mics
positions<00:05:46.339> as<00:05:47.270> opposed<00:05:47.509> to<00:05:47.599> omnidirectional

positions as opposed to omnidirectional
the<00:05:48.500> one<00:05:48.680> I'm<00:05:48.889> using<00:05:49.069> at<00:05:49.219> the<00:05:49.279> moment<00:05:49.310> is<00:05:49.550> on

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
the one I'm using at the moment is on

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.860 
the one I'm using at the moment is on
the<00:05:49.699> directional<00:05:50.210> I<00:05:50.330> don't<00:05:50.509> where<00:05:50.629> you<00:05:50.690> can

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
the directional I don't where you can

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.240 
the directional I don't where you can
see<00:05:51.139> but<00:05:51.349> this<00:05:51.440> mic<00:05:51.710> is<00:05:51.740> actually<00:05:52.069> pointing

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
see but this mic is actually pointing

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.430 
see but this mic is actually pointing
downwards<00:05:52.940> and<00:05:53.509> yet<00:05:53.659> it's<00:05:53.839> still<00:05:53.930> picking<00:05:54.349> me

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
downwards and yet it's still picking me

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.200 
downwards and yet it's still picking me
up<00:05:54.469> fine<00:05:54.919> that's<00:05:55.310> because<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.729> picks<00:05:55.940> up<00:05:56.089> the

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
up fine that's because it picks up the

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.850 
up fine that's because it picks up the
sound<00:05:56.389> equally<00:05:57.020> all<00:05:57.169> the<00:05:57.319> way<00:05:57.439> around<00:05:57.710> the

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
sound equally all the way around the

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.129 
sound equally all the way around the
microphone<00:05:58.089> so<00:05:59.089> if<00:05:59.240> that's<00:05:59.389> my<00:05:59.629> microphone

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
microphone so if that's my microphone

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.990 
microphone so if that's my microphone
it's<00:06:00.319> literally<00:06:00.740> picking<00:06:00.949> up<00:06:01.189> all<00:06:01.639> the<00:06:01.909> way

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
it's literally picking up all the way

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.350 
it's literally picking up all the way
around<00:06:02.330> left<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.139> right<00:06:03.370> front<00:06:04.370> to<00:06:04.520> back<00:06:04.699> top

whether you use those two different

hear a little bit of the top end sort of

bouncing around a little bit but if I

bouncing around a little bit but if I

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
wanted to make it more sound like it's

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.480 
wanted to make it more sound like it's
sort<00:06:30.259> of<00:06:30.289> being<00:06:30.560> spoken<00:06:31.039> directly<00:06:31.250> into<00:06:31.460> your

ear or if I want to control the
potential<00:06:34.490> of<00:06:34.580> feedback<00:06:35.120> then<00:06:35.389> I'm<00:06:35.539> much

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:35.719 
potential of feedback then I'm much

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:37.689 
potential of feedback then I'm much
better<00:06:35.930> off<00:06:36.080> with<00:06:36.229> a<00:06:36.259> cardioid<00:06:36.979> pickup

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
better off with a cardioid pickup

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:39.430 
better off with a cardioid pickup
because<00:06:38.240> that's<00:06:38.419> going<00:06:38.569> to<00:06:38.630> do<00:06:38.750> as<00:06:39.020> I<00:06:39.080> say<00:06:39.289> it's

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
because that's going to do as I say it's

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.879 
because that's going to do as I say it's
best<00:06:39.620> to<00:06:39.740> reject<00:06:40.159> sounds<00:06:40.550> that<00:06:40.669> you

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
best to reject sounds that you

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:42.739 
best to reject sounds that you
wanted<00:06:41.310> to<00:06:41.400> hear<00:06:41.580> and<00:06:41.939> that<00:06:41.999> would<00:06:42.509> include

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:42.749 
wanted to hear and that would include

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:45.170 
wanted to hear and that would include
the<00:06:43.110> microphone<00:06:43.919> hearing<00:06:44.340> itself<00:06:44.639> through

the speakers which is what causes a
