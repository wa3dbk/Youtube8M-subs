00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.650
 look at today 's recipe is a classic 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.109
 of Italian cuisine which is a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.109
 year tomato accompanying the masses 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.120
 parmegiani the series of plays 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.670
 what caught the attention of the recipe was 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.160
 that instead of five years is done in a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.730
 pan from kivu several hours more 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.329
 this sauce is made the more in the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.030
 susfor will vote for it very much 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.820
 more flavor and covered with foil 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.440
 you can choose texture after 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 What do you want to do with him? 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.940
 blender has a texture 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.550
 thinner or in the processor you have a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.500
 much thicker person 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.110
 The great advantage is that you do not need 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.880
 strip the skin 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.940
 only the tomato simply cuts through the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.340
 half fire places in all the games 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:16.350
 ambiance and copper intelligence 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.290
 put a wine and direct as snow 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.290
 He received touch to make a summary of 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.660
 Tomato accused one mold 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.280

 as the lady because the carrot because 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.270
 it breaks the acidity of the tomato with a 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:47.810
 head of garlic with hulk metal hull 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:55.259
 cut into four can rotate it so 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.220
 Everything is expected with a spoon and a half of 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.030
 salt 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.759
 I 'm using French gray salt then 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.000
 It has salt view because it is a great 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:13.940
 investment and you will see difference 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:20.570
 olive oil the whole team comes time 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:26.600
 a little bit of balsamic vinegar and take 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.600
 some chicken from me 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.940
 now this time of fire 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:53.900
 forty- five minutes later it's already 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:53.900
 ready for you to take it out of the oven ok 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:10.970
 given that the super super hot now 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:13.519
 gave a beautiful peeling chill 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.920
 the garlic cloves that are easy to 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:24.879
 You look here and we squeeze. 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:24.879
 he already knows the other 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.950
 in this case take a good look if not 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:48.850
 no means of thyme to perceive that 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:50.920
 in the middle of 2011 the rate on another one and rose 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.510
 ending our expedition in search of the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.800
 lost eye 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:00.280
 I think we 're already here for the 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.060
 next step food processor 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.540
 now starts putting those taken in the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.540
 processor 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:31.710
 the mec the texture who a little more and 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.710
 still gives a little bit 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.780
 of consistency 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.780
 Ok, we're just going to prove our horizon. 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.630
 very different from the one you 're going to 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.970
 find in supermarkets because 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.280
 me or you - you can control the 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.130
 amount of sodium salt and 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.320
 also of the ingredients is with more water 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.360
 Do you want to eat using this for example? 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.920
 How can we make money on a taste? 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.850
 outstanding 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.910

 another advantage of this monument was 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.230
 accessing the males you can add 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.360
 other ingredients is to have a 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.180

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.080
 Olive FernÃ£o Fernandinho and at night 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.370
 together you can add at that time
