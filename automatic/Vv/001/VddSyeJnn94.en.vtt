00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.320 

no<00:02:02.780> way<00:02:02.960> we<00:02:03.110> expected<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:04.610> kind<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:04.880> margin

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
no way we expected that kind of margin

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.539 
no way we expected that kind of margin
and<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.470> doesn't<00:02:06.740> really<00:02:06.860> reflect<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.369> two

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
and it doesn't really reflect the two

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.419 
and it doesn't really reflect the two
teams<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:08.000> really<00:02:08.179> feel<00:02:08.390> like<00:02:08.920> UCLA<00:02:09.920> has

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
teams I really feel like UCLA has

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.180 
teams I really feel like UCLA has
quality<00:02:11.150> all<00:02:11.270> over<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.540> field

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
quality all over the field

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.860 
quality all over the field
but<00:02:13.670> every<00:02:13.850> now<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.120> again<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.330> mean<00:02:14.630> if<00:02:14.720> we're

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
but every now and again I mean if we're

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.860 
but every now and again I mean if we're
connecting<00:02:15.410> things<00:02:15.950> like<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.280> can<00:02:16.400> happen

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
connecting things like that can happen

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.740 
connecting things like that can happen
we<00:02:17.870> never<00:02:18.760> expect<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.819> be<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.239> such<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> great

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
we never expect to be that such a great

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.680 
we never expect to be that such a great
team<00:02:21.340> seven<00:02:22.340> never<00:02:22.910> excited<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.330> score<00:02:23.510> more

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
team seven never excited to score more

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.920 
team seven never excited to score more
than<00:02:23.720> one<00:02:24.050> goal<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.290> them<00:02:24.620> if<00:02:24.800> we<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.330> but<00:02:26.330> yeah

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
than one goal on them if we can but yeah

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.340 
than one goal on them if we can but yeah
we<00:02:27.170> were<00:02:27.850> pretty<00:02:28.850> good<00:02:29.030> we<00:02:29.540> feel<00:02:29.750> excited<00:02:30.290> to

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
we were pretty good we feel excited to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.160 
we were pretty good we feel excited to
have<00:02:30.440> won<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.709> game<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.540> margin<00:02:32.959> for<00:02:33.049> us

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
have won the game and the margin for us

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.900 
have won the game and the margin for us
astray<00:02:33.530> we<00:02:33.769> believe<00:02:34.069> in<00:02:34.220> attacking<00:02:34.580> and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
astray we believe in attacking and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.220 
astray we believe in attacking and
scoring<00:02:35.269> goals<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.750> thought<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.110> was

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
scoring goals and I thought that was

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.310 
scoring goals and I thought that was
absolutely<00:02:36.380> super<00:02:36.980> for<00:02:37.160> us
