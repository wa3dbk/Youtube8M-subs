water so I removed the lid and I noticed
that<00:01:38.100> there's<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> lot<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:39.630> this

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that there's a lot of actually this

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.840 
that there's a lot of actually this
one's<00:01:40.020> pretty<00:01:40.290> good<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:41.220> there's<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> lot<00:01:41.820> of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
one's pretty good but there's a lot of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.780 
one's pretty good but there's a lot of
thread<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.420> residue<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.439> top<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.399> comes

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
thread of residue on the top this comes

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.999 
thread of residue on the top this comes
from<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.329> coagulation<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> blood<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
from the coagulation of the blood of the

bones from the cut pieces of chicken and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
bones from the cut pieces of chicken and

it discovers your soups you want to
remove<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:53.909> use<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
remove it so what I like to do is use a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.560 
remove it so what I like to do is use a
skimmer<00:01:54.720> or<00:01:54.869> even<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.619> mesh<00:01:55.829> strainer<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.790> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
skimmer or even a mesh strainer and just

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.899 
skimmer or even a mesh strainer and just
go<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.070> particles<00:01:59.610> come

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
go like that and then the particles come

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.749 
go like that and then the particles come
right<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> soup<00:02:01.320> into<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.399> strainer

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.560 
right in to the soup into the strainer
and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.930> get<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.259> out<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.530> my<00:02:04.619> soup

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
and then I get it out of my soup

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.249 
and then I get it out of my soup
is<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.290> would<00:02:06.770> have<00:02:06.890> gotten<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:07.370> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.810 
have them and about three carrots cut
into<00:02:44.360> about<00:02:45.080> 1<00:02:45.380> 1<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.770> 1/2<00:02:45.860> inch<00:02:46.220> lengths<00:02:46.670> and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
into about 1 1 and 1/2 inch lengths and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.640 
into about 1 1 and 1/2 inch lengths and
you<00:02:46.880> can<00:02:47.060> cut<00:02:47.270> them<00:02:47.450> on<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.600> diagonal<00:02:48.110> as<00:02:48.470> long

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
you can cut them on the diagonal as long

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.320 
you can cut them on the diagonal as long
as<00:02:48.770> you<00:02:48.860> don't<00:02:48.980> make<00:02:49.160> them<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:49.610> thin<00:02:50.060> that

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
as you don't make them so thin that

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.430 
as you don't make them so thin that
they'll<00:02:50.930> fall<00:02:51.230> apart<00:02:51.260> when<00:02:51.980> cooking<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:54.200> that

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
they'll fall apart when cooking to that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:03.780 
they'll fall apart when cooking to that
I<00:02:58.000> add<00:02:59.000> some<00:02:59.360> salt<00:02:59.690> now<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:01.790> tend<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.420> under<00:03:02.810> salt

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
I add some salt now I tend to under salt

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.150 
I add some salt now I tend to under salt
one<00:03:04.790> because<00:03:05.300> I'm<00:03:05.540> using<00:03:05.750> kosher<00:03:06.200> chicken<00:03:06.769> and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
one because I'm using kosher chicken and

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.220 
one because I'm using kosher chicken and
kosher<00:03:07.459> chicken<00:03:07.700> has<00:03:08.060> been<00:03:08.090> salted<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.080> has

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
kosher chicken has been salted so it has

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.110 
kosher chicken has been salted so it has
a<00:03:09.260> little<00:03:09.560> bit<00:03:09.680> more<00:03:09.890> salt<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.910> other

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
a little bit more salt and the other

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.810 
a little bit more salt and the other
reason<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:12.049> I<00:03:12.350> rather<00:03:12.590> add<00:03:12.980> salt<00:03:13.430> at<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.790> end

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
reason is I rather add salt at the end

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.840 
reason is I rather add salt at the end
then<00:03:14.600> at<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.900> beginning<00:03:15.410> some<00:03:16.280> people<00:03:16.640> add

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
then at the beginning some people add

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.660 
then at the beginning some people add
whole<00:03:17.150> peppercorns<00:03:17.830> some<00:03:18.830> people<00:03:19.220> add<00:03:19.340> white

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
whole peppercorns some people add white

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.060 
whole peppercorns some people add white
pepper<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:20.780> we<00:03:20.989> can't<00:03:21.230> see<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.769> I<00:03:21.950> don't

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
pepper so that we can't see it I don't

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.250 
pepper so that we can't see it I don't
really<00:03:22.459> care<00:03:22.820> about<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.269> too<00:03:23.720> much

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
really care about that too much

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.460 
really care about that too much
and<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:25.010> add<00:03:25.280> some<00:03:25.310> grindings<00:03:26.299> of<00:03:26.570> fresh<00:03:26.959> black

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
and I add some grindings of fresh black

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.160 
and I add some grindings of fresh black
pepper<00:03:29.170> stir<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.560> little<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.610> can

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
pepper stir it a little so that I can

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.009 
pepper stir it a little so that I can
submerge<00:03:33.170> all<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.709> vegetables<00:03:34.959> this<00:03:35.959> is

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
submerge all the vegetables this is

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.229 
submerge all the vegetables this is
probably<00:03:36.709> a<00:03:36.799> little<00:03:36.890> bit<00:03:37.280> more<00:03:37.519> water<00:03:37.910> than

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
probably a little bit more water than

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.229 
probably a little bit more water than
you<00:03:38.450> need<00:03:38.780> but<00:03:39.650> that's<00:03:39.860> okay<00:03:40.220> it'll<00:03:40.549> boil<00:03:40.880> down

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
you need but that's okay it'll boil down

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.600 
you need but that's okay it'll boil down
so<00:03:42.230> that's<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.890> put<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.760> lid<00:03:44.000> on<00:03:44.030> it<00:03:45.250> sim<00:03:46.250> put<00:03:46.519> it

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
so that's it put a lid on it sim put it

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.530 
so that's it put a lid on it sim put it
on<00:03:46.730> simmer<00:03:47.530> leave<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.680> alone<00:03:48.920> for<00:03:49.250> about<00:03:49.610> two

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
on simmer leave it alone for about two

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.650 
on simmer leave it alone for about two
hours<00:03:50.829> after<00:03:51.829> our<00:03:52.220> soup<00:03:52.549> is<00:03:52.700> done<00:03:52.940> we'll
