per<00:00:25.500> hour<00:00:25.560> pump<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.900> upgraded<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.080> last<00:00:28.320> night

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
to a 500cc gallon per hour pump I had to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530 
to a 500cc gallon per hour pump I had to
put<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> divider<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.149> cuts<00:00:33.360> back

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
put a divider on it so it cuts back

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.290 
put a divider on it so it cuts back
because<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.649> 500<00:00:35.160> CC<00:00:35.430> gallon<00:00:35.670> per<00:00:35.790> hour<00:00:35.850> flow

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
because this 500 CC gallon per hour flow

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.290 
because this 500 CC gallon per hour flow
is<00:00:36.750> too<00:00:37.050> much<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.530> my<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.370> half<00:00:38.579> inch<00:00:38.820> Oh

so<00:01:34.470> I'm<00:01:34.530> taking<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.950> deal<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> water

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so I'm taking this deal to in the water

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.030 
so I'm taking this deal to in the water
and<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.450> gonna<00:01:36.540> pump<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.900> oxygen<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.920> as

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and it's gonna pump out oxygen so as

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.969 
and it's gonna pump out oxygen so as
long<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.220> fish<00:01:38.670> were<00:01:38.880> inside<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.360> tank

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
long as fish were inside of the tank

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.830

pumping<00:01:40.979> out<00:01:41.100> co2<00:01:41.479> cyanobacteria<00:01:42.479> was

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
pumping out co2 cyanobacteria was

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
pumping out co2 cyanobacteria was
thriving<00:01:43.110> less<00:01:43.380> co2<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> plant<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
thriving less co2 just like a plant and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.300 
thriving less co2 just like a plant and
pumping<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.570> oxygen<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.649> at<00:01:46.799> some<00:01:46.979> points

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
pumping out oxygen so at some points

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.399

it<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.860> crazy<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.420> for<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> day

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
it was crazy so just for the day

channel Morphin here and stuff and
probably<00:02:33.830> put<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.190> seahorse<00:02:34.490> down<00:02:34.670> here

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
probably put the seahorse down here

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.360

will talk about seahorses later yes
we're<00:02:39.560> still<00:02:39.650> gonna<00:02:39.860> do<00:02:40.010> seahorses<00:02:40.580> don't

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
we're still gonna do seahorses don't

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
I've got timers on the lights now I did

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.930 
I've got timers on the lights now I did
that<00:03:42.440> last<00:03:42.590> night<00:03:42.770> too<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.490> lights<00:03:43.760> will

stays<00:03:47.090> on<00:03:47.120> all<00:03:47.270> day<00:03:47.450> because<00:03:47.900> if<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.830> some

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
people leave the softball when the main

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.280 
people leave the softball when the main
system<00:03:52.460> goes<00:03:52.610> off<00:03:52.850> because<00:03:53.120> when<00:03:53.900> this<00:03:54.080> goes

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
system goes off because when this goes

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.700 
system goes off because when this goes
off<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.830> this<00:03:55.070> is<00:03:55.220> off<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.700> your<00:03:56.540> pH<00:03:57.200> will<00:03:57.410> drop

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
off and this is off to your pH will drop

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.160 
off and this is off to your pH will drop
but<00:03:58.160> if<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.400> leave<00:03:58.610> say<00:03:59.420> this<00:03:59.570> goes<00:03:59.780> off<00:03:59.990> and

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
but if you leave say this goes off and

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.750 
but if you leave say this goes off and
this<00:04:00.320> comes<00:04:00.590> on<00:04:00.830> or<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:01.100> stays<00:04:01.280> on<00:04:01.490> all<00:04:01.520> the

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
this comes on or it stays on all the

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.940 
this comes on or it stays on all the
time<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.210> won't<00:04:02.330> have<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.660> pH<00:04:03.080> fluctuation

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
time it won't have a pH fluctuation

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.270 
time it won't have a pH fluctuation
it'll<00:04:04.490> keep<00:04:04.610> your<00:04:04.760> pH<00:04:05.120> constant<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:07.100> the

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
it'll keep your pH constant so the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.370 
it'll keep your pH constant so the
lights<00:04:07.520> are<00:04:07.730> on<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:08.330> gonna<00:04:08.540> raise<00:04:08.750> pH<00:04:09.170> when

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
lights are on is gonna raise pH when

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.730 
lights are on is gonna raise pH when
lights<00:04:09.560> go<00:04:09.740> out<00:04:09.770> pH<00:04:10.280> drops<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.510> got<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.440> lot<00:04:12.620> of

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
lights go out pH drops so got a lot of

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.780 
lights go out pH drops so got a lot of
big<00:04:12.860> plans<00:04:13.040> in<00:04:13.220> here<00:04:13.340> if<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.459> don't<00:04:13.610> put

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
big plans in here if I don't put

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.190 
big plans in here if I don't put
seahorses<00:04:14.300> in<00:04:14.390> here<00:04:14.540> I'm<00:04:14.660> probably<00:04:14.810> gonna<00:04:14.990> put

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
seahorses in here I'm probably gonna put

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.960 
seahorses in here I'm probably gonna put
shrimp<00:04:15.380> down<00:04:15.650> here<00:04:15.920> because<00:04:16.670> I<00:04:18.430> just<00:04:19.430> saw<00:04:19.730> just

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
shrimp down here because I just saw just

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.250 
shrimp down here because I just saw just
like<00:04:20.060> shrimp<00:04:20.420> or<00:04:20.540> I<00:04:20.600> might<00:04:20.750> put<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:20.960> Marine

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
like shrimp or I might put the Marine

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.260 
like shrimp or I might put the Marine
down<00:04:21.500> here<00:04:21.710> if<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:21.919> gets<00:04:22.040> too<00:04:22.190> aggressive

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
down here if it gets too aggressive

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.430 
down here if it gets too aggressive
I<00:04:23.300> could<00:04:23.449> put<00:04:23.599> shrimp<00:04:23.870> up<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.199> the<00:04:24.289> main

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
I could put shrimp up in the main
