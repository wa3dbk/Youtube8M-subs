00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.720 
dedicate to it we're also using the
microphone<00:02:36.110> on<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.530> camera<00:02:36.680> as<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.280> can<00:02:37.459> see

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
microphone on the camera as you can see

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.319 
microphone on the camera as you can see
sadly<00:02:38.690> we've<00:02:39.260> only<00:02:39.440> got<00:02:39.739> mono<00:02:40.329> options

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
sadly we've only got mono options

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.349 
sadly we've only got mono options
available<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:42.799> camera<00:02:43.250> doesn't<00:02:43.459> have<00:02:43.670> stereo

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
available the camera doesn't have stereo

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.900 
available the camera doesn't have stereo
output<00:02:45.140> which<00:02:45.349> is<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.530> real<00:02:45.799> shame<00:02:46.069> it<00:02:46.549> record

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
output which is a real shame it record

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.500

the little twisty knobs and levers you
can<00:02:59.299> pull<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.780> zoom<00:02:59.989> they're<00:03:00.260> kind<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.590> cool

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260

the<00:03:21.810> yeah<00:03:22.050> I'm<00:03:22.500> tired<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.950> can<00:03:26.100> essentially

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
the yeah I'm tired you can essentially

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.940 
the yeah I'm tired you can essentially
use<00:03:26.610> on<00:03:26.910> these<00:03:27.060> cameras<00:03:27.450> as<00:03:27.600> CCTV<00:03:28.530> camera

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
use on these cameras as CCTV camera

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.200 
use on these cameras as CCTV camera
quite<00:03:29.160> easily<00:03:29.430> as<00:03:29.790> well

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
quite easily as well

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.290 
quite easily as well
this<00:03:30.900> cameras<00:03:31.320> great<00:03:31.710> for<00:03:32.040> recording<00:03:32.300> CRT

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
this cameras great for recording CRT

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.120 
this cameras great for recording CRT
footage<00:03:33.810> on<00:03:33.990> that<00:03:34.020> sone<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.650> know<00:03:34.800> which<00:03:35.010> is

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
footage on that sone you know which is

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.980 
footage on that sone you know which is
great<00:03:35.370> things<00:03:35.910> like<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:38.490> Mega<00:03:38.730> Drive<00:03:39.180> and

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
great things like the Mega Drive and

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.660 
great things like the Mega Drive and
stuff<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.530> only<00:03:40.830> has<00:03:41.160> RF<00:03:41.580> output<00:03:42.060> for<00:03:42.270> now

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.880 

let's<00:03:47.670> see<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.330> switches<00:03:49.110> on<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:49.590> there

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
let's see this switches on the but there

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.170 
let's see this switches on the but there
we<00:03:49.950> go<00:03:53.270> so<00:03:54.270> camera<00:03:54.900> captures<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:56.180> reasonably

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
we go so camera captures it reasonably

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.479 
we go so camera captures it reasonably
accurate<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:57.989> colors

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.330 

do<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.150> hazy<00:04:03.659> here<00:04:04.439> and<00:04:04.620> there<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.920> think<00:04:05.189> if

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
do it hazy here and there I think if

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.369 
do it hazy here and there I think if
that<00:04:05.549> seems<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.209> be<00:04:06.299> more<00:04:06.540> down<00:04:06.719> to<00:04:06.959> YouTube

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
that seems to be more down to YouTube

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.670 
that seems to be more down to YouTube
compression<00:04:08.280> rather<00:04:08.519> with<00:04:09.510> cam<00:04:09.840> compression

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
compression rather with cam compression

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.800 
compression rather with cam compression
I'm<00:04:11.280> going<00:04:11.489> to<00:04:11.579> say<00:04:11.760> rather<00:04:11.969> than<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.390> camera

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
I'm going to say rather than the camera

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.099 
I'm going to say rather than the camera
itself<00:04:13.640> which<00:04:14.640> is<00:04:14.819> why<00:04:15.030> these<00:04:15.090> webcams<00:04:15.900> which

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
itself which is why these webcams which

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.729 
itself which is why these webcams which
have<00:04:16.320> HD<00:04:17.090> resolution<00:04:18.090> are<00:04:18.739> completely

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
have HD resolution are completely

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.540 
have HD resolution are completely
pointless

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.700 

one<00:04:27.240> most<00:04:27.690> people<00:04:27.870> just<00:04:28.169> don't<00:04:28.349> have<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
one most people just don't have the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.320 
one most people just don't have the
bandwidth<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.310> transmit<00:04:30.030> actually<00:04:31.729> until<00:04:32.729> the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
bandwidth to transmit actually until the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.249 
bandwidth to transmit actually until the
cameras<00:04:33.780> don't<00:04:34.080> truly<00:04:34.620> support<00:04:35.490> real<00:04:35.880> HD

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.820 

don't<00:04:40.259> buy<00:04:40.500> into<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.949> crap<00:04:42.440> I'll<00:04:43.440> be<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.620> while

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
don't buy into the crap I'll be a while

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.950 
don't buy into the crap I'll be a while
before<00:04:44.370> we<00:04:44.639> have<00:04:44.819> that<00:04:45.210> kind<00:04:45.479> of<00:04:45.599> technology

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960
