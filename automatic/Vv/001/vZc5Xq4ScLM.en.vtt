00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.579
 do not look at your spectators 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.079
 this year's statement for yet another video 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.570
 of the illegal site 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:38.570
 today we talk about consumption of 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:43.309
 salt is beneficial harmful natural or abnormal 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.769
 good as we know first of all 17 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.079
 millions of Brazilians are at least 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:51.019
 already classified as hypertensive 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.140
 although it will probably be the 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.059
 number would be much higher since the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.010
 medical parameters are based on 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.949
 people who consume too much salt food 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.280
 cooked is before him ptix and obviously 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.890
 has the pressure never above normal 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.740
 so the parameters early than 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.170
 of course they should be 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.299
 according to the study of the American xii 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.240
 proven and decades that consumption 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.090
 causes salt and hypertension for more than 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.100
 you do not suffer now in the near future 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.500
 will is suffering is the first of all 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.960
 kitchen salt the sodium stoneware as the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.630
 people know him inorganic 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.680
 ie it is unusable round by 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.720
 our organism 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.670
 That's why every person who consumes salt 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:47.030
 with that water retention hoe 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.240
 why the sun as the minerals 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.940
 the plant synthesizes it transforms 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.790
 they in organic to be consumed 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.490
 for animals we can not eat 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.680
 directly to the ground, but to the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.110
 plants is the form of nature in 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.690
 provide these minerals contained in the soil 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.530
 so important to our health 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.640
 ie the inorganic sun its shape 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.110
 inorganic only bionic love in plants and 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.900
 useable by the body 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.930
 because we consume plants luck 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.019
 we do not get bloated like a person 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.019
 who eats salt food 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.190
 Well, we know that the samurai 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.940
 practiced the famous rally 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.700
 with salt consumption and not only with the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.880
 that citizen not only with the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.850
 but putting more than 100 grams 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.070
 of salt in a short time a small 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.790
 amount of water ingested at one time 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.040
 only 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.250
 The next morning, I woke up dead 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.330
 because of the dehydration 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.130
 You see how toxic salt is if you just 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.050
 need to understand that 100 grams is the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.600
 enough to kill a man 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.520
 dehydration to be consumed once only 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.160
 obviously we do not consume 100 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.090
 grams of salt in one day so we 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.570
 suffers in your 75 of the world's population 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.280
 suffers from chronic disabling but not 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.360
 I'm still alive though I 'm always 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.820
 cause of dehydration every day 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.360
 people know that salt has accumulated 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.570
 artery walls cause hypertension 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:31.100
 heart problems dehydration and bengo 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.739
 and it 's only up to you to get into the sea 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.810
 with a wound and realize how 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:40.010
 painful and imagine it within your 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.870
 arteries inside your body 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.280
 bathing your cells 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.400
 We know when we get into a 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.200
 wound in the sea starts to hurt a lot 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.970
 because salt is an irritant 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.680
 the salt also kills the taste buds 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.140
 why its users of salt 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.840
 I usually complain that food does not 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.200
 salt being already played saved on top 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.540
 it enough because sometimes because 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.760
 they end up losing the ability to 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.830
 to feel the natural salty fruit 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:15.620
 vegetables from natural food and it 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.330
 stimulating the neuro- organism by adapting 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.030
 consumption of salt that is much higher than 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.580
 natural language literally loses its 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.250
 ability to feel killing the 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.570
 receptors probably we know 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.760
 that Indians have never used salt in a 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.730
 primitive civilization uses salt 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.110
 this is actually a thing of some 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.050
 a thousand years here 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.780
 usually the white man of 2010 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.879
 the action of civilizations because for 8 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.770
 millions of years we do not use and yet 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.370
 many primitive tribes have not yet 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.770
 even if unnatural is to refine the 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.840
 bad balance and throw on your food 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.460
 Would you get it on your habitat? 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.830
 Natural 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.720
 there we also have the question of salt 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.690
 from Himalayas at seven with sea salt 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.740
 etc. who usually asks in the world 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.169
 inclusive but this is not healthy 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.199
 saved is salt is not healthy 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.500
 becomes an oxymoron two words that 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:19.039
 not healthy and salt not with 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.009
 fear or even though it is health 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:24.680
 Malaysians can talk about what the 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.889
 How much but usually goes out is well 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.080
 expensive and who is always selling 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.629
 trying to convince himself that his product 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.199
 it is necessary for your health that it is 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:39.530
 healthy is beneficial so let's cool it. 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:42.080
 Yes, but if that's the case, if you need 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.300
 tempering the food is because I do not have 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.770
 I do not like her, I do not like her 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.909
 human beings or because it was extremely 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.190
 cooked 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.259
 so I hope this video I 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.360
 you have to reflect while the 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.279
 consumption of salt to realize that our 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.779
 natural food a banana tomato 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:06:00.560
 lettuce is mango watermelon does not need 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:04.729
 salt 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.240
 then go for the fruits and vegetables more 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:10.219
 cheaper and more practical healthy you 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.069
 need not assist the process 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:15.379
 industrial that is anything that comes 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:18.169
 packed in balconies classified 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:19.460
 so stay tuned for the next videos 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.169
 of the illegal site 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.599
 if you want to know more information and 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.009
 details about salt consumption because the 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:27.229
 people do not use this kind of thing 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.340
 diet ran away because we think it is 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.740
 harmful 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.539
 you can read us to a frugal they are more 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.599
 of 300 pages with various information 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:38.240
 various scientific data on the genius 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:42.379
 that this health practice focuses on fruits 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.569
 vegetables does not make the suggestion to 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:47.449
 recommended the use of salt in the 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:50.580
 food and this register on the website and blog
