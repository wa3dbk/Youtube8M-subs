00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
them for quite some time never really

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.290 
them for quite some time never really
had<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> project<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.529> do<00:00:31.730> with<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> these<00:00:33.120> so

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
had a project to do with one of these so

a<00:00:37.860> series<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.340> blog<00:00:38.670> posts<00:00:39.149> using<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.110> so

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
a series of blog posts using this so

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.600 
a series of blog posts using this so
these<00:00:40.440> all<00:00:40.620> connect<00:00:40.950> together<00:00:41.040> that's<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.399> case

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
these all connect together that's a case

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.840 
these all connect together that's a case
for<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> PI<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.660> don't<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.079> need<00:00:43.379> that

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
for the PI you don't really need that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.610 
for the PI you don't really need that
but<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.120> tidied<00:00:45.570> everything<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:46.110> that's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
but it just tidied everything up that's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.979 
but it just tidied everything up that's
a<00:00:46.890> memory<00:00:47.430> card<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.940> goes<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> P<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
a memory card that goes in the P is a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.430 
a memory card that goes in the P is a
fixed<00:00:49.320> 64<00:00:49.800> Meg<00:00:50.039> gig<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.850> rather<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:52.350> then

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
fixed 64 Meg gig one rather and then

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.350 
fixed 64 Meg gig one rather and then
obviously<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.860> got<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> PI<00:00:53.280> yourself<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.000> have

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360

based on a Linux operating system and I

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
based on a Linux operating system and I
built<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.540> about<00:01:21.840> six<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:22.560> seven<00:01:22.799> months<00:01:22.920> ago

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
built this about six or seven months ago

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
built this about six or seven months ago
as<00:01:23.549> an<00:01:23.759> experiment<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.470> running

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
as an experiment but now it's running

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
as an experiment but now it's running
all<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> phone<00:01:26.700> extensions<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.570> house

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
all of the phone extensions in my house

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.499 
all of the phone extensions in my house
it<00:01:28.080> connects<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.530> my<00:01:28.710> work<00:01:28.950> extension<00:01:29.670> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it connects with my work extension it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.780 
it connects with my work extension it
connects<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.350> Skype<00:01:31.920> extension<00:01:32.520> which<00:01:32.670> is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
connects to a Skype extension which is

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.240 
connects to a Skype extension which is
connected<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.299> UK<00:01:33.540> phone<00:01:33.990> number<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.619> also

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
connected to a UK phone number and also

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
connected to a UK phone number and also
enables<00:01:35.610> me<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.270> international<00:01:36.840> calling

enables me to do international calling
so<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.189> very<00:01:38.390> it's<00:01:39.390> become<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> very<00:01:39.780> useful

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so it's very it's become a very useful

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.899 
so it's very it's become a very useful
piece<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.680> equipment<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> listen

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
piece of equipment but if you listen

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.830 
piece of equipment but if you listen
very<00:01:41.939> carefully<00:01:43.340> it's<00:01:44.340> got<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> massive<00:01:45.329> fan

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
very carefully it's got a massive fan

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.780 
very carefully it's got a massive fan
and<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.140> sounds<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:47.369> loud<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.759> my

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.800 
phones
so<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.780> idea<00:01:55.229> using<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:55.860> projects<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
so the idea using these projects is the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.660 
so the idea using these projects is the
parts<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.960> quite<00:01:58.170> simply<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.340> can

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
parts is quite simply to see if I can

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.230 
parts is quite simply to see if I can
get<00:02:00.649> that<00:02:01.649> same<00:02:01.969> distribution<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.090> Linux

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
get that same distribution of Linux

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.959 
get that same distribution of Linux
running<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.350> my<00:02:04.560> Raspberry<00:02:05.189> Pi<00:02:05.219> which

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
running on my Raspberry Pi which

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.070 
running on my Raspberry Pi which
obviously<00:02:06.329> will<00:02:06.719> run<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.200> lot<00:02:07.469> quieter<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
obviously will run a lot quieter and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.140 
obviously will run a lot quieter and
also<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.410> lot<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> lot<00:02:11.009> more<00:02:11.069> cheaply<00:02:11.640> as<00:02:11.879> well

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
also a lot a lot more cheaply as well

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.030 
also a lot a lot more cheaply as well
because

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
because

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
because
it's<00:02:13.129> obviously<00:02:13.370> consuming<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:13.909> lot<00:02:14.030> of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
it's obviously consuming a lot of

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.000 
it's obviously consuming a lot of
electricity<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:15.260> I'm<00:02:15.379> gonna<00:02:15.500> do<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.680> whole

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
electricity so I'm gonna do a whole

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.229 
electricity so I'm gonna do a whole

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
series of vlog posts about how to create

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.069 
series of vlog posts about how to create

now<00:02:25.609> I<00:02:25.640> must<00:02:25.939> confess<00:02:26.299> I'm<00:02:26.689> a<00:02:26.750> novice<00:02:27.140> I'm<00:02:27.319> not

now I must confess I'm a novice I'm not
an<00:02:27.560> expert<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.069> I'll<00:02:28.159> probably<00:02:28.340> be<00:02:28.670> asking<00:02:29.000> for

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
an expert so I'll probably be asking for

an expert so I'll probably be asking for
help

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
help

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.929 
help
I<00:02:29.689> will<00:02:30.530> document<00:02:31.209> how<00:02:32.209> far<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.510> go<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:34.340> yes<00:02:34.700> so

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
I will document how far I go but yes so

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.179 
I will document how far I go but yes so
this<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.359> start<00:02:35.659> of<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.230> project<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.890> if

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:37.189 
this is the start of this project and if

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:38.770 
this is the start of this project and if
you<00:02:37.340> have<00:02:37.549> been<00:02:37.760> watching<00:02:37.909> I<00:02:38.209> greatly
