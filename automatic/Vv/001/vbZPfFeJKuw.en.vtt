00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.890
 Hello, thanks for watching 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.680
 sign up today will be 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.799
 unpacking on canon camera 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.799
 powershot 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.110
 This is how it looks 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:24.740
 here in sx500 and 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:28.640
 with boost it from ultrazoom models 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.500
 Zones here he has the least extent on the box 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.890
 written 30 x 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.040
 that is, as I understand it, this is optical 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.990
 zoom 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.450
 30 times 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.400
 and probably also digital above 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.310
 be 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:49.740
 so what else from this box we can 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.730
 see it says that shoots as 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.730
 hd 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.100
 that is, immediately say it is not very 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.200
 expensive camera basically 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.200
 average quality average price 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.340
 its strength is up to 2,400 i think 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.679
 maximum 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.679
 the strap does not choke on this camera 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:18.010
 Well, that is, depending on the regions where 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:23.100
 you live and you take 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:29.490
 I removed for two or three herds in this for 2 300 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.490
 so what we hide let's see what's in it 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.649
 to eat 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.649
 everyone hid 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.790
 not all 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.570
 with 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.570
 according to eat 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.920
 I open 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.920
 Basically chose him on the Internet 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.740
 if his friends so what have you 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.740
 there is 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:07.240
 such a box springy 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.240
 take me and there would be two disks 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.970
 111 this is probably 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.209
 and this program is obtained on 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.359
 camera flip edit 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:28.859
 photos are probably so clear to yourself 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:28.859
 drivers here manual on camera 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:45.450
 we see service centers 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.540
 All Ukraine is clear nature so 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.069
 here 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.390
 instruction 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.970
 user guide 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.390
 I understand it is all water 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.810
 read study so you have something new 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.490
 in principle, I think everything is standard with 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.070
 the camera just had an ultrazoom 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.880
 main feature 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.880
 so what we have here 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:20.670
 krita probably 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.670
 this is a charging cable for charging 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.299
 this 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.299
 cable 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.150
 this cable 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.800
 with a micro lesbian hut just 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.220
 for computer connection 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.220
 Further 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.030
 but this is a strap and what 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.280
 I will not reveal it 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.769
 understandable just a trinket here with it 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.900
 charger 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:07.269
 now I look how she looks 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.269
 I understand the charge 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.290
 charging and charging under the battery 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.290
 psychotic on batteries 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.209
 to surrender 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.900
 such a 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:29.360
 I think ok I looked like a good 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.360
 quality so what else 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.760
 battery battery battery 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.440
 we have a thousand batteries 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.449
 screen up 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.129
 minimum 940 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.990
 clear 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.700
 should be fine 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.030
 but that does not know just tell 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.460
 little cog here is a stub this yes 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:01.320
 for example you keep the battery long and not 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:05.580
 use there is such a groove 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.250
 knew to work so here's the keyhole 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.460
 and here for example here's an arrow on 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.350
 switch 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.620
 and all the keyway is on the arrows 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.680
 country example is you already know what you need 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.560
 charge it 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.419
 that is, for example the weather use them 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.800
 charge and if for example put it 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.510
 so here but closer to the plus sign 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.820
 that 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.520
 immediately when you take the battery 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.090
 You will know that it is already charged 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.450
 plant out 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:42.050
 I use it, that is, I got it 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:45.880
 he was on the arrow that is asking him 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:51.250
 charge understand this i will then do and 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.250
 so important 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.890
 and eat 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:02.750
 ear handsome handsome boy that's great 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.750
 Well done guys, look 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.050
 immediately and the cap 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.879
 put 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.310
 then basically the lid goes separately from 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:13.710
 camera 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.200
 but Comes but separately and then 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.610
 hitched you correctly though it 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.610
 such a package 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.860
 it is good that the cover actually and then 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:30.000
 position packing 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.000
 i.e. cap 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.000
 with a cord 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.290
 clings about here 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:45.470
 more you 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:50.150
 from 3 so say 16 megapixels 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:57.000
 so the monitor is estimated 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:07:00.560
 and three inches already 32 of this so monitor 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.560
 simple as tft 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:08.750
 yes he has an interface 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:11.830
 in style when well done all well done 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:15.080
 did manual ruble adjustment 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.570
 what we like in ditches in many 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.280
 no way by the way you are manual 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.389
 will see 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:26.320
 that is, they do not trust users 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:26.320
 so on the flare 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:30.129
 basically everything 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:39.440
 I will deal with it later. 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:39.440
 him look subscribe bye
