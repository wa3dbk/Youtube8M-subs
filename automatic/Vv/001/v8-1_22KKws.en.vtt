00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 shoot it well that ball well for 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.649
 and he heads it in 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.850
 dancing on the two one in which making 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.979
 it was an exciting competition man 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.140
 facking hell we are going to Russians with it 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.060
 second lead he is has 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.039
 pressure at the end 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.920
 yes right difficult the pye or the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.450
 the gea that the chicken really super good from me 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.800
 is just the four dark frieze for the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.140
 trip through 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.420
 really go right on he needs something 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.860
 better chance fresco had the bottom bar 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.080
 even the skin 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.610

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.610

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.450
 come on yes it's the corner again 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.880
 windy corner 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.170
 you are three hours before the final this 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.940
 man plays with fire 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.760
 this man plays with fire and he gets 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.100
 the neighborhood back is own drove through one 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.660
 yes come on this must have been anyway 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.880
 must have been through a 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.680
 please get me try keep this 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.840
 just swear it out of your hands like this 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.860
 also give and totally i go i am 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.540
 finish it 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.010
 the waste bente made the great 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.600
 goal 5 a 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.850
 the must be tips this must be 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.650
 yet the end as it was so 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.300
 actually inside I open 20 packages 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.830
 to get hold of 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.600
 and then we hopefully go one of them 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.950
 make a better team at least it's wild 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.180
 quite a chill but it is of course possible 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.600
 always better 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.820
 yes we won that world cup 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.530
 5 the very convincing second half 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.000
 the first half was a bit moderate in faith 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.080
 is supposed to be a draw 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.310
 receives 30,000 queen street packages 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.210
 so let's see what what eventually yes 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.070
 statistics where we agree better 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.300
 my 5th was very flattered 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.370
 actually become three become two 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.910
 about that was actually really fair 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.640
 been 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.230
 now not of the will confess championship 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.180
 it wants fat 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.410
 the wk have now started so late as 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.550
 definitely prefer a like behind for it 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.860
 win two cheese without 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.450
 lose points and we move on to 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.040
 so the packages open all packages and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.780
 then I would want the highlights of asia 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.580
 when I think all the packages 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.830
 but then just the pussy packs really one 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.810
 very quickly and then yes we will be 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.670
 see 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.840
 ok first suit apparently that is not 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.610
 too bad I go I think so 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.740
 use as a center with 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.990
 fits nicely fillet offenders that strong 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.510
 at will my site 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.740
 second pier an ex third read for free 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.670
 grab then hopefully you will still 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.950
 twenty 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.960
 we don't get in the last package either 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.180
 something really great, not really 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.790
 we are just going to go to that 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.080
 the text I am going to buy 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.090
 first grab that I actually own 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.739
 buy in the hope that of course more 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.720
 for your suits will follow in one of 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.770
 I also want those 20 of course 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.599
 I've got a sickly here 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.330
 and for the rest it is nothing we go 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:30.819
 just by ok we get if so the the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.349
 package of cores so jan vertonghen 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.789
 also think pretty neat who I am now 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.319
 if left behind him or was mine 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.020
 hollow recessed so I will certainly use that 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.190
 vertonghen in the jantje and the rest of the year 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.680
 really like me club and i want 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.690
 trying to save so much but on to 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.639
 get better pack number five though 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.560
 a nice player but he does not fit 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.270
 so I just had the team selden neffe 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.009
 louis fluup is said today i know 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.690
 the bacon was just looking and good 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.419
 european space as a natural messi van 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.650
 cadastre players no but the rest is it 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.419
 not really something great again 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.370
 fairfax we go more of course 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.319
 to get a better player 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.909
 as the pack and we get vidal 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.610
 that is a very good player pasha 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.990
 week number 7 but a fun game 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.370
 I have, unfortunately , a role 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.210
 so we continue 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:17.920
 nothing hakim climb on the back 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.020
 perk number nine is nothing in winning again 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.100
 x oh giving my god is good it is me 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.430

 Grab it with two players hole that 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.990

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.790
 the rest not yet which number aurele one 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.280

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.870
 780 reason 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.970
 go back number 14 double digits 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.590

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.180

 just get the shit work there actually 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.360
 pack fact is think rustic style 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.730
 but unfortunately we have nothing on it 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.070
 number 60 in the us qaida that's it 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.590

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.290
 number 7 you give us something via entra 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.510
 new players are all spiders

 week number 8 you give us as i do 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.940
 come true 3 so unfortunately none of it 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.770
 added value in a lastent pack 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.410
 pack down and we'll get one again 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.560

 nothing at all like double 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.650
 so we go on to the last package 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.510
