00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.759
 summertime is scooter time many 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.370
 do not use the car on warm days 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.550
 and take the scooter to the lake or 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.190
 to work and often lightly clothed 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.859
 a big danger like the adac test 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.560
 proves the departure of the driver from 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.570
 scooter with 50 km / h shows how 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.630
 different clothes on the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.750
 was tested three 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.000
 once the same drop once with your 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.929
 office suit with shirt and tie 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.690
 half shoes 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.090
 the second time with jeans from standard 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.430
 cotton lighter cotton jacket and 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.649
 thin sneakers and the third test 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.480
 The dummy carried a special one 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.440
 motorcycle jeans with corresponding 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.530
 denim jacket 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.149
 Both with protectors the result 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.199
 the casual clothes in the case with 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.120
 jeans were the injury already relative 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.980
 that means that material becomes serious 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.420
 completely written off it goes on the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.340
 skin but really catastrophic was the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.260
 the use of office clothes so 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.570
 simple lighter suits 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.340
 the material is gone immediately and then 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.750
 there can be serious injuries 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.240
 that she can not just scrape it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.890
 go down to the bone 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.439
 test winner is clearly the special one 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.479
 motorcycle jeans with jacket also looks here 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.490
 But abortions are not until 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.979
 on the skin through the protectors 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.860
 become shoulders knees and arms 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.600
 additionally protected against impact 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.860
 Comparison to the serious injuries 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.009
 falling with the thin office clothes 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.180
 especially at office suits with his 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.920
 very thin fabric 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.049
 there will be contact with the asphalt 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.680
 material will be removed over a large area 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.750
 polished 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.220
 if nothing is under it then only 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.700
 even the bare skin 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.200
 then there is also material away 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.320
 polished as blatant as that sounds 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.340
 that means there is great injury in 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.719
 the case is estimated by two 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.750
 about palm size 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.610
 and the bones are not far 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.509
 they can also be removed 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.969
 to be affected 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.670
 So that is an absolutely inadequate 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.580
 protection 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.830
 the adac guesses necessarily with his 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.709
 Suit on the scooter wants to drive 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.959
 a special over suit with stable 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.390
 Use material and protectors 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.360
 There is also leisure clothing 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.830
 in motorcycle dealer good 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.959
 shooting opportunities so-called keppler 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.940
 jeans are hardly visually normal 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.110
 However, jeans offer a difference 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.110
 much more protection
