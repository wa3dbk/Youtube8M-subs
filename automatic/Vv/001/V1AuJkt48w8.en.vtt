receiver pack that's this big battery

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.029 
receiver pack that's this big battery
here<00:00:47.870> when<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> open<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.440> your<00:00:49.559> box<00:00:49.770> there

your<00:00:52.680> instruction<00:00:53.340> manual<00:00:53.370> or<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.329> may<00:00:54.539> have

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
your instruction manual or it may have

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.600 
your instruction manual or it may have
been<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> receiver<00:00:55.530> case<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610

been in the receiver case here or the
receiver<00:00:56.879> box<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.629> goes<00:00:57.780> inside

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
receiver box here so it goes inside

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319 
receiver box here so it goes inside
there<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.859> first<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.730> would<00:00:59.789> do<00:01:00.030> before

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
there so first thing I would do before

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.240 
there so first thing I would do before
you<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.480> anything<00:01:00.660> else<00:01:00.840> pull<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250

get<00:01:02.789> it

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
get it

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.090 
get it
charging<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> reason<00:01:04.260> being<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100

use<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> factory<00:01:06.030> charger<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.659> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
use the factory charger which is this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.870 
use the factory charger which is this
one<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.740> gonna<00:01:07.920> take<00:01:08.189> between<00:01:08.369> six<00:01:08.549> and

one here it's gonna take between six and
eight<00:01:09.000> hours<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.840> kind<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.049> an

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
eight hours so this is kind of an

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.190 
eight hours so this is kind of an
overnight<00:01:10.650> charger<00:01:11.659> ideally<00:01:12.659> what<00:01:12.810> you'll<00:01:12.990> do

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.489 
unfortunately don't get a lot of time to
run<00:04:35.729> so<00:04:35.969> I<00:04:35.999> just<00:04:36.300> get<00:04:36.749> a<00:04:36.779> little<00:04:37.020> bit<00:04:37.169> of<00:04:37.349> fuel

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:37.499 
run so I just get a little bit of fuel

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.860 
run so I just get a little bit of fuel
like<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.800> gallon<00:04:38.219> in<00:04:38.340> there<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:38.729> I'll<00:04:39.689> just

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
like a gallon in there and I'll just

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.800 
like a gallon in there and I'll just
make<00:04:40.020> up<00:04:40.199> mix<00:04:40.469> up<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:40.710> small<00:04:40.979> batch<00:04:41.189> and<00:04:41.810> you

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
make up mix up a small batch and you

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.899 
make up mix up a small batch and you
want<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.080> mix<00:04:43.169> it<00:04:43.289> 25<00:04:43.889> to<00:04:44.099> 1<00:04:44.279> that's<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.729> ratio

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
want to mix it 25 to 1 that's the ratio

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.610 
want to mix it 25 to 1 that's the ratio
I'll<00:04:45.599> have<00:04:45.779> a<00:04:45.810> link<00:04:46.080> below<00:04:46.229> this<00:04:46.439> video

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
remember 25 to 1 is your ratio lots of

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.409 
remember 25 to 1 is your ratio lots of
information<00:04:55.860> out<00:04:56.219> there<00:04:56.400> how<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.639> do<00:04:56.909> it<00:04:57.029> but

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
to mix the fuel nice and easy

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.550 
to mix the fuel nice and easy
again<00:05:05.610> I<00:05:05.789> don't<00:05:05.879> get<00:05:06.449> a<00:05:06.479> lot<00:05:06.659> of<00:05:06.719> time<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.319> run

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
again I don't get a lot of time to run

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.230 
again I don't get a lot of time to run
so<00:05:07.830> I<00:05:07.860> just<00:05:08.069> do<00:05:08.189> a<00:05:08.219> little<00:05:08.520> tiny<00:05:08.789> bit<00:05:08.969> of<00:05:09.029> fuel

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
so I just do a little tiny bit of fuel

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.249 
so I just do a little tiny bit of fuel
at<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.110> time<00:05:10.409> so<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:10.620> doesn't<00:05:10.800> go<00:05:10.919> stale<00:05:11.129> on<00:05:11.279> me

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
at a time so it doesn't go stale on me

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.390 
at a time so it doesn't go stale on me
common<00:05:13.259> common<00:05:13.560> question<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:13.889> get<00:05:14.039> all<00:05:14.250> the

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
common common question I get all the

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.029 
common common question I get all the
time<00:05:14.610> is<00:05:14.849> what<00:05:15.120> oil<00:05:15.270> do<00:05:15.509> I<00:05:15.539> use<00:05:15.840> quite<00:05:16.680> honestly

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
time is what oil do I use quite honestly

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.519 
time is what oil do I use quite honestly
it<00:05:17.159> doesn't<00:05:17.460> matter<00:05:17.639> very<00:05:18.330> much<00:05:18.689> if<00:05:19.349> you're<00:05:19.500> a

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
it doesn't matter very much if you're a

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.230 
it doesn't matter very much if you're a

what I've done both ways I've gone
straight<00:05:47.819> to<00:05:48.060> synthetic<00:05:48.389> I've<00:05:48.750> used

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:53.339 
will argue with me it doesn't matter if

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.029 
will argue with me it doesn't matter if
you<00:05:53.490> use<00:05:53.520> a<00:05:53.669> high<00:05:54.000> quality<00:05:54.589> synthetic<00:05:55.589> oil

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
you use a high quality synthetic oil

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:57.529 
you use a high quality synthetic oil
right<00:05:56.279> from<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.490> beginning<00:05:56.639> I<00:05:57.000> don't<00:05:57.089> think

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
right from the beginning I don't think

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.920 
right from the beginning I don't think
you<00:05:57.629> can<00:05:57.719> go<00:05:57.839> wrong<00:05:58.020> now<00:05:58.669> AMSOIL<00:05:59.669> oil<00:06:00.060> does<00:06:00.750> say
