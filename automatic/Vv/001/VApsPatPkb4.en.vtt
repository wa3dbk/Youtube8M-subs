00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
is wonderful it actually says here that

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.620 
is wonderful it actually says here that
it<00:04:35.560> has<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:35.740> full<00:04:36.010> color<00:04:36.310> spectrum<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:37.480> show

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
it has a full color spectrum to show

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.690 
it has a full color spectrum to show
every<00:04:37.990> detail<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:40.240> has<00:04:40.420> 600<00:04:41.200> Lux<00:04:41.560> Lu<00:04:42.130> X<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.550> don't

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
every detail it has 600 Lux Lu X I don't

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.680 
every detail it has 600 Lux Lu X I don't
really<00:04:42.880> know<00:04:43.000> what<00:04:43.090> that<00:04:43.150> means

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
really know what that means

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.470 
really know what that means
compared<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.560> 300<00:04:45.520> Lux<00:04:45.700> I<00:04:45.850> guess<00:04:46.000> that's<00:04:46.330> what

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
compared to 300 Lux I guess that's what

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.780 
compared to 300 Lux I guess that's what
normal<00:04:46.900> vanity<00:04:47.770> mirrors<00:04:48.160> have<00:04:50.580> you<00:04:51.580> never

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
normal vanity mirrors have you never

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.450 
normal vanity mirrors have you never
change<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.210> bulb<00:04:52.390> optimum<00:04:53.350> magnification<00:04:54.190> five

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
change a bulb optimum magnification five

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.960 
change a bulb optimum magnification five
times<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:56.260> no<00:04:56.650> quartz<00:04:57.040> so<00:04:57.220> you<00:04:57.280> never<00:04:57.490> have<00:04:57.820> to

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
times and no quartz so you never have to

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.460 
times and no quartz so you never have to
have<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.720> cord<00:04:59.290> with<00:04:59.470> this<00:04:59.620> unless<00:05:00.010> you<00:05:00.340> are

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
only bad thing I have two negatives

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.530 
only bad thing I have two negatives
always<00:05:27.370> have<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.640> find<00:05:27.820> a<00:05:27.910> negative<00:05:28.300> you<00:05:28.510> know

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540

you<00:05:28.690> have<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:28.870> be<00:05:28.960> devil's<00:05:29.260> advocate<00:05:29.910> two

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
you have to be devil's advocate two

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.040 
you have to be devil's advocate two
negatives<00:05:32.610> it's<00:05:33.610> five<00:05:34.270> times<00:05:34.510> magnification

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
negatives it's five times magnification

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.380

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
focused okay so you can't like just kind

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.159 
focused okay so you can't like just kind
of<00:05:56.620> step<00:05:57.040> back<00:05:57.070> and<00:05:57.580> actually<00:05:58.060> see<00:05:58.360> yourself

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
of step back and actually see yourself

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.490 
of step back and actually see yourself
in<00:05:59.500> the<00:06:00.010> mirror<00:06:00.390> as<00:06:01.390> you<00:06:01.930> know<00:06:02.020> like<00:06:02.169> you<00:06:02.350> would

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
in the mirror as you know like you would

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.790 
in the mirror as you know like you would
be<00:06:02.650> able<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.860> with<00:06:03.100> a<00:06:03.130> regular<00:06:03.790> mirror<00:06:04.800> so

be able to with a regular mirror so

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.590 
be able to with a regular mirror so
that's<00:06:06.040> a<00:06:06.190> little<00:06:06.790> negative<00:06:07.240> also<00:06:09.479> with<00:06:10.479> the

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
that's a little negative also with the

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.130 
that's a little negative also with the
magnification<00:06:11.640> you<00:06:12.640> see<00:06:13.120> everything<00:06:13.930> I've

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
magnification you see everything I've

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.820 
magnification you see everything I've
never<00:06:14.500> seen<00:06:15.040> a<00:06:15.070> mirror<00:06:15.970> this<00:06:16.750> good<00:06:17.140> this

magnification that you get at the store

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.710 
magnification that you get at the store
this<00:06:29.650> is<00:06:29.860> the<00:06:30.010> clearest<00:06:30.460> mirror<00:06:31.030> that<00:06:31.510> I<00:06:31.539> have

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
this is the clearest mirror that I have

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.119 
this is the clearest mirror that I have
ever<00:06:31.960> seen<00:06:32.260> in<00:06:32.380> my<00:06:32.500> entire<00:06:32.560> life
