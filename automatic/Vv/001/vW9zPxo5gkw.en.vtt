00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
to put it together the way I like but

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.740 
to put it together the way I like but
that<00:02:43.250> could<00:02:43.910> be<00:02:43.940> different<00:02:44.420> than<00:02:44.540> way<00:02:44.690> of

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
that could be different than way of

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.330 
that could be different than way of
judge<00:02:45.050> like<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.320> said<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.500> don't<00:02:45.620> go<00:02:45.920> in<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.160> whole

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
judge like I said I don't go in a whole

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.940 
judge like I said I don't go in a whole
lot<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.550> Chrome<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.270> motor<00:02:47.510> because<00:02:48.170> you

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
lot of Chrome on the motor because you

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.030 
lot of Chrome on the motor because you
know<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.700> know<00:02:50.180> I've<00:02:50.420> got<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> chrome<00:02:51.040> thermostat
