00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
looked at some players who I know are

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.889 
looked at some players who I know are
really<00:00:41.250> good<00:00:41.550> at<00:00:41.730> getting<00:00:42.300> moves<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
really good at getting moves and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.290 
really good at getting moves and
specialist<00:00:43.649> players<00:00:44.010> overall<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.700> the

specialist players overall and the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.299 
specialist players overall and the
really<00:00:45.539> good<00:00:45.629> players<00:00:45.980> when<00:00:46.980> using<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
really good players when using a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.540 
really good players when using a
specialist<00:00:47.850> streak<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> kind<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
specialist streak and so I kind of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.889 
specialist streak and so I kind of
looked<00:00:50.730> at<00:00:50.850> what<00:00:50.969> they<00:00:51.120> did<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.510> realized

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
looked at what they did and I realized

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.459 
looked at what they did and I realized
quite<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.199> few<00:00:52.440> things<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.360> do<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:55.050> maybe

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
quite a few things that I do but maybe

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.380 
quite a few things that I do but maybe
not<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.920> much<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.399> should<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:57.120> maybe<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
not as much as I should have or maybe a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
not as much as I should have or maybe a
few<00:00:57.600> things<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> shouldn't<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
few things that I shouldn't do that I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.689 
few things that I shouldn't do that I
did<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> little<00:00:59.910> bit<00:01:00.090> too<00:01:00.270> much<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.670> one<00:01:02.670> of

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
did a little bit too much so one of

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.130 
did a little bit too much so one of
these<00:01:02.789> things<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.420> notice<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.870> gameplay

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
these things the notice of this gameplay

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.530 
these things the notice of this gameplay
I<00:01:04.559> kind<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.890> run<00:01:05.040> away<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.880> lot<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.390> gun

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
I kind of run away from a lot of gun

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.899 
I kind of run away from a lot of gun
fights<00:01:06.570> at<00:01:07.020> maybe<00:01:07.409> normally<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.159> would<00:01:08.729> have

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
fights at maybe normally I would have

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.670 
fights at maybe normally I would have
tried<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> stay<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.110> take<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.560> many

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
tried to stay and take out as many

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.640 
tried to stay and take out as many
people<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.280> could<00:01:11.340> before<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.330> died<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
people as I could before I died and you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
people as I could before I died and you
know<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.979> would<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.369> hope<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:15.000> could<00:01:15.240> take

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
know I would just hope that I could take

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
know I would just hope that I could take
out<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> bunch<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:16.200> meanwhile<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.799> was

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
out a bunch of them meanwhile it was

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.460 
out a bunch of them meanwhile it was
pretty<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:17.460> inevitable<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:19.320> their

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
pretty much inevitable that when their

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.770 
pretty much inevitable that when their
outnumbering<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.630> now<00:01:21.630> you're

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
outnumbering you like that now you're

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.600 
outnumbering you like that now you're
gonna<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:22.409> able<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.710> take<00:01:22.920> them<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.430> I've

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
specialist streak over also my point is

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.600 
specialist streak over also my point is
you<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:51.170> sometimes<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:53.070> things<00:01:53.280> so

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
you know sometimes we just do things so

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.179 
you know sometimes we just do things so
much<00:01:53.880> especially<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:55.409> our<00:01:55.500> gameplay<00:01:55.950> that

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
much especially in our gameplay that

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.760 
much especially in our gameplay that
they<00:01:56.399> become<00:01:56.729> bad<00:01:57.030> habits<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.320> kind<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
they become bad habits and you kind of

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.170 
they become bad habits and you kind of
don't<00:01:58.890> know<00:01:59.040> how<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.250> shake<00:01:59.520> them<00:01:59.729> unless<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
don't know how to shake them unless you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.630 
don't know how to shake them unless you
like<00:02:00.329> stop<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.170> know<00:02:01.430> what<00:02:02.430> am<00:02:02.579> i

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
like stop and think you know what am i

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.399 
like stop and think you know what am i
doing<00:02:02.909> wrong<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.420> how<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.869> improve<00:02:04.020> this

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
doing wrong what how can I improve this

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.870 
doing wrong what how can I improve this
so<00:02:04.649> that's<00:02:04.860> what<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.070> did<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.700> definitely

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
so that's what I did and it definitely

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.999 
so that's what I did and it definitely
helped<00:02:06.210> me<00:02:06.329> out<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.479> recently<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.560> beginning<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
helped me out so recently I beginning a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.609 
helped me out so recently I beginning a
lot<00:02:08.250> better<00:02:08.759> moves<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.479> lot<00:02:09.509> mo<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.229> lot<00:02:10.440> more

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
lot better moves and a lot mo a lot more

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.370 
lot better moves and a lot mo a lot more
moves<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:12.150> even<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.599> Hubble

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
moves so I have even like Hubble

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.960 
moves so I have even like Hubble
fast<00:02:13.680> moves<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.100> think<00:02:14.310> some<00:02:14.490> are<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.730> three

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
fast moves I think some are like three

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.940 
fast moves I think some are like three
minutes<00:02:15.180> or<00:02:15.480> somewhere<00:02:16.380> around<00:02:16.410> there<00:02:16.680> some

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
minutes or somewhere around there some

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.200 
minutes or somewhere around there some
are<00:02:17.040> even<00:02:17.130> shorter<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.700> i'll<00:02:17.820> definitely<00:02:18.180> be

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
are even shorter so i'll definitely be

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.360 
are even shorter so i'll definitely be
posting<00:02:18.720> those<00:02:18.840> up<00:02:19.080> sometime<00:02:19.800> soon<00:02:20.100> so

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
posting those up sometime soon so

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.030 
posting those up sometime soon so
definitely<00:02:20.670> look<00:02:20.850> forward<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:22.040> uh

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
definitely look forward to that but uh

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.970 
definitely look forward to that but uh
yeah<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.270> kind<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.080> feel<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.620> fixed

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980

that I want to become better at is
consistency<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.730> if<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.910> give<00:02:39.090> one<00:02:39.120> mode

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
consistency so if you give one mode

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.420 
consistency so if you give one mode
that's<00:02:39.750> cool<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.260> know<00:02:40.320> as<00:02:40.590> flash<00:02:40.860> yeah<00:02:41.370> you

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
that's cool you know as flash yeah you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.770 
that's cool you know as flash yeah you
gotta<00:02:41.700> move<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.180> can<00:02:42.300> tell<00:02:42.480> all<00:02:42.630> your<00:02:42.720> friends

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
but you don't really know how to get

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.610 
but you don't really know how to get
a-movin<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.720> probably<00:02:45.990> couldn't<00:02:46.410> do<00:02:46.500> it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
a-movin you probably couldn't do it

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.280 
a-movin you probably couldn't do it
again<00:02:46.710> if<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.850> wanted<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.390> if<00:02:48.420> unless<00:02:49.170> you

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
again if you wanted to if unless you

again if you wanted to if unless you
really<00:02:49.470> know<00:02:49.590> how<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.160> that's<00:02:50.820> really<00:02:51.030> what<00:02:51.210> I

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
really know how and that's really what I

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.930 
really know how and that's really what I
want<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.600> do<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.720> wanted<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.350> teach<00:02:52.740> myself<00:02:52.950> how

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
want to do I wanted to teach myself how

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.320 
want to do I wanted to teach myself how
so<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.890> took<00:02:55.890> some<00:02:56.190> time<00:02:56.460> no<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.090> actually

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
so I took some time no I actually

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.000 
so I took some time no I actually
analyze<00:02:57.990> what<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.320> was<00:02:58.470> doing<00:02:58.770> what<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:58.950> was

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
analyze what I was doing what I was

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.710 
analyze what I was doing what I was
doing<00:02:59.130> wrong<00:02:59.520> and<00:02:59.700> what<00:02:59.820> these<00:03:00.390> better

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
doing wrong and what these better

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.510 
doing wrong and what these better
players<00:03:01.050> were<00:03:01.290> doing<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.010> wasn't<00:03:02.370> doing

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
players were doing that I wasn't doing

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.000 
players were doing that I wasn't doing
so<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:03.180> kind<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.630> incorporated<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.440> into<00:03:04.710> my

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
so I kind of incorporated that into my

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.150 
so I kind of incorporated that into my
play<00:03:05.250> style<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.820> uh<00:03:06.260> yeah<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.290> obviously<00:03:07.980> it's

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
play style and uh yeah so obviously it's

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.490 
play style and uh yeah so obviously it's
working<00:03:08.460> out<00:03:08.550> for<00:03:08.730> me<00:03:08.790> because<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.750> am<00:03:09.990> getting

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
working out for me because I am getting

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.380 
working out for me because I am getting
better<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.310> I'm<00:03:11.550> getting<00:03:11.700> better<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.150> moves

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
better and I'm getting better it moves
