00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 Hello everyone, Alcatraz 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.089
 prison in today's build bugs 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.910
 battlefield 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.309
 online you learn what to do if your 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.009
 a round in robbery mode turns into 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.740
 fight teams what happens when on the map 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.600
 suddenly the walls disappear and your satellite 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.910
 the phone suddenly decides to stroll by 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.519
 minimap to the nearest stall for tea 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.150
 about this and much else we are with you now 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.730
 let's talk so opens our parade of bugs 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.189
 robbery incidents are the essence 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.649
 the bug is just when the man team is titus 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.989
 kidnaps both bags of money a round not 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.000
 ends and continues before 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.340
 moment until the bandit team 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.290
 run out of ticket and the name will time out 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.290
 team of cops always win 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.700
 when did it happen for the first time since 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.130
 once played for the police team 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.530
 at first people didnâ€™t get what it was 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.690
 only at the end of the round did the people realize that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.970
 the ill-fated server is to blame for everything 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.280
 tank payback hour came at that moment 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.620
 when the team swapped 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.750
 it caused massive batthurts of mine 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.210
 comrades that perfectly visible in 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.250
 chat when the helicopter took the last one 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.680
 bag with money we could only 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.080
 to be cop targets until the very end 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.170
 round in our team vital atmosphere 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.390
 the hopelessness of his position as 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.710
 game modes online and walls on 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.140
 cards love to joke 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.479
 they refuse to be destroyed then 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.479
 generally goes to inviz quite like a prophet 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.130
 at the same time they are visible only with one 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.790
 sides have densities of them impossible 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.890
 pass the 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.000
 but you can leave a couple of bullet holes on 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.430
 invisible edge 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.440
 naturally tricky players immediately find 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.720
 so use walls namely 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.730
 watch for their victim and come in with 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.830
 the side from which the enemy player is not 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.180
 awaits attack the prophet clearly in the day 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.490
 some textures are so scared 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.910
 homeowners who strive to escape 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.980
 like this for example on cakes 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.930
 By the way, both are not only 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.269
 radio beacons were taken away from snipers and 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.820
 handed over to the engineer so also called them 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.980
 satellite phones so they 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.959
 now and strive to escape from not love them 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.370
 owners true 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.110
 no one managed to escape 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.150
 next bang wetherall games probably 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.299
 specially left in the game for the fierce 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.549
 snipers Kim Perasta what Affairs and 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.640
 and the next bug was added to the game 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.739
 especially for sam phisher because we all 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.890
 we know how important it is to hide in his work 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.080
 body what now at least I imagine 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.040
 I myself look like an expression 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.739
 I'll tell you 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.459
 Well, at least not pay for the funeral 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.350
 I had to think about the earth 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.630
 you will not always need 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.980
 it is enough to have on hand at least 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.409
 a couple of walls to a 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.299
 yanyk body just make sure that 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.299
 the enemy did not try to get out of them 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.390
 Some masters of disguise are able 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.440
 hover in the air above the technique so 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.260
 they do not notice 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.540
 and the pose of this craftsman clearly hints that 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.680
 electronics art fucked up with sales 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.140
 thanks to its hotline, I know 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.870
 always wondered why my 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.980
 the team is constantly merging now I 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.500
 I understand why 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.690
 and it 's not just the crayfish that 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.079
 the first time they take a mouse in their hands and aim 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.129
 yourself or let's fuck the cat in 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.129
 survival syringe 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.450
 part of the problem lies in the wizards 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.390
 Parking different moves and skills successfully 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.530
 to park yes yes partially because 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.450
 such a team is left without transport 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.970
 of course, and here is not without craftsmen 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.130
 some have so succeeded time is blind 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.370
 parking that can even put the car 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.819
 the roof and without batting an eye and the other 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.920
 the helicopter will be able to lay on its side 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.440
 in the game so angry at people 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.550
 that announced to them the most present 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.310
 Rise of the Machines 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.739
 for example in protest this bike 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.960
 refused to break and stood huge 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.930
 number of hits until the very end 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.800
 round u you nobody managed it 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.870
 break down and if god forbid you don't 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.229
 fortunate enough to leave the battlefield on 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.070
 technique then she will cruelly punish you no 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.169
 will not explode 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:44.500
 and make you color blind until next 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:47.530
 revival attention especially for 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.080
 star wars fans buy stuff 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.240
 Jedi nah online and start jumping like that 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.400
 same high as hatch skywalker 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.919
 and for lovers of force fields we 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.530
 We added a new game that is caged and 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.169
 close will not let enemies and their grenades 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.979
 For a kilometer of whom are these things your total 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:10.090
 for $ 39 hurry offer 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.919
 limited some especially happy 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.919
 players are ready to fall through the ground 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.340
 for a bad deed in the literal sense 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:20.020
 and if you disturbed the whole round insolently 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.460
 kim piracy take his beloved 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.620
 sniper position 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.690
 then sooner or later you will enjoy it 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.990
 an epic flight into space in the winds 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.789
 bathert everyone thanks for your attention with you 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.660
 In connection was alcatraz prison 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.660
 good luck
