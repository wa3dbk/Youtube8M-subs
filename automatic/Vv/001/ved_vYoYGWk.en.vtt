00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.220
 many roads are cut off from the world 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.989
 we need it 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:10.129
 according to 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.129
 maurice for profits happened very quickly 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.070
 in this range 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.019
 like it should be 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.640
 it seems to me he was born in the hainaut 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.269
 I'm not sure at the end of the match 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.269
 I studied by surprise 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.359
 he was director 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.359
 but what shocks we left for a single set federer continued 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.300
 who studied with the greatest attention 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 but on Saturday the blue line of friends are there 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.790
 the only 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.730
 to support half an hour 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.960
 for now it's here that he started perfectly to see how 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.400
 we do 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.140
 face them but watch out because he still has a lot of power 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 nuclear declared 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.980
 he does not go 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.980

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 richard lessard and a half they've already been team champions 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.990
 go through hell 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.280
 for my part I am against all said m 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.540
 the man who says know it little descent of the attention cus 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 we just have to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.080
 worn by the city 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 but it also reminds me 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.969
 exclusively for example autopsied 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:12.949
 joey starr is in 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:15.249

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.249
 there is a lot of content on the ww site for the township 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.019
 resting this summer at the heart of the debates 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.979
 listen to me now know that the text 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.709
 I will see if it is possible 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 in short if everything will be fine 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.439
 in any case very good job of setting 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.519
 while the team ii 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.639
 we hope to make the streets 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.639
 but be careful maybe not at the end of his sentences 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.249
 the situation is calm 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.249
 pretty passes per game 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.979
 the criticism of your TV is very simple 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.659
 almost all of europe 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:16.529
 his demonstration 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.949
 when we look at ourselves a bit, what we receive 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.949
