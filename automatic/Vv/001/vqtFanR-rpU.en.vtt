00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
what'll happen if you're camping for

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.249 
what'll happen if you're camping for
four<00:02:07.380> or<00:02:07.470> five<00:02:07.500> days<00:02:08.780> you'll<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.050> little

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
four or five days you'll see this little

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.460 
four or five days you'll see this little
eye<00:02:10.530> right<00:02:10.860> here<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.190> red<00:02:11.750> if<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.110> zoom<00:02:13.320> in

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
eye right here is red if we can zoom in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.460 
eye right here is red if we can zoom in
on<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.710> little<00:02:13.890> eye<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.750> reason<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.260> red

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
on that little eye the reason it's red

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.560 
on that little eye the reason it's red
is<00:02:16.620> because<00:02:17.010> there's<00:02:17.220> no<00:02:17.460> propane<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.420> either

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
is because there's no propane in either

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.300 
is because there's no propane in either
tank<00:02:19.070> okay

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
tank okay

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.970 
tank okay
this<00:02:20.850> little<00:02:21.150> selector<00:02:21.660> switch<00:02:21.960> is<00:02:22.560> then<00:02:22.770> on

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
this little selector switch is then on

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.120 
this little selector switch is then on
that<00:02:23.100> switch<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:25.260> pointing<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.950> this

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
that switch this is now pointing to this

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.690 
that switch this is now pointing to this
tank

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
tank

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.990 
tank
that<00:02:27.330> means<00:02:27.540> we're<00:02:27.690> pulling<00:02:28.140> off<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.560> tank

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
that means we're pulling off this tank

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.970 
that means we're pulling off this tank
if<00:02:30.000> there's<00:02:30.210> propane<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:30.930> tank<00:02:31.200> this

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
if there's propane in this tank this

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.820 
if there's propane in this tank this
little<00:02:32.250> red<00:02:32.400> I'll<00:02:32.640> turn<00:02:32.940> green<00:02:33.770> now<00:02:34.770> the

little red I'll turn green now the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.190 
little red I'll turn green now the
reason<00:02:35.160> we<00:02:35.280> turn<00:02:35.460> both<00:02:35.640> tanks<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
reason we turn both tanks on is in the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.930 
reason we turn both tanks on is in the
middle<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.620> night<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.460> would<00:02:38.580> drops<00:02:38.760> down

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
middle of the night it would drops down

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.990 
middle of the night it would drops down
45<00:02:39.510> degrees<00:02:39.840> our<00:02:40.080> furnace<00:02:40.410> kicks<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.220> this

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
45 degrees our furnace kicks on and this

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.270 
45 degrees our furnace kicks on and this
tank<00:02:42.300> runs<00:02:42.630> empty<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.680> will<00:02:43.830> automatically

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
tank runs empty it will automatically

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.630 
tank runs empty it will automatically
switch<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.970> one<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.890> every<00:02:47.190> couple<00:02:47.370> days

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
switch to this one so every couple days

and the eye is red that means this tanks
empty<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.370> automatically<00:02:56.850> switched<00:02:57.240> to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
empty and it automatically switched to

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.870 
empty and it automatically switched to
this<00:02:57.600> tank<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.680> flip<00:02:58.980> your<00:02:59.160> selector<00:02:59.610> switch
