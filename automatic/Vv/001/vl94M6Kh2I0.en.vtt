00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.480
 Hi, I am nickname official 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.280
 makeup artist loreal paris in russia and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.590
 Today I want to answer one of 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.599
 popular requests on the Internet as 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.910
 visually enlarge the eyes and make them 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.250
 more wide open since the main 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.710
 focus our eye make-up we advance 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.859
 prepared the face for the makeup carried the tone 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.900
 a little blush and I have worked eyebrows 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.460
 chose a black purple pencil for 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 to emphasize eye color 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.530
 our pencil is cold and muscari eyes 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.079
 warm this makeup you are sure to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.489
 worked with both the lower and upper eyelids for 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.820
 to maximize 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.719
 visually open your eyes 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.289
 draw a fairly wide line 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.600
 trying to find 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.399
 the space between the eyelashes she is not 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.640
 must be perfectly flat 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.230
 because we end up with it 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 to the outer corner of the eye the line should 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.690
 slightly expand any makeup always 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.469
 lower eyelid should be less active 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.580
 than the top 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.060
 I connect the line of the lower eyelid and the upper 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.260
 connecting in such a triangle I take 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.360
 brush and feather line in a haze 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.780
 the pencil serves as the basis for us 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.780
 under the shadows 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:26.100
 I take the darkest shade of the shadows and 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.259
 duplicate the line that I created 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.880
 using a pencil te them and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.530
 shade vertically 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.540
 that is, upwards and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.250
 horizontally towards the temple 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.750
 not only to open visually 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.060
 eye but also lengthen it 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.780
 remember that in such a make-up should not 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.210
 be hard clear lines will explain why 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.320
 we achieve a natural effect 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.659
 natural shade 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.590
 we shade the shadows in order to 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.780
 to make it look the best 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.430
 natural and natural to the eye 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.939
 visually not clamped 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.189
 I shade the shadows up to the fold between 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.860
 moving and fixed eyelids I take 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.560
 fluffy brush and lighter shade 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.630
 shadows 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.989
 shadows but highlight the outer corner of the eye 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:16.590
 and working through the fold between the movable 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:18.660
 and fixed century in the middle of the century I 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.000
 I create a blip that will give us 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.500
 extra volume is lighter and 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.599
 shining shadows 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.580
 I take a purple shade we do not need 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.360
 so that the purple color is considered very 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.920
 frankly bright we just create more 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.379
 complex shadow cast 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.400
 due to the fact that we add it to the center 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.980
 century the same thing we do on the bottom 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.349
 century the center of the lower century I put 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.379
 purple with the lightest shade of 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.739
 palettes of shadows I worked on the inner 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.739
 eye corner 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.080
 in order to make an eye contour 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.420
 clearer i take the perfect superliner 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.739
 slim author paris is very thin 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.340
 the applicator and right between the cilia 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.650
 applying it 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.630
 sides duplicate ciliary contour makeup 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.360
 eye we finish with mascara 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.230
 we color both upper and lower 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.870
 eyelashes 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.910
 do it vertically with on stack 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.209
 eyelashes towards the temples and 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.269
 up in order to visually enlarge 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.950
 eyes need mascara which gives 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:42.600
 visible surround effect like ours exactly 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.760
 treasures and eyelashes butterfly wings makeup with 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.069
 one side is completely complete and you 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:54.420
 can see how much the eye is visually 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:57.170
 became more emphasis in our makeup clearly 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.910
 on the eyes so for the lips we choose 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.790
 neutral soothing shades they don't 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.430
 should attract a lot of attention 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:12.630
 but at the same time the lips will look 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:14.100
 impressively like this several stages we 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.299
 created makeup that visually 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.190
 increases eyes 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.850
 makes it more open and 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.850
 expressive
