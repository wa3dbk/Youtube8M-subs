because it is pretty dark in there and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.460 
because it is pretty dark in there and
there<00:01:31.090> are<00:01:31.239> two<00:01:31.479> tunnels<00:01:31.869> from<00:01:31.959> here<00:01:32.170> to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
there are two tunnels from here to

breezewood expands from salut via clean
the<00:01:36.250> breeze<00:01:36.459> would<00:01:36.670> that's<00:01:36.910> about<00:01:37.149> ten<00:01:37.420> mile

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
the breeze would that's about ten mile

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.650 
the breeze would that's about ten mile
and<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.310> tunnels<00:01:39.759> are<00:01:39.880> about<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.090> mile<00:01:40.390> long

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
and the tunnels are about a mile long

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.229 
and the tunnels are about a mile long
each<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.440> can<00:01:41.560> see<00:01:41.739> it's<00:01:41.890> quite<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.729> hike<00:01:43.030> if

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:43.239 
each so you can see it's quite a hike if

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:45.960 
each so you can see it's quite a hike if
you<00:01:43.420> if<00:01:43.869> you're<00:01:44.080> going<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.500> whole<00:01:44.619> month<00:01:44.970> and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
you see the barriers behind me because

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.510 
you see the barriers behind me because
