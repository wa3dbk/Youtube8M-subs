00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.120
 the expectation of at least one 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.910
 can not 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.960
 look only white flag last turn 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:16.059
 last return there he comes the montoya amparo 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.119
 You have to drive very carefully. 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.210
 care conservatories mainly 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:26.470
 another born in Bogota, Colombia, in the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.500
 September 20, 1975, once 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:34.020
 champion once champion also in the 500 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:38.440
 15 pole positions and comes to your 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.429
 13th victory in 13th victory in formula 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.140
 indy 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.760
 You do not have to worry about 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.890
 have to take a lot of 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.629
 attention and great care with who comes 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.679
 behind nothing less than my car 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:56.100
 now my touch came touch is out of the 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:58.710
 try a pilot, let's check it out already 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.420
 There was charlie kimball but no 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 spoiled the popular party with the role 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.890
 leave the proof did not stop we do not want 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.869
 yellow flag is at least everything 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.390
 Please indicate for the last test the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.780
 last round at the time of play and a1 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.720
 paid neither the Colombian passes first 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.390
 versa season opening test gave 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.840
 montoya some incredible vibration of the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.299
 team penske will power second comes 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.759
 There's Tony Kannan to get the third 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.950
 place of brazilian tony kanaan helio 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.039
 castroneves the room 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.420
 even with that match in that way 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.460
 on the last lap 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.840
 I did not use the yellow flag that 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.869
 very much favored 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.690
 montoya makes a deviant 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:47.190
 little pilot born in Bogota 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.190
 colombia goes to its 13th victory and 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.740
 celebrates as it gets ever eaten in 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.900
 applause from the river power there side by side 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.080
 with it in the passage on the screen 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.350
 in that line and the two make a test 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.120
 sensational touch on the beak of rio paulo and 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.300
 it was not enough to 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.040
 compromise in the race the Australian 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.920
 Defending champion is making pink vest 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.050
 that had 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:19.350
 godard gazprom have best month in 80 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.000
 perfect for him to leave and it was hard to see 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.110
 those two in front also supporting 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.110
 also the sponsors 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.760
 remembering that the speed was very 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.620
 in the classification the car is 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.110
 very fast and a river municipality of the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.880
 stones or sings I wonder the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.280
 The elephants ' departure is the only 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.700
 The thing that told you is 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.620
 take care of yourself dinars in the test and 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.410
 but he spoke but at the end of his life 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.950
 they are the post are pilots 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.450
 they need the competition more 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.459
 really a spectacular proof of 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.170
 montoya and remembering that Tony was 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:05.519
 who got into the cars of the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.900
 penske sent Tony very well very well 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.030
 being and montoya 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.430
 one of the few to finish the race with the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.800
 car intact and who would say filipe yet 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.040
 but he leaned but until it was all 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.690
 well could not keep the car in a 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 piece and remembering helium I also think 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.040
 which is the closure dispensing the 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.560
 I am very happy for this 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.940
 there is too much and guided very expensive that 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.070
 away a lot of time 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.380
 Helium was fully capable of 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.239
 has a great team and is in 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.540
 form could be in the place of montoya 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.860
 and if it was not that bad 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.840
 that among the latecomers 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.840
 between those pilots there ended up giving 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.090
 mal and otoni that comes also needed 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.500
 a good result in the mixed circuit he 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.480
 which in the past by much in some 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.600
 circuits and the year begins with the 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.140
 third place very well very well in this 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.140
 moment the runway overrun them do 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.690
 a rope the agreement is over 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.600
 ended up screwing up there under the car 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.190
 from the ambassador, the montoya car is 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.230
 It's hard to take that rope to 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.020
 ensure the journalists the public is 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.080
 huddled to get the first photos 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.000
 the first images here of the winner of 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.540
 season opening event 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.940
 the wide montoya there the montoya family 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.580
 does not come together and also to celebrate 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:29.160
 to celebrate disappoint the pilot who 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.530
 victory in the opening of the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.440
 season for Brazilians felipe 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.290
 giaffone helio castroneves in third 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.540
 or indeed the third tony kanaan 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.020
 helinho fourth placed expected more or 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.770
 not 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.260
 I think helium battery had chances 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.150
 obvious there might be in the 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.830
 place of montoya as well as power think 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.630
 that the three drivers who had chances 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.760
 by car to win the race 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.610
 Oh and to my surprise Tony is from 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.669
 better than I really imagined is 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.770
 superiority of penske cars gave 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.320
 to notice the end of every week where 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.300
 it was great toni got to mess with 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.090
 among the front cars were four 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.940
 thinks and he has put himself right in the middle 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.160
 guide Tony is also to be congratulated 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.020

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.880

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.430

00:05:49.330 --> 00:06:01.919
 indy formula and seat bank offering 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.810
 Brazil needed credit in hand 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:09.069
 kilometers of advantages ipiranga troque 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:12.719
