00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
it's better if you use like an

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.399 
it's better if you use like an
electronic<00:05:47.430> set<00:05:47.699> because<00:05:48.449> it<00:05:48.810> sounds<00:05:49.110> kind<00:05:49.349> of

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
electronic set because it sounds kind of

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:53.180 
electronic set because it sounds kind of
wrong<00:05:49.650> if<00:05:49.979> you<00:05:50.009> use<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.729> regular<00:05:51.509> set<00:05:52.190> for

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
wrong if you use the regular set for

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.860 
wrong if you use the regular set for
mine<00:05:53.340> it<00:05:53.580> doesn't<00:05:53.849> even<00:05:53.940> play<00:05:54.210> notes<00:05:54.599> down
