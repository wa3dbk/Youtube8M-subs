00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
ground forever I think with any gun but

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.340 
ground forever I think with any gun but
yeah<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.240> could<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.570> literally<00:02:33.960> just<00:02:34.020> keep

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
yeah I could just literally just keep

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.060 
yeah I could just literally just keep
shooting<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.950> gun<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.710> won't<00:02:37.890> run

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
shooting with this gun and I won't run

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.920 
shooting with this gun and I won't run
out<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.190> ammo<00:02:38.460> or<00:02:40.100> extremely<00:02:41.100> long<00:02:41.460> time<00:02:41.930> but

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
out of ammo or extremely long time but

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.870 
out of ammo or extremely long time but
yeah<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.960> version<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.490> is

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.760 
yeah and the version that I have is
shock<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.080> really<00:02:49.380> doesn't<00:02:50.340> really

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
shock so it really doesn't really

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.830 
shock so it really doesn't really
against<00:02:52.770> like<00:02:53.400> Lance<00:02:53.790> soldier<00:02:54.270> guys<00:02:54.420> like
