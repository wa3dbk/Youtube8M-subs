00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.360
 so welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.839
 let's play 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.440
 today I will attack with this 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.740
 I have troops in the clear bank 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.809
 archer level 3 levels 4 and 3 6 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.880
 but I always just let you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.220
 give good mineral wealth because that is 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 really good 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 ok then it starts now ok so 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.660
 always pay attention to whether the opponent tesla 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.670
 or not if he has none and he 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.410
 actually is quite good for you and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.040
 no ex soil, then you can do it well 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.290
 attack 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.670
 but here in my level I am 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.140
 just too weak for the two ex 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.570
 arch and just the walls are too 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.129
 too good 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.559
 you've got to remember something like a 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.110
 Wall breaker level 3 can be a wall 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.820
 almost destroy level-5 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.170
 then there is still something possible yes 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.410
 just something here 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.750
 that is completely stupid because the fourth 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.680
 weak for city hall level 9 also has 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.260
 his things here 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.729
 I could defeat that right now 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.350
 I can do it too 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.659
 although that is really alex very little 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.040
 that's 4000, that's not 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.150
 but still I'm just doing it 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.299
 because he has Town Hall Level 9 that is 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.600
 actually ill 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.600
 Here we go 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.409
 now always a few 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.790
 but that I am now because he is me 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.790
 different 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.020
 Now I just have to try this way 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.260
 percent and after a few more 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.550
 leave dry 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.550
 There is also a bit more 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.710
 yes that 's it and stupid mistake of 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.310
 me 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.800
 so were to go but I have here 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.250
 also one of the hoping whole not 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.450
 so bad 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.990
 I probably have certain lx 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.070
 I'll leave here now 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.070
 easy too 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.390
 a couple of robolds he 'll look like that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.600
 maybe something else to get out but he 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:46.730
 clearly make him public 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.840
 ok then i do not care with my no 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.380
 here at the back drum 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.590
 So gambling really was like being here 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.610
 looks nice too and even if I do 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.840
 mercilessly lost yes I am 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.600
 a series of single mistakes 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.400
 okay but from mistakes you learn so 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.380
 but still the player has city hall 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.610
 level 9 and for a long four substantiate it 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.580
 may be level 40 or 50 but 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.290
 Of course he probably has a lot now 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.750
 much more money but so much of it 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.930
 that's probably all now 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.930
 money 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:45.330
 still destroyed davis 46 made 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.450
 oh yes maybe it works with 4 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:54.750
 behind 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:58.250
 maybe here too , that's it 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.880
 nice as you can see here 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.230
 I did not want to say a lot again 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.530
 after which he broke with it 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.530
 do 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.430
 ok oh yeah yeah okay it was 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.250
 actually okay eight points and 151 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.650
 that alex is supposed to be the lakai with it 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.960
 be brought down the Lower Rhine that was okay 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.880
 Now I'll take a quick look at mine 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.360
 clan before maybe a touchable there 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.419
 you are welcome 1400 police in the well 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.490
 they are all nice and there comes 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.700
 just come in 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.260
 Ok, here I'll show you something 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:47.160
 I have completed 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:50.090
 Here you can bet 250 beds up here 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.690
 also really look irritated 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:57.870
 4 and really many jewels here 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.260
 50 jewels and there you should just 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.510
 Not 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.669
 then to simply watch that 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.680
 you do not neglect that and in 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.310
