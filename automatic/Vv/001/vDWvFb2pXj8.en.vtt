00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
ones are made in Germany so then the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.619 
ones are made in Germany so then the
next<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:57.899> you've<00:00:58.050> got<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> big<00:00:59.010> river

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
next one you've got is the big river

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.009 
next one you've got is the big river

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
I think it's thing it runs about what a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.300 
I think it's thing it runs about what a
hell<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> guess<00:01:07.110> twenty<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> twenty-five

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
