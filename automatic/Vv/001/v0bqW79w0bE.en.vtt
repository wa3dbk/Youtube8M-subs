00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.139
 now I don't know but I've heard it said so much 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.839
 that still in '42 in '43 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.210
 the fiat still produced the CR 42s 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.739
 because there was a signed contract that had to make many and then war or no war 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.519
 was good or not good 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.549
 the contract had to be finished 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.039
 I was assigned to the 76th Squadron 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.160
 of which the commander was precisely this ... 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.320
 Calistri 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.890
 coincidentally, the senior lieutenant 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.630
 it was Adriano Visconti 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.770
 and from there, I speak at the end of '42 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.750
 my personal friendship with Adriano Visconti also began 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.670
 Visconti's aim was to protect the northern cities from the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.490
 American and English raids 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.200
 because they got up with the fighters and did what they could do ... 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.100
 it had become indispensable for Adriano Visconti to have my brother 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.800
 as my brother had studied German at school 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.940
 so he knew German well and he used it, if he always carried it with him 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.980
 because the connections with the German military etc ... 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.300
 possibly held in German 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.580
 they called for an interrogation 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.590
 Visconti 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.480
 and Lieutenant Stefanini 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.120
 which was 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.680
 a student of the last academic year 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.920
 he had come to us 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.420
 because he was in the north, second lieutenant 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.070
 and Visconti had adopted him as his aide 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.020
 for which 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.940
 Stefanini 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.850
 he had participated together with Visconti 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.910
 at all interviews 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.980
 for surrender agreements 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.640
 of Visconti 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.250
 result they called Adriano Visconti 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.940
 and Stefanini for an interview 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.940
 we were on the first floor 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.180
 having gone across the courtyard, they shot both of them 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.059
 because viscounts was completely opposed to any war action 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.299
 against the Italians 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.020
 even if they were partisans or in other words 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.620
 they also sold all the provisions they had 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.640
 to the population etc ... there the only mistake perhaps of Visconti was that of 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.099
 deliver the weapons, it is true that 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.289
 they had threatened him if not 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:42.289
 they laid down their weapons and had two 88-cannons out there and demolished the barracks 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:49.309
 but it is necessary to see if it is true, if it is not true, but Visconti, faced with the fact of spreading 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:54.109
 blood, etc ... he looked at it well and accepted 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.549
 that false agreement that 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.269
 it was never realized as it should have been
