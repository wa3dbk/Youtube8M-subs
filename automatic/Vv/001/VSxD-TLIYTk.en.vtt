00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
right now and that's the way you want to

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:31.930 
right now and that's the way you want to
start<00:01:07.620> shuffling<00:01:08.620> vehicles

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:39.149 

and<00:01:32.940> we're<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> begin<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.049> by

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.109 

I<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:41.799> a<00:01:41.829> good<00:01:42.369> set<00:01:42.579> of<00:01:42.609> jumper<00:01:42.999> cables<00:01:43.390> here

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
I have a good set of jumper cables here

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.399 
I have a good set of jumper cables here
first<00:01:46.119> thing<00:01:46.270> we're<00:01:46.420> gonna<00:01:46.539> do<00:01:46.780> is<00:01:46.929> refer<00:01:47.229> to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
first thing we're gonna do is refer to

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.800 
first thing we're gonna do is refer to
jumper<00:01:47.740> cables<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:49.090> don't<00:01:49.270> want<00:01:49.420> any<00:01:49.569> of<00:01:49.659> the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
jumper cables you don't want any of the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.779 
jumper cables you don't want any of the
leads<00:01:50.020> touching<00:01:50.590> what<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:50.979> generally<00:01:51.549> do<00:01:51.729> is

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
leads touching what I generally do is

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.999 
leads touching what I generally do is
take<00:01:52.060> one<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.420> leads<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.810> just<00:01:53.020> clip<00:01:53.709> the

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
take one of the leads and just clip the

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.440 
take one of the leads and just clip the
insulation<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.729> other<00:01:54.939> one<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.270> way<00:01:55.420> I

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
insulation of the other one that way I

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.849 
insulation of the other one that way I
knew<00:01:55.689> that<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.959> metal<00:01:56.200> parts<00:01:56.469> aren't<00:01:56.679> going

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
knew that the metal parts aren't going

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:02.099 
knew that the metal parts aren't going
to<00:01:56.979> touch<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.509> then<00:01:59.700> starting<00:02:00.700> with<00:02:01.109> the

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
to touch and then starting with the

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:05.069 
to touch and then starting with the
vehicle<00:02:02.500> with<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.829> dead<00:02:03.039> battery<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.990> want<00:02:04.990> to

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
vehicle with the dead battery I want to

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.080 
vehicle with the dead battery I want to
take<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.349> red<00:02:05.560> clamp<00:02:05.859> which<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.310> usually

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
take the red clamp which is usually

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.969 
take the red clamp which is usually
associated<00:02:07.420> with<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.019> positive<00:02:08.500> terminal<00:02:08.920> on

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
associated with the positive terminal on

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.180 
associated with the positive terminal on
the<00:02:09.009> battery<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:10.319> looking<00:02:11.319> at<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.590> battery<00:02:11.950> I

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
the battery and looking at the battery I

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.520 
the battery and looking at the battery I
can<00:02:13.120> tell<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.690> this<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.349> positive

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
can tell that this is the positive

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.500 
can tell that this is the positive
terminal<00:02:14.829> first<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.910> all<00:02:16.030> because<00:02:16.329> it's

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
terminal first of all because it's

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.309 
terminal first of all because it's
stamped<00:02:16.870> into<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.290> battery<00:02:17.620> right<00:02:17.860> here<00:02:17.920> POS

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
stamped into the battery right here POS

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.110 
stamped into the battery right here POS
secondly<00:02:20.319> this<00:02:20.769> terminal<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.489> larger<00:02:22.000> in

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
secondly this terminal is larger in

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.720 
secondly this terminal is larger in
diameter<00:02:22.500> than<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.709> terminal<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.370> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
diameter than this terminal so the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.280 
diameter than this terminal so the
larger<00:02:25.090> terminal<00:02:25.540> being<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.840> positive

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
larger terminal being the positive

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.039 
larger terminal being the positive
terminal<00:02:26.680> that's<00:02:27.250> where<00:02:27.519> I'm<00:02:27.610> going<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:27.970> start

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.650 

placing<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:32.260> clamp<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.799> terminal<00:02:33.660> and

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
placing the clamp on the terminal and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.300 
placing the clamp on the terminal and
then<00:02:34.989> I<00:02:35.109> wiggle<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.560> around<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.950> little<00:02:35.980> bit

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
then I wiggle that around a little bit

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:52.370 
then I wiggle that around a little bit
to<00:02:36.400> make<00:02:36.519> sure<00:02:36.670> I<00:02:36.700> get<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> good<00:02:37.000> grip<00:02:37.359> on<00:02:37.510> that

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.009 

this<00:02:53.380> one<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.650> positive<00:02:53.829> again<00:02:54.549> this<00:02:55.540> terminal

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
this one is positive again this terminal

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.839 
this one is positive again this terminal
is<00:02:56.079> larger<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:56.560> diameter<00:02:56.739> than<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.400> terminal

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
is larger in diameter than that terminal

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.789 
is larger in diameter than that terminal
besides<00:02:58.269> behind<00:02:58.690> this<00:02:58.870> terminal<00:02:59.319> I<00:02:59.440> can<00:02:59.590> see<00:02:59.769> a

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
besides behind this terminal I can see a

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.030 
besides behind this terminal I can see a
small<00:03:00.099> negative<00:03:00.609> sign<00:03:01.169> so<00:03:02.169> placing<00:03:02.919> the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
small negative sign so placing the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.509
