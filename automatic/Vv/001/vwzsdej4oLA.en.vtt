00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
of this in the past I believe there's a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.109 
of this in the past I believe there's a
pickup<00:00:21.330> truck<00:00:21.480> version<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.460> sedan<00:00:23.460> delivery<00:00:23.670> I

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
pickup truck version a sedan delivery I

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.599 
pickup truck version a sedan delivery I
believe<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.660> was<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.859> convertible<00:00:26.310> version

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609

of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.570> coupe<00:00:27.930> itself<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.680> think<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
of the coupe itself I think the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.669 
of the coupe itself I think the
headstock<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:29.970> custom<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> skill

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
headstock and custom this is a skill

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.020

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.960 
tl sheet I assume that's what they mean
when<00:02:16.710> they<00:02:16.740> have<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.100> dates<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:17.550> here<00:02:17.760> because

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
when they have the dates on here because

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.510 
when they have the dates on here because
I've<00:02:18.060> seen<00:02:18.560> some<00:02:19.560> kits<00:02:19.860> where<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.130> dates<00:02:20.340> will

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
I've seen some kits where the dates will

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.850 
I've seen some kits where the dates will
be<00:02:20.550> earlier<00:02:21.060> than<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.080> kid<00:02:22.290> actually<00:02:22.470> is

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
be earlier than what the kid actually is

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.370 
be earlier than what the kid actually is
so<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.190> assume<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.820> those<00:02:24.720> are<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.020> carry

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
so I assume that those are just carry

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.350 
so I assume that those are just carry
overs<00:02:25.800> but<00:02:26.040> overall<00:02:26.340> these<00:02:26.610> are<00:02:26.670> really<00:02:27.210> nice

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
overs but overall these are really nice

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.080 
overs but overall these are really nice
I've<00:02:27.600> been<00:02:27.720> decals<00:02:31.610> flames<00:02:32.610> there's<00:02:32.940> some
