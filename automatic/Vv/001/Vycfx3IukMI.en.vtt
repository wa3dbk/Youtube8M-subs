quality of the case is not as perfect as
it<00:02:27.210> should<00:02:27.420> be<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:28.560> let's<00:02:28.740> get<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.950> iphone<00:02:29.070> in

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
just place it down and then you just

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.290 
just place it down and then you just
snap<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.770> top<00:02:35.160> frame<00:02:35.690> up<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.020> iphone<00:02:38.300> now

you<00:02:39.360> do<00:02:39.600> here<00:02:39.780> snapping<00:02:40.110> because<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.920> does<00:02:41.340> fit

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
you do here snapping because it does fit

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.150 
you do here snapping because it does fit
very<00:02:42.150> nicely<00:02:42.420> except<00:02:43.320> for<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.530> top<00:02:43.740> but<00:02:44.040> we'll

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160

that<00:03:33.900> I've<00:03:33.989> seen<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.400> does<00:03:35.640> fit<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.910> older

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
here now the ports and cutouts are fine

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.530 
here now the ports and cutouts are fine
as<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.580> see<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.880> do<00:03:44.970> have<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.180> camera

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
as you can see you do have the camera

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.140 
as you can see you do have the camera
right<00:03:45.660> here<00:03:45.720> on<00:03:46.020> the<00:03:46.110> back<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:47.220> said<00:03:47.280> that

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
right here on the back like I said that

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.630 
right here on the back like I said that
little<00:03:48.930> piece<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.680> felt<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.400> middle

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
little piece of felt in the middle

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.570 
little piece of felt in the middle
prevents<00:03:51.120> any<00:03:51.330> sort<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.720> washing<00:03:52.230> out<00:03:52.520> now<00:03:53.520> the

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
prevents any sort of washing out now the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.550 
prevents any sort of washing out now the
main<00:03:53.760> issue<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.090> talking<00:03:54.540> about<00:03:54.600> was<00:03:55.380> right

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
main issue is talking about was right

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.729 
main issue is talking about was right
here<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.430> can<00:03:56.580> see<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:57.390> doesn't<00:03:57.739> snap

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
here you can see that it doesn't snap

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.890 
here you can see that it doesn't snap
incorrectly<00:03:59.430> I'm<00:04:00.030> not<00:04:00.209> sure<00:04:00.390> if<00:04:00.510> that's<00:04:00.630> my

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
incorrectly I'm not sure if that's my

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.620 
incorrectly I'm not sure if that's my
case<00:04:01.230> or<00:04:01.470> every<00:04:01.950> case<00:04:02.130> in<00:04:02.310> general<00:04:02.760> but<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.510> was

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
case or every case in general but it was

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.810 
case or every case in general but it was
something<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:04.200> point<00:04:04.470> out<00:04:04.620> now<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.370> do<00:04:05.640> hit

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
something to point out now you do hit

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.220 
something to point out now you do hit
some<00:04:06.030> minor<00:04:06.239> bubbling<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.959> screen

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
some minor bubbling of the screen

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.900 
some minor bubbling of the screen
protector<00:04:07.620> as<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:08.310> might<00:04:08.459> be<00:04:08.489> able<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.790> see

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
protector as you might be able to see

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.390 
protector as you might be able to see
you<00:04:08.970> right<00:04:09.120> here<00:04:09.500> which<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.800> I'm<00:04:11.010> not<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.220> big

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
you right here which is I'm not a big

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.770 
you right here which is I'm not a big
fan<00:04:11.430> of<00:04:11.640> but<00:04:11.940> it's<00:04:12.030> nothing<00:04:12.209> huge<00:04:12.420> just

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
fan of but it's nothing huge just

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.460 
fan of but it's nothing huge just
nothing<00:04:13.230> like<00:04:13.260> when<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.890> slider<00:04:14.310> case<00:04:14.610> causes

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
nothing like when a slider case causes

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.539 
nothing like when a slider case causes
so<00:04:16.470> overall<00:04:17.040> this<00:04:17.549> case<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:18.150> basically<00:04:19.109> decent

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
so overall this case is basically decent

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.219 
so overall this case is basically decent
I'm<00:04:20.549> not<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.730> big<00:04:20.970> fan<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.450> these<00:04:21.810> types<00:04:22.109> of

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
I'm not a big fan of these types of

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.529 
I'm not a big fan of these types of
cases<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.950> only<00:04:23.190> one<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.580> own<00:04:23.789> is<00:04:23.970> this<00:04:24.150> one<00:04:24.390> and

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
cases the only one I own is this one and

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.210 
cases the only one I own is this one and
the<00:04:24.990> speck<00:04:25.229> fitted<00:04:25.440> and

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
the speck fitted and

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.950 
the speck fitted and
speck<00:04:26.400> fitted<00:04:26.580> does<00:04:26.880> seem<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.210> snap<00:04:27.480> in<00:04:27.690> much

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
speck fitted does seem to snap in much

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.750 
speck fitted does seem to snap in much
more<00:04:28.200> securely<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.580> does<00:04:29.730> have<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.030> nice

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
more securely and it does have that nice

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.730 
more securely and it does have that nice
what<00:04:32.760> do<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:32.880> call<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.270> nice<00:04:33.500> pattern<00:04:34.500> on

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
what do you call it a nice pattern on

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.220 
what do you call it a nice pattern on
the<00:04:34.860> back<00:04:34.890> which<00:04:35.520> has<00:04:35.730> a<00:04:35.760> nice<00:04:36.000> feel<00:04:36.270> so

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
the back which has a nice feel so

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.630 
the back which has a nice feel so
unfortunately<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:37.890> really<00:04:38.130> can't<00:04:38.340> recommend

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
unfortunately I really can't recommend

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.470 
unfortunately I really can't recommend
this<00:04:38.820> case<00:04:39.150> for<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.020> price<00:04:40.550> 3499<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.940> really

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
this case for the price 3499 I really

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.610 
this case for the price 3499 I really
did<00:04:42.630> think<00:04:42.690> that<00:04:42.990> they<00:04:43.170> should<00:04:43.200> have<00:04:43.470> thrown

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
did think that they should have thrown

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.370 
did think that they should have thrown
something<00:04:44.010> extra<00:04:44.580> in<00:04:44.700> there<00:04:45.080> unless<00:04:46.080> it's<00:04:46.290> a

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
something extra in there unless it's a

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.930 
something extra in there unless it's a
case<00:04:46.560> like<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.920> speck<00:04:47.160> candyshell<00:04:47.790> which

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
case like the speck candyshell which

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.660 
case like the speck candyshell which
just<00:04:48.210> provides<00:04:48.860> fantastic<00:04:49.860> protection<00:04:50.430> and

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
just provides fantastic protection and

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.600 
just provides fantastic protection and
it's<00:04:50.790> just<00:04:51.030> such<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.390> different<00:04:51.600> case<00:04:52.070> but<00:04:53.070> I'd

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
it's just such a different case but I'd

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.730
