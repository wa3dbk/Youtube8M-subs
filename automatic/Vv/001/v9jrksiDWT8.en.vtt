this<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.400> basically<00:03:52.580> my<00:03:52.760> survival<00:03:53.540> class<00:03:54.100> this

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
this is basically my survival class this

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.000

stunned in that from though this is

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.980 
stunned in that from though this is
basically<00:04:30.400> for<00:04:30.760> clothes<00:04:31.360> this<00:04:31.780> one's

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.550 
got sugar nut and stun grenades to make
up<00:04:36.910> for<00:04:36.940> my<00:04:37.389> lack<00:04:37.600> of<00:04:37.660> accuracy<00:04:38.229> with<00:04:38.530> the

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
up for my lack of accuracy with the

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.830 
up for my lack of accuracy with the
shotgun<00:04:38.970> which<00:04:39.970> is<00:04:40.150> very<00:04:40.360> good<00:04:40.450> because

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
shotgun which is very good because

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.659 
shotgun which is very good because
shotgun<00:04:41.560> doesn't<00:04:41.770> have<00:04:41.889> much<00:04:42.070> accuracy<00:04:42.430> at

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
shotgun doesn't have much accuracy at

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.960 
shotgun doesn't have much accuracy at
all<00:04:42.820> but<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.120> has<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.240> lot<00:04:43.330> of<00:04:43.479> damage<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
all but it has a lot of damage in the

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.820 
all but it has a lot of damage in the
extreme<00:04:46.479> conditioning<00:04:46.960> is<00:04:47.080> good<00:04:47.290> for<00:04:47.530> running

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
extreme conditioning is good for running

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.030 
extreme conditioning is good for running
away<00:04:49.229> your<00:04:50.229> opponent<00:04:50.620> won't<00:04:50.680> be<00:04:50.830> able<00:04:50.919> to

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
away your opponent won't be able to

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.360 
away your opponent won't be able to
really<00:04:51.520> keep<00:04:51.669> up<00:04:51.850> with<00:04:52.090> you<00:04:52.210> at<00:04:52.330> this<00:04:52.510> one

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
really keep up with you at this one

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.650 
really keep up with you at this one
aside<00:04:54.370> from<00:04:54.580> its<00:04:54.790> rach<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.150> just<00:04:55.330> run<00:04:55.450> up<00:04:55.570> and

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
aside from its rach you just run up and

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.790 
aside from its rach you just run up and
shoots<00:04:55.900> up<00:04:56.050> with

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
shoots up with

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.980 
shoots up with
so<00:04:57.280> this<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.610> good<00:04:57.849> one<00:04:58.030> for<00:04:58.270> this<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:58.810> my

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
so this is a good one for this is my

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.990 
so this is a good one for this is my
loan<00:04:59.199> this<00:04:59.560> is<00:04:59.680> like<00:04:59.860> my<00:05:00.099> heavy<00:05:00.340> assault<00:05:00.729> my

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
loan this is like my heavy assault my

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.920 
loan this is like my heavy assault my

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.770 
of hand did more to them the sleight of
hand<00:05:07.539> is<00:05:07.629> basically<00:05:08.050> pretty<00:05:08.500> obvious<00:05:09.009> for<00:05:09.340> a

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
hand is basically pretty obvious for a

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.330 
hand is basically pretty obvious for a

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
because machine gun light machine guns

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.700 
because machine gun light machine guns
are<00:05:12.490> very<00:05:12.669> hard<00:05:12.879> to<00:05:12.940> reload<00:05:13.300> very<00:05:14.199> slow<00:05:14.530> at

are very hard to reload very slow at

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.619 
are very hard to reload very slow at
least<00:05:14.949> when<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.520> slide<00:05:15.819> if<00:05:15.940> he<00:05:16.030> hits<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.240> quick

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:16.629 
least when you slide if he hits a quick

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.950 
least when you slide if he hits a quick
and<00:05:16.780> step<00:05:17.500> up<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.740> pace<00:05:17.889> a<00:05:17.949> bit

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.070 

March<00:05:21.710> ative<00:05:22.270> just<00:05:23.270> casing<00:05:23.449> when<00:05:23.690> gets<00:05:23.870> close

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:45.719 

now<00:05:38.380> we<00:05:38.440> move<00:05:38.710> on<00:05:38.889> to<00:05:38.919> these<00:05:39.550> micro<00:05:40.450> I<00:05:40.720> believe

there<00:05:46.330> we<00:05:46.479> go<00:05:46.599> this<00:05:47.529> is<00:05:47.650> pretty<00:05:47.830> basic<00:05:48.039> got

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
there we go this is pretty basic got

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.549 
there we go this is pretty basic got
clay<00:05:48.789> moist<00:05:49.180> just<00:05:49.689> in<00:05:49.809> case<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.080> want<00:05:50.259> to<00:05:50.289> camp

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
you got stopping power you get that one

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.089 
you got stopping power you get that one
shot<00:05:52.419> with<00:05:52.599> killing<00:05:52.930> our<00:05:53.110> lungs<00:05:53.439> for<00:05:53.800> longer

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
shot with killing our lungs for longer

shot with killing our lungs for longer
sniper<00:05:54.789> shots<00:05:55.089> deep<00:05:55.749> impact<00:05:56.169> is<00:05:56.379> also<00:05:56.710> good

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
sniper shots deep impact is also good

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.749 
sniper shots deep impact is also good
for<00:05:57.219> that<00:05:57.370> too<00:05:58.259> this<00:05:59.259> I<00:05:59.620> use<00:05:59.800> on<00:06:00.219> long<00:06:00.490> because

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
for that too this I use on long because
