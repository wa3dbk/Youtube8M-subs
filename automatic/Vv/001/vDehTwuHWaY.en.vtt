00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.620
 ogier 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.799
 we are worried 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.799
 p 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.429
 but 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.429
 different elements that you find in nature 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.140
 the magic is beautiful 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.259
 which 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.439
 efe 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.640

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.920
 efe 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.280
 I'll try 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.640
 also although the truth 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.450
 the ideas always 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.130
 the air but there is the difference between having ideas and natural 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.930
 in motion the ideas 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.800
 p 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 it seems to us that it is a strong contrast 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.569
 see a little bit about what people want 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:54.569
 but without losing its essence that raises what it must support 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.250
 little bit 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.870
 the port of acapulco 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.080
 these fallacies as honored 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.150

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.670
 have to advance 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.869
 yes 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:19.069
 but investors on the other hand a dark red concreting work of 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.149
 electricity 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.149
 the airport

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.749
 this will depend on the duration of each one what it means 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.019
 Washington 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.019

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.099
 plus a bag

 according to the expert 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:37.509
