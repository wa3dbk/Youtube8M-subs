00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.710
 the boy and today I have considered 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:25.529
 how is it going on the cake 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.949
 flat under 02 30 in the rap and I say 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.699
 times 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.199
 The trick is not that easy though 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.149
 learn the complete fast on 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.440
 most important in his tricks and by 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.360
 Teachers are very happy 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.809
 ambition the will that he stays and that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.010
 it's always trying a lot 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.440
 is important 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.649
 Personally, I would say first 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.579
 start that classic im first time 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.699
 stepping pace there 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.500
 and then you can do it so easily 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.149
 tried up to now was high to 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.149
 get shown 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.600
 picture is so far from her attempt she was 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.520
 First of all, the weight has to be that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.520
 to bring front-that's me 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.550
 the first boss, the second is so 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.560
 That should always come immediately 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.320
 so that the safety may repeat 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.900
 for which he says we could go to the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.700
 weight out of rubbish 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.590
 Alsdorf's second step is 40 times 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 that they show in this movement 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.550
 no longer want in the sense 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.020
 you should always use the foot always with the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.950
 So we stand in front is mine 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.830
 personal opinion 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.300
 with the foot with the metal stands with 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.000
 the on the fewest away in the forest 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:52.290
 always bring in the award crown 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:57.990
 and who can be happy that she 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.490
 quasi clearly more powerful and the guests 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:10.320
 gets an idea of the violent or 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:13.230
 from the heart that the christ the weight 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.560
 I get to the front shows that we 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.560
 play well 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.550
 Opel gets how far his own life 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.560
 it must have to go further back 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.840
 this is about to overturn i say 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.650
 this is all public one 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.299
 snappy buhs then if you are so 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.200
 you can go up there 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.030
 Out and virtually free from on the street 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.110
 and get the exercise that you the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.110
 Disabled showed only briefly 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.130
 So it turns so far you like 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:06.120
 seen then comes the next one 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:10.170
 We dare the easiest 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.420
 Giant height equal but a medium 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.860
 will be present in every skatepark 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.340
 then you start your ford so with 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.800
 some animals then jump up 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.960
 shift or court forward the 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.940
 football club knits on me around 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.730
 but he does not come back 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.500
 because it is the point x, and yet 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.660
 Do you want to attend the exhibition? 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.550
 WebFish that is already here they come 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.470
 until the next step it is very 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.120
 important that if you like to one 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.410
 light 90 degrees then the foot has into it 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.450
 It will soon tilt slightly backwards 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.020
 and now here is the most important one 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.780
 of all the weight in the ramp 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.280
 publishers because they are heading down 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.960
 if you weight in the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.380
 wanted to shift the direction dense 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.270
 made 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:06.400
 too much in the direction of these you 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:08.200
 so you have to go with 59 too 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.850
 jump and always weight once 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.940
 easy to retire, do not let us 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:16.120
 hang on gas stations in the ramp 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.840
 the effect is guaranteed by jungs werdorf and 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.160
 then you have to complete the street 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.040
 be jumping back under but 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.400
 These oblique I just wanted to short 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.400
 clip a 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.520
 this snow is very important with that yes 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.510
 Also come back in the lamp if you 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.790
 you looked at the little tip now 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.070
 you clearly see it either 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.780
 rejected a bit of business 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.640
 with the income it is based 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.740
 dramatically if you are here and give 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.900
 so far forward they are leaving 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.460
 definitely should have left 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.950
 avoid and it was actually already 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:03.640
 in the shortest the only thing their salary 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.690
 can, after all, is one that, on the 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.460
 to practice street 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.380
 im flat with that you are really sure 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.450
 if you miss and everything is 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.000
 simply very important as I said conversation 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.970
 where this power curve has 90 degrees 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.590
 footballers the highest penalty he will 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:22.660
 continue full stores do not always 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.610
 nice in the tube and then if you 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.430
 now this comes no tilt 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.250
 point where something would fall over you 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.330
 just talk away in the lamp 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.710
 suffers some attempts to run the 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.150
 personally determined the slip 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:41.380
 often brought year I find it 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:44.470
 pretty cool as I said the most important 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.100
 just do not stay the same 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.580
 to give up 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.930
 always try the most important 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.620
 not work just can not work 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.540
 to give up 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.919
 How many times has republic fiercely clung to her 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.300
 belong to the ramp driven 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.380
 because I simply did not know 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.540
 have the key 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.480
 There are always different reasons 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.030
 could be key in a trick 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.830
 which one must know for this easy 90 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:11.160
 Grad curve up 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:14.310
 even the weight in the aces let with 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.440
 these three score about 475 more like 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.449
 it quasi itself, I myself am a 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.949
 graphics and therefore of course considered 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.050
 get the videos for you with it 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.780
 that it functions properly because 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.759
 Greetings show you and she says I 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.169
 Hope you like it if it still is 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.460
 Just ask in the questions 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.660
 Write comments if you like 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.060
 did not quite fit 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.410
 and if you like it just like that 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.729
 thumbs up maybe off or 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.199
 if you see more such videos 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.550
 will definitely be a lot 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.710
 come and then I would worry 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.810
 houseshift in bed and thus the 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.870
 shit sure it could be alright 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.870
