00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
are I'm going to show you if I hanging

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:03.070 
are I'm going to show you if I hanging
me<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.489> weight<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.879> it

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.450 

I'm<00:01:04.080> putting<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.500> button<00:01:04.650> along<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> door

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
I'm putting a button along the door

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.670 
I'm putting a button along the door
frame<00:01:05.760> here<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.540> idea<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.259> so

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
frame here and the idea of that is so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.590 
frame here and the idea of that is so
that<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> doors<00:01:08.610> are<00:01:08.790> opening<00:01:09.299> close

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that when the doors are opening close

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.780 
that when the doors are opening close
they're<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.470> actually<00:01:10.890> touching<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
they're not actually touching the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
they're not actually touching the
polythene<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.420> similarly<00:01:12.960> we're<00:01:13.440> going<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
polythene and similarly we're going to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.690 
polythene and similarly we're going to
put<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> button<00:01:14.130> across<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.840> brace<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
put a button across this brace to so the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.999 
put a button across this brace to so the
doors<00:01:17.909> would<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.119> held<00:01:18.680> just<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> right

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
doors would be held just in the right

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.920 
doors would be held just in the right
position<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.299> out<00:01:21.360> without

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
position for going in and out without

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.469 
position for going in and out without
ruining<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.470> polythene<00:01:23.090> now<00:01:24.090> we're<00:01:24.299> putting
