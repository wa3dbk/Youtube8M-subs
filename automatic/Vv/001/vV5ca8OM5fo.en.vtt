00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
it's a low light situation and then I

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:45.270 
it's a low light situation and then I
will<00:00:29.010> go<00:00:29.160> outside<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.300> let's<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.869> started

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.819 

just<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.449> lighting<00:00:46.809> impressed<00:00:47.230> me<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.800> most

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
just the lighting impressed me the most

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.150 
just the lighting impressed me the most
with<00:00:48.370> this<00:00:48.520> camera<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:51.100> adjust<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:52.059> well<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
with this camera just adjust so well it

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:12.700 
with this camera just adjust so well it
really<00:00:54.460> does<00:00:54.640> look<00:00:54.670> at<00:00:54.969> that

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.460
