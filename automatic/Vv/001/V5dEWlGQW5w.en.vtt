00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:07.500
 very good divisibility criteria 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.639
 when a number is divisible by 7 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.520
 It is divisible by 7 among 7 care that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.000
 This rule is simple but it tends to 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:24.390
 forget a number is divisible in 37 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.960
 when taking in the figure the units 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.660
 and we multiply it by 2 and you 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.580
 we subtract 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.860
 to the rest of the number that we have left 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:40.170
 you have to give us that zero difference or 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.449
 a multiple number of seven 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.449
 agree to show a button 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.910
 I'm going to put the blackboard so it's 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.510
 of course we have the figure 343 as you know 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.430
 well this is these are put in the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.060
 units 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.409
 agree and this we consider to be the 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.210
 rest 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.310
 the veins the rest 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.200
 then on the one hand we have the 34 and for 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.950
 another side we have the units that is the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.990
 3 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.990
 in the units we multiply them by 2 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:27.580
 and he gives us 6 so now we take 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.580
 the 34 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.830
 and we remove 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.040
 what gives us 34 16 28 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:46.190
 28 is a multiple number of 7 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:51.710
 yes because 7 by 4 28 28 is divisible 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:56.930
 between 7 if you see 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.969
 then we verify that 343 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.750
 divisible between 7 agreed upon has to 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:07.759
 give a multiple number of 70 I'll put 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.759
 the example so that we see the 0 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.570
 105 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.330
 105 units is 5 well and we have 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.110
 the rest on the one hand the 10 and on the other 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.750
 side 5 on 5 multiplied by 2 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.840
 points for 5 as you know very well is 10 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:51.470
 and now I make the difference subtraction 10 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.470
 - 10 to 0 and with humidity 0 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:00.370
 we verify that the figure is divisible 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.770
 between 7 that easy and that's easy 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.920

 to that you subscribe jce in the channel of 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.560
 solve your math doubts a 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.890
 greeting 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.890
