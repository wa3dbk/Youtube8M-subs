00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.949
 the judas beer 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.899
 the game of beer offers a rich set of nuances that allow 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.300
 illustrate much pain of mentor tere system of management and of the 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.370
 information 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.810
 first of all after beer is a model because it's a representation 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.180
 partial of the real system because it has a part of the identical structure is 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.560
 that is, systems such as morphic is a dynamic model because the system 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.560
 It changes as time goes by, what is it for? 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.360
 the simulation of the beer production and distribution system 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.150
 allows us to know how the structure of the system is to say elements that 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.160
 interrelate center them and the whole 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.910
 determine the behavior of the system 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.290
 almost independently of the decisions that are taken what are its elements and 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.430
 how can we apply them 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.680
 the elements of beer are consumers 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.480
 beers 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.720
 cnc ap 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.450
 retailers wholesalers 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.350
 distributors factories 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.980
 and the determined relationships 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.370
 who buys where when the consumers who buy where they want 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.190
 all week while retailers and wholesalers and 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.540
 dealers 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.490
 they acquire products at certain times and the factory also 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.260
 has a beer production structure 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.230
 three weeks for a batch and a week for the change of products to 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.340
 dynamically interact these elements including the delays for the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.310
 transmission of information 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.220
 before the team what it represents in the passenger ode of the sale of beer 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.129
 b 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.639
 the factory responds four or six weeks later 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.159
 producing this type of networks 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.159
 when already the demand for the state nor the normal 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.859
 partial views of wholesale distributors and retailers 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.039
 determine that the final inventories 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.919
 the ability of the market to absorb them for a long time is openly foreseen 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.329
 we are in the presence of a situation in which the causes that listen to it 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.479
 they are separated in time 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.449
 which is not strange in the complexity of the systems 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:41.620
 the complexity 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.099
 here present 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.429
 ao in a simplified system like this model 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.099
 does not allow to determine the policyholders 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.659
 decisions 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.329
 retailers wholesaler 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.979
 dealers 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.429
 and madrid 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:00.609
 what are the leverage points 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.769
 so that the decision really causes meningitis 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.789
 because another situation that shows that there is more 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:11.779
 there are no correct answers since the complexity determines that there is this type 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:12.859
 of sites 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.169
 and negatives in each institution 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.759
 some immediate and others that will appear long after 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:22.979
 know the culture of the system will allow is that the decisions are not 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:23.939
 directed 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.719
 so to the apparent nor superficial if they do not go well to what younger 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.219
 undoubtedly this sets a different possible nose level with the 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.399
 system approach 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:39.699
 Another situation that appears is that decision makers place orders 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.510
 loser barret who do not receive a requested amount pushing beyond what 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.849
 what was necessary 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.879
 when thermal things keep getting worse 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.909
 We do not have beer despite having placed many orders 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.039
 the situations will bury 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.589
 a little more before improving 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.680
 begin to arrive orders this situation 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.549
 fluctuates inventories 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.549
 if we graphically observe the behavior over time 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.329
 we will observe that by not understanding the structure and behavior of the system and 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.370
 make decisions about the apparent 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.489
 when we owe in inventory 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.009
 how much was sold last week 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.129
 there are times when inventories are exhausted and 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.490
 later they will be saturated 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.759
 because the implicit structural delays of the system for 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.360
 transmit information 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.360
 they also have amplifying effects 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.170
 which determine a super demand was super production from a 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.699
 minimal detonator 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.499
 let's think how many losses occurred with the inventories parked the 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:48.539
 taxation 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.629
 and how much loss does it represent when you stop selling because you do not have inventory? 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:57.780
 time one of the ports later forester the to raise this swing 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:59.060
 of the system 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.400
 as a product of the lack of information and that injecting the right mind into the 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.770
 system will be possible to control that oscillations from being a site to that 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.779
 Improve your behavior by looking more 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.529
 let's think about what happened in the beer game if the information about 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.169
 of the retail sales is transferred to the factory and every point 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.309
 intermediate without delays 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:25.309
 we would have a better chance of controlling the chicken 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.729
 between the parameters that determine poty moss for inventory of the 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.699
 production 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.839
 the behavior would be different westphal we would have acted on the culture
