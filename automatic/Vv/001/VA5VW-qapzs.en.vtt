how<00:01:18.409> we<00:01:18.470> could<00:01:18.710> help<00:01:18.860> support<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.430> project<00:01:19.760> I

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
how we could help support the project I

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.600 
how we could help support the project I
went<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:20.960> saw<00:01:21.830> what<00:01:22.010> they<00:01:22.130> needed<00:01:22.370> they

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
went and saw what they needed they

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.660 
went and saw what they needed they
explained<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.210> thing

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
explained the thing

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
explained the thing
in<00:01:23.880> detail<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.259> had<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> pretty<00:01:26.040> good

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
in detail and I had a pretty good

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.859 
in detail and I had a pretty good
understanding<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.060> way<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> solve<00:01:27.659> their

understanding of a way to solve their

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.590 
understanding of a way to solve their
problem<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:29.100> came<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> concept<00:01:29.909> of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
problem and I came up with a concept of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.620 
problem and I came up with a concept of
the<00:01:30.780> tool<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:32.159> interface<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:32.850> their

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the tool that could interface with their

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.139 
the tool that could interface with their
their<00:01:34.470> part<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> aircraft<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
their part on the aircraft and the

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.969 
their part on the aircraft and the
universal<00:01:36.689> Jack<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.530> used<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
universal Jack that they used in the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.389 
universal Jack that they used in the
hangar<00:01:38.399> if<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.149> taking<00:01:39.509> days<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.649> run

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
hangar if it's taking days to run

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.550 
hangar if it's taking days to run
through<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.580> process<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.210> JSF<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.409> could

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
through a process with JSF and we could

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.649 
through a process with JSF and we could
come<00:01:43.710> up<00:01:43.830> with<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.979> method<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.610> save<00:01:45.000> time<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
come up with a method to save time and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.469 
come up with a method to save time and
money<00:01:45.770> then<00:01:46.770> we're<00:01:47.130> all<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.549> we<00:01:48.180> proved

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
money then we're all for that we proved

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.100 
money then we're all for that we proved
it<00:01:48.630> already<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.250> bf1<00:01:50.250> they<00:01:50.850> change<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.390> from

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
it already on bf1 they change that from
