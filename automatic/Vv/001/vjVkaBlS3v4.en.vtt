that<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.810> balls<00:02:17.050> will<00:02:17.290> bounce<00:02:17.440> across<00:02:17.890> them

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
that the balls will bounce across them

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.869 
that the balls will bounce across them
and<00:02:18.310> they'll<00:02:18.489> add<00:02:18.910> wear<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:21.190> game<00:02:21.489> is<00:02:21.760> in

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
and they'll add wear so this game is in

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.040 
and they'll add wear so this game is in
pretty<00:02:22.060> good<00:02:22.150> shape<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:22.750> see<00:02:22.959> it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
pretty good shape and you can see it

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.540 
pretty good shape and you can see it
hasn't<00:02:23.200> even<00:02:23.319> been<00:02:23.560> cleaned<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.250> doesn't

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
hasn't even been cleaned and it doesn't

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.920 
hasn't even been cleaned and it doesn't
look<00:02:24.640> too<00:02:24.790> bad<00:02:24.819> at<00:02:25.150> all<00:02:25.239> I'm<00:02:25.420> sure<00:02:25.629> this<00:02:25.810> is

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
look too bad at all I'm sure this is

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.830 
look too bad at all I'm sure this is
gonna<00:02:26.110> clean<00:02:26.290> up<00:02:26.440> really<00:02:26.769> really<00:02:27.220> nice

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
gonna clean up really really nice

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.250 
gonna clean up really really nice
another<00:02:28.840> neat<00:02:29.769> thing<00:02:29.800> about<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.519> I<00:02:31.260> don't

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
another neat thing about it is I don't

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.350 
another neat thing about it is I don't
see<00:02:32.470> any<00:02:32.650> broken<00:02:32.800> plastics<00:02:33.550> which<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.880> really

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
see any broken plastics which is really

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.100 
see any broken plastics which is really
unusual

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
unusual

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.589 
unusual
look<00:02:35.410> at<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:36.209> everything<00:02:37.209> looks<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.480> be

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
look at that everything looks to be

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.150 
look at that everything looks to be
intact<00:02:38.069> it's<00:02:39.069> got<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.370> cool<00:02:40.230> long<00:02:41.230> dual

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
intact it's got this cool long dual

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.009 
intact it's got this cool long dual
right<00:02:42.879> lane<00:02:43.120> thing<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:43.660> you'd<00:02:43.810> see<00:02:43.989> on

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
right lane thing like you'd see on

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.009 
right lane thing like you'd see on
centigrade<00:02:44.560> 37<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.459> then<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.420> big<00:02:46.630> spinner

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
centigrade 37 and then a big spinner

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.750 
centigrade 37 and then a big spinner
here<00:02:47.680> which<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.160> guess<00:02:48.459> one<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
here which is a guess one of the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.900 
here which is a guess one of the
objectives<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.209> shoot<00:02:49.480> for<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:51.579> can<00:02:51.730> see

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
objectives you shoot for you can see

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.890 
objectives you shoot for you can see
where<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:53.670> balls<00:02:54.670> at<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.299> hole<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
where the balls at the the hole that the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.180 
where the balls at the the hole that the
balls<00:02:56.079> fall<00:02:56.319> into<00:02:56.560> there's<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.799> little<00:02:57.040> bit<00:02:57.130> of

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
balls fall into there's a little bit of

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.000 
balls fall into there's a little bit of
wear<00:02:57.370> but<00:02:57.700> it's<00:02:58.329> not<00:02:58.510> too<00:02:58.690> bad<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:59.230> think<00:02:59.650> this

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
wear but it's not too bad I think this

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.800 
wear but it's not too bad I think this
game<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.220> gonna<00:03:00.489> clean<00:03:00.730> up<00:03:00.910> pretty<00:03:01.090> nice<00:03:01.329> and

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
game is gonna clean up pretty nice and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.830 
game is gonna clean up pretty nice and
from<00:03:02.650> looking<00:03:02.920> at<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.130> cabinet<00:03:03.840> it's

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
from looking at the cabinet it's

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.380 
from looking at the cabinet it's
relatively<00:03:05.319> clean<00:03:05.620> look<00:03:06.430> down<00:03:06.610> inside<00:03:06.819> though

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
relatively clean look down inside though

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.569 
relatively clean look down inside though
you<00:03:07.450> can<00:03:07.750> see<00:03:07.930> there's<00:03:08.280> there's<00:03:09.280> plenty<00:03:09.340> of

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
you can see there's there's plenty of

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.839 
you can see there's there's plenty of
crop<00:03:09.849> down<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.299> there<00:03:11.010> there's<00:03:12.010> some<00:03:12.099> rat<00:03:12.489> crap

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
crop down in there there's some rat crap

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.910 
crop down in there there's some rat crap
and<00:03:13.780> dirt<00:03:14.079> I'm<00:03:14.290> gonna<00:03:14.440> have<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:14.709> really

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
and dirt I'm gonna have to be really

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.599 
and dirt I'm gonna have to be really
careful<00:03:15.099> when<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.630> vacuum<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:16.780> out<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:18.340> if<00:03:18.519> we

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
careful when I vacuum that out and if we

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.080 
careful when I vacuum that out and if we
look<00:03:18.790> over<00:03:18.940> here<00:03:20.310> there's<00:03:21.310> been<00:03:21.459> some<00:03:21.760> drinks

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
look over here there's been some drinks

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.500 
look over here there's been some drinks
spilled<00:03:22.450> in<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.750> coin<00:03:22.989> door<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.880> there's<00:03:25.329> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
spilled in the coin door and there's the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.620 
spilled in the coin door and there's the
inside<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.170> machine<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:27.420> will<00:03:28.420> have<00:03:28.540> to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
inside of the machine and I will have to

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.259 
inside of the machine and I will have to
pull<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.900> glass<00:03:29.079> off<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.650> take<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.950> look<00:03:30.160> at<00:03:30.310> it

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.229 

side<00:03:34.269> art<00:03:34.480> looks<00:03:34.720> pretty<00:03:34.959> good<00:03:36.420> not<00:03:37.420> too<00:03:37.600> bad

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
side art looks pretty good not too bad

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.240 
side art looks pretty good not too bad
I'll<00:03:40.239> show<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:40.660> one<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.230> biggest<00:03:41.769> problem

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
I'll show you one of the biggest problem

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.099 
I'll show you one of the biggest problem
that<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.400> see<00:03:42.519> with<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:43.090> game<00:03:43.299> is<00:03:43.959> there

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
that I see with the game is there

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.800 
that I see with the game is there
appears<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.440> be<00:03:44.530> some<00:03:44.739> water<00:03:44.920> damage<00:03:45.190> on<00:03:45.819> the

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
appears to be some water damage on the

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.750 
appears to be some water damage on the
back<00:03:47.730> why<00:03:48.730> they<00:03:49.090> used<00:03:49.389> plywood<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:51.100> most<00:03:51.609> of

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
back why they used plywood in most of

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.340 
back why they used plywood in most of
the<00:03:51.819> areas<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.359> then<00:03:52.450> in<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.720> back<00:03:52.900> they<00:03:53.139> used

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
the areas and then in the back they used

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.229 
the areas and then in the back they used
this<00:03:53.560> particle<00:03:54.280> board<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.549> don't<00:03:54.579> know<00:03:54.940> but

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
this particle board I don't know but

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.960 
this particle board I don't know but
obviously<00:03:55.329> it<00:03:55.690> just<00:03:55.720> doesn't<00:03:56.109> handle<00:03:56.530> well

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
obviously it just doesn't handle well

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.110 
obviously it just doesn't handle well
when<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.090> gets<00:03:58.120> wet<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.920> can<00:04:00.099> see<00:04:00.370> there's

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
when it gets wet and you can see there's

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.270 
when it gets wet and you can see there's
definitely<00:04:01.329> some<00:04:02.019> damage<00:04:02.470> here<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.900> know

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
definitely some damage here you know

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.309 
definitely some damage here you know
this<00:04:06.280> is<00:04:06.430> starting<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.790> come<00:04:07.000> undone<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.720> don't

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
this is starting to come undone I don't

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.170 
this is starting to come undone I don't
know<00:04:08.410> what<00:04:08.590> what<00:04:09.040> I'm<00:04:09.130> gonna<00:04:09.250> do<00:04:09.459> about<00:04:09.579> that<00:04:09.940> I

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
know what what I'm gonna do about that I

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.390 
know what what I'm gonna do about that I
have<00:04:10.389> to<00:04:10.510> try<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.780> mitigate<00:04:11.769> some<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.250> that

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
have to try to mitigate some of that

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.630 
have to try to mitigate some of that
damage<00:04:13.560> so

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
damage so

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.630 
damage so
that's<00:04:16.420> it<00:04:18.989> I'm<00:04:19.989> gonna<00:04:20.140> take<00:04:20.500> some<00:04:20.769> more<00:04:20.950> I'm

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
that's it I'm gonna take some more I'm

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.560
