we<00:00:06.750> were<00:00:06.839> involved<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.319> building<00:00:07.620> a

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
we were involved in building a

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.640 
we were involved in building a
publishing<00:00:09.480> solution<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:09.990> allows<00:00:10.230> them<00:00:10.500> to

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
publishing solution that allows them to

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.650 
publishing solution that allows them to
publish<00:00:11.040> video<00:00:11.340> not<00:00:11.670> only<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.030> YouTube<00:00:12.450> but

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
publish video not only to YouTube but

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.519 
publish video not only to YouTube but
also<00:00:12.809> iTunes<00:00:13.559> U<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.529> dedicated

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
also iTunes U and the dedicated

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.140 
also iTunes U and the dedicated
web-based<00:00:17.100> portal<00:00:19.460> often<00:00:20.460> people<00:00:20.550> ask<00:00:20.760> why

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
web-based portal often people ask why

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.689 
web-based portal often people ask why
not<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.840> concentrate<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.350> say<00:00:22.650> YouTube<00:00:23.369> or

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
not just concentrate on say YouTube or

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.450 
not just concentrate on say YouTube or
even<00:00:24.000> iTunes<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.710> reason<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.189> each

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
even iTunes the reason is is that each

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.920 
even iTunes the reason is is that each
of<00:00:26.519> those<00:00:26.730> individual<00:00:27.150> publishing<00:00:27.570> points

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
of those individual publishing points

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.320 
of those individual publishing points
have<00:00:28.109> particular<00:00:28.890> advantages<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.910> also

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
have particular advantages and also

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120 
have particular advantages and also
established<00:00:30.810> communities<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.410> they<00:00:31.560> want

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
established communities that they want

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.520 
established communities that they want
to<00:00:32.189> participate<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.850> all<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.149> them<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
to participate in all of them and one of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.020 
to participate in all of them and one of
the<00:00:34.590> biggest<00:00:34.829> problems<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:35.250> actually

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the biggest problems was actually

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.880 
the biggest problems was actually
allowing<00:00:36.329> staff<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.260> faculty<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
allowing staff and faculty to

allowing staff and faculty to
participate<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.730> iTunes<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.360> participate<00:00:39.930> in

participate in iTunes and participate in

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.350 
participate in iTunes and participate in
YouTube<00:00:40.469> without<00:00:41.399> having<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.059> through<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
that that staff upload and then also

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.049 
that that staff upload and then also

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
moves it to these publishing points if

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520 
moves it to these publishing points if
they<00:00:57.420> want<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.899> they<00:00:58.020> want<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> publish<00:00:58.469> it

on iTunes they can they want to publish
YouTube<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.770> automatically

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
YouTube they can and it automatically

YouTube they can and it automatically
happens<00:01:02.460> behind<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.000> scenes<00:01:03.059> without<00:01:03.600> them

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
happens behind the scenes without them

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
happens behind the scenes without them
actually<00:01:04.140> happen<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.619> too<00:01:05.580> much<00:01:05.700> about

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
actually happen to know too much about

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.550 
actually happen to know too much about
how<00:01:06.360> those<00:01:06.540> systems<00:01:06.750> work<00:01:07.729> well<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:10.170> video<00:01:10.290> in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
how those systems work well the video in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
how those systems work well the video in
particular<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> nightmare

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
particular is a nightmare

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.820 
particular is a nightmare
essentially<00:01:13.430> not<00:01:14.430> only<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.270> providing<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
essentially not only are we providing a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.330 
essentially not only are we providing a
system<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.369> pushes<00:01:19.009> finished<00:01:20.009> video

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
system that pushes finished video

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.590 
system that pushes finished video
content<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:21.360> different

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
content to all of these different

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.410 
content to all of these different
publishing<00:01:22.140> points<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:22.770> they're<00:01:23.280> also<00:01:23.430> doing

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
publishing points but they're also doing

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.670 
publishing points but they're also doing
all<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> transcoding<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.350> post-production

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
all the transcoding and post-production

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
all the transcoding and post-production
work<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.729> video<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.659> when<00:01:27.780> someone

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
work on that video so when someone

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.850 
work on that video so when someone
uploads<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.439> video<00:01:28.560> we

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
uploads a video we

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.920 
uploads a video we
create<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> kind<00:01:30.940> of<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.060> base<00:01:31.270> format<00:01:31.720> for<00:01:31.900> that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
create a kind of a base format for that

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.930 
create a kind of a base format for that
video<00:01:32.260> we<00:01:32.740> put<00:01:32.950> what<00:01:33.130> we<00:01:33.160> call<00:01:33.400> a<00:01:33.430> top<00:01:33.730> and<00:01:33.880> a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
video we put what we call a top and a

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.450 
video we put what we call a top and a
tail<00:01:34.180> on<00:01:35.050> that<00:01:35.110> video<00:01:35.530> it's<00:01:35.980> essentially<00:01:36.430> like

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
tail on that video it's essentially like

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.060 
tail on that video it's essentially like
a<00:01:36.580> kind<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:36.880> an<00:01:36.970> intro<00:01:37.390> like<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.020> spinning<00:01:38.530> logo

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
a kind of an intro like a spinning logo

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.160 
a kind of an intro like a spinning logo
or<00:01:39.250> jingle<00:01:39.670> or<00:01:39.790> something<00:01:40.300> that's<00:01:40.750> relevant

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.940 
final transcode of video watermarking
for<00:01:56.320> example<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.720> transcoding<00:01:59.380> engine

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
for example so the transcoding engine

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.400 
for example so the transcoding engine
which<00:02:00.250> we<00:02:00.430> call<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.729> autobot<00:02:01.330> after<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.050> good

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
which we call the autobot after the good

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.190 
which we call the autobot after the good
guys<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.860> Transformers<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:04.600> needs<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:05.080> be

guys and the Transformers it needs to be
able<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.470> transform<00:02:06.250> any<00:02:06.670> video<00:02:07.030> format

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
able to transform any video format

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.020 
able to transform any video format
whether<00:02:07.660> it's<00:02:07.899> from<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.110> mobile<00:02:08.350> phone<00:02:09.030> whether

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
whether it's from a mobile phone whether

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.120 
whether it's from a mobile phone whether
it's<00:02:10.239> shot<00:02:10.509> from<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.869> broadcast<00:02:11.530> quality

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
it's shot from a broadcast quality

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.370 
it's shot from a broadcast quality
camera<00:02:12.550> or<00:02:12.810> screen<00:02:13.810> captured<00:02:14.260> from

camera or screen captured from

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.400 
camera or screen captured from
somebody's<00:02:14.950> screen<00:02:15.750> into<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:17.020> series<00:02:17.380> of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
somebody's screen into a series of

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.840 
somebody's screen into a series of
Universal<00:02:17.950> formats<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.459> can<00:02:18.580> be

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
Universal formats that can be

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.479 
Universal formats that can be
distributed<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:20.250> different<00:02:21.250> screen

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
distributed so different screen

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.490 
distributed so different screen
resolutions<00:02:21.520> for<00:02:22.239> example<00:02:22.720> there<00:02:23.110> are<00:02:23.200> lots

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
resolutions for example there are lots

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.620 
resolutions for example there are lots
of<00:02:23.620> different<00:02:23.860> screen<00:02:24.040> resolutions<00:02:24.070> Sam<00:02:24.820> you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
of different screen resolutions Sam you

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.449 
of different screen resolutions Sam you
take<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.170> from<00:02:26.290> an<00:02:26.380> iPhone<00:02:26.770> it's<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.070> funny<00:02:27.280> kind

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
take it from an iPhone it's a funny kind

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.059 
take it from an iPhone it's a funny kind
of<00:02:27.610> format<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.239> on<00:02:28.390> so

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
of format and so on so

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.280 
of format and so on so
first<00:02:30.760> part<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.120> our<00:02:31.209> transcoding<00:02:31.749> process<00:02:31.780> is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
first part of our transcoding process is

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.000 
first part of our transcoding process is
to<00:02:32.409> make<00:02:32.620> this<00:02:32.829> space<00:02:33.400> format<00:02:33.939> which<00:02:34.299> we<00:02:34.450> then

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
to make this space format which we then

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.140 
to make this space format which we then
transcode<00:02:36.010> into<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.370> different<00:02:36.639> destination

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
transcode into the different destination

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.660 
transcode into the different destination
formats<00:02:37.540> around<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:38.799> have<00:02:38.920> three<00:02:39.189> primary

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
formats around and we have three primary

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.099 
formats around and we have three primary
destination<00:02:40.120> formats<00:02:40.450> one's<00:02:40.659> a<00:02:40.900> high

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
destination formats one's a high

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.759 
destination formats one's a high
resolution<00:02:41.319> streamed<00:02:42.389> format<00:02:43.469> which<00:02:44.469> can<00:02:44.499> go

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
resolution streamed format which can go

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.809 
resolution streamed format which can go
all<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:44.980> way<00:02:45.069> up<00:02:45.159> to<00:02:45.310> near<00:02:45.459> High<00:02:45.609> Definition

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
all the way up to near High Definition

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.179 
all the way up to near High Definition
we<00:02:46.599> deal<00:02:47.019> with<00:02:47.049> smiles<00:02:47.469> as<00:02:47.680> large<00:02:47.889> as<00:02:48.040> about

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
we deal with smiles as large as about

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.849 
we deal with smiles as large as about

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
formats obviously things like iTunes U

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.509 
formats obviously things like iTunes U
we<00:02:52.810> have<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> dedicated<00:02:53.439> format<00:02:54.010> for<00:02:54.189> that<00:02:54.219> and

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
we have a dedicated format for that and

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.339 
we have a dedicated format for that and
also<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.389> YouTube<00:02:55.750> which<00:02:55.930> has<00:02:56.079> a<00:02:56.109> slightly

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
also for YouTube which has a slightly

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.199 
also for YouTube which has a slightly
different<00:02:56.530> formatting<00:02:57.099> for<00:02:58.090> their

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
different formatting for their

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.539 
different formatting for their
transcoding<00:02:58.780> service<00:02:59.109> as<00:02:59.230> well<00:02:59.409> it's<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.430> good

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
transcoding service as well it's a good

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.339 
transcoding service as well it's a good
question<00:03:00.939> training's<00:03:01.419> very<00:03:01.689> hard<00:03:01.989> they're

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
question training's very hard they're

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.149 
question training's very hard they're
very<00:03:02.560> diverse<00:03:03.450> group<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.599> users<00:03:05.049> with<00:03:05.859> a

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
very diverse group of users with a

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.740 
very diverse group of users with a
diverse<00:03:06.579> set<00:03:06.849> of<00:03:06.879> skills<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:10.359> basic

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
diverse set of skills and so the basic

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.629 
diverse set of skills and so the basic
kind<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.159> requirement<00:03:12.159> is<00:03:12.219> that<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.430> don't

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
kind of requirement is that you don't

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.129 
kind of requirement is that you don't
have<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.909> understand<00:03:13.359> anything<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.989> can

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
have to understand anything that you can

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.649 
have to understand anything that you can
just<00:03:14.409> work<00:03:14.919> with<00:03:15.159> it<00:03:15.280> sometimes<00:03:16.239> that's

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
just work with it sometimes that's

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.390 
just work with it sometimes that's
tricky<00:03:17.019> from<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.349> user<00:03:17.530> experience<00:03:17.739> point<00:03:18.250> of

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
tricky from a user experience point of

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.280 
tricky from a user experience point of
view<00:03:18.519> because<00:03:18.760> we're<00:03:19.209> we're<00:03:19.840> dealing<00:03:20.139> with<00:03:20.169> a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
view because we're we're dealing with a

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.170 
view because we're we're dealing with a
spectrum<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:20.859> users<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:21.219> want<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.819> very

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
spectrum of users that want a very

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.229 
spectrum of users that want a very
sophisticated<00:03:22.540> solution<00:03:23.469> that<00:03:23.680> can<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:25.150> know

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
sophisticated solution that can you know

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.339 
sophisticated solution that can you know
have<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.359> lot<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.599> bells<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:25.900> whistles<00:03:25.989> they

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
have a lot of bells and whistles they

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.289 
have a lot of bells and whistles they
can<00:03:26.500> turn<00:03:26.680> on<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:26.980> off<00:03:27.040> as<00:03:27.579> they<00:03:27.819> want<00:03:28.060> and

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
can turn on and off as they want and

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.080 
can turn on and off as they want and
also<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:29.530> much<00:03:29.980> more<00:03:30.189> simplified<00:03:30.760> group<00:03:31.000> of

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
also a much more simplified group of

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.459 
also a much more simplified group of
users<00:03:31.419> that<00:03:31.449> don't<00:03:31.810> really<00:03:31.930> want<00:03:32.139> understand

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:32.469 
users that don't really want understand

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:33.750 
users that don't really want understand
anything<00:03:32.709> they<00:03:32.889> just<00:03:32.919> want<00:03:33.189> to<00:03:33.250> upload<00:03:33.609> their

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
anything they just want to upload their

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.999 
anything they just want to upload their
video<00:03:33.969> and<00:03:34.180> find<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.870> magically<00:03:35.290> appear<00:03:35.620> on<00:03:35.739> on

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:36.009 
video and find it magically appear on on

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:37.550 
video and find it magically appear on on
iTunes<00:03:36.489> for<00:03:36.639> example

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
iTunes for example

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.070 
iTunes for example
so<00:03:38.100> we've<00:03:38.760> done<00:03:38.940> quite<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.150> few<00:03:39.240> things<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.720> try

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
so we've done quite a few things to try

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.720 
so we've done quite a few things to try
and<00:03:40.760> make<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.910> work<00:03:42.260> we<00:03:43.260> provide<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:44.190> guess

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
and make that work we provide I guess

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.400 
and make that work we provide I guess
probably<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.630> biggest<00:03:45.900> innovation<00:03:46.319> in

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
probably the the biggest innovation in

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.400 
probably the the biggest innovation in
that<00:03:46.440> area<00:03:46.740> for<00:03:46.860> us<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.190> what<00:03:48.030> we<00:03:48.120> call<00:03:48.410> an

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
that area for us is what we call an

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.550 
that area for us is what we call an
upload<00:03:49.860> template<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.569> can<00:03:51.780> choose<00:03:52.110> from<00:03:52.410> a

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
upload template so you can choose from a

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.199 
upload template so you can choose from a
series<00:03:52.830> of<00:03:52.920> choices<00:03:53.069> one<00:03:53.610> which<00:03:53.790> might<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.180> a

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
series of choices one which might be a
