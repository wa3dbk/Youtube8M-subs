out<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.850> ship's<00:01:39.060> history<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.869> learn<00:01:40.170> all

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
out the ship's history and learn all

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
out the ship's history and learn all
about<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.560> conservation<00:01:40.860> work<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:42.030> being

about the conservation work and it being
a<00:01:42.329> temporary<00:01:42.689> structure<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.380> us<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
a temporary structure for us it was a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859 
a temporary structure for us it was a
real<00:01:44.070> opportunity<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:45.030> experiment<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
real opportunity to experiment with the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.350 
real opportunity to experiment with the
form<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.829> structure<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.579> play<00:01:48.240> around

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
form and the structure and play around

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.950 
form and the structure and play around
with<00:01:48.630> new<00:01:48.869> design<00:01:49.170> technology<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.689> worked

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
with new design technology so we worked

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.859 
with new design technology so we worked
in<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.290> parametric<00:01:52.680> software<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:54.000> build<00:01:54.600> an

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
in this parametric software to build an

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
in this parametric software to build an
intelligent<00:01:55.500> model<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> structure<00:01:56.369> we

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
intelligent model of the structure we

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.270 
intelligent model of the structure we
could<00:01:57.299> edit<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.840> underlying<00:01:58.469> geometry<00:01:58.770> of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
could edit the underlying geometry of

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.469 
could edit the underlying geometry of
the<00:01:59.700> thing<00:02:00.649> but<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> dependent<00:02:02.640> elements

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the thing but all the dependent elements

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.200 
the thing but all the dependent elements
would<00:02:03.659> update<00:02:03.899> giving<00:02:04.590> us<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.210> opportunity

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
would update giving us the opportunity

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:16.130 
would update giving us the opportunity
to<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.509> experiment<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.259> real<00:02:07.439> time

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.660 

NIC's<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.600> this<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:23.340> basic

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
NIC's so this is the the basic

controlling<00:02:59.160> those<00:02:59.280> variables<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.150> what

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
controlling those variables and what

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.050 
controlling those variables and what
kind<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.380> global<00:03:01.860> changes<00:03:02.370> they<00:03:02.550> would<00:03:02.760> create

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
kind of global changes they would create

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.699 
kind of global changes they would create
on<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.360> structure<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:07.290> we<00:03:07.410> work<00:03:07.560> quite

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
on the structure so we work quite

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.860 
on the structure so we work quite
closely<00:03:07.860> with<00:03:08.160> our<00:03:08.310> engineers<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.300> develop

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
closely with our engineers to develop

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.190 
closely with our engineers to develop
and<00:03:10.290> refine<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:11.239> satellite<00:03:12.239> curvature<00:03:13.019> of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
and refine this satellite curvature of

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.040 
and refine this satellite curvature of
the<00:03:13.320> roof<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:14.100> gives<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.580> rigidity<00:03:14.760> on<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
the roof that gives it rigidity on the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.110 
the roof that gives it rigidity on the
inside<00:03:16.500> we<00:03:16.709> have<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:17.010> be<00:03:17.130> quite<00:03:17.370> careful<00:03:17.640> to

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
inside we have to be quite careful to

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.720 
inside we have to be quite careful to
keep<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.780> space<00:03:19.440> free<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:19.950> obstructions<00:03:20.579> from

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
keep the space free of obstructions from

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.970 
keep the space free of obstructions from
the<00:03:21.180> cables<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.290> crisscross<00:03:22.500> overhead<00:03:27.980> so

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
the cables that crisscross overhead so

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.870 
the cables that crisscross overhead so
they're<00:03:29.130> one<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> best<00:03:29.579> things<00:03:29.820> about

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
they're one of the best things about

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.789 
they're one of the best things about
working<00:03:30.390> with<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.660> flexible<00:03:31.140> software<00:03:31.620> is

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
working with this flexible software is

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.520 
working with this flexible software is
that<00:03:31.829> late<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.579> game<00:03:32.730> we<00:03:33.390> our<00:03:33.720> budget<00:03:34.320> and

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
that late in the game we our budget and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.410 
that late in the game we our budget and
the<00:03:34.829> site<00:03:35.130> boundaries<00:03:35.579> were<00:03:35.760> suddenly<00:03:35.970> shrunk

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
the site boundaries were suddenly shrunk

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.470 
the site boundaries were suddenly shrunk
and<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:37.440> could<00:03:37.650> quickly<00:03:37.890> update<00:03:38.160> things<00:03:38.700> we

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
and we could quickly update things we

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.900 
and we could quickly update things we
also<00:03:39.630> use<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.709> model<00:03:41.040> for<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.430> structural

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
also use the model for the structural

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.810 
also use the model for the structural
finite<00:03:42.329> element<00:03:43.140> analysis<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.010> all<00:03:44.579> of<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
finite element analysis and all of the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.240 
finite element analysis and all of the
elements<00:03:44.910> were<00:03:45.570> digitally<00:03:46.290> prefabricated

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
elements were digitally prefabricated

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.830 
elements were digitally prefabricated
directly<00:03:47.670> from<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.970> model

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.270 

so<00:03:53.840> it's<00:03:53.990> basically<00:03:54.170> a<00:03:54.380> kit<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.590> parts<00:03:54.860> the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
so it's basically a kit of parts the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.840 
so it's basically a kit of parts the
squared<00:03:56.030> Timbers<00:03:56.840> are<00:03:57.140> all<00:03:57.380> CNC<00:03:58.310> cut<00:03:58.610> to

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
different angles and they're these

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.840

another the timber structure was erected

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.300 
another the timber structure was erected
in<00:04:16.489> only<00:04:17.120> about<00:04:17.299> three<00:04:17.630> days<00:04:17.950> fit<00:04:18.950> together

in only about three days fit together

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.810 
in only about three days fit together
much<00:04:19.549> like<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:19.820> children's<00:04:20.180> wooden<00:04:20.780> toy<00:04:21.019> the

much like a children's wooden toy the
the<00:04:22.820> structure<00:04:23.480> had<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.780> be<00:04:23.930> propped<00:04:24.410> up<00:04:24.590> in

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
the structure had to be propped up in

the structure had to be propped up in
place<00:04:25.010> before<00:04:25.340> all<00:04:25.640> the<00:04:25.760> big<00:04:26.000> cables<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:26.690> the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
place before all the big cables and the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:36.280 
place before all the big cables and the
fabric<00:04:27.680> tie<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:27.980> all<00:04:28.220> together<00:04:33.669> so<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:35.290> fabric

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
fabric tie it all together so the fabric

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.460 
fabric tie it all together so the fabric
canopy<00:04:37.130> was<00:04:37.400> digitally<00:04:38.300> tailored<00:04:38.720> in<00:04:38.990> one

ropes pulling it into position kind of

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.320 
ropes pulling it into position kind of
reminded<00:04:48.560> me<00:04:48.590> a<00:04:48.680> lot<00:04:48.919> of<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.340> sailors

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
reminded me a lot of the sailors
