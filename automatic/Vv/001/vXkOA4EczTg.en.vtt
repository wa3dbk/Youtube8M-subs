00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
making a Tron like figure which on like

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.560 
making a Tron like figure which on like
effects<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.769> here<00:00:14.700> we<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:15.000> clothes<00:00:15.299> we<00:00:15.540> have

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.760 
effects is here we have clothes we have
glowing<00:00:15.929> texture<00:00:16.910> and<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> mesh<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
glowing texture and we have a mesh the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.640 
glowing texture and we have a mesh the
next<00:00:20.039> thing<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.250> need<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.660> add<00:00:22.080> some

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
next thing we need to to do is add some

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.429 
next thing we need to to do is add some
armatures<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> sky<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.050> move<00:00:25.199> him

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
armatures to the sky so we can move him

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.620 
armatures to the sky so we can move him
armatures<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.340> bones<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.119> they

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
armatures are like bones and they

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.500 
armatures are like bones and they
manipulate<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.680> mesh<00:00:28.910> so<00:00:29.910> first<00:00:30.150> let's<00:00:30.330> set

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
manipulate the mesh so first let's set

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
manipulate the mesh so first let's set
up<00:00:30.539> our<00:00:30.720> screen<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.660> what<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
up our screen so what I like to do is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.200 
up our screen so what I like to do is
have<00:00:35.120> this<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.660> side<00:00:37.489> like<00:00:38.489> such<00:00:38.790> and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.569 
have this on the side like such and
we'll<00:00:39.329> change<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> perspective<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.579> this

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579

cursor right there in the pelvis which

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.850 
cursor right there in the pelvis which
is<00:01:18.270> right<00:01:18.420> where<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.500> now

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
we're going to add an armature we're

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.380 
we're going to add an armature we're
just<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> do<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> single<00:01:23.549> bone<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.119> have

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
just going to do a single bone they have

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.560 
just going to do a single bone they have
a<00:01:24.420> human<00:01:24.840> rig<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.130> mess<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.610> but

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
a human rig that you can mess with but

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
a human rig that you can mess with but
I'm<00:01:27.869> before<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> purpose<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.159> tutorial<00:01:29.460> I'm

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
I'm before the purpose of a tutorial I'm

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700 
I'm before the purpose of a tutorial I'm
going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.909> walk<00:01:30.030> through<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.420> whole<00:01:30.570> thing<00:01:30.780> so

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
going to walk through the whole thing so

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.730 
going to walk through the whole thing so
we<00:01:31.890> added<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.790> can't<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.540> and

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
we added it but you can't see it and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.100 
we added it but you can't see it and
that's<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:36.150> mesh<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> inside

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
that's because the mesh is on the inside

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.039 
that's because the mesh is on the inside
and<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.729> mean<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> archers<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> inside<00:01:40.020> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and I mean the archers on the inside of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.210 
and I mean the archers on the inside of
the<00:01:40.170> mesh<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.460> can't<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:43.159> how<00:01:44.159> can

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the mesh so we can't see it so how can

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.109 
the mesh so we can't see it so how can
we<00:01:44.820> fix<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.390> problem<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:47.009> go<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.790> select

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.270 
we fix this problem you go you select
the<00:01:48.240> armature<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.229> go<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:52.049> object<00:01:52.710> screen

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the armature you go to the object screen

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.490 
the armature you go to the object screen
and<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.820> go<00:01:54.149> down<00:01:54.329> here<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.630> display<00:01:55.170> and

by the way every time I extend I hit E

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.550 
by the way every time I extend I hit E
and<00:02:48.989> then<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.380> move<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.239> since<00:02:51.239> I'm<00:02:51.390> using<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
and then I move and since I'm using the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.050 
and then I move and since I'm using the
side<00:02:52.950> view<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.340> don't<00:02:53.579> have<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.790> worry<00:02:53.940> about

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
side view I don't have to worry about

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.850 
side view I don't have to worry about
X's<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.480> Y's<00:02:54.660> because<00:02:55.140> molar<00:02:55.380> working<00:02:55.739> with

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
X's and Y's because molar working with

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.240 
X's and Y's because molar working with
two<00:02:55.980> accesses<00:02:56.720> okay<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.319> do<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> jaw<00:02:58.890> so

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
two accesses okay so do the jaw so

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.369 
two accesses okay so do the jaw so
here's<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.640> here's<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> back<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.660> here's

the jaw now we want the dog to be down

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.930 
the jaw now we want the dog to be down
here<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:04.829> we<00:03:05.010> also<00:03:05.160> want<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.610> be<00:03:05.700> connected

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
here but we also want it to be connected

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.000 
here but we also want it to be connected
to<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.299> movement<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.870> head<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.890> we're

disconnect bone hit G to move it and

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.309 
disconnect bone hit G to move it and
then<00:03:15.060> align<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:16.560> gel<00:03:17.359> with<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.959> pivot<00:03:19.290> point

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
then align the gel with the pivot point

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:27.199 
then align the gel with the pivot point
of<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.250> jaw<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:23.579> head<00:03:24.680> now<00:03:25.680> let's<00:03:26.340> see<00:03:26.549> so

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
i end the video you can make the bones

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.599 
i end the video you can make the bones
look<00:03:42.959> like<00:03:42.989> whatever<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.530> want<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:44.400> make

them look like sticks I like to do this
during<00:03:46.380> animation<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.700> can<00:03:47.760> use<00:03:48.090> be<00:03:48.780> bodies

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
during animation you can use be bodies

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.909 
during animation you can use be bodies
or<00:03:49.440> envelope<00:03:50.370> since<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.239> don't<00:03:51.569> like<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.919> deform

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
or envelope since I don't like to deform

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.710 
or envelope since I don't like to deform
based<00:03:53.310> on<00:03:53.519> envelope<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.299> like<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.630> use

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
based on envelope I just like to use

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.830 
based on envelope I just like to use
vector<00:03:55.109> groups<00:03:56.150> I'm<00:03:57.150> going<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.359> go<00:03:57.450> be<00:03:57.630> body

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
vector groups I'm going to go be body

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.009 
vector groups I'm going to go be body
let<00:03:58.739> me<00:03:58.799> show<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.040> why<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.540> right<00:04:00.690> now<00:04:00.720> it's

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
let me show you why so right now it's

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.640 
let me show you why so right now it's
kind<00:04:01.079> of<00:04:01.290> not<00:04:01.799> really<00:04:01.829> useful<00:04:02.489> I'm<00:04:02.849> hit<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.989> so

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
kind of not really useful I'm hit a so

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.909 
kind of not really useful I'm hit a so
we<00:04:04.769> can<00:04:04.950> select<00:04:05.310> everything<00:04:05.730> hit<00:04:06.630> ctrl<00:04:06.810> alt<00:04:07.470> s

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
we can select everything hit ctrl alt s

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.020 
we can select everything hit ctrl alt s
and<00:04:09.919> scale<00:04:10.919> them<00:04:11.099> down<00:04:11.160> this<00:04:11.549> will<00:04:11.760> make<00:04:11.849> them

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
and scale them down this will make them

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.800 
and scale them down this will make them
thinner<00:04:12.510> if<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.980> just<00:04:14.250> hit<00:04:14.459> s<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:15.000> changes<00:04:15.599> the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
thinner if you just hit s it changes the

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.400 
thinner if you just hit s it changes the
entire<00:04:16.160> scale<00:04:17.160> but<00:04:17.820> if<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:17.970> do<00:04:18.090> ctrl<00:04:18.599> alt<00:04:18.870> s<00:04:19.049> it

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
entire scale but if you do ctrl alt s it

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.899 
entire scale but if you do ctrl alt s it
contains<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:21.180> changes<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.719> girth<00:04:21.959> of<00:04:22.909> the

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
contains the it changes the girth of the

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.450 
contains the it changes the girth of the
the<00:04:24.210> be<00:04:24.330> bodies

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
the be bodies

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.490 
the be bodies
so<00:04:25.819> hit<00:04:25.970> f3<00:04:26.120> let<00:04:26.569> me<00:04:26.690> hit<00:04:26.810> three<00:04:26.990> again<00:04:27.229> so<00:04:27.440> you

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
so hit f3 let me hit three again so you

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.350 
so hit f3 let me hit three again so you
can<00:04:27.650> get<00:04:27.770> aligned<00:04:28.069> let<00:04:28.850> me<00:04:28.940> show<00:04:29.090> you<00:04:29.150> one<00:04:29.330> of

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
can get aligned let me show you one of

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.210 
can get aligned let me show you one of
the<00:04:29.449> coolest<00:04:29.780> things<00:04:30.699> with<00:04:31.699> Peabody's<00:04:33.160> go<00:04:34.160> to

the coolest things with Peabody's go to

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.790 
the coolest things with Peabody's go to
the<00:04:35.090> bone<00:04:35.300> thing<00:04:36.259> over<00:04:36.470> here<00:04:36.500> on<00:04:36.680> your

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
the bone thing over here on your

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.570 
the bone thing over here on your
poverty's<00:04:37.099> panel<00:04:37.340> open<00:04:38.180> up<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.449> deform<00:04:38.900> and

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
poverty's panel open up the deform and

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.189 
poverty's panel open up the deform and
you'll<00:04:40.580> see<00:04:40.729> these<00:04:40.910> really<00:04:41.479> cool<00:04:41.660> attributes

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
you'll see these really cool attributes

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.110 
you'll see these really cool attributes
see<00:04:43.160> them<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.370> fact<00:04:43.639> we're<00:04:43.789> going<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:43.970> have<00:04:44.060> to

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
see them in fact we're going to have to

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.800 
see them in fact we're going to have to
go<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.270> pose<00:04:44.419> mode<00:04:44.979> so<00:04:45.979> we're<00:04:46.099> in<00:04:46.130> pose<00:04:46.340> mode

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
go to pose mode so we're in pose mode

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.110 
go to pose mode so we're in pose mode
we've<00:04:47.810> selected<00:04:47.990> our<00:04:48.319> bone<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:49.759> thing<00:04:49.970> that's

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
we've selected our bone the thing that's

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.430 
we've selected our bone the thing that's
interesting<00:04:50.270> about<00:04:50.539> a<00:04:50.690> spinal<00:04:51.050> column<00:04:51.349> and

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
interesting about a spinal column and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.409 
interesting about a spinal column and
it's<00:04:51.919> made<00:04:52.160> up<00:04:52.310> of<00:04:52.400> tons<00:04:52.729> of<00:04:53.000> little<00:04:53.210> bones

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
it's made up of tons of little bones

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.350 
it's made up of tons of little bones
that<00:04:54.410> all<00:04:54.620> Bend<00:04:55.009> and<00:04:55.310> what<00:04:55.759> we<00:04:55.880> have<00:04:56.060> here<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.330> a

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
that all Bend and what we have here is a

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.279 
that all Bend and what we have here is a
very<00:04:56.569> large<00:04:56.960> goal<00:04:58.539> so<00:04:59.539> by<00:04:59.750> adding<00:04:59.930> these

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
very large goal so by adding these

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.890 
very large goal so by adding these
segments<00:05:01.599> we<00:05:02.599> will<00:05:02.810> be<00:05:02.930> simulating<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:04.900> spinal

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
segments we will be simulating a spinal

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.999 
segments we will be simulating a spinal
column<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:11.419> head<00:05:11.570> doesn't<00:05:11.750> need<00:05:11.960> any<00:05:12.139> let<00:05:12.919> me

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
column the head doesn't need any let me

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.589 
column the head doesn't need any let me
show<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:13.190> why<00:05:13.400> this<00:05:13.460> is<00:05:13.759> cool<00:05:14.000> so<00:05:14.389> when<00:05:14.509> you

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
show you why this is cool so when you

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.129 
show you why this is cool so when you
move<00:05:14.949> said<00:05:15.949> one<00:05:16.160> more<00:05:16.539> when<00:05:17.539> you<00:05:17.630> move<00:05:17.870> the

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
move said one more when you move the

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:19.810 
move said one more when you move the
head<00:05:18.349> you'll<00:05:18.680> see<00:05:18.889> that<00:05:19.009> the<00:05:19.159> neck<00:05:19.520> also

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
head you'll see that the neck also

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.050 
head you'll see that the neck also
changes<00:05:21.039> when<00:05:22.039> you<00:05:22.099> move<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.430> neck<00:05:22.729> you'll

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
changes when you move the neck you'll

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.050 
changes when you move the neck you'll
see<00:05:23.270> that<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.599> back<00:05:23.870> also<00:05:24.259> changes<00:05:25.030> when<00:05:26.030> you

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
see that the back also changes when you

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.659 
see that the back also changes when you
move<00:05:26.270> this<00:05:26.539> you'll<00:05:26.870> see<00:05:27.050> if<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.289> waist

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
move this you'll see if the waist

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.839 
move this you'll see if the waist
changes<00:05:28.669> and<00:05:29.500> if<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:30.620> move<00:05:30.860> your<00:05:31.099> back<00:05:31.610> in

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
changes and if you move your back in

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.550 
changes and if you move your back in
real<00:05:32.000> life<00:05:32.210> you'll<00:05:32.479> notice<00:05:32.840> you<00:05:33.229> do<00:05:33.380> these

real life you'll notice you do these

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.879 
real life you'll notice you do these
things<00:05:34.419> when<00:05:35.419> you<00:05:35.539> go<00:05:35.659> to<00:05:35.720> edit<00:05:35.990> mode<00:05:36.169> it's

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
things when you go to edit mode it's

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.149 
things when you go to edit mode it's
really<00:05:37.460> just<00:05:37.759> this<00:05:38.090> so<00:05:39.020> simplify<00:05:39.620> is<00:05:39.680> your<00:05:39.979> mat
