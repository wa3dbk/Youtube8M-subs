 in a visit to the facilities of the 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.980
 Peruvian fishing technology institute 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.080
 itp the gladys production minister 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.660
 and showed him to the media 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.700
 the surimi of potash one of the many 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.890
 innovation research that 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.960
 performs said institute and of which said 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.880
 it is a raw material very appreciated by 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:36.290
 the international market for its extensive 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:38.000
 contrary to a way of elaborating their 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.410
 baseline of potaje has several 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.300
 Perfect windows to the shape 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.920
 conventional the first thing that allows you 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.720
 keep the proteins and I would ask you 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.559
 that it would come up to contribute my researcher 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.979
 please allow this to maintain the quality and 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.830
 the protein value of the boot but 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.540
 in addition to solados of the flavor and it gives him 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.280
 fernando the possibility of having a 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.519
 Surimi cover when a color 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.710
 very white that is a very raw material 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.570
 appreciated by the international market 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.180
 to make imitations of resources 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.170
 hydrobiological products here on the date 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.960
 I'm showing them I put everything on him 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.420
 imitation applications that can be 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.880
 make from his line of squid has been 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.040
 managed to elaborate with honey work 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 and the hunger that is part of the team that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.450
 destroyed this investigation that are for 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.049
 example shells of fan pulp of 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.170
 lobster crab lobster sausages 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.090
 mouth bed and other additional products 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.850
 which are in great demand in the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.009
 home market in the potash surimi 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.289
 options after submitting the resource to 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.450
 a successive washing process after the 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.909
 which manages to eliminate the strong odor and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.950
 the bitter taste that characterizes it for 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.869
 then be used in the preparation of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.670
 frozen products the owner of 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.009
 produces also noted that the support of 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.020
 private sector will be very important for 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.209
 develop and promote this type of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.020
 technology and its companies because it will give 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.810
 the pota a greater added value 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.850
 in 2008 the ITP initiates the procedures 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.950
 before the indecopi to obtain the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.599
 patent and it's now in November this 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.180
 year that indecopi formally communicates 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.349
 that the patent of invention requested 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.349
