and<00:00:45.070> it's<00:00:45.610> set<00:00:45.760> up<00:00:45.790> for<00:00:46.150> electric<00:00:46.570> or<00:00:46.780> you<00:00:46.990> can

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
and it's set up for electric or you can

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.900 
and it's set up for electric or you can
actually<00:00:47.530> put<00:00:47.860> a<00:00:47.890> gas<00:00:48.100> engine<00:00:48.340> in<00:00:48.579> it<00:00:48.730> though

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
actually put a gas engine in it though

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.930 
actually put a gas engine in it though
why<00:00:49.600> would<00:00:49.810> you<00:00:49.900> do<00:00:50.020> that<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.980> nice<00:00:51.190> big<00:00:51.520> open

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
why would you do that the nice big open

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.160 
why would you do that the nice big open
cockpit<00:00:52.150> area<00:00:52.540> it<00:00:52.660> would<00:00:52.750> actually<00:00:52.930> make<00:00:53.079> a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
cockpit area it would actually make a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.950 
cockpit area it would actually make a
great<00:00:53.530> platform<00:00:54.070> for<00:00:54.160> fpv<00:00:54.850> so<00:00:55.150> that<00:00:55.810> would<00:00:55.900> be

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
great platform for fpv so that would be

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.360 
great platform for fpv so that would be
a<00:00:55.989> cool<00:00:56.170> addition<00:00:56.350> comes<00:00:56.890> with<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.190> scale

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
a cool addition comes with the scale

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.569 
a cool addition comes with the scale

around<00:01:17.770> 6<00:01:18.610> kilograms<00:01:19.080> does<00:01:20.080> have<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.320> large

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
around 6 kilograms does have a large

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.530 
around 6 kilograms does have a large
large<00:01:21.040> wing<00:01:21.310> area<00:01:21.520> so<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:21.880> should<00:01:22.060> fly<00:01:22.299> nice

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
large wing area so it should fly nice

channel<00:01:29.140> control<00:01:29.470> so<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:29.740> won't<00:01:29.979> need

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
channel control so you won't need

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.969 
channel control so you won't need

as radio goes the wing is a two-piece
wing<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:36.130> you'll<00:01:36.280> need<00:01:36.400> to<00:01:36.909> standard<00:01:37.299> servos

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600

for<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:38.020> wing<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.409> then<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:38.830> standard<00:01:39.159> servos

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490

for<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:40.390> tail<00:01:40.720> sections<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:42.100> then<00:01:42.250> if<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.520> do

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
for the tail sections and then if you do

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.550 
for the tail sections and then if you do
choose<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:42.909> put<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.240> gas<00:01:43.450> engine<00:01:43.720> on<00:01:43.960> it<00:01:44.110> you

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
choose to put a gas engine on it you

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.880 
choose to put a gas engine on it you
will<00:01:44.680> need<00:01:44.860> about<00:01:45.040> a<00:01:45.189> 20<00:01:45.640> CC<00:01:46.380> engine<00:01:47.380> as<00:01:47.530> well

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
will need about a 20 CC engine as well

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.820 
will need about a 20 CC engine as well
as<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:48.130> throttle<00:01:48.729> servo<00:01:48.880> for<00:01:49.360> it<00:01:49.479> so<00:01:50.020> be<00:01:50.290> sure<00:01:50.650> to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
as a throttle servo for it so be sure to
