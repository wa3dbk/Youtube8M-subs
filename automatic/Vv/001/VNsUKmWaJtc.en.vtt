00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello it's rachel of the blog my little ones 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.779
 happiness to meet the demand 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.820
 of a reader I made today a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.679
 child model of white blue bracelet 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.900
 red I had introduced you in the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.610
 previous video and as I do not have any 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.300
 little child on hand I put them 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.350
 on the arm of donkey kong 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.090
 here I am going to show you how to do 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.939
 this bracelet that looks like the model 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.390
 adult whose I will give you the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.070
 details 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.740
 look at the difference in size between 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.189
 the version for the pope has an aversion 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.750
 for the little boy 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.210
 so this one has a flag 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.280
 much finer and narrower he 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.399
 will fit a thinner wrist 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.070
 children 2 to 5 years about you I 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.750
 shows right away how to do for 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.120
 this bracelet we will work as for 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.270
 the adult bracelet with the craft 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.610
 aligned it will of course be more marine 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.210
 white and red and a tie for 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.309
 close the bracelet all the way to the end 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.219
 between there will be the whole bracelet on the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.059
 one job before crocheting 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.809
 since it is much smaller than 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.020
 adult size 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.939
 we start with red, which is a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.580
 mesh of chains which aims a ca of 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.640
 attach to the flag then we take 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.950
 for the flag and put it on 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.350
 middle right under the red then we 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.080
 leave the maine picot under the red for 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.549
 go to the right 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.750
 we still make a line of blue with 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.289
 always 5 on the elastic underneath 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.000
 of the other two 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.520
 then we go to white and white 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.680
 as for the goal bracelet I'm going to the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.420
 put in double thickness with two 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.759
 elastic 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.409
 when there is only one white of 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:51.470
 this way it will stand out better ranked 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:55.329
 two white elastics on the line under 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:01.670
 the blues then to the places of red 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:05.709
 under the blanks then we lock up the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:10.970
 flag placing a red diagonally 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:14.180
 and a big game that joins the flag 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.269
 is over we continue with the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.860
 chain that will fix the 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.260
 wrist bracelet of the child and one 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.110
 take the order blue white red all 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.049
 simply for net purpose be matched 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.430
 in the colors of the flag 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.260
 I would like a genesis of this mesh 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.180
 I only have six locations 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.450
 so I'm just going to do the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.950
 seventh to seventh my last two 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.329
 bottom picot for this stitch 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.350
 I use an elastic always but I 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.350
 fold me in half 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.400
 we will now consolidated my skin 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.020
 crossing each line with the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.200
 assorted colors with elastic 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.320
 folded in half to make it tighter 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:12.310
 at the bottom I therefore place a red 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:14.830
 I forget and I pass them over to 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.700
 top I do the same with 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.760
 white first a first on this line 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.980
 I want more I want I check it 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.570
 is not so sure the two pico that does not 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.690
 did not save myself I do one thing at 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.690
 above 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.590
 and finally with blue that ends the 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.879
 last line 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.290
 I will now prepare the second 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.920
 young girl who follows the order of the colors 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.500
 the red white 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.379
 here we stop at the blues so we 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.549
 continues the second chain is with 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:58.040
 white on the left line then the 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.599
 red this chain is going to do 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.840
 also this mesh I need so 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:07.989
 this elastic game rests a following 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.799
 blue tongue to the cat 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.799
 to arrive at 5 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.709
 and even 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.709
 a blue and a white 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.479
 on this white will come just now 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.199
 fixed 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.889
 the red mesh of the flag everything is ready 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:36.020
 we can now go to the hook 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:40.389
 before crochet we can still put 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:46.639
 the task of the bracelet on the last my 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:52.340
 this way it's already ready yet expensive 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:56.090
 that chain up these 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.759
 bracelets more simple to do you 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.229
 know the technique in between a 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.229
 click we want to search the thread 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.169
 arrived here we have two red threads that 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:14.820
 happens on the same picot we start with 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.820
 the one above that is the one on the right 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.780
 unobstructed in man you can do at the same time 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.639
 time the one left to not 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.430
 forget it 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:30.510
 then we really have the right column 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:33.820
 by pushing double two elastics 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:38.620
 which is a little embarrassing is that they are there 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:44.200
 to tighten scoundrel functions for 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:46.960
 to release the films that are below 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.620
 go back all the blue match and we 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.780
 stop we go back down the column 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.780
 do the same thing to the left 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:09.590
 soon arrive at the blue mesh here is 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.290
 and this time we also take 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.960
 the red elastic to make it a 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:22.700
 mesh and we can pick up the flag 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.700
 and his first home m edge 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:36.560
 but already the task of one side I'm not 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.110
 the flag and its net bag are ready 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.470
 we will now put this mesh 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:49.550
 red down the second young is 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:53.120
 sure the white mesh is waiting for it and 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.660
 have all also crochet this 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.660
 second youth 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:22.449
 and in fact too scared is a rich and 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:28.139
 removed the round of web media brussels 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:28.139

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:40.439
 here is kissing the child sizes 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:40.949
 much smaller than the version 

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:44.629
 adult 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:44.629
