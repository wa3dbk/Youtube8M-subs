 Hi, girls, how are you doing? 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.789
 Welcome once again to space.com 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.759
 in this case I'm going to bring you another outfit 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.310
 very comfortable very for everyday but with a 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.689
 touch a little more daring more 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.570
 rocker more my style so good 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.149
 you can take ideas for I do not know what you know 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.040
 how to combine certain clothes more 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.840
 striking that right now you go 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.730
 to see and well then nothing that I hope that 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.590
 you like it, basically I'm going to tell you very 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.239
 quickie makeup I wear threw me 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.829
 a smoky brown because I thought 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.730
 that will contrast with my blue eyes 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.829
 look what I used, I'll find it 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.629
 here is the eye shadow the stick 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.640
 from kiko that you already know are long 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 This one does have this aspect and I 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.469
 he has applied it in number 04 as a basis 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.229
 and on top of that I put the shadow of marc on 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.489
 the tone or jan writer and then nothing 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.979
 it has illuminated me with a compact powder 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.229
 normal that I use the mineral as 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.359
 always mascara and then the 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.070
 water line so that contrast a bit 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.340
 and it's not so dark as to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.740
 let's say the day or for mid-afternoon you can 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.520
 used the chroma graphic pencil of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.720
 marc in tone nw 25 in that 30 already 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.240
 you know it's a beige tone 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.950
 a bone that is not excessively clear 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.900
 but it's not dark either, it's a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.480
 intermediate rib on the cheeks 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.900
 I wear the rouge madrid. 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.270
 you know that it is a warm tone very wearable 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.070
 is slightly matte satin is not 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.250
 everything but good that's very nice to the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.010
 seen and on the lips I wear a tender 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.380
 theme tom that went out for the collection 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.270
 from last summer that good comes to be 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.490
 as a moisturizer a lip balm 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.250
 with a gloss finish and I would say because 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.890
 has a glossy finish and what 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.180
 good is that it has 12 solar factor as well 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.320
 Good thing, they hydrate your lips 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.420
 has a little dot of color is 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.770
 practically transparent but good what 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.780
 I knew in other colors only that in this 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.570
 so I've put on this one that's like that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.700
 not quite natural healthy so that 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.860
 combine perfectly with my smoked in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.840
