00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
thought the button was broken because it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.630 
thought the button was broken because it
wasn't<00:01:06.750> working<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.409> I'll<00:01:08.340> show<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
and then push the button it works fine

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.289 
and then push the button it works fine
but<00:01:18.390> he<00:01:18.570> actually<00:01:19.049> uh<00:01:19.789> he<00:01:20.789> actually<00:01:20.909> didn't

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299

then we'll find the code well there it
is

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
is

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.300 
is
I<00:02:18.930> managed<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.290> find<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.680> didn't<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.160> take

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
I managed to find it didn't have to take

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.509 
I managed to find it didn't have to take
the<00:02:20.459> cover<00:02:20.670> off<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.269> had<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:22.190> push<00:02:23.190> up<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
the cover off I just had that push up a

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.140 
the cover off I just had that push up a
little<00:02:23.700> ways<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:25.579> don't<00:02:26.579> know<00:02:26.760> how<00:02:26.970> well

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
little ways and I don't know how well

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.309 
little ways and I don't know how well
you<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:27.900> see<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.440> I'll<00:02:28.620> see<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:29.930> shade<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.139> a

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
you can see that I'll see you shade it a

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.470 
you can see that I'll see you shade it a
little<00:02:31.650> bit<00:02:33.200> there<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.230> go<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.420> there's<00:02:36.420> a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
little bit there we go and there's a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.629 
little bit there we go and there's a
bottom<00:02:36.840> line<00:02:37.079> there<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:38.209> says<00:02:40.160> yeah<00:02:41.220> stand

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
bottom line there that says yeah stand

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.930 
bottom line there that says yeah stand
there<00:02:41.760> from<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.030> light<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:43.760> one<00:02:44.760> right

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
there from the light that one right

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.160 
there from the light that one right
there<00:02:45.209> enamel<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.500> go<00:02:46.739> over<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:48.150> eight<00:02:48.810> nine

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
there enamel and go over you eight nine

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.270 
there enamel and go over you eight nine
six<00:02:49.799> six

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
six six

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.890 
six six
so<00:02:51.269> that's<00:02:51.450> pink<00:02:51.750> OD<00:02:52.170> 9<00:02:52.410> 6<00:02:52.739> 6<00:02:53.510> which<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.690> believe

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
so that's pink OD 9 6 6 which I believe

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.800 
so that's pink OD 9 6 6 which I believe
is<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:55.109> light<00:02:55.920> blue<00:02:56.370> sapphire<00:02:57.000> metallic<00:02:57.599> or

is a light blue sapphire metallic or

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.710 
is a light blue sapphire metallic or
something<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.349> that<00:02:58.579> what<00:02:59.630> there's<00:03:00.630> another

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
something like that what there's another

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.589 
something like that what there's another
sticker<00:03:01.230> there<00:03:01.470> if<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.709> ever<00:03:02.209> if<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.419> door

sticker there if you ever if the door

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.330 
sticker there if you ever if the door
