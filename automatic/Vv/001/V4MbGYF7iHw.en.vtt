and the main goals are to get the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.460 
and the main goals are to get the
combustion<00:01:33.300> car<00:01:33.569> on<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:33.780> ground<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:34.110> fast<00:01:34.319> as

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
combustion car on the ground as fast as

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.559 
combustion car on the ground as fast as
we<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.459> get<00:01:35.580> as<00:01:35.700> much<00:01:35.910> testing<00:01:36.390> time

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
we can and to get as much testing time

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:37.910 
we can and to get as much testing time
on<00:01:36.720> last<00:01:36.929> year's<00:01:37.110> e<00:01:37.229> car<00:01:37.410> while<00:01:37.619> still

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
on last year's e car while still

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.919 
on last year's e car while still
developing<00:01:38.429> the<00:01:38.580> current<00:01:38.850> design<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.750> is

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
developing the current design this is

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.210 
developing the current design this is
really<00:01:40.140> important<00:01:40.470> because<00:01:40.500> last<00:01:40.920> year<00:01:41.130> we

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
really important because last year we

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.980 
really important because last year we
found<00:01:41.399> out<00:01:41.640> unfortunately<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.780> don't

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
found out unfortunately that you don't

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.389 
found out unfortunately that you don't
have<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> lot<00:01:43.289> of<00:01:43.319> testing<00:01:43.709> time<00:01:43.860> you're<00:01:44.310> not

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
have a lot of testing time you're not

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.889 
have a lot of testing time you're not
gonna<00:01:44.550> have<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> successful<00:01:44.910> run<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.569> earnest

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
gonna have a successful run in earnest

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.630 
gonna have a successful run in earnest
so<00:01:46.410> this<00:01:46.560> year<00:01:46.770> we're<00:01:46.920> all<00:01:47.039> about<00:01:47.280> getting<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
so this year we're all about getting the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
so this year we're all about getting the
cars<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> ground<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.390> fast<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.750> possible

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
cars on the ground as fast as possible

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
cars on the ground as fast as possible
and<00:01:49.410> it's<00:01:49.679> implementing<00:01:50.190> as<00:01:50.280> much<00:01:50.429> testing<00:01:50.849> as

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
and it's implementing as much testing as

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.789 
and it's implementing as much testing as
we<00:01:51.179> can

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
we can

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.120 
we can
driving<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:53.890> cars<00:01:54.100> are<00:01:54.399> really<00:01:54.820> exhilarating

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
driving the cars are really exhilarating

electric car components a lot of those

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.319 
electric car components a lot of those
are<00:03:35.680> very<00:03:35.859> expensive<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.700> at<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.910> same<00:03:37.090> time

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
the electric car is kind of where this

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.099 
the electric car is kind of where this

that<00:03:45.280> we<00:03:45.340> need<00:03:45.489> money<00:03:45.639> to<00:03:45.730> buy<00:03:45.940> for<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.180> car

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359

tires<00:03:46.810> we<00:03:47.230> go<00:03:47.380> through<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.650> lot<00:03:47.889> of<00:03:47.920> them<00:03:48.160> we<00:03:48.730> try

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
tires we go through a lot of them we try

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.000 
tires we go through a lot of them we try
not<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.269> burn<00:03:49.450> them<00:03:49.599> but<00:03:49.720> it's<00:03:49.900> kind<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.709> fun<00:03:50.889> to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
not to burn them but it's kind of fun to

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.860 
not to burn them but it's kind of fun to
go<00:03:51.160> fast<00:03:51.609> around<00:03:51.910> corners<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.329> every<00:03:52.630> once<00:03:52.810> in

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
go fast around corners and every once in

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.620 
go fast around corners and every once in
a<00:03:52.930> while<00:03:53.049> we<00:03:53.260> burn<00:03:53.859> through<00:03:54.130> some<00:03:54.340> rubber

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
a while we burn through some rubber

kind<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.900> fun<00:04:04.110> things<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.470> we<00:04:05.060> report<00:04:06.060> the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
kind of fun things that we report the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.460 
kind of fun things that we report the
coolest<00:04:06.660> prepping<00:04:06.960> on<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.110> team<00:04:07.260> is

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
coolest prepping on the team is

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.270 
coolest prepping on the team is
definitely<00:04:07.980> kind<00:04:08.070> of<00:04:08.220> seeing<00:04:10.280> everything

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
definitely kind of seeing everything

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.610 
definitely kind of seeing everything
especially<00:04:11.550> this<00:04:11.850> quarter<00:04:12.240> is<00:04:12.510> being<00:04:13.350> made<00:04:13.500> up

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
especially this quarter is being made up

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.980 
especially this quarter is being made up
once<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:14.100> know<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.550> a<00:04:14.820> lot<00:04:15.060> of<00:04:15.210> Fall<00:04:15.600> Quarter

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
once you know so a lot of Fall Quarter

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.449 
once you know so a lot of Fall Quarter
is<00:04:16.110> designing<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.890> I'm<00:04:16.950> putting<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.250> onto<00:04:17.340> a

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
is designing and I'm putting it onto a

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.070 
is designing and I'm putting it onto a
computer<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.090> saying<00:04:18.360> oh<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.660> know<00:04:18.930> this

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
computer and saying oh you know this

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.870 
computer and saying oh you know this
will<00:04:19.590> probably<00:04:19.770> work<00:04:19.920> according<00:04:20.580> to<00:04:20.640> these

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
will probably work according to these

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.270 
will probably work according to these
calculations<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:22.170> you<00:04:22.680> know<00:04:22.770> this<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.220> that

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
calculations and you know this and that

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.180 
calculations and you know this and that
simulation<00:04:24.000> but<00:04:24.620> it's<00:04:25.620> really<00:04:25.710> cool<00:04:25.950> to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
simulation but it's really cool to

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.030 
simulation but it's really cool to
actually<00:04:26.310> like<00:04:26.550> start<00:04:26.760> building<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.920> most<00:04:28.920> of

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
actually like start building it most of

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.670 
actually like start building it most of
school<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.880> sitting<00:04:30.270> in<00:04:30.360> class<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:30.900> writing

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
school is sitting in class and writing

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.220 
school is sitting in class and writing
down<00:04:31.800> on<00:04:31.890> paper<00:04:32.100> oh<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:33.030> is<00:04:33.240> how<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.050> would

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
down on paper oh this is how you would

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.990 
down on paper oh this is how you would
calculate<00:04:34.380> this<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:35.250> know<00:04:35.400> this<00:04:35.640> is<00:04:35.850> how

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
calculate this so you know this is how

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.350 
calculate this so you know this is how
this<00:04:36.180> would<00:04:36.390> act<00:04:36.570> under<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.960> situation<00:04:38.360> but

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
this would act under the situation but

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.360 
this would act under the situation but
definitely<00:04:40.140> I've<00:04:40.350> learned<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.740> lot<00:04:40.770> more<00:04:40.950> in

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
definitely I've learned a lot more in

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.860 
definitely I've learned a lot more in
these<00:04:41.520> past<00:04:41.760> couple<00:04:41.940> months<00:04:42.090> of<00:04:42.480> putting<00:04:42.780> my

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
these past couple months of putting my

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.290 
these past couple months of putting my
hands<00:04:43.170> on<00:04:43.290> things<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.120> seeing<00:04:45.120> how<00:04:45.210> they

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
hands on things and seeing how they

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.050 
hands on things and seeing how they
actually<00:04:45.660> worked<00:04:45.840> out<00:04:45.930> from<00:04:46.140> real<00:04:46.260> life<00:04:47.060> has

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
actually worked out from real life has

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.010 
actually worked out from real life has
definitely<00:04:48.360> been<00:04:48.450> probably<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.870> most

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
definitely been probably the most

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.470 
definitely been probably the most
beneficial<00:04:49.380> part<00:04:49.920> of<00:04:50.010> college<00:04:50.400> so<00:04:50.700> far<00:04:50.910> I<00:04:51.240> mean

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
beneficial part of college so far I mean

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.300 
beneficial part of college so far I mean
the<00:04:51.720> coolest<00:04:52.080> part<00:04:52.320> about<00:04:52.410> this<00:04:52.560> team<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.130> me

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
the coolest part about this team to me

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.550 
the coolest part about this team to me
is<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:54.240> opportunities<00:04:54.930> that<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.230> gives<00:04:55.410> the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
is the opportunities that it gives the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.830 
is the opportunities that it gives the
members<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.520> people<00:04:56.850> that<00:04:57.060> put<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:57.510> all<00:04:57.780> of

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
members the people that put in all of

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.170 
members the people that put in all of
the<00:04:58.140> hours<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.740> learn<00:04:59.040> from<00:04:59.490> this<00:04:59.700> amazing

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
the hours and learn from this amazing

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.810 
the hours and learn from this amazing
experience<00:05:00.770> ultimately<00:05:01.770> get<00:05:02.100> opportunities

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
experience ultimately get opportunities

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.240 
experience ultimately get opportunities
to<00:05:02.850> progress<00:05:03.810> as<00:05:04.080> engineers<00:05:04.530> later<00:05:04.800> on<00:05:05.010> by

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
to progress as engineers later on by

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.510 
to progress as engineers later on by
getting<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.730> very<00:05:05.940> cool<00:05:06.210> jobs<00:05:06.540> you<00:05:06.990> know

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
getting the very cool jobs you know

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.400 
getting the very cool jobs you know
everybody<00:05:08.520> has<00:05:08.760> kind<00:05:09.360> of<00:05:09.510> their<00:05:09.720> own<00:05:09.900> idea<00:05:10.290> of

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
everybody has kind of their own idea of

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.910 
everybody has kind of their own idea of
what<00:05:10.590> these<00:05:10.770> very<00:05:11.100> cool<00:05:11.400> jobs<00:05:11.760> are<00:05:12.200> but<00:05:13.200> jobs

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
what these very cool jobs are but jobs

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.750 
what these very cool jobs are but jobs
in<00:05:14.310> companies<00:05:15.000> where<00:05:15.920> there's<00:05:16.920> continued

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
in companies where there's continued

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.700 
in companies where there's continued
innovation<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.690> you<00:05:18.870> know<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.050> can<00:05:19.290> think<00:05:19.470> of

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
innovation and you know you can think of

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.340 
innovation and you know you can think of
Boeing<00:05:20.640> you<00:05:20.850> can<00:05:21.030> think<00:05:21.210> of<00:05:21.300> SpaceX<00:05:21.900> you<00:05:22.230> can

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
Boeing you can think of SpaceX you can

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.190 
Boeing you can think of SpaceX you can
think<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.650> Tesla<00:05:23.360> all<00:05:24.360> of<00:05:24.600> these<00:05:24.720> companies

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
think of Tesla all of these companies

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.020 
think of Tesla all of these companies
you<00:05:25.620> know<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.980> know<00:05:26.280> people<00:05:26.580> that<00:05:26.850> work<00:05:27.000> there

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
you know I know people that work there

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.330 
you know I know people that work there
and<00:05:27.470> I'm<00:05:28.470> sure<00:05:28.740> they<00:05:28.890> would<00:05:28.980> say<00:05:29.100> the<00:05:29.220> same

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
and I'm sure they would say the same

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.840 
and I'm sure they would say the same
thing<00:05:29.400> is<00:05:29.730> because<00:05:30.000> they<00:05:30.180> were<00:05:30.240> on<00:05:30.450> this<00:05:30.630> team
