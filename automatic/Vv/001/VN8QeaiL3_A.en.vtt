is<00:00:29.310> appearance<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.570> my<00:00:30.869> theory<00:00:31.140> acts<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.710> a

is appearance now my theory acts as a

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.560 
is appearance now my theory acts as a
bridge<00:00:32.250> from<00:00:32.580> that<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.150> have<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.330> bear

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
bridge from that and you have to bear

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.810 
bridge from that and you have to bear
with<00:00:33.600> me<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.199> it<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.620> indeed<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.220> radical

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
with me because it is indeed a radical

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.020 
with me because it is indeed a radical
my<00:00:36.540> theory<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.230> Riku<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.010> housing<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
my theory is that Riku is housing the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.710 
my theory is that Riku is housing the
heart<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:40.140> piece<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.430> vanities<00:00:42.030> within

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
heart or a piece of a vanities within

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.770 
heart or a piece of a vanities within
himself<00:00:43.010> just<00:00:44.010> think<00:00:44.280> about<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.760> Ventus<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
himself just think about it Ventus and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.799 
himself just think about it Ventus and
Riku<00:00:46.290> both<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:47.010> many<00:00:47.460> extreme<00:00:48.090> similarities

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
Riku both have many extreme similarities

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.680 
Riku both have many extreme similarities
but<00:00:49.440> let<00:00:49.800> me<00:00:49.920> break<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.309> down<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.120> it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
but let me break it down for you so it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.630 
but let me break it down for you so it
will<00:00:51.870> start<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> make<00:00:52.380> sense<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.920> I'll<00:00:53.190> also

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
will start to make sense and I'll also

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520 
will start to make sense and I'll also
address<00:00:54.000> some<00:00:54.030> clashing<00:00:54.960> facts<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
address some clashing facts with the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.100 
address some clashing facts with the
theory<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.550> let's<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.420> into<00:00:57.809> it

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
theory so let's get into it

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.150 
theory so let's get into it
as<00:00:59.300> most<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.600> should<00:01:00.630> know<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.380> the<00:01:01.739> end<00:01:01.950> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
as most of you should know at the end of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.729 
as most of you should know at the end of
birth<00:01:02.399> by<00:01:02.579> Sleep<00:01:02.969> Ventus<00:01:03.719> defeated<00:01:04.229> mantis

birth by Sleep Ventus defeated mantis

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.249 
birth by Sleep Ventus defeated mantis
and<00:01:04.890> destroyed<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> Keyblade<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:07.080> should

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
and destroyed the Keyblade this should

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.249 
and destroyed the Keyblade this should
have<00:01:07.350> marked<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.770> Vanity's<00:01:08.250> demise<00:01:08.640> yes<00:01:09.479> well

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
have marked a Vanity's demise yes well

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.070 
have marked a Vanity's demise yes well
actually<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:11.100> shown<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.940> both<00:01:12.300> Ventus<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
actually is shown that both Ventus and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.219 
actually is shown that both Ventus and
manages<00:01:13.740> both<00:01:14.220> faded<00:01:15.000> into<00:01:15.150> light<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> later

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
manages both faded into light and later

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.050 
manages both faded into light and later
it's<00:01:16.500> revealed<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.950> ventus's<00:01:17.490> heart<00:01:17.610> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
it's revealed that ventus's heart is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.750 
it's revealed that ventus's heart is
once<00:01:18.510> again<00:01:18.630> damaged<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.590> he<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:20.070> alive<00:01:20.430> so

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
once again damaged but he was alive so

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.539 
once again damaged but he was alive so
one<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.810> assume<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.170> vanishes<00:01:22.830> could<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.490> in

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
one can assume that vanishes could be in

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.490 
one can assume that vanishes could be in
the<00:01:23.640> same<00:01:23.880> boat<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.330> hinted<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.020> dream<00:01:25.200> Drop

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the same boat as hinted in dream Drop

the same boat as hinted in dream Drop
Distance<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:26.340> Ventus<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.970> alive<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.900> some

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
be hurting and to open his heart to try

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.609 
be hurting and to open his heart to try
and<00:01:36.900> help<00:01:37.110> them

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and help them

and help them
perhaps<00:01:38.250> Riku<00:01:38.760> was<00:01:38.909> talking<00:01:39.330> from<00:01:39.450> experience

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
perhaps Riku was talking from experience

perhaps Riku was talking from experience
my<00:01:41.009> theory<00:01:41.340> suggests<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.060> after<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.630> Ventus

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
my theory suggests that after of Ventus

my theory suggests that after of Ventus

but<00:05:20.590> what<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:21.220> know<00:05:21.340> something<00:05:21.820> may<00:05:21.910> be<00:05:21.940> going

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
but what you know something may be going

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.450 
but what you know something may be going
on<00:05:22.450> but<00:05:22.630> nevertheless<00:05:22.900> this<00:05:23.740> is<00:05:23.800> my<00:05:24.130> theory

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
on but nevertheless this is my theory

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.700 
on but nevertheless this is my theory
and<00:05:24.760> regardless<00:05:25.360> I<00:05:25.480> believe<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:26.050> Ventus<00:05:26.530> and

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
and regardless I believe that Ventus and

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.440 
and regardless I believe that Ventus and
Riku<00:05:27.070> are<00:05:27.280> connected<00:05:27.970> someway<00:05:28.750> somehow<00:05:30.240> so<00:05:31.240> as

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
Riku are connected someway somehow so as

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.370 
Riku are connected someway somehow so as
