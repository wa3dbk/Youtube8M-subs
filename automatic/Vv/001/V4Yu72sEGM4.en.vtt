00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.190
 hello friends with you tiberian 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.740
 and this is the 61st edition heading master for all 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.960
 tanks heading in which i get a mark 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.109
 klassnost master on technique name 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.220
 which you specify in the comments 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.680
 today in the program we have again 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.750
 unhurried armored vehicles on this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.480
 times British production namely 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.669
 at-7 Fri-shka seventh level precisely for 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.399
 she was voted by most viewers 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.230
 honestly hoped that you finally 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.300
 do select block principle because i 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.460
 for a long time I want to go on it but 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.050
 voting won and therefore at-7 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.300
 I had to ride it and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.910
 burn another batch of chairs for 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.680
 thank you very much well let's 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.530
 let's start studying our today's 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.079
 heroine as I said at the beginning of the Fri-shka 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.760
 unhurried but very dynamic 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.100
 twenty kilometers per hour she is gaining 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.199
 fast and can support them so 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.879
 five minutes after the start of the battle you 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.280
 probably those will get to the hill on 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.920
 robin really with mobility 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.350
 of this unit, I reconciled immediately well 20 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.510
 kilometers per hour and 20 thanks for not 13 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.860
 turned on the autopilot and let yourself crawling 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.330
 over and at this time in chat 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.729
 write a joke 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.890
 but with what I could not accept it 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.619
 which basically caused the fires so it 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.600
 the combination of booking and instrument of this 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.390
 british rhymes to start tell 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.100
 about booking here honestly guys i 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.960
 I love armored tanks 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.540
 which you can really talk 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.670
 Well, for example, the mouse you are driving yourself 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.680
 city map you go Fri-shka 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.900
 Level 10 you expose the diamond 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.030
 turn in the tower at all shoots not 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.100
 punches to leave those golds you 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.100
 shoot also not punch and you are so 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.439
 standing bargain is put up with this rad 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.460
 you will be cool we really often 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.380
 happens only in a dream 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.649
 but still armored tanks it 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.930
 cool but among the great variety 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.240
 armored tanks our game has 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.460
 such which I never understood well 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.810
 for example at-7 she is all of herself 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.820
 armored 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.619
 at 203 millimeters for the seventh level 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.050
 what google what armor 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.700
 That is, in theory, this Fri-shka should 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.040
 update well or protect some 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.319
 direction due to your armor crawling 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.330
 you imagine leisurely 20 kilometers per hour 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.910
 arrows you watch and the opponent starts 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.920
 vytselivat dovorachivat body increase 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.900
 receiving armor you do not shoot 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.870
 pierce you shoot back and crawl 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.730
 further but often with these types 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.340
 armored tanks have a problem 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.380
 it is usually somewhere above, and 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.690
 called commander turret 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.760
 and in this case when you play on 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.560
 that 7 with this commander turret you 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.150
 you can't do anything because it's not 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.340
 bottom armor sheet that can be hidden 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.220
 for relief or for any of us broadcast 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.260
 this is not a commander for example 75 left 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.019
 sides that can be hidden around the corner 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.849
 British support buildings this is a bucket 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.470
 is just centered and she 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.660
 so cool and that when you only 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.280
 you start to creep out of the mound you already 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.730
 you shine and the enemy flies at you 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.739
 shells 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.720
 because the commander's turret transmits 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.940
 hello everyone and trust me not to get there 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.890
 it is very difficult even from 300 meters 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.590
 any slanted soviet tank 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.959
 even kv-2 shaytan ki managed somehow 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.180
 charge in this bucket grandmother we honestly 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.940
 I will say at this moment I am a little bit 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.769
 upset in the rest yes under the cabinet 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.959
 very well armored for your 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.359
 level classmates in the forehead often not 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.150
 punch but also the side sometimes keeps hitting 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.950
 And now I would like to say a few words about 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.380
 guns generally speaking when i first 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.450
 I saw his characteristics thought damn 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.150
 Yes, she's a great breakthrough 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.040
 armor-piercing shell 226 millimeters 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.739
 one-time damage, though small 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.239
 230 but the gun is very high 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.440
 firing rate of lemon 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.780
 recharged for five and a half 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.239
 seconds and with all that he has 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.340
 chic accuracy of 031 by 100 meters and 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.290
 comfortable time information i'm honest 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.239
 speaking of very surprised by such parameters 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.970
 We already after the first battle understood in what 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.889
 the catch is firstly I personally have the accuracy 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.139
 when i shot without full details 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.420
 shells flew anywhere just not in 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.420
 enemy tank but okay here I am 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.160
 probably guilty 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.890
 but it is necessary to be reduced to the end but still 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.720
 It is an unpleasant sensation in the second 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.610
 what I didn't like the most so far 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.620
 played this birdie this is the angle 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.709
 not only vertical but also 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.139
 horizontal implement is in the right 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.150
 parts of the hull therefore at-7 reminds 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.100
 I have such a knight with a spear in the tournament 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.980
 who on horseback you-so you-so 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.260
 and spear of all spear in our case 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.090
 is also very good at the enemy but 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.220
 to keep track of him will have to constantly 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.350
 turn the body if left gun 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.780
 at least somehow turns right to 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.540
 vertical corners don't want to do this 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.740
 pickups are also not happy minus 5 and plus 7 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.590
 that is, you will not be able to 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.150
 shoot neither down nor up in the end 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.550
 it turns out that the gun is capable 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.650
 realize the full potential of the gun only 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.630
 in the event that shoots at the enemy 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.430
 straight ahead if the opponent 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.850
 moves you have to constantly 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.889
 turn the case around and reassemble 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.260
 So it turns out the guns are good but with 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.360
 reservations reservation is not particularly saves and 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.280
 benefits we are at a speed of 20 kilometers in 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.080
 hour that is, as you know, so that 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.660
 I had to get a master 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.280
 make some effort and 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.039
 experience for achivki need to earn 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.960
 decent about 1300 clean for 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.300
 level seven is very high 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.130
 figure at the beginning I even tried 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.050
 I thought I would move the tank 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.060
 back and forth to stop aiming 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.430
 Commander q and I will fire on 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.930
 opponents but if the sixth is fast to me 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.850
 explained what is the number I have not 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.660
 give me a ride and therefore I am already crit 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.810
 took care 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.300
 Well, not really forward here and insolent surprise 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.979
 Aksa T7 general conversation short two three 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.110
 shots somewhere in silhouette and you 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.060
 go to the hangar in this case 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.700
 being at the bottom of the list you need to play 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.200
 clean ptshku become postrelivat benefit 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.630
 nines you can easily punch 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.850
 even bebashkami and try to put as 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.580
 can be more damage and suddenly give the master 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.770
 but for some reason I could not play 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.080
 in the gun probably all the fault of the awl in one 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.419
 place I can not stand no need to go 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.760
 forward tank commander and 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.130
 so I suffered as many as twenty three fights 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.800
 until you hit the robin in the top and not 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.960
 started playing for for in general with a stretch 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.970
 this way can be called normal 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.500
 if you can stand in the bushes then 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.190
 be able to put a decent amount 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.150
 damage 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.010
 but if you 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.630
 as I am an amateur with forward then you 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.670
 necessarily pat by commander 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.190
 the turret so think carefully 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.250
 do you need this and be with you 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.500
 master on this for today all all 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.510
