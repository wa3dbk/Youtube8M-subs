 change in life even if it changed course 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.090
 of one's own destiny facing 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.190

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.640
 decided to take action to lose weight 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.530
 lucas has always been vain but now 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.920
 special is that in just eight months 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.149
 He slimmed 50 pounds off the dummy. 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.789
 54 to 40 hours Ã³ the size of this 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.129
 shorts he used to use the boy 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.510
 that everything started in February of 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.820
 2014 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.890
 after not having renewed the contract 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.079
 company that worked because of the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.370
 overweight he saw that it was time to do 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 something 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.409
 I realized that if I had a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.240
 under I had a better body I 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.170
 I'm sure this could have me 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.650
 helped 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.390

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.340

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.560
 decision was accompanied by a series of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.170
 changes and the whole family went into 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.380
 war against the scales mother of lucas 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.290
 became the main supporter 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.210
 modifying all the routine of the house here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.390
 especially in the kitchen, right? 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.520
 we started to adopt a diet 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.990
 healthy and balanced diet with 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.600
 nutritionist is and today everything is different 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.659
 in a short time the results began to 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.850
 appear in the first three months lucas 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.600
 shorter and he's unhappy 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.969
 today seeing the before and after the young man 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.280

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.590

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.300
 large is motivated to keep weight 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.830
 let me go back where I was 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.380
 Lucas says he did not practice 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.320
 and I've never been a fan of 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.510
 The gym he saw in swimming a way 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.700
 more enjoyable to lose weight 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.650
 lucas has already reached the ideal weight and now 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.840
 continues with the exercise routine 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.970

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.320

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.020
 week he comes to this club 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.150
 divinÃ³polis and spend at least an hour 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.280
 a routine that was mandatory and now 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.220
 see lucas pleasure is one of the most 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.190
 applied nor does the boy seem to 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.290
 Last year he barely left the house and he knows 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.580
 that if it were not for the changes in life and 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.050
 on the scale could have had diabetes 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.260
 today the power is with the most cholesterol 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.020
 How high is this heart problem, my son? 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.750
 born again where you do not have another 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.420

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.990

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.770
 life 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.870
