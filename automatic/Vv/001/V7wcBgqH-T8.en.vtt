glaze<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.579> her<00:01:50.700> wash<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.420> um<00:01:52.130> yeah<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> had<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
glaze of her wash and um yeah so I had a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.490 
glaze of her wash and um yeah so I had a
couple<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.500> them<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.979> stuff<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.670> I

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
couple of them and stuff like that I

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
couple of them and stuff like that I
found<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:58.979> great<00:01:59.240> alternative<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
found this really great alternative to a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.230 
found this really great alternative to a
foundation<00:02:00.960> brush<00:02:01.469> also<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.549> doesn't<00:02:03.149> really

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
foundation brush also it doesn't really

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.029 
foundation brush also it doesn't really
look<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:04.200> foundation<00:02:04.860> brush<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:06.570> much

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
look like a foundation brush that much

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.550 
look like a foundation brush that much
because<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> shape<00:02:08.599> you<00:02:09.599> know<00:02:09.750> compared

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
because of the shape you know compared

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.949 
because of the shape you know compared
it's<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.550> same<00:02:11.730> shape

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
it's not the same shape

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.149 
it's not the same shape
and<00:02:13.049> stuff<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:15.200> would<00:02:16.200> still<00:02:16.530> use<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.859> as
