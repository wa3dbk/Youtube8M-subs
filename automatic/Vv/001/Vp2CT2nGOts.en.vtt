00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.320 
know stable that'll be cool red white
and<00:02:40.890> blue<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.100> given<00:02:41.730> us<00:02:41.850> so<00:02:42.030> now<00:02:42.120> we're<00:02:42.239> gonna

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
and blue and given us so now we're gonna

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.729 
and blue and given us so now we're gonna
give<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.630> one<00:02:42.780> more<00:02:42.870> try<00:02:45.290> yeah<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.530> Mike

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739

again<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.370> we<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:47.970> put<00:02:48.390> out<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.540> four<00:02:48.959> cell

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
again and we just put out a four cell

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.560 
again and we just put out a four cell
we're<00:02:50.100> basically<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.700> shoot<00:02:50.940> up<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.390> do

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
we're basically going to shoot up and do

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.940 
we're basically going to shoot up and do
a<00:02:51.630> couple<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.050> tricks<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.470> know<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.769> going<00:02:52.890> to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
a couple of tricks I know it's going to

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.650 
a couple of tricks I know it's going to
come<00:02:53.190> down<00:02:53.250> something's<00:02:54.030> going<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.269> collapse

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
come down something's going to collapse

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.140 
come down something's going to collapse
so<00:02:55.019> we<00:02:55.830> hopefully<00:02:56.010> catch<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.610> on<00:02:56.700> video

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
so we hopefully catch it on video

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:07.570 
so we hopefully catch it on video
I<00:02:57.180> see<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.450> wings<00:02:57.920> eating<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.010> wings<00:02:59.160> yeah
