so<00:00:06.180> we're<00:00:06.299> back<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.720> ice<00:00:06.859> it's<00:00:07.859> August

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
so we're back in the ice it's August

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.699 
so we're back in the ice it's August
12th<00:00:09.559> about<00:00:10.559> 8<00:00:10.680> o'clock<00:00:10.709> in<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.129> morning<00:00:11.459> and

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:12.709 
12th about 8 o'clock in the morning and

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.769 
12th about 8 o'clock in the morning and
we're<00:00:13.709> in<00:00:13.799> Simpson<00:00:14.190> Bay<00:00:14.369> on<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.180> south<00:00:15.330> side

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:15.779 
we're in Simpson Bay on the south side

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:20.480 
we're in Simpson Bay on the south side
south<00:00:16.350> coast<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.770> Victoria<00:00:17.160> Island<00:00:18.080> it's<00:00:19.490> we

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
south coast to Victoria Island it's we

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.339 
south coast to Victoria Island it's we
thought<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.820> had<00:00:20.910> cheated<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.869> ice<00:00:22.050> we

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
thought we had cheated this this ice we

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.339 
thought we had cheated this this ice we
thought<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.619> got<00:00:22.650> around<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:24.079> it<00:00:25.079> doesn't

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
thought we got around it but it doesn't

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.560 
thought we got around it but it doesn't
look<00:00:25.470> like<00:00:25.499> we<00:00:25.740> did<00:00:25.919> you<00:00:26.910> never<00:00:27.089> know<00:00:27.240> how<00:00:27.390> much

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
look like we did you never know how much

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.480 
look like we did you never know how much
to<00:00:27.749> change<00:00:27.929> your<00:00:28.169> course<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.890> get<00:00:29.039> around<00:00:29.279> it

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
to change your course to get around it

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.630 
to change your course to get around it
because<00:00:30.650> there<00:00:31.650> could<00:00:31.829> just<00:00:31.859> as<00:00:32.070> well<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.310> more

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
because there could just as well be more

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.830 
because there could just as well be more
ice<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.120> way<00:00:33.210> you're<00:00:33.360> going

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
ice the way you're going

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380 
ice the way you're going
so<00:00:34.079> sometimes<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.130> best<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.820> stay<00:00:36.150> on

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
so sometimes it's best just to stay on

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.000 
so sometimes it's best just to stay on
course<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.050> pick<00:00:37.200> your<00:00:37.350> way<00:00:37.440> through<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.739> and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
course and pick your way through it and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.549 
course and pick your way through it and
I<00:00:38.370> think<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:38.609> what<00:00:38.820> we're<00:00:38.969> gonna<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.270> here

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
I think that's what we're gonna do here

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.720 
I think that's what we're gonna do here
when<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.800> hit<00:00:40.949> the<00:00:41.070> ice<00:00:41.190> there's<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> bit<00:00:41.699> of

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
when you do hit the ice there's a bit of

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
when you do hit the ice there's a bit of
a<00:00:41.850> crunching<00:00:42.270> sound<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.949> not<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> very

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
a crunching sound and it's not a very

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.069 
a crunching sound and it's not a very
pleasant<00:00:44.579> sound<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.690> not<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> boat

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
pleasant sound it's not the boat

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.680 
pleasant sound it's not the boat
crunching<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.739> ice<00:00:46.969> but<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.300> tends<00:00:48.570> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
crunching it's the ice but it tends to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.049 
crunching it's the ice but it tends to
bring<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.019> crew<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.440> pretty<00:00:49.710> quickly<00:00:50.059> from

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
bring the crew up pretty quickly from

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.130 
bring the crew up pretty quickly from
down<00:00:51.300> below<00:00:51.510> I'm<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.710> doing<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.550> quick<00:00:54.140> climb

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
down below I'm just doing a quick climb

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.549 
down below I'm just doing a quick climb
to<00:00:55.920> take<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> look<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.539> wrong<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
to take a look at what is wrong see the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.189 
to take a look at what is wrong see the
ice<00:00:58.679> get<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.429> a<00:00:59.460> an<00:01:00.059> overview<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.660> idea<00:01:00.989> of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
ice get a get a an overview and idea of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.090 
ice get a get a an overview and idea of
how<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> get<00:01:02.399> through<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:02.760> round<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:04.040> what<00:01:05.040> do

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
how to get through all round and what do

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.930 
how to get through all round and what do
you<00:01:05.129> take<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
you take up with you

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.530 
you take up with you
oh<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:09.180> mean<00:01:10.070> put<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> harness<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:12.360> easy

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
oh I mean put on the harness it's easy

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.260 
oh I mean put on the harness it's easy
to<00:01:12.780> climb<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.439> difficult<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:15.090> go

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
to climb but it's difficult to to go

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.149 
to climb but it's difficult to to go
down<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.049> know<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.560> goes<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.130> must

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
down and as we know what goes up must

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:26.149 
down and as we know what goes up must
come<00:01:17.430> down

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.889 

okay<00:01:27.159> so<00:01:27.549> directly<00:01:27.939> ahead<00:01:28.119> from<00:01:28.570> how<00:01:28.689> we're

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
okay so directly ahead from how we're

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:36.520 
okay so directly ahead from how we're
pointing<00:01:29.320> now

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.440 

to<00:01:37.530> stay<00:01:37.770> inshore<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> we've<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:41.880> got<00:01:42.060> hunts

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to stay inshore so we've just got hunts

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.800 
to stay inshore so we've just got hunts
up<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> mast<00:01:44.210> because<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.270> can't<00:01:45.509> see<00:01:45.659> where

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
up the mast because we can't see where

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.680 
up the mast because we can't see where
we<00:01:45.960> need<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.290> from<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.509> it<00:01:48.509> looks

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
we need to go from here and it looks

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.969 
we need to go from here and it looks
like<00:01:48.840> we'll<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.080> go<00:01:49.200> inshore<00:01:49.619> more

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
like we'll have to go inshore more

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.380 
like we'll have to go inshore more
change<00:01:50.729> course<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.270> get<00:01:52.200> around<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:53.390> what

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
change course to get around this what

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.260 
change course to get around this what
did<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.080> about<00:01:55.409> 110<00:01:56.190> 3/10<00:01:56.970> what

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
did you think it is about 110 3/10 what

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.810 
did you think it is about 110 3/10 what
is<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.539> ahead<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.840> us<00:02:01.220> says<00:02:02.220> it's<00:02:02.399> gonna<00:02:02.520> stay

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
is it ahead of us says it's gonna stay

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.600 
is it ahead of us says it's gonna stay
like<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.690> we<00:02:04.020> stay<00:02:04.229> 0<00:02:04.560> 9<00:02:04.740> 0<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:05.220> slightly

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
like this if we stay 0 9 0 or slightly

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.020 
like this if we stay 0 9 0 or slightly
further<00:02:05.789> north<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:07.409> our<00:02:07.560> course<00:02:08.030> where

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
further north so that's our course where

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.729 
further north so that's our course where
we<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.360> go<00:02:09.709> we<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.979> stay<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.310> short

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
we have to go we have to stay in short

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.740 
we have to go we have to stay in short
to<00:02:13.739> avoid<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.280> ice<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.330> ice<00:02:15.480> gets

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
to avoid the ice because the ice gets

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.259 
to avoid the ice because the ice gets
much<00:02:15.930> thicker<00:02:16.290> offshore<00:02:16.709> it's<00:02:17.610> amazing

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
much thicker offshore it's amazing

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.809 
much thicker offshore it's amazing
we<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.110> satellite<00:02:19.890> imagery<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.550> we<00:02:20.670> can

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
we have satellite imagery that we can

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.009 
we have satellite imagery that we can
access<00:02:21.890> charts<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.340> information<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.360> I

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
access charts all this information and I

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.870
