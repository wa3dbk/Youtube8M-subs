iphone 4 and antenna issue where if the
somehow<00:00:07.919> if<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.370> antenna<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.150> conducted<00:00:09.719> or

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
somehow if the antenna is conducted or

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.030 
somehow if the antenna is conducted or
some<00:00:10.170> other<00:00:10.320> technical<00:00:10.920> issue<00:00:11.219> anyways<00:00:13.040> some

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
some other technical issue anyways some

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.310 
some other technical issue anyways some
people<00:00:14.360> you've<00:00:15.360> seen<00:00:15.509> lots<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.750> videos<00:00:15.809> on

people you've seen lots of videos on
YouTube<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.190> everywhere<00:00:17.580> else<00:00:17.609> where<00:00:18.119> people

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
YouTube and everywhere else where people

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.240 
YouTube and everywhere else where people
are<00:00:18.990> holding<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.320> phone<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> reception

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
are holding the phone and the reception

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.460 
are holding the phone and the reception
goes<00:00:20.430> away<00:00:20.580> some<00:00:21.570> people<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:21.960> claiming<00:00:22.199> that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
goes away some people are claiming that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.859 
goes away some people are claiming that
the<00:00:22.650> issue<00:00:22.859> does<00:00:23.220> not<00:00:23.430> exist<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.420> their<00:00:24.570> phone

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
the issue does not exist on their phone

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.250 
the issue does not exist on their phone
and<00:00:25.430> I<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.660> probably<00:00:27.810> more

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
and I think that this is probably more

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.110 
and I think that this is probably more
of<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.179> every<00:00:30.179> iphone<00:00:30.660> 4<00:00:31.019> issue<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
of like and every iphone 4 issue and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.330 
of like and every iphone 4 issue and
this<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> good<00:00:33.690> way<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.870> demonstrating<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
this is a good way of demonstrating a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
this is a good way of demonstrating a
problem<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.940> people<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.540> try<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.750> for

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
problem and people can try this for

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.619 
problem and people can try this for
themselves<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.780> further<00:00:40.079> ado<00:00:41.480> you<00:00:42.480> need

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
themselves so the further ado you need

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
themselves so the further ado you need
an<00:00:42.719> iphone<00:00:42.840> 4<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.430> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
an iphone 4 and you just to do it to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.060 
an iphone 4 and you just to do it to
demonstrate<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.940> problem<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.809> way<00:00:49.070> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
demonstrate the problem in my way you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.950 
demonstrate the problem in my way you
put<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> phone<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.270> side<00:00:51.449> there<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.840> then

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
put the phone on the side there and then

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.500 
put the phone on the side there and then
you're<00:00:52.500> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.890> put<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> key<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.360> touches

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you're going to put a key so it touches

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.750 
you're going to put a key so it touches
both<00:00:54.870> sides<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> antenna<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
both sides of the antenna here if you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.250 
both sides of the antenna here if you
can<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.270> break<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.809> antenna

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.049 

we're<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> take<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> trusty

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
we're going to do is take this a trusty

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.750 
we're going to do is take this a trusty
old<00:01:03.210> key<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.989> we're<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.250> just

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
old key here and we're going to just

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.230 
old key here and we're going to just
place<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.549> it's<00:01:08.549> touching<00:01:08.820> both

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
place it so that it's touching both

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.350 
place it so that it's touching both
sides<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> antenna<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.580> you'll<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.060> here

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
sides of the antenna and you'll see here

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:31.950 
sides of the antenna and you'll see here
that<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.970> reception<00:01:16.280> will<00:01:17.280> begin<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.759> drop

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.660 

maybe<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:33.020> have<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.500> key<00:01:33.770> on<00:01:33.799> there<00:01:34.100> just<00:01:34.369> right

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
maybe I have the key on there just right

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.060 
maybe I have the key on there just right
so<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:35.780> touching<00:01:35.960> both<00:01:36.229> sides<00:01:36.530> let's<00:01:36.890> say

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
so it's touching both sides let's say

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.230 
so it's touching both sides let's say
here<00:01:37.280> we<00:01:37.369> go<00:01:37.549> let's<00:01:38.149> try<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.479> again<00:01:43.060> there<00:01:44.060> we

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
here we go let's try it again there we

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.319 
here we go let's try it again there we
go<00:01:45.100> as<00:01:46.479> you<00:01:47.479> can<00:01:47.630> see<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:49.369> reception<00:01:49.909> is<00:01:50.060> just

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
go as you can see the reception is just

00:01:50.329 --> 00:02:22.730 
go as you can see the reception is just
dropping

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.880 

okay<00:02:23.740> so<00:02:24.520> eventually<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.600> will<00:02:25.840> say<00:02:26.080> no<00:02:26.380> signal

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
okay so eventually it will say no signal

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.530 
okay so eventually it will say no signal
and<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.430> will<00:02:27.580> not<00:02:27.700> be<00:02:27.850> able<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.000> make<00:02:28.090> calls<00:02:28.480> I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
and you will not be able to make calls I

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.930 
and you will not be able to make calls I
work<00:02:31.540> for<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.750> company<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.350> we<00:02:33.310> do

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
work for a company and we do

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.900 
work for a company and we do
standard-issue<00:02:34.510> iphones<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:36.700> have

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
standard-issue iphones and we have

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.700 
standard-issue iphones and we have
tested<00:02:37.300> this<00:02:37.420> on<00:02:37.630> about<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.170> half<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.530> dozen

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
tested this on about a half a dozen

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.040 
tested this on about a half a dozen
iPhones<00:02:39.550> every<00:02:40.000> single<00:02:40.330> one<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.480> them<00:02:40.690> has<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
iPhones every single one of them has the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.980 
iPhones every single one of them has the
exact<00:02:41.320> same<00:02:41.350> problem<00:02:42.180> i'll<00:02:43.180> also<00:02:43.420> demonstrate

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
exact same problem i'll also demonstrate

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.550 
exact same problem i'll also demonstrate
it<00:02:44.050> without<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.440> key<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:45.250> let's<00:02:45.460> go<00:02:45.610> ahead<00:02:45.640> and

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
it without the key so let's go ahead and

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.500 
it without the key so let's go ahead and
put<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.590> down<00:02:47.950> keys<00:02:48.490> is<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.790> good<00:02:48.940> way<00:02:49.090> for<00:02:49.120> you

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
put that down keys is a good way for you

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.760 
put that down keys is a good way for you

know some people may hold the phone I

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.070 
know some people may hold the phone I
don't<00:02:51.460> know<00:02:51.580> if<00:02:51.670> their<00:02:51.820> hands<00:02:52.120> very

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
don't know if their hands very

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.230 
don't know if their hands very
conductive<00:02:53.470> or<00:02:53.890> whatever<00:02:54.190> they<00:02:54.790> don't<00:02:54.970> they

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
conductive or whatever they don't they

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.540 
conductive or whatever they don't they
don't<00:02:55.270> see<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.870> issue<00:02:56.070> but<00:02:57.070> it's<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.370> real

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
don't see the issue but it's a real

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.460 
don't see the issue but it's a real

issue so again you can see there's a

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.490
