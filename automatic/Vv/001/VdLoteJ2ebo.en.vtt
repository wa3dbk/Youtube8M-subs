leading photos from iPhoto so I very

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.080 
leading photos from iPhoto so I very

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
often get questions about deleting

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.669 
often get questions about deleting
photos<00:00:12.330> from<00:00:12.570> iPhoto<00:00:12.750> because<00:00:13.200> sometimes<00:00:13.530> it

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
photos from iPhoto because sometimes it

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.079 
photos from iPhoto because sometimes it
can<00:00:13.710> be<00:00:13.830> tricky<00:00:14.009> if<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.370> don't<00:00:14.549> understand

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
can be tricky if you don't understand

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.060 
can be tricky if you don't understand
the<00:00:15.269> difference<00:00:15.360> between<00:00:15.570> events<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.619> albums

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
the difference between events and albums

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.000 
the difference between events and albums
so<00:00:18.000> here<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.359> iPhoto<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.869> your<00:00:18.960> library<00:00:19.439> you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
so here in iPhoto in your library you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.740 
so here in iPhoto in your library you
have<00:00:20.039> different<00:00:20.670> selections<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
have different selections but the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.009 
have different selections but the
starting<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.199> events<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.510> events<00:00:24.510> basically

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
starting with events so events basically

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.310 
starting with events so events basically
have<00:00:25.980> individual<00:00:26.730> photos<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.300> them<00:00:27.510> every

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
at all so the differential events and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.819 
at all so the differential events and
albums<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.989> very<00:00:46.170> important<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:46.739> you're

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
albums is very important when you're

be found in different events so for

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.240 
be found in different events so for

instance I can create an album called
scenery<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.850> link<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.689> different<00:01:06.900> photos

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
exactly one event and it's only in one

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469

them I could go and select one I could

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.090 
them I could go and select one I could
control<00:03:41.970> click<00:03:42.239> on<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.750> say<00:03:43.380> show<00:03:43.739> event

control click on it and say show event
and<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.760> goes<00:03:44.940> into<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.390> event<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.989> has

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
and now it goes into the event that has

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.350 
and now it goes into the event that has
that<00:03:46.470> photo<00:03:46.980> select<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.700> photo<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.090> delete

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
it but that could be a lot of work if I

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.840 
it but that could be a lot of work if I
have<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.600> ton<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.049> photos<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:52.410> want<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.620> delete<00:03:52.850> so

have a ton of photos I want to delete so

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.000 
have a ton of photos I want to delete so
there<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.180> one<00:03:54.390> other<00:03:54.540> trick<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.530> can<00:03:55.739> select

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
there is one other trick you can select

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.180 
there is one other trick you can select
all<00:03:56.480> command<00:03:57.480> data<00:03:57.690> select<00:03:58.049> all<00:03:58.200> in<00:03:58.380> this

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
all command data select all in this

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.310 
all command data select all in this
album<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.760> you<00:04:00.090> can<00:04:00.239> go<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.360> event<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.959> create

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
album and you can go to event and create

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.990 
album and you can go to event and create
an<00:04:01.440> event<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.890> what<00:04:01.980> will<00:04:02.070> happen<00:04:02.400> here<00:04:02.850> is

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
an event and what will happen here is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.380 
an event and what will happen here is
basically<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.260> will<00:04:04.530> move<00:04:04.860> all<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:06.030> photos

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
basically it will move all of the photos

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.600 
basically it will move all of the photos
from<00:04:06.420> their<00:04:06.810> original<00:04:06.930> events<00:04:07.620> into<00:04:07.829> a<00:04:07.980> new

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
from their original events into a new

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.100 
from their original events into a new
event<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.239> warns<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.600> about<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.930> here

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
event and it warns you about it here

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.990 
event and it warns you about it here
since<00:04:10.500> photos<00:04:10.799> can<00:04:10.950> only<00:04:11.070> be<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.280> one<00:04:11.489> event<00:04:11.760> at

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
since photos can only be in one event at

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000 
since photos can only be in one event at
a<00:04:12.060> time<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:13.049> will<00:04:13.230> remove<00:04:13.470> them<00:04:13.650> all<00:04:13.860> the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
a time it will remove them all the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.620 
a time it will remove them all the
events<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.400> they're<00:04:14.549> in<00:04:14.730> could<00:04:15.269> be<00:04:15.329> spread

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
events that they're in could be spread

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.960 
events that they're in could be spread
out<00:04:15.660> through<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:15.959> entire<00:04:16.310> library<00:04:17.310> put<00:04:17.850> them

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
out through the entire library put them

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.979 
out through the entire library put them
in<00:04:18.090> one<00:04:18.329> single<00:04:18.630> event

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
in one single event

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.930 
in one single event
once<00:04:19.350> you're<00:04:19.500> in<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.620> one<00:04:19.859> single<00:04:20.100> event<00:04:20.489> you

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
once you're in that one single event you

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.320 
once you're in that one single event you
can<00:04:21.090> then<00:04:21.209> go<00:04:21.599> to<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.810> single<00:04:22.410> event<00:04:22.890> and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
can then go to that single event and

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.670 
can then go to that single event and
delete<00:04:24.330> them<00:04:24.539> from<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:25.110> event<00:04:25.320> that's

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
delete them from that event that's

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.350 
delete them from that event that's
deleting<00:04:26.070> them<00:04:26.190> completely<00:04:26.669> from

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
deleting them completely from

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.779 
deleting them completely from
your<00:04:27.569> library<00:04:28.199> now<00:04:28.889> another<00:04:29.280> way<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.490> do<00:04:29.669> that

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
your library now another way to do that

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.129 
your library now another way to do that
without<00:04:29.909> creating<00:04:30.300> an<00:04:30.509> album<00:04:30.659> is<00:04:30.930> say<00:04:31.080> you

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
without creating an album is say you

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.629 
without creating an album is say you
want<00:04:31.469> to<00:04:31.530> go<00:04:31.620> through<00:04:31.800> events<00:04:32.069> or<00:04:32.189> photos

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
want to go through events or photos

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.700 
want to go through events or photos
which<00:04:32.819> is<00:04:32.939> basically<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.449> list<00:04:33.689> of<00:04:33.840> events<00:04:34.050> as

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
which is basically a list of events as

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.890 
which is basically a list of events as
well<00:04:34.979> it's<00:04:35.219> just<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.669> lists<00:04:36.360> them<00:04:36.479> in<00:04:36.629> in

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
well it's just that it lists them in in

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.270 
well it's just that it lists them in in
a<00:04:37.050> way<00:04:37.169> that<00:04:37.319> you<00:04:37.409> can<00:04:37.530> see<00:04:37.680> photos<00:04:37.889> across

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
a way that you can see photos across

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.059 
a way that you can see photos across
multiple<00:04:38.699> events<00:04:39.120> so<00:04:40.050> say<00:04:40.229> I<00:04:40.259> want<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.620> select

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
multiple events so say I want to select

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.740 
multiple events so say I want to select
a<00:04:41.280> lot<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.550> different<00:04:41.789> photos<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.240> delete<00:04:42.569> I

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
a lot of different photos to delete I

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.300 
a lot of different photos to delete I
could<00:04:43.229> select<00:04:43.409> them<00:04:43.680> here<00:04:43.949> and<00:04:44.039> select

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
could select them here and select

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.679 
could select them here and select
another<00:04:44.520> one<00:04:44.729> holding<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.090> command<00:04:45.389> key<00:04:45.479> down

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:45.689 
another one holding the command key down

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:47.420 
another one holding the command key down
so<00:04:45.930> I'm<00:04:45.990> selecting<00:04:46.139> multiples<00:04:46.860> across

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
so I'm selecting multiples across

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.850 
so I'm selecting multiples across
multiple<00:04:47.759> albums<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.389> then<00:04:48.780> hit<00:04:49.020> command<00:04:49.770> to

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
multiple albums and then hit command to

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.499 
multiple albums and then hit command to
lead<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.099> put<00:04:50.250> them<00:04:50.370> in<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.550> trash<00:04:50.789> but<00:04:51.240> say<00:04:51.479> I

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
lead to put them in the trash but say I

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.570 
lead to put them in the trash but say I
want<00:04:51.719> to<00:04:51.780> review<00:04:52.110> them<00:04:52.319> all<00:04:52.409> first<00:04:52.740> what<00:04:53.550> I

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
want to review them all first what I

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.189 
want to review them all first what I
could<00:04:53.849> do<00:04:53.969> instead<00:04:54.120> is<00:04:54.330> flag<00:04:54.750> them<00:04:55.020> so

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
could do instead is flag them so

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.140 
could do instead is flag them so

that they're all listed here and it's

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.129 
that they're all listed here and it's
the<00:05:19.229> same<00:05:19.500> deal<00:05:20.129> here<00:05:20.490> as<00:05:20.669> if<00:05:21.090> this<00:05:21.840> was<00:05:22.020> an

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
the same deal here as if this was an

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.839

hit<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.210> delete<00:05:24.750> it<00:05:24.900> simply<00:05:25.199> unflagged<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:26.120> so

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
hit a delete it simply unflagged it so

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.360 
hit a delete it simply unflagged it so
what<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:28.020> do<00:05:28.740> instead<00:05:29.129> is<00:05:29.969> I<00:05:30.449> can<00:05:31.069> select<00:05:32.069> all<00:05:32.279> of

what I do instead is I can select all of
these<00:05:32.759> and<00:05:33.060> do<00:05:33.389> the<00:05:33.539> same<00:05:33.719> thing<00:05:33.990> here<00:05:34.289> where<00:05:34.469> I

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
these and do the same thing here where I

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.260 
these and do the same thing here where I
create<00:05:35.039> an<00:05:35.129> event<00:05:35.430> I<00:05:35.610> can<00:05:35.759> actually<00:05:36.089> don't

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270

create event from flagged photos so

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:40.100 
create event from flagged photos so
basically<00:05:39.360> remove<00:05:39.629> them<00:05:39.810> all<00:05:39.900> from<00:05:40.020> their

basically remove them all from their
current<00:05:40.199> events<00:05:40.560> put<00:05:41.039> them<00:05:41.159> in<00:05:41.250> a<00:05:41.310> new<00:05:41.460> event

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
current events put them in a new event

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.760 
current events put them in a new event
and<00:05:41.969> from<00:05:42.930> there<00:05:43.080> I<00:05:43.110> can<00:05:43.229> delete<00:05:43.529> the<00:05:43.680> event

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
and from there I can delete the event

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.140 
and from there I can delete the event
that's<00:05:44.069> deleting<00:05:44.370> all<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.490> photos<00:05:44.789> so<00:05:45.089> you

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.300 
that's deleting all the photos so you
can<00:05:45.300> use<00:05:45.419> flagging<00:05:45.990> then<00:05:46.620> create<00:05:46.919> new<00:05:47.009> event

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
can use flagging then create new event

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.829 
can use flagging then create new event
and<00:05:47.430> then<00:05:47.610> delete<00:05:47.909> the<00:05:48.060> event<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:48.509> delete
