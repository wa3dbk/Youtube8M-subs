a demanding game graphically and for
some<00:03:03.489> people<00:03:03.639> it<00:03:03.970> gets<00:03:04.060> annoying<00:03:04.389> when<00:03:04.630> you

can't have one looking as nicely doesn't
some<00:03:06.579> people's<00:03:06.849> videos<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.079> try<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.590> push

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
some people's videos so you try and push

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.900 
some people's videos so you try and push
up<00:03:08.859> your<00:03:10.530> quality<00:03:11.530> settings<00:03:11.919> and<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.400> get<00:03:12.669> a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
up your quality settings and you get a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.059 
up your quality settings and you get a
reduction<00:03:13.269> in<00:03:13.599> performance<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.260> my<00:03:14.799> video

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
reduction in performance and my video

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.949 
reduction in performance and my video
