seems<00:03:22.590> like<00:03:22.799> this<00:03:23.040> one<00:03:23.310> right<00:03:23.489> here<00:03:23.819> yeah<00:03:24.750> if<00:03:25.290> I

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
seems like this one right here yeah if I

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.160 
seems like this one right here yeah if I
would<00:03:25.860> have<00:03:25.980> left<00:03:26.160> her<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.790> too<00:03:27.480> after

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
would have left her like that too after

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.530 
would have left her like that too after
it<00:03:28.620> dried<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.130> would<00:03:29.280> look<00:03:29.549> exactly<00:03:29.700> like<00:03:30.120> that

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
it dried it would look exactly like that

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.710 
it dried it would look exactly like that
so<00:03:30.780> basically<00:03:31.500> means<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.040> need<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.720> start

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
that process I'm gonna add a little bit

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.039 
that process I'm gonna add a little bit
more<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:38.190> my<00:03:38.340> 30<00:03:38.640> lotion<00:03:39.209> as<00:03:39.510> well<00:03:39.720> as<00:03:39.870> the

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.599 

here<00:04:11.209> we<00:04:11.329> are<00:04:11.359> the<00:04:12.140> next<00:04:12.500> morning<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.250> let<00:04:13.489> my

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
hair air dry over time so I can sit with

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.699 
hair air dry over time so I can sit with
LexA<00:04:16.820> rather<00:04:17.030> essentially<00:04:17.930> like<00:04:18.139> any<00:04:18.410> other

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
LexA rather essentially like any other

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.129 
LexA rather essentially like any other
roller<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.759> only<00:04:20.090> difference<00:04:20.509> is<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.720> you

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
roller the only difference is that you

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.379 
roller the only difference is that you
will<00:04:21.320> need<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.500> straighten<00:04:22.160> out<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.940> flexi

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
will need to straighten out the flexi

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.350 
will need to straighten out the flexi
rod<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:24.289> unroll<00:04:24.830> your<00:04:24.860> hair<00:04:25.400> take<00:04:25.940> your<00:04:26.150> time

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
so you don't disturb the curl too much

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.360 
so you don't disturb the curl too much
because<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.360> don't<00:04:29.389> want<00:04:29.630> it<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.229> frizz<00:04:31.070> up

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
because you don't want it to frizz up

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.950 
because you don't want it to frizz up
but<00:04:32.330> other<00:04:32.570> than<00:04:32.840> that<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:34.190> just<00:04:34.220> unroll<00:04:35.090> all

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.810 
to you but I via cleat with these in
flexi<00:05:20.990> rod<00:05:21.139> so<00:05:21.409> they're<00:05:22.010> pretty<00:05:22.280> comfortable

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
flexi rod so they're pretty comfortable

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.810 
flexi rod so they're pretty comfortable
because<00:05:23.330> they're<00:05:23.599> soft<00:05:26.770> so<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.919> last<00:05:28.130> step<00:05:28.490> is

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
because they're soft so the last step is

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.879 
because they're soft so the last step is
completely<00:05:29.389> optional<00:05:29.510> I<00:05:30.320> like<00:05:30.500> to<00:05:30.650> pull<00:05:30.860> my

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
completely optional I like to pull my

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.070 
completely optional I like to pull my
curls<00:05:31.370> apart<00:05:31.760> so<00:05:32.060> basically<00:05:32.479> I<00:05:32.599> just<00:05:32.810> want<00:05:33.020> to

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080
