00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.960
 name mike stewart age 40 position 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.329
 Trainer 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.070
 On Monday, the Canadian led his 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.230
 first unit in the ice arena 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.520
 The coach took the penguin player 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.860
 just ran right 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.080
 ice hockey and there the mouse bites no 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.160
 thread is finally no 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.559
 kid's birthday red track jacket 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.449
 käppi on the head watchful eyes 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.000
 stewart did his job on the 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.309
 ice everything under control his eyes 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.790
 nothing escapes and it is somehow 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.909
 funny stewart is similar in appearance 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.040
 Cory Holden the defender of the 2002 with 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.460
 Bremerhaven became German champion 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.989
 However, the two are not related 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.520
 stewart has a lot of plans with the penguins 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:10.170
 on the low-flying from the season 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.170
 2011/2012 is history 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.420
 Welcome to the player's bank 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.280
 fischtown pinguins and there he sits 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.110
 the new coach of the fischtown pinguins 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.390
 Mike Stewart Welcome to 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.100
 bremerhaven mike man has seen the same 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.530
 at the first unit is the post 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.790
 the players go along well and me 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.830
 have the feeling we have a lot 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.870
 ambitious trainer here on board the 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.310
 incidents 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.150
 I am very happy here in Bremerhaven 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.130
 to be 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.710
 I think the guys were a bit 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.930
 nervous today at the first training I 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.850
 also completely honest 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.890
 but it went well and I think so 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.930
 if that's important to us, that's us 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.690
 super training habits 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.070
 have and if it recognizes that recognize 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.470
 also bring into play 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.880
 the first fitness tests are already 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.560
 completes the first performance tests 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.360
 can you say the players have 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.860
 her homework was done or was there 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.300
 the game where you have to say human so 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.780
 the values ​​we did not like yours 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.850
 power 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.860
 I think everyone knew before 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.330
 that you came from is me 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.080
 important is that we are a very 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.300
 be fit team and so i have to 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.680
 they all had to say they were total 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.489
 football have given full throttle and quite 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.650
 honest 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.570
 a fitter team hobby hobby up 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.140
 now there was nothing so i am very very 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.330
 satisfied 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.110
 Fitter than your Austrian team 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.769
 last year similar but gold or 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.380
 player 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.280
 this year are better better next to each other 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.630
 as the players of last season 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.310
 many years in austria now the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.269
 change to the North Sea coast that's it 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.280
 a cultural shock 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.040
 that is quite something new is a whole 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.550
 new world or because it is funny 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.470
 It almost a new language for me 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.420
 Mr. High German for me is one 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.410
 will bit strange it was 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.540
 slower learning of cultural shock is not 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.940
 really ice hockey you see 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.290
 many cities seen in my career 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.420
 and I am very very curious about our harbor 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.920
 new place and we have a clock in the 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.170
 bus last in our team 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.660
 had friday and it was absolutely great 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.400
 and get you eaten ingo me 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.830
 right there to a pig 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.340
 after that so way as well as in 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.920
 Austria 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.910
 but I am very impressed with that 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.500
 city ​​and very very positive 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.760
 impressed me again on the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.500
 team to speak many new ones 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.460
 faces the question is also chris 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.050
 Stanley is not there anymore 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.910
 team captain of the last season 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.590
 who will be new darling at the penguins 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.940
 you can already see trend there 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.830
 andrew mcpherson maybe or one 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.720
 chris straube or 1 marian data 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.090
 collection candidates 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.580
 I think we need a little bit of time 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.540
 First we have together before we do this 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.180
 make decision 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.670
 but of course that's a big thing 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.590
 for a hockey team is the 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.140
 to have the right person as captain 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.480
 because he is the representative of the whole 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.640
 Team in due time internally 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.120
 when elected or is there by you 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.220
 certainly 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.820
 it is not yet known , believe me 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.290
 i believe in chosen i am still 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.910
 nothing i'm not sure yet 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.190
 I think he will be next week 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.050
 Would decide the fischtown pinguins 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.460
 Play in the second league is finally 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.870
 The theater is not over anymore 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.370
 discussion about the league like 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.739
 are you relieved that the topic 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.440
 that's it was like it was done 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.630
 swiss people about our whole 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.390
 Concentration but I have to say 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.350
 always seduced everything given that to 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.120
 dry up that would be in the 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.760
 I have to stay and have to stay in the Bundesliga 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.640
 hat off because we have no appearance 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.630
 no chance ever had on the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.280
 squad we have training today 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.170
 Counting seven defenders is one 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.700
 a little bit if you know that with 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.380
 marc petermann also our young man 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.060
 it probably does not necessarily 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.520
 so much to learn there has to be something else 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.740
 happen or 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.330
 we will also read that well first 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.760
 we have time during the 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.950
 preparation phase of the toom analyze 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.320
 The guys will be a chance 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.440
 get and if you take the chance 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.460
 then if it stays that way it would be 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.630
 of course a topic 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.000
 internally but so far we will 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.830
 wait before we do any 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.900
 decision still apply a word 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.160
 the foreign players a friesen 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.960
 or 1 kug they are not here yet 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.130
 Well, how did you scan that? 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.430
 personally known 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.050
 not really no 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.170
 when we get these resümees im 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.849
 summer is when upset and I then 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.279
 talking on the phone together 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.289
 and then with agence sometimes 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:38.139
 Coaches from this player age team 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.419
 mates of this player and by order 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.399
 we get an overview of wisi cent 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.529
 as a player and as a person 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:46.119
 because of the character I believe we 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:47.009
 have the right side 

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:49.330
 brought 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.330
 with cook for example he was a top 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.639
 scorer for coach marc and us 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.249
 Both have contact in denmark through 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.789
 He got these contacts here 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:02.979
 flow that is also other other thing 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.959
 fall he was in north america but already 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.839
 again with agence with coaches with the 

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:11.669
 Aids talked and I am very very 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:13.509
 stable influence of internal defense 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.309
 we know that we are on our 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.839
 Internet portal many fans also off
