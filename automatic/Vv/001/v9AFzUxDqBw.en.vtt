hey everyone today I have three new
instruction<00:00:03.110> show<00:00:03.260> you<00:00:03.439> these<00:00:04.040> are<00:00:04.220> made<00:00:04.370> by<00:00:04.520> a

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:04.550 
instruction show you these are made by a

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.490 
instruction show you these are made by a
relatively<00:00:05.270> new<00:00:05.480> company<00:00:05.690> called<00:00:06.110> Aria

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
relatively new company called Aria

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.170 
relatively new company called Aria
sounds<00:00:06.920> and<00:00:07.100> I'm<00:00:07.580> really<00:00:07.790> liking<00:00:07.970> this

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
sounds and I'm really liking this

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.990 
sounds and I'm really liking this
collection<00:00:08.890> so<00:00:09.890> this<00:00:10.040> is<00:00:10.190> a<00:00:10.220> collection<00:00:10.760> of

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
collection so this is a collection of

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.549 
collection so this is a collection of
three<00:00:11.269> different<00:00:11.510> solo<00:00:11.900> instruments<00:00:12.440> a

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
three different solo instruments a

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.710 
three different solo instruments a
classical<00:00:13.220> guitar<00:00:13.519> a<00:00:13.700> cello<00:00:14.090> and<00:00:14.360> a<00:00:14.450> French

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
classical guitar a cello and a French

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.810 
classical guitar a cello and a French
horn<00:00:14.990> and<00:00:15.170> they<00:00:15.830> sound<00:00:16.070> really<00:00:16.129> good<00:00:16.339> to<00:00:16.550> me

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
horn and they sound really good to me

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.159 
horn and they sound really good to me
especially<00:00:17.240> considering<00:00:17.720> how<00:00:17.839> affordable

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:18.169 
especially considering how affordable

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.079 
especially considering how affordable
they<00:00:18.470> are<00:00:18.619> so<00:00:19.429> I<00:00:19.489> won't<00:00:19.699> waste<00:00:19.849> much<00:00:20.060> time

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:20.089 
they are so I won't waste much time

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:21.399 
they are so I won't waste much time
let's<00:00:20.599> get<00:00:20.720> right<00:00:20.900> into<00:00:21.050> it

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:21.409 
let's get right into it

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.329 
let's get right into it
first<00:00:22.279> off<00:00:22.460> we<00:00:22.699> have<00:00:22.730> a<00:00:23.179> classical<00:00:23.689> guitar

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
first off we have a classical guitar

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.620 
first off we have a classical guitar
opening<00:00:25.339> up<00:00:25.429> the<00:00:25.550> interface<00:00:25.759> you<00:00:26.300> can<00:00:26.419> see

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
opening up the interface you can see

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.739 
opening up the interface you can see
that<00:00:26.810> it<00:00:26.899> runs<00:00:27.019> in<00:00:27.259> contact<00:00:27.710> five<00:00:28.569> you<00:00:29.569> have

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:29.749 
that it runs in contact five you have

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.779 
that it runs in contact five you have
basic<00:00:30.109> controls<00:00:30.470> over<00:00:30.829> reverb<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:31.369> room<00:00:31.550> size

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
basic controls over reverb and room size

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:41.759 
basic controls over reverb and room size
which<00:00:32.090> is<00:00:32.239> nice<00:00:32.449> for<00:00:32.480> sculpting<00:00:33.170> your<00:00:33.379> tone

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.529 

those<00:00:42.769> are<00:00:42.920> pretty<00:00:43.100> simple<00:00:43.340> below<00:00:44.090> this<00:00:44.269> is<00:00:44.480> a

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
those are pretty simple below this is a

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.090 
those are pretty simple below this is a
new<00:00:44.929> feature<00:00:45.140> that<00:00:45.289> I<00:00:45.500> haven't<00:00:45.769> ever<00:00:45.980> seen

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
new feature that I haven't ever seen

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.220 
new feature that I haven't ever seen
before<00:00:46.429> um<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:47.660> something<00:00:47.870> called

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
before um this is something called

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.889 
before um this is something called
performance<00:00:48.769> mode<00:00:48.949> and<00:00:49.219> basically<00:00:50.000> this<00:00:50.359> is<00:00:50.600> a

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
performance mode and basically this is a

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.110 
performance mode and basically this is a
way<00:00:50.929> to<00:00:51.170> add<00:00:51.499> realism<00:00:51.920> but<00:00:52.339> maintain

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
way to add realism but maintain

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.139 
way to add realism but maintain
playability<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.589> with<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:55.249> off<00:00:55.399> you<00:00:55.789> have<00:00:55.969> the

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
playability so with it off you have the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.209 
playability so with it off you have the
full<00:00:56.359> natural<00:00:56.600> attack<00:00:57.109> of<00:00:57.379> all<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.679> notes<00:01:00.219> and

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
full natural attack of all the notes and

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.099 
full natural attack of all the notes and
that<00:01:01.399> long<00:01:01.640> attack<00:01:01.969> can<00:01:02.210> actually<00:01:02.600> seem<00:01:02.839> like

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
that long attack can actually seem like

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.320 
that long attack can actually seem like
latency<00:01:03.530> when<00:01:03.710> you're<00:01:03.859> playing<00:01:04.070> live<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.270> to

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
latency when you're playing live so to

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.700 
latency when you're playing live so to
get<00:01:05.510> rid<00:01:05.660> of<00:01:05.720> this<00:01:05.840> they<00:01:06.140> have<00:01:06.290> introduced

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
get rid of this they have introduced

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.200 
get rid of this they have introduced
something<00:01:06.860> called<00:01:07.010> performance<00:01:07.640> mode<00:01:07.850> so

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
something called performance mode so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.730 
something called performance mode so
enabling<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:08.870> is<00:01:09.110> basically<00:01:09.470> going<00:01:09.650> to

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
enabling this is basically going to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.410 
enabling this is basically going to
shorten<00:01:10.040> all<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.280> notes<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:11.120> make<00:01:11.300> the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
shorten all the notes and make the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.310 
shorten all the notes and make the
attack<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:11.930> lot<00:01:12.170> quicker<00:01:14.020> so<00:01:15.020> it's<00:01:15.110> very

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
attack a lot quicker so it's very

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.840 
attack a lot quicker so it's very
helpful<00:01:15.560> for<00:01:15.830> playing<00:01:16.010> live<00:01:16.220> especially<00:01:16.430> with

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
helpful for playing live especially with

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.110 
helpful for playing live especially with
quick<00:01:17.090> stuff<00:01:18.340> that's<00:01:19.340> with<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.610> on<00:01:19.730> and<00:01:20.000> with

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
quick stuff that's with it on and with

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
quick stuff that's with it on and with
it<00:01:20.240> off

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.240 

turning<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.230> on<00:01:24.260> makes<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:24.710> lot<00:01:24.830> easier<00:01:24.890> to

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
turning it on makes it a lot easier to

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.849 
turning it on makes it a lot easier to
play

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.289 

so<00:01:30.859> the<00:01:30.950> company<00:01:31.340> actually<00:01:31.460> recommends<00:01:32.149> that

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
so the company actually recommends that

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.029 
so the company actually recommends that
you<00:01:32.450> leave<00:01:32.659> this<00:01:32.810> on<00:01:33.020> for<00:01:33.289> recording<00:01:33.770> then

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
you leave this on for recording then

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.830 
you leave this on for recording then
when<00:01:34.189> you're<00:01:34.310> done<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.880> can<00:01:34.909> turn<00:01:35.299> it<00:01:35.390> off<00:01:35.569> and

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
when you're done you can turn it off and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.139 
when you're done you can turn it off and
then<00:01:36.560> go<00:01:36.829> back<00:01:37.009> into<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.490> MIDI<00:01:37.670> notes<00:01:37.909> and

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
then go back into the MIDI notes and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.149 
then go back into the MIDI notes and
make<00:01:38.569> everything<00:01:38.810> sound<00:01:39.200> as<00:01:39.469> realistic<00:01:40.039> as

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
make everything sound as realistic as

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.190 
make everything sound as realistic as
possible<00:01:40.219> in<00:01:41.209> addition<00:01:41.539> to<00:01:41.600> performance<00:01:42.049> mode

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
possible in addition to performance mode

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.929 
possible in addition to performance mode
you<00:01:42.439> also<00:01:42.530> have<00:01:42.740> key<00:01:42.920> switches<00:01:43.159> down<00:01:43.429> here<00:01:43.789> if

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
you also have key switches down here if

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.910 
you also have key switches down here if
you're<00:01:44.689> unfamiliar<00:01:45.079> with<00:01:45.170> key<00:01:45.409> switches<00:01:45.770> they

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
you're unfamiliar with key switches they

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.080 
you're unfamiliar with key switches they
basically<00:01:46.189> just<00:01:46.520> change<00:01:46.729> between<00:01:46.909> different

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
basically just change between different

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.899 
basically just change between different
articulations<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.890> playing<00:01:49.219> this<00:01:49.340> low<00:01:49.549> C<00:01:49.759> down

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
articulations so playing this low C down

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.039 
articulations so playing this low C down
here<00:01:50.179> it's<00:01:50.299> just<00:01:50.420> going<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.630> give<00:01:50.750> me<00:01:50.840> thick

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
here it's just going to give me thick

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.130 
here it's just going to give me thick
notes<00:01:51.939> and<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:53.299> have<00:01:53.450> hammer-ons<00:01:53.959> and

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
notes and I have hammer-ons and

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.499 
notes and I have hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:01:54.229> and<00:02:00.579> those<00:02:01.579> are<00:02:01.759> helpful<00:02:01.909> for<00:02:02.329> the

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
pull-offs and those are helpful for the

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.089 
pull-offs and those are helpful for the
godoh<00:02:02.689> passages<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.439> also<00:02:04.399> have<00:02:04.520> harmonics<00:02:06.099> and

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
godoh passages I also have harmonics and

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:12.009 
godoh passages I also have harmonics and
then<00:02:07.729> strum<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.360> chord<00:02:08.390> notes<00:02:10.810> now<00:02:11.810> those

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
then strum the chord notes now those

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.080 
then strum the chord notes now those
might<00:02:12.200> sound<00:02:12.530> kind<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.950> similar<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.790> thick

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
might sound kind of similar to the thick

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.699 
might sound kind of similar to the thick
ones<00:02:14.329> I'll<00:02:14.660> show<00:02:14.989> you<00:02:15.049> the<00:02:15.170> difference<00:02:15.500> here

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
ones I'll show you the difference here

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:31.630 
ones I'll show you the difference here
for<00:02:16.099> strummed<00:02:16.610> chords<00:02:29.769> so<00:02:30.769> just<00:02:31.069> has<00:02:31.220> less<00:02:31.609> of

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
for strummed chords so just has less of

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.780 
for strummed chords so just has less of
a<00:02:32.030> harsh<00:02:32.269> attack<00:02:34.510> as<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.720> strum<00:02:36.019> cordwood<00:02:36.790> so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
a harsh attack as a strum cordwood so

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.610 
a harsh attack as a strum cordwood so
those<00:02:38.120> sound<00:02:38.450> really<00:02:38.720> good<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
those sound really good I like the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.960 
those sound really good I like the
different<00:02:39.799> articulations<00:02:40.639> and<00:02:40.849> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
different articulations and the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.729 
different articulations and the
performance<00:02:41.420> mode<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.079> it<00:02:42.349> helps<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.620> make

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
performance mode and it helps to make

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.800 
performance mode and it helps to make
this<00:02:43.250> classical<00:02:43.970> guitar<00:02:44.030> sound<00:02:44.569> very

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
this classical guitar sound very

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.470 
this classical guitar sound very
convincing<00:02:45.760> moving<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:46.849> from<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.150> classical

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
convincing moving on from the classical

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.379 
convincing moving on from the classical
guitar<00:02:47.569> we<00:02:48.019> also<00:02:48.230> have<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.560> cello<00:02:48.950> patch<00:02:49.389> now

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
guitar we also have a cello patch now

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.539 
guitar we also have a cello patch now
this<00:02:50.599> has<00:02:50.870> no<00:02:51.380> piece<00:02:51.620> which<00:02:51.829> is<00:02:51.950> down<00:02:52.099> here<00:02:52.340> but

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
this has no piece which is down here but

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.559 
this has no piece which is down here but
you<00:02:52.579> can<00:02:52.760> see<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.060> there<00:02:53.269> are<00:02:53.299> several

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
you can see that there are several

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.690 
you can see that there are several
different<00:02:53.750> articulations<00:02:54.260> over<00:02:54.829> here<00:02:55.099> now

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
different articulations over here now

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.699 
different articulations over here now
you<00:02:55.819> can<00:02:55.970> load<00:02:56.090> these<00:02:56.269> separately<00:02:56.750> I'm<00:02:57.680> going

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
you can load these separately I'm going

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.729 
you can load these separately I'm going
to<00:02:57.950> start<00:02:58.190> with<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.700> sustain<00:02:59.329> patch<00:02:59.540> here<00:02:59.989> so

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
to start with the sustain patch here so

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.050 
to start with the sustain patch here so
this<00:03:00.919> is<00:03:01.040> really<00:03:01.190> nice<00:03:01.370> because<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.849> has

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
this is really nice because it has

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:14.900 
this is really nice because it has
expression<00:03:02.989> control<00:03:03.290> with<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.590> mod<00:03:03.769> wheel

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.280 

so<00:03:15.910> that's<00:03:16.090> very<00:03:16.330> helpful<00:03:16.510> for<00:03:16.870> playing<00:03:17.110> those

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
so that's very helpful for playing those

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.040 
so that's very helpful for playing those
expressive<00:03:17.860> passages<00:03:18.510> let's<00:03:19.510> move<00:03:19.720> on<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
expressive passages let's move on to the

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:28.470 
expressive passages let's move on to the
pit<00:03:20.200> Scotto<00:03:20.470> patch<00:03:27.060> sounds<00:03:28.060> good<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.330> me

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
pit Scotto patch sounds good to me

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:37.289 
pit Scotto patch sounds good to me
there's<00:03:28.840> also<00:03:29.050> staccato<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.760> those<00:03:37.000> sound

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
there's also staccato so those sound

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:37.740 
there's also staccato so those sound
pretty<00:03:37.480> good

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
pretty good

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.110 
pretty good
and<00:03:38.590> then<00:03:38.709> tremolo<00:03:39.160> I'm<00:03:39.370> liking<00:03:39.670> this<00:03:39.790> one<00:03:40.000> as

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
and then tremolo I'm liking this one as

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.110 
and then tremolo I'm liking this one as
well<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:41.620> has<00:03:41.860> expression<00:03:42.670> with<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:42.970> mod

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
well so this has expression with the mod

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:58.589 
well so this has expression with the mod
wheel<00:03:43.299> again<00:03:57.269> between<00:03:58.269> those<00:03:58.569> four

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
wheel again between those four

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.600 
wheel again between those four
articulations<00:03:59.379> you<00:03:59.590> have<00:03:59.769> a<00:04:00.040> very<00:04:00.370> nice
