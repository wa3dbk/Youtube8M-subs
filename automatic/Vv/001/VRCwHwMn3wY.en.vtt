00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
we're going to do use this for a bench

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
we're going to do use this for a bench
for<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.649> moment<00:01:35.390> yeah<00:01:39.590> yes<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:41.550> going<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
take and pop the switch apart but I can

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.669 
take and pop the switch apart but I can
get<00:01:46.440> it<00:01:46.530> apart<00:01:50.869> play<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.229> take<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
get it apart play it it is take a

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.130 
get it apart play it it is take a
screwdriver<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.910> knife<00:01:54.210> or<00:01:54.660> something<00:01:54.690> like

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
screwdriver or a knife or something like

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.830 
screwdriver or a knife or something like
that<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:56.220> got<00:01:56.369> two<00:01:56.550> little<00:01:56.700> hooks<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.390> here

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that it's got two little hooks in here

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.710 
that it's got two little hooks in here
and<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.710> pop<00:01:58.950> those<00:01:59.220> out<00:01:59.550> or<00:01:59.850> pop<00:02:00.179> those<00:02:00.450> loose

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
and you pop those out or pop those loose

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.469 
and you pop those out or pop those loose
like<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.520> then<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> switch<00:02:02.850> comes<00:02:03.090> apart

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
like this then the switch comes apart

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.350 
like this then the switch comes apart
and<00:02:03.600> you'll<00:02:03.690> see<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.340> all<00:02:05.340> there<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.819> is<00:02:06.210> just

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
and you'll see that all there is is just

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:17.530 
and you'll see that all there is is just
some<00:02:06.600> little<00:02:06.890> contacts

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.290 

and<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.959> way<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.140> fix<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.250> take<00:02:20.970> some

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
and the way to fix this is to take some

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.880 
and the way to fix this is to take some
PB<00:02:21.690> Blaster<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.450> spray<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.140> contacts

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
PB Blaster and just spray the contacts

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:42.229 
PB Blaster and just spray the contacts
down<00:02:26.190> maybe<00:02:26.580> work<00:02:26.970> them<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.270> little<00:02:27.510> bit

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.390 

kind<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.900> work<00:02:43.049> them<00:02:43.230> back<00:02:43.409> and<00:02:43.590> forth<00:02:43.620> then

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
kind of work them back and forth then

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.369 
kind of work them back and forth then
kind<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:46.099> tap<00:02:47.099> off<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.390> excess<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:49.819> then<00:02:51.379> put

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
kind of tap off the excess and then put

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.940 
kind of tap off the excess and then put
the<00:02:52.470> switch<00:02:52.680> together<00:02:54.379> put<00:02:55.379> back<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.739> two

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
the switch together put back this two

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:09.300 
the switch together put back this two
snaps<00:02:56.220> back<00:02:56.489> together

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.860 

and<00:03:10.310> then<00:03:10.599> now<00:03:11.599> set<00:03:12.349> this<00:03:12.500> back<00:03:12.829> over<00:03:13.159> here<00:03:13.870> see

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
and then now set this back over here see

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:24.479 
and then now set this back over here see
if<00:03:14.959> I<00:03:15.049> can<00:03:15.140> adjust<00:03:15.409> this<00:03:15.650> right<00:03:15.950> again<00:03:23.140> focus

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
if I can adjust this right again focus

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.160 
if I can adjust this right again focus
there<00:03:25.489> we<00:03:25.640> go<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.500> then<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:28.720> just<00:03:29.720> take<00:03:29.959> and

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
there we go and then I just take and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:41.229 
there we go and then I just take and
plug<00:03:30.500> this<00:03:31.030> back<00:03:32.030> in<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.959> we<00:03:33.709> test<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.849> you

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
plug this back in and we test and you

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.800 
plug this back in and we test and you
see<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.799> window<00:03:44.650> rolls<00:03:45.650> up<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.190> down<00:03:46.400> now

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
see the window rolls up and down now

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.780 
see the window rolls up and down now
when<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:47.959> work<00:03:48.139> the<00:03:48.290> switch<00:03:48.530> so<00:03:49.430> that's<00:03:49.609> all

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
when you work the switch so that's all

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.300 
when you work the switch so that's all
there<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:50.680> evidently<00:03:51.680> these<00:03:51.980> things

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
there is to it evidently these things

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.619 
there is to it evidently these things
are<00:03:52.459> good<00:03:52.579> about<00:03:52.670> this<00:03:53.000> this<00:03:53.150> has<00:03:53.269> happened

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
are good about this this has happened

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.539 
are good about this this has happened
several<00:03:53.780> times<00:03:53.959> before<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:55.190> just<00:03:55.340> take<00:03:55.519> a

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
several times before you just take a

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.550 
several times before you just take a
switch<00:03:55.790> apart<00:03:56.120> spray<00:03:56.540> some<00:03:56.720> blaster<00:03:57.230> in<00:03:57.440> it

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
switch apart spray some blaster in it

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.750 
switch apart spray some blaster in it
some<00:03:57.739> PB<00:03:58.010> Blaster

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
some PB Blaster

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.640 
some PB Blaster
and<00:03:59.480> that<00:04:00.049> usually<00:04:00.260> cures<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.310> problem<00:04:02.650> so

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
and that usually cures the problem so

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.069 
and that usually cures the problem so
