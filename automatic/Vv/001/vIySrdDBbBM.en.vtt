I did another work through a sub I do

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.140 
I did another work through a sub I do
know<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> book<00:01:20.400> ups<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.820> tapping

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
know now so the book ups here tapping

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.969 
know now so the book ups here tapping
and<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> know<00:01:21.900> why<00:01:22.020> yeah<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.770> no

and you know why yeah do we have no
choice<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.000> forgot<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.689> shatters<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
choice and then I forgot that shatters a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.920 
choice and then I forgot that shatters a
sound<00:01:25.740> base<00:01:25.979> move<00:01:26.280> that's<00:01:26.970> gonna<00:01:27.210> hit<00:01:27.450> through

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
sound base move that's gonna hit through

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.039 
sound base move that's gonna hit through
sub<00:01:28.759> some<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:30.030> sure<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.570> works<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
sub some pretty sure how that works and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.380 
sub some pretty sure how that works and
then<00:01:31.229> shatter<00:01:31.740> always<00:01:32.220> confuses<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.909> by<00:01:33.150> just

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
then shatter always confuses you by just
