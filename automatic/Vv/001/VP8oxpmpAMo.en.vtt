lob of waterfall or falafels waterfall

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.549 
lob of waterfall or falafels waterfall
that<00:01:03.660> makes<00:01:03.899> no<00:01:04.080> sense

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that makes no sense

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.770 
that makes no sense
lava<00:01:04.949> fall<00:01:05.280> right<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:08.330> let's<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.570> if

Mountain biome if you're looking for the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.830 
Mountain biome if you're looking for the
coordinates<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.030> gonna<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> upper

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
coordinates are gonna be in the upper

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.330 
coordinates are gonna be in the upper
left<00:01:25.080> corner<00:01:26.119> mainly<00:01:27.119> because<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:28.130> this<00:01:29.130> type

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
left corner mainly because in this type

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.660 
left corner mainly because in this type
of<00:01:29.369> seed<00:01:30.140> I'm<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.350> gonna<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> every<00:01:32.369> single

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
of seed I'm not gonna go to every single

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.530 
of seed I'm not gonna go to every single
mountain<00:01:33.119> type<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.600> coordinates<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.290> this

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
mountain type and coordinates for this

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.420 
mountain type and coordinates for this
and<00:01:36.540> even<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.259> really<00:01:37.890> don't<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.100> doing

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and even then I really don't like doing

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640 
and even then I really don't like doing
the<00:01:38.520> coordinates<00:01:38.880> cuz<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.140> usually<00:01:40.350> just

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the coordinates cuz you can usually just

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.960 
the coordinates cuz you can usually just
get<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.009> pause<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> video<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> upper

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
get if I pause in the video in the upper

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.460 
get if I pause in the video in the upper
left<00:01:42.150> corner<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> general<00:01:43.170> area

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
left corner and you get the general area

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.090 
left corner and you get the general area
that<00:01:46.549> sees<00:01:47.549> anything<00:01:48.180> else<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.509> interest

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
that sees anything else of interest

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
that sees anything else of interest
that's<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.280> snow<00:01:50.520> biome<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.479> means<00:01:51.689> we're

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that's a snow biome so that means we're

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.969 
that's a snow biome so that means we're
heading<00:01:52.320> back<00:01:52.790> over<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:55.590> I'm

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
heading back over there I think I'm

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.340 
heading back over there I think I'm
gonna<00:01:56.070> end<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> video<00:01:56.869> let<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.990> guys<00:01:58.170> explore
