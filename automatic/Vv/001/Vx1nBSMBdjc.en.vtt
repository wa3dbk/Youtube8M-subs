 although it turned out and it 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.990

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.990

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.830
 precisely large forms which 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.940

 which is 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.260
 flamenco music is transmitted to the language of love and 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.400
 of course 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.400
