really<00:00:33.960> scientists<00:00:34.680> could<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.880> look

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
really scientists could you just look

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090 
really scientists could you just look
the<00:00:36.120> other<00:00:36.390> way<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.070> know

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the other way on this one we all know

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.549 
the other way on this one we all know
that<00:00:38.579> sugar<00:00:38.820> isn't<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.570> healthiest<00:00:40.260> thing

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that sugar isn't the healthiest thing

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.389 
that sugar isn't the healthiest thing
but<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.550> not<00:00:41.640> dangerous<00:00:42.210> right<00:00:43.309> well<00:00:44.309> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
but it's not dangerous right well it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.470 
but it's not dangerous right well it
turns<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.930> that<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.079> totally<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:47.480> here's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
turns out that it totally can be here's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.110 
turns out that it totally can be here's
a<00:00:48.629> sad<00:00:48.840> statistic<00:00:49.489> for<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> first<00:00:50.789> time<00:00:50.969> in
