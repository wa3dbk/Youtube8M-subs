taken<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.210> video<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> show<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.230> it's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
taken a video here to show you that it's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.920 
taken a video here to show you that it's
fully<00:00:38.430> functional<00:00:39.059> show<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> condition

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
fully functional show you the condition

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.319 
fully functional show you the condition
of<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.110> there's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> few<00:00:40.440> minor<00:00:41.399> dings<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
of it there's a few minor dings on it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.560 
of it there's a few minor dings on it
but<00:00:42.570> certainly<00:00:43.260> nothing<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:44.280> would<00:00:44.610> affect

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
but certainly nothing that would affect

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.220 
but certainly nothing that would affect
performance<00:00:46.170> anyway<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.770> uh<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.879> pretty

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
performance anyway and uh it's a pretty

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.470 
performance anyway and uh it's a pretty
pretty<00:00:49.230> solid<00:00:49.649> amplifier<00:00:50.129> overall<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.030> have

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
pretty solid amplifier overall I have

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.529 
pretty solid amplifier overall I have
pictures<00:00:51.930> listed<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:53.070> well<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.640> how<00:00:54.210> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
pictures listed on as well of how it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
pictures listed on as well of how it
looks<00:00:54.780> front<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.289> back<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:57.170> green<00:00:58.170> light<00:00:58.320> for

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
looks front and back and green light for

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.049 
looks front and back and green light for
power<00:00:58.739> always<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.160> good<00:00:59.370> thing<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.910> hooked

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
power always a good thing have it hooked

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.939 
power always a good thing have it hooked
up<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.329> my<00:01:00.449> Boston<00:01:00.690> test<00:01:01.079> speaker<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.559> usual

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
up to my Boston test speaker as usual

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.780 
up to my Boston test speaker as usual
and<00:01:02.190> I'll<00:01:03.000> play<00:01:03.799> play<00:01:04.799> some<00:01:04.979> music<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and I'll play play some music for you so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:46.050 
and I'll play play some music for you so
you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.720> works

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.820 

all<00:01:47.060> right<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:47.690> completes<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.260> video<00:01:48.380> if

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
all right that completes the video if

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.960 
all right that completes the video if
