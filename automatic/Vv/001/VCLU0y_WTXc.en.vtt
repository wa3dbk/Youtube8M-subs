 xbox one as for the pc version and 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.839
 Well, as you can see I'm going to pass 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.220
 here to detail a couple of little things at 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.869
 just as I'm going to inform you a bit then 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.340
 of the news that will include and 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.100
 let's go what little we have 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.200
 informed I do not know if there will be more or not 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.150
 I know but well I re inform of all 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.350
 the little things I 've seen is worth all 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.990
 forms you will have here in the description 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.670
 the roster page with the link then to 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.620
 the news so you can see it more 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.170
 carefully and I will also give you a 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.420
 link of a kind of trailer that have 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.970
 since it's supposed to be the game in 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.530
 playstation 4 and road teams we go on 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.780
 the new generation consoles 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.940
 so well then let's start and what 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.820
 first is to tell you that for example for 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.740
 playstation 4 and xbox one on 18 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.770
 November 2014 or this same 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.030
 year we will have gta 5 while the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.560
 pc version 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.360
 Therefore, we will have to wait for a 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.940
 little bit more but just a little bit and 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.330
 will reach our our computers 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.920
 on January 27 , 2015 as you see 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.450
 Well you have to wait a little bit 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.850
 wait until after Christmas but 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.170
 Well surely the wait will be worth the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.060
 penalty for all those who want 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.830
 enjoy this game in your 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.390
 computer and well then I will move to 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.369
 tell you also some little things 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.899
 and it's obviously good how it is 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.080
 logical in these new consoles 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.000
 generation ready to give much more 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.270
 graphic performance obviously 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.640
 they will improve noticeably, because everything 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.350
 which are graphics and other of the game at 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.869
 just as well they also let us fall 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.210
 here one thing that the truth is that it gives a 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.990
 little to think and put that distance 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.190
 of drawn increased then that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.679
 we can understand that this is going to 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.050
 possibly increase the map 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.659
 be a little bigger maybe they can 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.030
 make the bigger map and add some 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.830
 new area I do not know north high by saying 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.080
 some thing but this would be simply 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.489
 speak for speaking but good yes that puts 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.070
 that the drawn distance will be 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.329
 increased and the resolution also that 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.990
 it means we will have better 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.720
 graphics like 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.100
 I have commented good also we are going to 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.690
 put a series of things very 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.060
 interesting and is that they will see new 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.280
 weapons new vehicles more activities 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.690
 they are going to put wild lives is what 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.960
 means that we will have then 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.540
 as in the campaign mode version 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.260
 we have bird animals and all that kind 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.720
 of fauna because they are going to put it in the mode 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.150
 online and good because that is surely 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.670
 very, very well, there will also be 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.290
 more traffic puts more dense traffic 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.200
 vegetation system that means 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.810
 well that the trees the branches good 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.210
 for the herbs that are on the mountain 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.030
 that they will have much more quality 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.220
 for much more graphic quality by 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.530
 say it somehow and they're also going to 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.470
 add damage effects are going to improve 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.170
 the effects of climate damage and will 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.610
 put improved climate things and a lot 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.520
 more that means that because that same 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.250
 they put us snow for example it could be 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.620
 an option that they put snow or like 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.630
 that that then improve what is the types 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.430
 of time there is to say then a 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.260
 rain that is a little bit more 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.780
 let's go a little bit of this kind of 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.599
 things and good also to tell you that they are going to 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.489
 add 100 new new songs 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.010
 mixes of the radio stations that already 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.019
 you know we have 17 stations 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.390
 good they are going to add new music and others 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.280
 and the truth is that it is quite good 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.650
 very interesting thing that they raise us 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.299
 here is that because for all 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.040
 players you book for all 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.980
 those who book the gta version 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.829
 5 either for playstation 4 xbox one or 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.049
 PC because you're getting a million 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.209
 gta dollars worth of money for the game 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.709
 and well, they are going to distribute it from the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.540
 next way they will give you half 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.579
 million for your account the way 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.000
 history is to say the campaign mode and the 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.489
 another half million will be for your 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.139
 your online gta character the 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.760
 It is true that it is not bad 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.379
 for those who reserve it and good 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.989
 Well, just start, you can already 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.219
 have this kind of thing also another 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.620
 thing that they are going to put quite 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.970
 interesting is that they are going for all 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.549
 those who come from both 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.560
 playstation 3 like xbox 360 as they go 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.840
 to put unique versions of vehicles 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.190
 classics and well they're going to put a 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.690
 seaplane a faster airship 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.610
 and the truth is that they are going to put 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.290
 activities like photography and life 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.390
 wild because I imagine that they will be missions 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.990
 to go photographing because I do not know a lion 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.220
 a cougar I do not know what they put I do not know are 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.080
 improvements are the same you may like more 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.690
 or less but good are enough things 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.550
 interesting and good also one thing 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.130
 very very good they have done is to expand 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.990
 the capacity of public items of 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.840
 online people that you already know that to day of 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.640
 today I think it's around 16 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.350
 people if I'm not wrong 15-16 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.330
 good people will expand it 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.170
 up to 30 players the truth is that they go 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.820
 to be authentic pitched battles 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.460
 surely there are 30 people in it 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.740
 starting the truth that you have very very very 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.000
 good looking all these things and good 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.890
 Well, I just wanted to comment 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.930
 these little things that are going to go 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.670
 implementing that I think they are very 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.590
 well and apart from that I also tell you 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.450
 that obviously all the dlc is that 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.860
 we have until today because 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.290
 obviously they will be available 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.780
 also in this version for playstation 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.270
 4 xbox one and pc and one thing that also 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.280
 very interesting that I think it would be what 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.200
 yours and is that all those who 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.030
 good that today you play a gta 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.700
 you can pass 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.810
 to these new versions of gta the 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.030
 truth is that it is very well so not 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.790
 we have to start from scratch or nothing 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.560
 I think that's very, very good 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.080
 truth is that it would be a pain in the ass to have 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.150
 start again from scratch to go up 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.310
 level to the truth that I think that 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.290
 it would be a little bit to go backwards so 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.610
 well I see this great and good 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.320

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.880
