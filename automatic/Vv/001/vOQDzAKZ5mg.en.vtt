00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 I think nine aliens and a lot of travel 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:16.119
 the victims are a man and then my 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.400
 opinion is that this time with boy 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.500
 begging 2 years and 9 is delayed because 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.610
 had all that trouble I already said 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.400
 nor are they 79 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.650
 but the monkey xico bento lasses is gone 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.449
 so cool but the back here this 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.369
 jungle team got very hurt short 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.340
 quite part of the team to the back cover 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.770
 with very well designed and it is this 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.579
 here was an issue neither 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.090
 will travel to too much, huh? 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.520
 Chip is partying with Ze is with the 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.360
 country is with all the people there 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.510
 with rosinha 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.059
 this pink edition did not even appear then it is 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.550
 it will only be so different, let's go fishing and 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.649
 Then they go fishing and the trip begins. 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.290
 first appears the large cup 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.300
 and there are two direct references occurs 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.340
 Brazil this can tell what 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.530
 the references will see so much reference 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.719
 in this edition you stay half lost 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.700
 then we have the bandeirantes ghosts 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.770
 direct reference to the history of brazil 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.229
 not to mention that they also appeared in the 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.000
 Classical method boy then you already 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.750
 It's a little there and the sister is already there. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.369
 talking right? 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.560
 but to this day in history it also appears 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.840
 the kingdom of atlantis referential means that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.970
 the atlantic thing and such but also 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.520
 appeared in this classic moment you 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.890
 already read and should also know how to disappear is 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.290
 write the seizure of endless shelter 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.780
 that you then want to read probably 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.009
 must be remember I never me because I 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.290
 When I was a child, I had more 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.570
 difficulty than monica's class 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.509
 so I probably knew a lot 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.460
 more of the story of the guy's disco né 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.200
 but unfortunately here most of the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.970
 references here with latest stuff 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.329
 It was after something 2000s by 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.880
 law 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.070
 the issues he was most into is decade of 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.500
 90 's that my father kept 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.570
 saved a long time later we have to 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.189
 Appearance of the sea monster with the good né 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.950
 face that also inhabit a reminder 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:08.259
 min nemo looking neca recalls that in 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.409
 calluses on earth do not remember back already 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.409
 what 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.129
 I'll say at this point your time 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:25.329
 to pick up or if the guy happiness 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:27.069
 It's gone and it's going we do not have 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.230
 time travel they will stop at the 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.239
 past and soon after that we still have 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.099
 is the appearance of pirates they are 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.409
 captured by pirates they have a mother 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.170
 It's cool with your friend and trust. 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.180
 that part of nothing appears to me in the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:46.540
 edition is already handy 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.489
 the trip is at the 8 thousand level and in this 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.349
 part is no longer we have one of the largest 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.200
 references we have a water table that 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.159
 shows the exterminator of the future shows the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.989
 rambo and shows us why 97 dollars 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.269
 You must know beyond the type that we 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.870
 you must know then you know how 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.150
 and that is 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.400
 and unfortunately or fortunately every day 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.709
 that he is released there and of course 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.659
 who helped us to escape very well is legal 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.849
 that part that we just so you 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.129
 I do not know where it was. 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.590
 already in a comedy use this match too 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.419
 It was really cool and they finally come back 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.370
 to their reality they return to the lagoon 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.919
 where they were fishing and even 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.079
 only there just Ozhan from the country that is 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.780
 so, but you're going to get this - a world 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.209
 of things we were friends and neglected salt 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.739
 arrived home is just a fishery that 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.239
 happens when you come back from a 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.280
 fishery will tell a story 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.099
 miraculous fisherman story 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.260
 this was an invention is the level of 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.760
 traveling it was very high the level of 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.430
 reference was too large 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.139
 the comedy as zé da roça and to use is qued 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:54.280
 very cool between the two is enough says 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:56.349
 that I was tied to a donkey on the q2 but 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.159
 in my opinion I this time I 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.720
 I paid the edition because it 's cute little wolf 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:05.139
 business is the team that will buy the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.900
 editing so I paid I do not like 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.970
 pay and in my opinion the price will not 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.250
 there is an edition without counting 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.889
 pages are reduced in moniker class 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.370
 young 79 with price paid very well in 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.769
 House 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.440
 so for you who is not a subscriber 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.669
 unfortunately I recommend you do not 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.710
 buy this edition 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.530

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.319
 position 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.060

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:33.340

 highlight or art that disappoints 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.470
