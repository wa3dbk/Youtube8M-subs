 which will show you how to use the 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.469
 twitter 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.610
 of the screen wrong occasion in 6.1 as 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.099

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.890
 video on how to make it functional in the 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.470
 year 5.1.1 but now it does not work very 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.600
 ok with that ok file if you already 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.980
 are in the year 6.1 are going to have 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.810
 have to install this file so that 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.120
 have a correct functioning of 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.620
 this tweet for people who do not know 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.690
 about what this tweet has been 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.309
 is this that will allow us to add what 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.910
 what is the temperature of the city or 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:40.240
 country without the need to modify it via 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.680
 obvious internal wifi this is what I 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.730
 I mean for example this is a the end 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.800
 which requires this type of 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.360
 configuration and simply if you 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.520
 they already have this click installed on their 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.040
 device is automatically going to 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.810
 recognize what is being the place 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.460
 where they are and they will mark you 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.649
 the temperature of your city or country the 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.059
 wta that is an excellent the cream since 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.870
 most creators are 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.309
 doing his sprint board are the screens 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.920
 with this kind of jeep configuration 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.180
 what is the last carmen ok for location 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.710
 good to install it will be very easy 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.720
 simply in the description of this 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.880
 video I will leave you 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.700
 the file where they will be able to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 Download and install on your device 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.040
 for example once they have 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.230
 downloaded the file will come 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.220
 your desktop and we're going to access your 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.780
 device via to modify the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.340
 internal files with the program 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.440

 where will they be able to download this 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.530
 program since several people have 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.570
 state 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.100
 asking about what's coming 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.220
 being this program although there is one time 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.360
 that have installed it and have it 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.460
 connected your device to the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.770
 computer we are going to open this program 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.299
 and here it gives us a great variety of 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.130
 categories we're just going to go to this 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.960
 category that says installation of apps 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.159

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.150
 and well I in this case I will not do 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.009

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.570
 what is my device and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.310
 Now we must go to our device 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.590

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.080

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.200
