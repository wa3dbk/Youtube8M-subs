00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.730
 hello how about friends welcome to a new tunnel of treasure and simple and in 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.290
 this occasion I would teach you to work with the loops for 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.119
 for those who do not know what loops are for 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:14.679
 make up your mind 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.029
 this is used when a known number of bs is desired literary 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.900
 employee 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.900
 as indecent one hour that is strongly increased 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.730
 For this we use the following 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.369
 It was the following functions 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.930
 in this little box, let's say the loop for 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.980
 pekin where is native of the canton the manna place the variable 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.160
 i the initial value is to say circus as 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.830
 van der sar where a 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.250
 value will be dehydrated hundred 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.250
 with step 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.190
 step by step is to go step by step means that yes 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.190
 husband where he was trainer one by one 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.410
 the one who passes the following there are those who place him as the sequence of actions of 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.180
 and we have to close always trust to make sure that each function has 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 its end 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.820
 motorcycle lake to show in showing the natural numbers of the turn to 100 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.060
 how modest web 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 with what when reading the title 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.930
 numbers 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.930
 natural 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.250
 we begin with a stick of command a kiss 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 is equal to zero 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.740
 hideki we put the call one hour 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.790
 yes 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.009
 initialist opensuse with the woman for the effect 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.350
 We start with 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.180
 in a word it is going to be written 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.710
 as an end to be happy 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.600
 the place 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.120
 it is not necessary to place 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.130
 phenomenon 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.580
 let's say that it is necessary to place the variables because if they are not asking 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.260
 place it curvature from 1 to 100 in this case and messi tell us 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.419
 there were no flights 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.719
 from the one to the month that we are entering saying that we place 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:18.749
 5 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:22.629
 lahore oils will be let's say we know the five get up to five 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.989
 but as it is not expanding they placed natural smoke in a climb it will be like 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.989
 a constant breasts did not take any validity 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.159
 we need is to directly place the loop 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.919
 in Colombia the 7 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.799
 the time of madrid 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.899
 here is where we place 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:44.799
 the initial value is to say 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.279
 that will be equal to one 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:48.529
 until 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:50.989
 with a final time trial 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.650
 one is imminent 1 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.129
 to the movies 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.129
 and it will be equal to one ansa 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.929
 say compassion 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.209
 value of the pass in this case means 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.259
 from honda engine sales and compassion follows from the horrendous 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.099
 one by one but we request that you go one at a time 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.879
 with step 1 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.819
 Being the following 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.239
 to write 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.239
 I'm looking for it with Bogota and only 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.469
 I would like false confine 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.469
 it is worth that if not then it does not close confide stop an error 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:31.689
 he says he needs to close for 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.969
 you have to know who you pay with 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.239
 that's not going to repeat facts to repeat until down 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.349
 A) Yes 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.249
 so far as it is let's say that 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:44.509
 until it arrived 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.819
 as you threw a value of 1 given moment 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.150
 about death one hundred 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.959
 perfect is going to follow 3 four five six seven seven chimneys and say it's not going 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.349
 to follow 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.799
 to say it 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.799
 running we tested the algorithm 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.399
 perfect we see that it arrives 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:05.399
 from the farm 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.029
 he does 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.459
 depending on the homolog of flight fir harassment of the place and place 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.299
 we throw 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.009
 let's go to 8 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:16.969
 can not see 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:20.370
 3rd, serve to be many 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.580
 much 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.050
 let's say that the program and very later we will explain how we can 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.569
 astarloa more complex problem 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.120
 since in the center of the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.190
 the important thing is to learn how it is used among women 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.659
 now let's say something else 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.370
 yes 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.460
 we want only the work to arrive as those that not only in missions 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.999
 space a command stick a kiss 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.080
 that will be equal to zero 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.080
 fisher your name 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.919
 pablo bristle 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.919
 veil is not he but from 1 light dawn to courage 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.120
 what do you enter here 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.650
 pressed the value that we enter in this case 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.729
 is the world tone 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.830
 In this case, do 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.069
 and that will be the same from 1 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:15.639
 until 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.320
 borrÃ¡s were universities to the number that we know 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.800
 with step 1 do is going to write this up to the shoulder that what we 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.740
 we know 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.839
 we try 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.270
 and you will see that your name is a service 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.270
 we place 5 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.270
 one two three four or five 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.449
 it looks like it's going 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.449
 please only up to the number that we wish 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.740
 profiles and we place with step two 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.740
 fear in two 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.270
 3 5 why or why there was or not 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.589
 controls are three bad are five 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:59.539
 shelter and two in two 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:00.550
 good less 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.490
 those who did not understand 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.189
 I'll leave it 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.759
 the algorithm of undocumented in destruction in the description of 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.119
 video 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.770
 for those who want 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.650
 give your suggestion or pallero reviews 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.559
 about problems that had come up 

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:19.559
 Algorithm that I had sent him so you can visit my facebook page 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.319
 PC call and simplicity 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.740
 remember to click on 'like' after 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.210
 You can send your comment that I will gladly 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.419
 it's okay 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.099
 pending to help 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:35.800
 for friends up here the video tutorial I hope you liked it as 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.309
 improved 

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:38.160
 to do 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.219
 it is understood 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.169
 and remember to subscribe to my channel that 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.009
 after 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:46.480
 if I was still very new and I hope that 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.639
 we will be fine 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.259
 good friend I do not get wet until the next tutorial
