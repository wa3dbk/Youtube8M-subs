00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
choices and we kind of discovered this

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.309 
choices and we kind of discovered this
on<00:02:16.980> accident<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.700> know<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.720> can<00:02:18.959> do<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.080> with<00:02:19.290> a

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
on accident I know you can do it with a

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.530 
on accident I know you can do it with a
Yuki<00:02:19.830> legend<00:02:20.220> rider<00:02:20.400> series<00:02:20.670> well<00:02:21.000> it'll<00:02:21.209> I
