 as a protective casing 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.890
 allows to use the tablet in certain 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.890

 what is the surface is a 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.450
 surface 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.280
 as rubber coated 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.860

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:02.490
 as in the upper area where it is 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.490
 where would be the one that would cover the screen 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.530
 we have the coverages 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.110
 and that correspond with him with the 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.110
 tablet the camera area 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.900
 and we see how 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.210
 it opens 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.620

 is well adapted and is useful for the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.710
 pencil me 10 then it is to check it with a 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.710
 own dell latitude 10 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.620
 the accessory fits quite well 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.560

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.400

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.400
 pretty fixed 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.710
 in fact it is well adapted to what it is 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.710
 the tablet itself 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.100
 to the overtures 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.690
 is 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.450
 really accurate it shows that it's a 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.500
 official product and done conscientiously 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.500
 for this tablet 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.640
 if it is perfect perfectly marked 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.670
 what is the camera of the device and 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.210
 it even looks like it's fine 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.640
 centered what is the slot of the 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:04.360
 sd card card we can 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:08.130
 to use with the latitude 10 the rest 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.130
 of ports and connections 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.910
 the area of the external speaker to one side and 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:20.670
 other 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:24.860
 and important the connection connections 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.860
 to load the device 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:35.400
 this protective case this accessory 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.860
 Latitude protector 10 is not just a 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.570
 good option to transport the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.900
 device and to keep it protected 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.509
 but also 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:50.260
 will serve us to be able 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:54.270
 I will use the tablet 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:57.270
 in desktop mode not in position 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.270
 desktop 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.310
 we can see how the screen will support 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.690
 perfectly what is the surface 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.690
 of the accessory 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:15.990
 there is a good friction except this 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:20.190
 position maybe that's the one 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.100
 makes the weight of the screen is not 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.090
 too much for support 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.420
 for the plastic support of the area 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.420
 rear 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.810
 We see that the most recommendable position or 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.870
 which supports the weight of the screen better 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.980
 it would be this 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:47.289
 I'm going even if we could leave space 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:50.309
 enough to use for example 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.309
 a keyboard 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:00.710
 and be able to use the tablet as 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:05.770
 office tool and to type with 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.770
 electronic or text with greater comfort
