00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.170 
what do you guys say you're ready to do

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.379 
what do you guys say you're ready to do
some<00:00:01.380> work<00:00:01.560> on<00:00:01.740> it<00:00:01.920> me<00:00:02.460> too<00:00:02.639> okay<00:00:02.879> since<00:00:03.270> you

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
some work on it me too okay since you

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.900 
some work on it me too okay since you
guys<00:00:03.510> were<00:00:03.689> last<00:00:03.990> here<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:05.279> zenzai<00:00:05.730> was<00:00:05.819> on

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
guys were last here and zenzai was on

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.259 
guys were last here and zenzai was on
vacation<00:00:06.060> my<00:00:06.480> dad<00:00:06.629> took<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.049> carburetors<00:00:08.010> off

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
vacation my dad took the carburetors off

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.129 
vacation my dad took the carburetors off
apparently<00:00:09.269> cleaned<00:00:09.540> them<00:00:09.660> out<00:00:09.719> really<00:00:09.929> good

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
apparently cleaned them out really good

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.169 
apparently cleaned them out really good
it's<00:00:10.290> still<00:00:10.469> kind<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.710> dirty<00:00:11.190> down<00:00:11.519> inside<00:00:12.000> of

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
it's still kind of dirty down inside of

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.190 
it's still kind of dirty down inside of
there<00:00:12.300> though<00:00:12.450> maybe<00:00:12.750> we'll<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.110> do

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
there though maybe we'll have to do

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.570 
there though maybe we'll have to do
something<00:00:13.500> about<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.950> don't<00:00:14.280> know<00:00:14.340> what

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
something about that I don't know what

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.620 
something about that I don't know what
though<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.000> here's<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.299> thing<00:00:15.480> about

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
though so here's the thing about

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.330 
though so here's the thing about
starters<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.289> guys<00:00:16.410> remember<00:00:16.740> how<00:00:16.859> last<00:00:17.039> time

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
starters you guys remember how last time

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.429 
starters you guys remember how last time
we<00:00:18.270> took<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.600> whole<00:00:18.779> starter<00:00:19.050> apart<00:00:19.320> and

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
we took this whole starter apart and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.050 
we took this whole starter apart and
like<00:00:19.500> rebuilt<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.070> wearing<00:00:20.430> gloves<00:00:20.609> today<00:00:20.850> by

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
like rebuilt it wearing gloves today by

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.490 
like rebuilt it wearing gloves today by
the<00:00:21.119> way<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.740> did<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> again<00:00:23.580> because

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
the way I just did it again because

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.230 
the way I just did it again because
inside<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.529> here<00:00:26.010> there's<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> little<00:00:26.820> bushing

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
inside of here there's a little bushing

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.870 
inside of here there's a little bushing
and<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:28.050> whole<00:00:28.260> shaft<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.859> loose<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.760> what

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
and this whole shaft was loose so what

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.189 
and this whole shaft was loose so what
we<00:00:29.970> think<00:00:30.150> what's<00:00:30.300> happening<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
we think what's happening is that in the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
we think what's happening is that in the
back<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.740> especially<00:00:32.009> loose<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.910> my<00:00:33.030> dad<00:00:33.180> got

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
back was especially loose so my dad got

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.549 
back was especially loose so my dad got
new<00:00:33.510> bushings<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:33.989> he<00:00:34.050> put<00:00:34.230> him<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.380> there

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
new bushings and he put him in there

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.959 
new bushings and he put him in there
while<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.710> was<00:00:34.890> away<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.100> vacation<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.790> then<00:00:35.880> I

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
while I was away on vacation and then I

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.370 
while I was away on vacation and then I
came<00:00:36.030> over<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.660> reassemble<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
came over here and I reassemble the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
came over here and I reassemble the
starter<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.430> hopefully<00:00:38.760> what's<00:00:38.879> gonna<00:00:39.000> happen

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
starter so hopefully what's gonna happen

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.090 
starter so hopefully what's gonna happen
now<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.420> when<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.870> starter<00:00:40.170> throws<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.860> gear

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
now is when the starter throws this gear

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400 
now is when the starter throws this gear
forward<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.820> not<00:00:41.910> gonna<00:00:42.120> wiggle<00:00:42.480> around<00:00:42.989> or

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
forward it's not gonna wiggle around or

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.779 
forward it's not gonna wiggle around or
throw<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> side<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.640> hits

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
throw it off to the side so that it hits

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.490 
throw it off to the side so that it hits
the<00:00:44.940> flywheel<00:00:45.450> or<00:00:45.480> anything<00:00:45.870> hopefully<00:00:46.050> this

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the flywheel or anything hopefully this

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.680 
the flywheel or anything hopefully this
will<00:00:46.620> make<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> tight<00:00:47.190> we'll<00:00:47.910> see<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.270> thusly

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
will make it tight we'll see and thusly

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.900 
will make it tight we'll see and thusly
that'll<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> solution<00:00:49.980> rather<00:00:50.670> than

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
that'll be the solution rather than

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.639 
that'll be the solution rather than
tearing<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> whole<00:00:51.420> engine<00:00:52.199> apart<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
tearing the whole engine apart and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.040 
tearing the whole engine apart and
replacing<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.449> torque<00:00:54.449> converter<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.899> has

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
replacing the torque converter that has

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.619 
replacing the torque converter that has
the<00:00:55.260> ring<00:00:55.530> gear<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.210> hopefully<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.510> will

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the ring gear on it hopefully this will

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.049 
the ring gear on it hopefully this will
fix<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.020> hopefully<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.309> starter<00:00:59.940> is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
fix it hopefully there it is starter is

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.049 
fix it hopefully there it is starter is
back<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:01.160> we're<00:01:02.160> gonna<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.640> compression

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
back in we're gonna do some compression

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
back in we're gonna do some compression
checks<00:01:03.510> before<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.260> any<00:01:04.439> further<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
checks before we go any further just to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.740 
checks before we go any further just to
make<00:01:05.369> sure<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.670> don't<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.880> any<00:01:05.939> burnt<00:01:06.270> valves

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
make sure we don't have any burnt valves

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.780 
make sure we don't have any burnt valves
or<00:01:06.869> anything<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.100> good<00:01:08.250> stuff

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
or anything you know the good stuff

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.940 
or anything you know the good stuff
simple<00:01:09.450> easy<00:01:09.600> stuff<00:01:10.170> got<00:01:10.409> good<00:01:10.590> news<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.890> I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
simple easy stuff got good news and I

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.940 
simple easy stuff got good news and I
got<00:01:10.979> bad<00:01:11.130> news<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.270> starter<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:13.710> did<00:01:13.860> do

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
got bad news the starter what we did do

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.990 
got bad news the starter what we did do
it<00:01:14.040> didn't<00:01:14.250> fix<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:14.760> it's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it didn't fix it so I think it's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.490 
it didn't fix it so I think it's
definitely<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.630> ring<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.200> which<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
definitely the ring here now which is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.870 
definitely the ring here now which is
very<00:01:16.770> expensive<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.189> very<00:01:17.250> difficult<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.759> do

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
very expensive and very difficult to do

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
very expensive and very difficult to do
so<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.780> happening<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.229> now

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so not happening right now

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
so not happening right now
but<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.490> did<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> compression<00:01:21.180> check<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.540> all

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
but we did a compression check on all

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.260 
but we did a compression check on all
the<00:01:21.659> cylinders<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.950> got<00:01:23.130> super<00:01:24.060> good

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the cylinders we got super good

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.780 
the cylinders we got super good
compression<00:01:24.630> everywhere<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.860> that's<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.400> good

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
compression everywhere so that's a good

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.679 
compression everywhere so that's a good
sign<00:01:27.060> right<00:01:27.390> there

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
sign right there

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.719 
sign right there
that's<00:01:28.290> some<00:01:28.439> powerful<00:01:28.770> compression<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.700> a

accelerator I got to work on that other

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.220 
accelerator I got to work on that other
than<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.849> I<00:03:20.879> think<00:03:21.030> we're<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.659> think<00:03:22.019> we're

Degrassi<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:04.019> I'm<00:04:04.860> going<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.280> predict<00:04:05.640> this

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760

not dead but she has

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.080 
not dead but she has

the car she got hit by the car because

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.750
