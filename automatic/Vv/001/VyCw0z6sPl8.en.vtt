water<00:02:05.610> left<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.840> lot<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.409> people<00:02:07.560> sponge<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
water left a lot of people sponge and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.270 
water left a lot of people sponge and
they<00:02:09.360> still<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.929> water<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.679> there<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.129> you've

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
they still have water in there so you've

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.830 
they still have water in there so you've
got<00:02:11.489> water<00:02:11.849> running<00:02:12.270> every

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
got water running every

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.290 
got water running every
we're<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.650> runs<00:02:13.980> your<00:02:14.190> design<00:02:14.610> so

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
we're and it just runs your design so

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.420 
we're and it just runs your design so

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
you want to completely ring that out

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.479 
you want to completely ring that out
till<00:02:17.730> there's<00:02:18.000> no<00:02:18.390> water<00:02:18.870> left<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.860> then

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
till there's no water left and then

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.190 
till there's no water left and then
we're<00:02:20.730> gonna<00:02:20.819> start<00:02:21.269> with<00:02:21.390> our<00:02:21.450> first<00:02:21.840> color

their<00:02:39.660> sponge<00:02:40.140> directly<00:02:41.010> into<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.700> paint

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
their sponge directly into the paint

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.020 
their sponge directly into the paint
which<00:02:42.720> we<00:02:43.019> do<00:02:43.200> not<00:02:43.530> want<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.459> because<00:02:44.670> then

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
which we do not want to do because then

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.600 
which we do not want to do because then
you<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:45.180> have<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:46.019> blob<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.040> I'll<00:02:47.160> show<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
you just have a blob and I'll show you a

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.250 
you just have a blob and I'll show you a
paint<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:49.019> if<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.620> instead<00:02:50.549> take<00:02:51.510> your<00:02:51.780> sponge

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
paint so if you instead take your sponge

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.850 
paint so if you instead take your sponge
and<00:02:52.709> pull<00:02:53.519> your<00:02:53.819> paint<00:02:54.329> I'm<00:02:55.079> taking<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.709> edge

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
and pull your paint I'm taking the edge

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.289 
and pull your paint I'm taking the edge
of<00:02:56.099> it<00:02:56.220> I'm<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.700> middle<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
of it I'm not in the middle of that and

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.680 
of it I'm not in the middle of that and
then<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.079> have<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:58.920> here<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.819> sponge

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
then you have this here and you sponge

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.630 
then you have this here and you sponge
off<00:03:01.019> of<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.410> then<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.769> get<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.010> nice<00:03:02.340> even

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
off of that then you get a nice even

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.330 
off of that then you get a nice even
design<00:03:03.420> instead<00:03:04.079> of<00:03:04.200> just<00:03:04.470> splotches<00:03:05.129> of

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
design instead of just splotches of

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.150 
design instead of just splotches of
paint<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:06.599> we're<00:03:07.170> gonna<00:03:07.260> come<00:03:07.620> over<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.069> our

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
paint so we're gonna come over to our

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.949 
paint so we're gonna come over to our
gourd<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.760> always<00:03:09.000> start<00:03:09.390> at<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.690> bottom

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959

can<00:03:18.480> stop<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.319> probably<00:03:19.920> won't<00:03:20.100> affect

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
can stop and it's probably won't affect

straight<00:04:09.419> up<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.810> down<00:04:09.870> don't<00:04:10.530> ever<00:04:10.889> pull<00:04:11.310> it

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
straight up and down don't ever pull it

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.699 
straight up and down don't ever pull it
or<00:04:11.730> turn<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.299> then<00:04:12.630> you'll<00:04:12.840> get<00:04:13.049> kind<00:04:13.319> of<00:04:13.530> a

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
or turn it then you'll get kind of a

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.580 
or turn it then you'll get kind of a
drag<00:04:14.549> lining<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.299> don't<00:04:15.510> want<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.229> by

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
drag lining you don't want that and by

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.129 
drag lining you don't want that and by
turning<00:04:17.099> it<00:04:17.250> as<00:04:17.430> you're<00:04:17.700> going<00:04:17.729> it<00:04:18.269> keeps<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
turning it as you're going it keeps the

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.800 
turning it as you're going it keeps the
design<00:04:19.500> moving<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.130> stuff<00:04:20.310> staying<00:04:20.789> in<00:04:21.060> same

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
design moving and stuff staying in same

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.260 
design moving and stuff staying in same
in<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.079> row<00:04:22.349> so<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.770> have<00:04:23.039> one<00:04:23.340> design<00:04:23.729> that's

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
in a row so you have one design that's

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.909 
in a row so you have one design that's
exactly<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.720> same<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.199> don't<00:04:25.470> want<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.889> you

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
exactly the same you don't want it you

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.119 
exactly the same you don't want it you
want<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.370> very<00:04:26.990> let's<00:04:27.990> see<00:04:28.139> how<00:04:28.410> fast<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:28.949> easy

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
want it very let's see how fast and easy

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.580 
want it very let's see how fast and easy
that<00:04:29.310> was<00:04:29.789> we've<00:04:30.419> got<00:04:30.629> that<00:04:30.780> all<00:04:30.840> nice<00:04:31.259> and

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
that was we've got that all nice and

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.189 
that was we've got that all nice and
neat<00:04:31.770> on<00:04:32.009> there<00:04:32.400> so<00:04:33.180> I'm<00:04:33.419> gonna<00:04:33.659> go<00:04:33.990> over<00:04:34.020> here

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
neat on there so I'm gonna go over here

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.409 
neat on there so I'm gonna go over here
and<00:04:34.530> rinse<00:04:34.889> my<00:04:35.099> color<00:04:35.460> out<00:04:35.789> and<00:04:36.180> we're<00:04:36.300> gonna

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
and rinse my color out and we're gonna

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.730 
and rinse my color out and we're gonna
go<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:37.349> brown<00:04:37.650> when<00:04:38.430> I'm<00:04:38.580> doing

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
go to the brown when I'm doing

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.670 
go to the brown when I'm doing
background<00:04:40.740> textures<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.849> usually<00:04:42.840> do<00:04:43.110> two

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
background textures I usually do two

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.700 
background textures I usually do two
colors<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.699> think<00:04:45.150> it<00:04:45.419> makes<00:04:45.569> it<00:04:45.720> look<00:04:45.780> just<00:04:46.259> a

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
colors I think it makes it look just a

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.760 
colors I think it makes it look just a
little<00:04:46.889> bit<00:04:47.039> nicer<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.539> could<00:04:48.900> do<00:04:49.110> three<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.500> do

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
little bit nicer you could do three I do

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.309 
little bit nicer you could do three I do
not<00:04:50.250> recommend<00:04:50.819> any<00:04:51.300> more<00:04:51.750> than<00:04:52.020> three

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
not recommend any more than three

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.960 
not recommend any more than three
because<00:04:52.620> then<00:04:52.710> you're<00:04:52.889> gonna<00:04:52.979> start<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.639> muddy

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
because then you're gonna start to muddy

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.040 
because then you're gonna start to muddy
it<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:55.110> don't<00:04:55.289> want<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.740> do<00:04:55.949> that<00:04:56.930> so<00:04:57.930> we're

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
this out so we're walking it bouncing it

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.490 
this out so we're walking it bouncing it
straight<00:05:14.699> up<00:05:14.849> and<00:05:15.060> down<00:05:15.120> when<00:05:15.810> I<00:05:15.870> tell<00:05:16.259> you<00:05:16.380> not

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
straight up and down when I tell you not

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.709 
straight up and down when I tell you not
to<00:05:16.560> slide<00:05:17.099> on<00:05:17.340> your<00:05:17.460> gourd<00:05:17.729> if<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.060> slide<00:05:18.449> you

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
end up with something like that on your

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.619 
end up with something like that on your
gourd<00:05:20.789> as<00:05:20.969> well<00:05:21.240> so<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:21.900> want<00:05:22.289> that<00:05:22.500> bounce<00:05:23.629> to

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629 
gourd as well so you want that bounce to

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.740 
gourd as well so you want that bounce to
it<00:05:24.800> so<00:05:25.800> we're<00:05:25.979> gonna<00:05:26.039> come<00:05:26.490> in<00:05:26.669> here<00:05:27.000> now<00:05:27.270> and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
it so we're gonna come in here now and

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.260 
it so we're gonna come in here now and
we're<00:05:28.020> just<00:05:28.409> gonna<00:05:28.620> go<00:05:28.860> here<00:05:29.280> and<00:05:29.430> there<00:05:29.819> and

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
we're just gonna go here and there and

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.270 
we're just gonna go here and there and
you<00:05:30.810> can<00:05:31.080> do<00:05:31.259> this

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
you can do this

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.309 
you can do this
heavier<00:05:33.060> lighter<00:05:34.340> whatever<00:05:35.509> you<00:05:36.509> want

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
heavier lighter whatever you want

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.769 
heavier lighter whatever you want
remember<00:05:37.919> you<00:05:38.069> can<00:05:38.219> always<00:05:38.490> go<00:05:38.819> back<00:05:38.849> and<00:05:39.150> add

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:39.779 
remember you can always go back and add

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:43.070 
remember you can always go back and add
more<00:05:40.430> you<00:05:41.430> can<00:05:41.639> it's<00:05:41.789> not<00:05:41.880> as<00:05:42.150> easy<00:05:42.300> to<00:05:42.509> take<00:05:42.870> it

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
more you can it's not as easy to take it

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.350 
more you can it's not as easy to take it
off<00:05:43.289> so<00:05:44.039> I<00:05:44.069> would<00:05:44.430> always<00:05:44.639> start<00:05:45.060> out<00:05:45.210> a<00:05:45.240> little

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
off so I would always start out a little

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.620 
off so I would always start out a little
bit<00:05:45.870> lighter<00:05:46.400> if<00:05:47.400> you<00:05:47.729> were<00:05:47.940> just<00:05:48.270> starting

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
bit lighter if you were just starting

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.899 
bit lighter if you were just starting
out<00:05:48.960> how<00:05:49.259> you<00:05:49.319> kind<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.889> know<00:05:50.130> what<00:05:50.400> you<00:05:50.580> want

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 
out how you kind of know what you want

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.269 
out how you kind of know what you want
and<00:05:51.180> then<00:05:51.630> you<00:05:51.750> can<00:05:51.900> always<00:05:52.169> go<00:05:52.319> back<00:05:52.500> and<00:05:52.800> add

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
and then you can always go back and add

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:57.200 
and then you can always go back and add
more<00:05:54.259> in<00:05:55.370> sometimes<00:05:56.370> when<00:05:56.789> I'm<00:05:56.909> doing<00:05:57.029> my

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
more in sometimes when I'm doing my

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.730 
more in sometimes when I'm doing my
design<00:05:57.659> I'll<00:05:57.840> come<00:05:58.110> in<00:05:58.409> and<00:05:59.029> I<00:06:00.029> will<00:06:00.509> do<00:06:01.110> like<00:06:01.529> a

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
design I'll come in and I will do like a

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.279 
design I'll come in and I will do like a
lot<00:06:02.219> of<00:06:02.250> one<00:06:02.789> color<00:06:03.120> and<00:06:03.330> then<00:06:03.659> just<00:06:03.870> a<00:06:04.020> little

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
lot of one color and then just a little

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.480 
lot of one color and then just a little
bit<00:06:04.620> of<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:05.639> next<00:06:06.029> two<00:06:06.330> colors<00:06:07.190> for<00:06:08.190> my

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
bit of the next two colors for my

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.399 
bit of the next two colors for my
backgrounds<00:06:09.360> a<00:06:09.449> lot<00:06:09.569> of<00:06:09.659> times<00:06:09.870> I<00:06:09.990> use<00:06:10.020> my

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
backgrounds a lot of times I use my

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:13.610 
backgrounds a lot of times I use my
texture<00:06:11.130> brush<00:06:11.400> in<00:06:11.610> my<00:06:11.639> wax<00:06:12.120> I<00:06:12.659> do<00:06:13.110> have<00:06:13.590> a

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
texture brush in my wax I do have a

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.610 
texture brush in my wax I do have a
video<00:06:14.099> up<00:06:14.430> on<00:06:14.610> that<00:06:14.940> now<00:06:15.300> so<00:06:15.960> that's<00:06:16.139> another

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
video up on that now so that's another

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.769 
video up on that now so that's another
really<00:06:17.130> fun<00:06:17.669> technique<00:06:18.120> and<00:06:18.539> you're<00:06:18.630> just

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
really fun technique and you're just

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.019 
really fun technique and you're just
using<00:06:18.990> your<00:06:19.259> Crayola<00:06:19.590> so<00:06:20.430> you<00:06:20.520> don't<00:06:20.669> have<00:06:20.880> to

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
using your Crayola so you don't have to

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.420 
using your Crayola so you don't have to
have<00:06:21.180> any<00:06:21.389> other<00:06:21.630> products<00:06:22.259> so<00:06:23.069> check<00:06:23.400> that

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
have any other products so check that

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.430 
have any other products so check that
out<00:06:23.969> as<00:06:24.240> well<00:06:24.479> and<00:06:24.779> that's<00:06:24.870> how<00:06:25.110> to<00:06:25.169> use<00:06:25.259> the

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
out as well and that's how to use the

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.820 
out as well and that's how to use the
texture<00:06:26.159> brush<00:06:26.520> and<00:06:26.759> insert<00:06:27.529> okay

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
texture brush and insert okay

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.279 
texture brush and insert okay
now<00:06:29.490> isn't<00:06:29.819> that<00:06:30.000> fun<00:06:30.330> we've<00:06:30.599> got<00:06:30.810> that<00:06:31.050> all

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
now isn't that fun we've got that all

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.459 
now isn't that fun we've got that all
nice<00:06:31.620> and<00:06:32.009> neatly<00:06:33.000> on<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.659> one<00:06:33.870> difference

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
nice and neatly on the one difference

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.220 
nice and neatly on the one difference
between<00:06:35.009> this<00:06:35.539> sponging<00:06:36.539> it<00:06:36.630> on<00:06:36.810> and<00:06:37.050> you

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
between this sponging it on and you

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.650 
between this sponging it on and you
the<00:06:37.470> texture<00:06:37.980> brush<00:06:38.160> I<00:06:38.310> will<00:06:38.520> say<00:06:38.790> you<00:06:39.330> can<00:06:39.540> go

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
the texture brush I will say you can go

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.990 
the texture brush I will say you can go
over<00:06:39.870> this<00:06:40.230> with<00:06:40.530> the<00:06:40.650> Crayola<00:06:40.980> design<00:06:41.700> and

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
over this with the Crayola design and

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.850 
over this with the Crayola design and
not<00:06:42.390> have<00:06:42.660> to<00:06:42.810> worry<00:06:43.050> about<00:06:43.320> it<00:06:43.470> whereas<00:06:43.650> if

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
not have to worry about it whereas if

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.100 
not have to worry about it whereas if
you're<00:06:44.040> using<00:06:44.280> the<00:06:44.520> texture<00:06:45.000> brush<00:06:45.360> I<00:06:45.690> always

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
you're using the texture brush I always

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.170 
you're using the texture brush I always
do<00:06:46.320> the<00:06:46.500> design<00:06:46.860> first<00:06:47.190> because<00:06:47.550> you<00:06:47.700> can't<00:06:47.970> go

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
do the design first because you can't go

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.390 
do the design first because you can't go
over<00:06:48.630> those<00:06:48.780> areas<00:06:49.110> because<00:06:49.530> it's<00:06:49.710> wax<00:06:50.070> and

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
over those areas because it's wax and

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.790 
over those areas because it's wax and
it's<00:06:50.520> already<00:06:50.820> cool<00:06:51.120> so<00:06:51.870> you<00:06:51.960> want<00:06:52.350> there<00:06:52.530> is

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
it's already cool so you want there is

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.490 
it's already cool so you want there is
that<00:06:53.070> distinctive<00:06:53.760> difference<00:06:54.390> it's<00:06:55.380> just

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
that distinctive difference it's just

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.340 
that distinctive difference it's just
all<00:06:55.890> in<00:06:56.340> what<00:06:56.700> you<00:06:56.910> want<00:06:57.210> but<00:06:57.540> this<00:06:57.720> is<00:06:57.780> this<00:06:58.290> is
