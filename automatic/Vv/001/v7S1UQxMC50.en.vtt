and<00:00:04.500> again<00:00:04.740> spoke<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.220> us<00:00:05.310> about<00:00:05.880> the<00:00:06.240> healing

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
and again spoke to us about the healing

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.240 
and again spoke to us about the healing
of<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.660> nervous<00:00:06.930> system<00:00:07.260> and<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.800> pretty

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
of the nervous system and and pretty

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.770 
of the nervous system and and pretty
dramatic<00:00:08.760> way<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.090> remember<00:00:09.450> really<00:00:09.660> clearly

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
dramatic way I remember really clearly

dramatic way I remember really clearly
we<00:00:10.380> were<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.969> YWCA<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.990> Singapore<00:00:13.589> and

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
we were in a YWCA and in Singapore and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.500 
we were in a YWCA and in Singapore and
at<00:00:16.200> the<00:00:16.440> beginning<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.550> try<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> kind<00:00:18.420> of

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
at the beginning we we try to kind of

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.180 
at the beginning we we try to kind of
bear<00:00:18.660> each<00:00:18.780> other's<00:00:18.930> burdens<00:00:19.290> and<00:00:19.860> know<00:00:19.980> how

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
bear each other's burdens and know how

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.740 
bear each other's burdens and know how
we're<00:00:20.370> doing<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.940> there<00:00:21.540> was<00:00:21.660> just

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
we're doing and there was just

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.480 
we're doing and there was just
remarkable<00:00:22.200> thing<00:00:22.620> that<00:00:22.770> I<00:00:22.800> think<00:00:22.920> six

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
remarkable thing that I think six

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.940 
remarkable thing that I think six
different<00:00:23.820> members<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.540> GL<00:00:25.440> teal<00:00:25.650> or

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
different members of the GL teal or

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.390 
different members of the GL teal or
their<00:00:26.430> spouses<00:00:26.960> had<00:00:27.960> serious<00:00:28.560> diseases<00:00:29.130> of

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
their spouses had serious diseases of

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.430 
their spouses had serious diseases of
the<00:00:29.430> nervous<00:00:29.520> system<00:00:29.850> like<00:00:30.660> multiple

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.440 
the nervous system like multiple

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.970 
the nervous system like multiple
sclerosis<00:00:33.020> and<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.140> went<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.440> prayer<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.800> that

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
sclerosis and we went to prayer for that

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.979 
sclerosis and we went to prayer for that
and<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.999> God<00:00:36.269> just<00:00:36.329> opened<00:00:36.929> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and it was like God just opened the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.840 
and it was like God just opened the
scriptures<00:00:37.199> to<00:00:37.589> us<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.309> guy<00:00:38.579> was<00:00:38.760> saying

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
scriptures to us and and guy was saying

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.950 
scriptures to us and and guy was saying
the<00:00:38.999> same<00:00:39.030> thing<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.660> many<00:00:39.749> different

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the same thing to so many different

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.899 
the same thing to so many different
people<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:40.440> once<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.159> this<00:00:41.339> was<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.519> prophetic

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:41.909 
people at once so this was a prophetic

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.049 
people at once so this was a prophetic
message<00:00:42.269> for<00:00:43.050> all<00:00:43.109> of<00:00:43.260> while<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.940> as

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
message for all of while I'm and and as

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.729 
message for all of while I'm and and as
we<00:00:45.210> unpack<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.749> as<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.050> prayed<00:00:46.350> about<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
we unpack that as we prayed about and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
we unpack that as we prayed about and
thought<00:00:46.980> about<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.969> became<00:00:48.359> a<00:00:48.420> real

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
thought about it it became a real

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.569 
thought about it it became a real
defining<00:00:49.199> thing<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.589> those<00:00:49.710> few<00:00:50.010> days<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
defining thing for those few days and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.270 
defining thing for those few days and
and<00:00:51.379> particularly<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.800> thought<00:00:52.949> about<00:00:53.069> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and particularly we we thought about the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.790 
and particularly we we thought about the
synapses<00:00:53.850> how<00:00:54.059> how<00:00:54.690> within<00:00:55.170> our<00:00:55.440> nervous

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
synapses how how within our nervous

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.829 
synapses how how within our nervous
cells<00:00:56.670> within<00:00:56.999> the<00:00:57.179> cells<00:00:57.479> of<00:00:57.600> our<00:00:57.629> nervous

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
cells within the cells of our nervous

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.349 
cells within the cells of our nervous
system<00:00:58.260> there<00:00:58.440> are<00:00:59.089> the<00:01:00.089> little<00:01:00.329> gaps<00:01:00.569> and<00:01:01.190> and

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
system there are the little gaps and and

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.340 
system there are the little gaps and and
communication<00:01:03.359> occurs<00:01:03.690> over<00:01:03.870> those<00:01:04.110> gaps

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
communication occurs over those gaps

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.110 
communication occurs over those gaps
little<00:01:04.800> electrical<00:01:05.220> impulses<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:05.909> across

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
little electrical impulses to go across

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.450 
little electrical impulses to go across
and<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.690> our<00:01:06.810> synapse<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.439> we're<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:07.979> firing

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and that our synapse is we're not firing

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.429 
and that our synapse is we're not firing
that<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.270> were<00:01:09.360> isolated<00:01:09.540> from<00:01:09.899> each<00:01:10.110> other<00:01:10.290> we

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that we were isolated from each other we

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.319 
that we were isolated from each other we
were<00:01:10.560> independent<00:01:11.070> from<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.310> another<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
were independent from one another and it

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.060 
were independent from one another and it
was<00:01:12.479> through<00:01:12.719> that<00:01:12.750> prophetic<00:01:13.500> imagery<00:01:13.920> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
was through that prophetic imagery of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.920 
was through that prophetic imagery of
praying<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.490> people<00:01:14.700> who<00:01:14.909> were<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.210> well

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
praying for people who were not well

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.100 
praying for people who were not well
that<00:01:16.920> God<00:01:17.670> spoke<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> us<00:01:18.390> you're<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.899> well

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that God spoke to us you're not well

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.230 
that God spoke to us you're not well
pray<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.860> I'll<00:01:19.979> heal<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.030> we've

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
pray that I'll heal you and and we've

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.029 
pray that I'll heal you and and we've
started<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.659> system<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.110> healing<00:01:22.259> where<00:01:22.920> we've

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
started a system of healing where we've

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.029 
started a system of healing where we've
had<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.340> take<00:01:23.990> action<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.259> obedience<00:01:25.829> but<00:01:25.950> I

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
had to take action of obedience but I

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.980 
had to take action of obedience but I
think<00:01:26.219> God<00:01:26.549> also<00:01:26.789> is<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.270> doing<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.659> healing

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
think God also is just doing a healing

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.709 
think God also is just doing a healing

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.050 
and proper eldering functions you know
it's<00:01:49.049> because<00:01:49.469> when<00:01:50.429> God<00:01:50.579> speaks<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
it's because when God speaks to

teams need to be telling our stories
that's<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.219> important<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:05.700> also<00:02:05.850> an<00:02:06.179> avenue

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
that's so important but also an avenue

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.740 
that's so important but also an avenue
of<00:02:07.910> communicating<00:02:08.910> what<00:02:09.060> God<00:02:09.240> is<00:02:09.390> saying<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
of communicating what God is saying to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.410 
of communicating what God is saying to
us<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.640> responsibilities<00:02:12.390> of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
us and the the responsibilities of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.050 
us and the the responsibilities of
leadership<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.709> ability<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.220> do<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
leadership and the ability to do the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.710 
leadership and the ability to do the
practicalities<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.840> commune

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
practicalities of commune

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.539 
practicalities of commune
just<00:02:17.049> too<00:02:17.260> much<00:02:17.409> to<00:02:17.650> put<00:02:17.860> into<00:02:18.010> one<00:02:18.370> or<00:02:18.519> two

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
just too much to put into one or two

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.149 
just too much to put into one or two
people<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:19.840> think<00:02:19.959> every<00:02:20.500> leadership<00:02:20.920> team

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
people so I think every leadership team

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.490 
people so I think every leadership team
needs<00:02:22.030> people<00:02:22.329> standing<00:02:22.780> alongside<00:02:23.049> who<00:02:23.409> were

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
needs people standing alongside who were

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.920 
needs people standing alongside who were
called<00:02:23.890> there<00:02:24.189> to<00:02:24.459> communicate<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.299> when

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
when they're working well together then

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.199 
when they're working well together then
we<00:02:28.360> got<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> healthy<00:02:28.989> nervous<00:02:29.260> system

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209

well glt responded very positively

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.740 
well glt responded very positively

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750

on<00:03:54.069> I<00:03:54.099> think<00:03:54.190> that's<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.669> biggest<00:03:54.970> missing

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
on I think that's the biggest missing

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.330 
on I think that's the biggest missing
part<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:55.959> our<00:03:56.079> communications<00:03:56.709> but<00:03:57.190> then

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
part of our communications but then

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.949 
part of our communications but then
there's<00:03:57.519> also<00:03:57.699> internal<00:03:58.359> communications

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
there's also internal communications

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.469 
there's also internal communications
where<00:03:59.169> you<00:03:59.769> know<00:03:59.859> we<00:04:00.010> meet<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.370> prayer<00:04:01.359> and

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
where you know we meet is a prayer and

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.180 
where you know we meet is a prayer and

top-down not at all but with a sense of
you<00:04:32.850> know<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.000> central<00:04:33.570> coordination<00:04:34.410> so<00:04:34.770> that

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
you know a central coordination so that

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.350 
you know a central coordination so that
we<00:04:35.040> know<00:04:35.220> what<00:04:35.430> we're<00:04:35.610> saying<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.150> and

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
we know what we're saying and the and

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.960 
we know what we're saying and the and
the<00:04:36.480> message<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:36.900> clear<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.850> getting<00:04:38.850> that

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
the message is clear and getting that

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.510 
the message is clear and getting that
right<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.390> a<00:04:39.630> big<00:04:39.960> task<00:04:40.290> but<00:04:40.530> I<00:04:40.950> believe<00:04:41.370> we're

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
right is a big task but I believe we're

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.770 
right is a big task but I believe we're
on<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.640> right<00:04:41.790> Road<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:43.730> I<00:04:44.730> think<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.150> also

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
on the right Road I I think that also

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.780 
on the right Road I I think that also
for<00:04:46.110> communications<00:04:46.680> teams<00:04:46.950> it's<00:04:47.430> just

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
for communications teams it's just

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.780 
for communications teams it's just
important<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.210> recognize<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:48.660> as<00:04:49.669> it<00:04:50.669> was

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
important to recognize that as it was

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.930 
important to recognize that as it was

communications with technology and it's

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.530

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
used in our purposes then then we get

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.200 
used in our purposes then then we get
out<00:05:32.790> of<00:05:32.940> touch<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.479> we<00:05:34.400> we<00:05:35.400> find<00:05:35.729> that<00:05:35.910> the

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
out of touch and we we find that the

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.790 
out of touch and we we find that the
communication<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.110> communicating<00:05:37.710> that

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
communication the communicating that

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.920 
communication the communicating that
we're<00:05:37.950> doing<00:05:38.160> is<00:05:38.490> not<00:05:38.820> attractive<00:05:39.570> to<00:05:39.840> young

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
we're doing is not attractive to young

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.050 
we're doing is not attractive to young
people<00:05:40.320> because<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.310> things<00:05:41.550> that<00:05:41.669> are

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
people because the things that are

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.310 
people because the things that are
happening<00:05:42.210> around<00:05:42.450> them<00:05:42.690> were<00:05:42.780> just<00:05:42.990> a<00:05:43.080> lot

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
happening around them were just a lot

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.190 
happening around them were just a lot
more<00:05:43.560> attention<00:05:44.010> grabbing<00:05:44.750> so<00:05:45.750> we<00:05:45.960> need<00:05:46.080> to

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
more attention grabbing so we need to

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.290 
more attention grabbing so we need to
use<00:05:46.380> those<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:47.220> best<00:05:47.490> cutting<00:05:47.880> edge<00:05:47.970> means

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
use those the best cutting edge means

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.140 
use those the best cutting edge means
were<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.780> best<00:05:48.990> possible<00:05:49.410> content<00:05:50.150> grabbing

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
were the best possible content grabbing

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.840 
were the best possible content grabbing
people's<00:05:51.450> attention<00:05:51.800> without<00:05:52.850> sacrificing

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
people's attention without sacrificing

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.950 
people's attention without sacrificing
integrity<00:05:54.810> truths<00:05:55.710> uprightness<00:05:56.720> big<00:05:57.720> ask

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
integrity truths uprightness big ask

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.380 
integrity truths uprightness big ask
again<00:05:58.380> and<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:58.890> big<00:05:59.100> challenge<00:05:59.280> so<00:05:59.640> I<00:05:59.850> think
