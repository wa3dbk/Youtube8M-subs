00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.770
 if you do not like this, omit what is a 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.770
 taste 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:52.250
 come on let's gild money and then the 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.530
 ingredients for our we take out 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.480
 let's go back a little while to include it 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.980
 more and less 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.700
 and then what are we going to do here 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.910
 the onion 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:12.790
 all the onions we are going to give you a 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.489
 life lasts because the ingredients a 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.269
 tomato 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.269
 we will also include 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.930
 but here we put it simple 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.230
 for 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.230
 the weaknesses 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.230
 well look here our onion is already 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.040
 throneless here you can see the 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.650
 transparent and the tomato released water and 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.170
 is already in herbón what we are going to do 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.170
 here is to put our cilantro 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.930
 what a beautiful color to true until 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.269
 appetite 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.989
 and we are going to add our teaspoon of 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.989
 chicken soup 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.430
 there we have it 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.329
 and we are going to add a little water 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:22.430
 to make it warmer and let it go 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.520
 watching about five minutes we turned off and what 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.310
 We reserve for when we occupy and 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.680
 it is ready our instead here I have 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.419
 and my children and I have left as for a 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.190
 because I 'm going to add the 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.340
 chicks when it is already half cooked 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.780
 bean there as you can appreciate 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.849
 then what we are going to do is 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.849
 add the chicks 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.889
 and adding them so that like the ox 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:50.879
 that is very fast is so that it does not 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.949
 undo in cooking then it's a 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.349
 half football thing with that the little square 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:59.740
 and does the rest of the preparation 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:01.900
 until his final term ready 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.330
 here what you need to check is that the 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.560
 water from your container where everything 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.169
 is ready this is not going to leave 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.090
 consuming you can go adding it 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.849
 you have to be moving him every time 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.300
 when it does not stick to you, it would not be 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.190
 hit look as you see there is my sun to 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.069
 half-cooked what I'm going to do is 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.800
 let it come to cooking already 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:29.990
 almost to the end to be able to add what 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.880
 which is the sausage and the rejection 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.910
 because our children is already in the 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.650
 final stage and haute cuisine the only thing 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.310
 let's do is add our collection 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:44.500
 that's how it was then it was already 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.500
 everything ready we are going to add it 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.080
 same if you want to listen to everything in 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.930
 raw walking be ready the bean what 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.449
 I can hear if our listeners 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.210
 do it previously but then from this 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:02.020
 way we give something different you can not 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.050
 prepare and try it 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.840
 my daughter rite is very small then 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.590
 I'm going to go to this including the file 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.590
 slowly 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:22.230
 because our salsita is going to inflate with 

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:25.510
 the heat and the water 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:28.540
 and we add the yes 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.370
 but let's let it boil in a 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.180
 last love so that the sausages would 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.930
 Cook well 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.090
 and our kids 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.550
 knowing that they are ready is when 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.370
 the bean is already cooked the sausage has 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.729
 increased its volume and our project 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.979
 it's already cooked it 's soft and it's 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:51.400
 ready our cases we come back for 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:54.460
