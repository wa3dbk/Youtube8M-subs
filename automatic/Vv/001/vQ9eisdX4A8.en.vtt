our friend Eric King from shred slits
and<00:00:38.000> his<00:00:38.120> subordinate<00:00:38.660> right<00:00:38.840> out

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.290 

in<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.499> four-wheel<00:00:46.949> design<00:00:47.339> different<00:00:48.210> than

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
in the four-wheel design different than

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.660 
in the four-wheel design different than
regular<00:00:48.449> caster<00:00:49.079> boards<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.589> they<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
regular caster boards and they have a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.599 
regular caster boards and they have a
crazy<00:00:51.539> torsion<00:00:52.109> bar<00:00:52.289> system<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:53.250> lets<00:00:53.519> you

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
crazy torsion bar system that lets you

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.430 
crazy torsion bar system that lets you
do<00:00:53.729> a<00:00:53.760> few<00:00:54.030> different<00:00:54.329> things<00:00:54.479> that<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.199> can't

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
do a few different things that you can't

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.259 
do a few different things that you can't
do<00:00:55.589> in<00:00:55.710> regular<00:00:56.010> cast<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> board<00:00:59.269> it's

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
do in regular cast the board it's

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.579 
do in regular cast the board it's
obviously<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.659> more<00:01:00.839> stable<00:01:01.049> board<00:01:01.350> because

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
obviously a more stable board because

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.039 
obviously a more stable board because
you<00:01:01.679> have<00:01:01.799> four<00:01:02.070> wheels<00:01:02.309> instead<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.760> two

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
you have four wheels instead of two

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.200 
you have four wheels instead of two
there's<00:01:04.049> yeah<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.799> great<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.039> beginners

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
there's yeah it's great for beginners

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.609 
there's yeah it's great for beginners
it's<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.299> great<00:01:06.600> workout<00:01:06.990> board<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.500> we've

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it's a great workout board and we've

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.260 
it's a great workout board and we've
found<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.039> it's<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.250> great<00:01:08.460> downhill<00:01:09.030> board

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
found that it's a great downhill board

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.820 
found that it's a great downhill board
you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.539> shred<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.020> nice<00:01:10.170> at<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.530> because

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you can shred really nice at it because

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.440 
you can shred really nice at it because
we're<00:01:11.039> actually<00:01:11.189> really<00:01:11.520> stable<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
we're actually really stable because you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.060 
we're actually really stable because you
have<00:01:12.539> a<00:01:12.600> lot<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.960> points<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.470> contacts<00:01:13.890> don't

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
have a lot of points of contacts don't

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.380 
have a lot of points of contacts don't
slide<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:19.490> one<00:01:20.490> feature<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.940> board<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.360> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
slide out one feature this board that I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.510 
slide out one feature this board that I
really<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.049> caster<00:01:22.409> system<00:01:22.590> they're

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
really like is the caster system they're

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
really like is the caster system they're
aluminum<00:01:23.729> casters<00:01:24.330> are<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.750> light<00:01:24.899> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
aluminum casters are really light and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.169 
aluminum casters are really light and
really<00:01:25.229> stable<00:01:25.709> and<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.090> are

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
really stable and if you see that are

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.480 
really stable and if you see that are
very<00:01:27.360> narrow<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.890> casters<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.369> very

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
very narrow the the casters are very

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.779 
very narrow the the casters are very
close<00:01:29.729> together<00:01:29.929> so<00:01:30.929> you<00:01:31.500> won't<00:01:31.770> split<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
close together so you won't split the

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.010 
close together so you won't split the
casters<00:01:33.179> opening<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.569> you<00:01:33.690> can<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
casters opening like you can on a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.930 
casters opening like you can on a
regular<00:01:34.259> steel<00:01:34.470> caster<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.069> then<00:01:35.670> another

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
regular steel caster and then another

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.539 
regular steel caster and then another
feature<00:01:36.209> I<00:01:36.330> really<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.979> hardware<00:01:41.340> this

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
feature I really like the hardware this

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.320 
feature I really like the hardware this
thing<00:01:41.789> doesn't<00:01:42.179> have<00:01:43.130> spacers<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.759> has<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> bolt

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
thing doesn't have spacers it has a bolt

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.690 
thing doesn't have spacers it has a bolt
and<00:01:45.569> a<00:01:46.200> nut<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.679> a<00:01:46.709> very<00:01:47.310> similar<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and a nut like a very similar to a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.809
