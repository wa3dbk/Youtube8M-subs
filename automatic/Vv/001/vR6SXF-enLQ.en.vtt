00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello girls how are you today we are going to 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.280
 learn to knit fantasy openwork knit 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.030
 this is the right side 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.110
 the side of time 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.420
 here I have two reasons across one and 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.910
 two and a few reasons on high 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.610
 the graph along with the explanation of 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.150
 the symbols I will leave posted on my 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:33.340
 blog and lincoln find down in the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.730
 information box below this video 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.610
 from the graph 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.280
 the reason has 15 points of the reason 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.989
 this is the one that repeats or is the point is 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.860
 multiple to 15 + 123 points on this side 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.350
 and 1 2 3 4 5 points on the other side are 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.930
 balance points 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.210
 at the top the motive is repeated from the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.760
 return number 1 to return number 7 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.100
 here indicated are not indicated 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.820
 even turns because we knit them like 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.970
 they present us the points and the fairies 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.430
 we weave with the point backwards also 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.430
 edge points are indicated 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.930
 well now let's weave a small 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.180
 shows a motive at the top and a 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.140
 reason to the night we are going to weave everything 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.260
 this 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.659
 and notice when they weave the first round 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.600
 we read the graph from the right towards 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.550
 the left we weave all those points 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.890
 up to here we repeat the reason 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.860
 that has 15 points as many times as 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.220
 necessary and finish the round with these 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.490
 good balance points we're going to 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.439
 mount 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:03.350
 As they need are about 15 16 17 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:06.470
 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 points 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.500
 return number 1 edge point lo 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.520
 we passed without knitting 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.180
 three points add 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.660
 one 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.370
 two 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.069
 and three 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.200
 Loop simple decrease for this 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.739
 we passed a point without knitting to the needle 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.829
 right we weave the next point to the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.510
 right and we slide the point that does not 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.930
 we wove 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.219
 over the knitting 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.219
 three points add 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:51.780
 seven points to the right two three four 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.780
 five six 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.970
 73 points upside down 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.050
 3 loops in new simple decrease 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.170
 we passed a point d without knitting the 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.660
 next point we weave it to the right and 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.150
 we slip the point that we do not weave on 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.409
 the woven knit 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.409
 three points dare 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.140
 and 3 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.120
 and we always knit the edge 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.010
 reverse row number 2 and all 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.800
 Even twists are woven as we are 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.280
 present the points we turn the 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.020
 We knit first knit without knitting 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.880
 notice the points that are to the right 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.880
 we weave them to the right 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.210
 the point that has knots is the point at 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:49.180
 reverse we weave it upside down 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:51.730
 the room we weave upside down 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.730
 right point upside down and so on all 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.069
 the even turns we weave as we are 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.069
 present the points 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:09.040
 turn number 3 edge point now 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.040
 we have three points add 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.859
 Loop simple decrease we passed a 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:20.949
 point without knitting the next stitch what 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.340
 we weave to the right we slide the point 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:27.600
 that we do not knit on the knit 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.600
 three points upside down 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.050
 Loop simple decrease 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.590
 three points to the right 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.250
 two points together to the right 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.830
 lazara 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.830
 three points upside down 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.170
 Loop simple decrease 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.940
 three points assaulting 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.220
 and last point also the other way around that is 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.110
 the edge point turned number 4 is 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:14.410
 weave as we are presented with the points 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.100
 return number 5 first point we had it 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:23.070
 without knitting three stitches upside down 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.070
 Loop simple decrease 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:31.849
 three points upside down 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:35.629
 next to the right lasso two points 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.629
 together to the right 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.440
 next to the simple decrease right 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.850
 each point to the right three points at 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.850
 reverse 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.739
 laced 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.739
 simple decrease 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.930
 three points upside down 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.789
 edge point 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.479
 return number 7 the last round of this 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:16.800
 motive first point we had it without knitting 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:19.460
 three points upside down lazada decrease 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.460
 simple 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.620
 three points upside down 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.590
 two points to the right 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.770
 loop now we passed 2 points without knitting 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.950
 from one needle to the next the next 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.230
 point we weave it to the right and now 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.620
 we slide the two points that we 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.620
 we said 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.460
 over the knitting 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.949
 two points to the right 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.949
 three points upside down 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.550
 the simple decline 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.460
 three points upside down 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.419
 and last point of the edge upside down 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:15.089
 turn number 9 is woven just like the 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:18.650
 return number 1 so this reason comes out 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:22.550
 here we told you a reason 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:25.430
 annual wide and a reason to the top and 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.199
 at the end it goes well so that was all for 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:31.009
