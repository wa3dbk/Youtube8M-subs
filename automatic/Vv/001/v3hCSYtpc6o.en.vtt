00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910

think this should also work on the iPod

box<00:00:35.129> it's<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.489> available<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.180> iPad<00:00:36.510> so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
box it's not available on the iPad so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
box it's not available on the iPad so
this<00:00:37.530> menu<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.309> usage<00:00:38.610> menu<00:00:38.910> isn't<00:00:39.360> even

this menu the usage menu isn't even
under<00:00:39.840> general<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.129> manually

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
under general so you have to manually

under general so you have to manually
enable<00:00:41.699> this<00:00:41.969> yourself<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
enable this yourself I think that on the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590 
enable this yourself I think that on the
3G<00:00:44.219> versions<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> iPad<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.210> might<00:00:45.420> be

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
3G versions of the iPad this might be

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.180 
3G versions of the iPad this might be
here<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.379> you're<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> Wi-Fi<00:00:47.129> version

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
here but if you're on the Wi-Fi version

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.760 
here but if you're on the Wi-Fi version
it's<00:00:47.760> definitely<00:00:48.270> not<00:00:48.449> so<00:00:49.109> right<00:00:49.469> now<00:00:49.649> I'm

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
it's definitely not so right now I'm

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.319

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
required capabilities now I don't have

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.300 
required capabilities now I don't have
it<00:02:12.840> here<00:02:13.170> because<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.440> already<00:02:13.650> got<00:02:13.860> rid<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.130> it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
it here because I already got rid of it

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.580 
it here because I already got rid of it
but<00:02:15.270> if<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.450> go<00:02:15.570> down<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.990> next<00:02:16.110> block<00:02:16.410> you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
but if you go down to the next block you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.050 
but if you go down to the next block you
can<00:02:16.740> see<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.980> there<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.370> required

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
can see that there is a required

going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.290> zoom<00:02:22.440> into<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.860> little<00:02:23.160> bit<00:02:23.250> to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
going to zoom into this a little bit to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.140 
going to zoom into this a little bit to
give<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.970> better<00:02:24.120> view<00:02:25.940> wait<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.060> my

give you a better view wait for my

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.550 
give you a better view wait for my
camera<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.510> focus<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.170> there<00:02:28.709> goes<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:31.230> you

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
camera to focus and there goes so you

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.680 
camera to focus and there goes so you
can<00:02:31.709> see<00:02:31.830> here<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.190> we<00:02:32.310> have<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.550> usage<00:02:32.940> the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
can see here that we have the usage the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.140 
can see here that we have the usage the
usage<00:02:34.200> menu<00:02:34.530> information<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:35.910> we<00:02:36.030> have

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
usage menu information and here we have

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.729 
usage menu information and here we have
the<00:02:36.270> sound<00:02:36.510> menu<00:02:36.690> information<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.620> can

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
the sound menu information so you can

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.900 
the sound menu information so you can
see<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.070> south<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.459> have<00:02:38.489> required

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
see that for south we have required

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.180 
see that for south we have required
capabilities<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:40.350> usage<00:02:40.709> it's<00:02:40.920> not<00:02:41.070> there

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
capabilities for usage it's not there

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.860 
capabilities for usage it's not there
because<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.520> already<00:02:41.850> got<00:02:41.940> rid<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.360> so

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
because I already got rid of it so

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.479 
because I already got rid of it so
basically<00:02:43.170> what<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.470> need<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.709> do<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.100> tap<00:02:44.340> on

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
basically what you need to do is tap on

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.400 
basically what you need to do is tap on
the<00:02:44.550> edit<00:02:44.730> button<00:02:44.880> if<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.930> need<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.170> select

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
the edit button if you need to select

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.220 
the edit button if you need to select
the<00:02:46.590> required<00:02:46.950> capabilities<00:02:47.870> group<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:49.020> lines

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
the required capabilities group of lines

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.759 
the required capabilities group of lines
and<00:02:49.620> then<00:02:50.070> delete<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:52.200> sounds<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.620> can

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
and then delete it so for sounds you can

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.199 
and then delete it so for sounds you can
see<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.190> need<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.489> copy<00:02:53.670> everything

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
see that you need to copy everything

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.540 
see that you need to copy everything
from<00:02:54.360> key<00:02:54.780> all<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.620> way<00:02:55.800> down<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.280> closing

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
from key all the way down to the closing

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.540 
from key all the way down to the closing
array<00:02:56.970> line<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.790> all<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:01.430> here<00:03:02.430> is

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
array line so all of this here is

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.130 
array line so all of this here is
everything<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.150> includes<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.780> required

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
everything that it includes for required

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.050 
everything that it includes for required
capabilities<00:03:04.830> all<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.850> do<00:03:05.940> is

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
capabilities all you have to do is

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.630 
capabilities all you have to do is
backspace<00:03:06.530> twice<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.340> there's<00:03:08.489> no

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
backspace twice so that there's no

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.970 
backspace twice so that there's no
spacing<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.450> between<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.989> just<00:03:10.650> like<00:03:10.800> that

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
spacing in between and just like that

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.910 
spacing in between and just like that
you've<00:03:11.459> gotten<00:03:11.790> rid<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.180> now<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.350> just<00:03:13.590> got

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
you've gotten rid of it now I just got

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.890 
you've gotten rid of it now I just got
rid<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.250> for<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.730> sound<00:03:14.970> line<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:15.690> need

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
rid of it for the sound line so you need

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.259 
rid of it for the sound line so you need
to<00:03:15.989> do<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.200> for<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.410> block<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:17.040> usage<00:03:17.700> things

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
to do it for the block of usage things

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.470 
to do it for the block of usage things
here<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.769> right<00:03:20.370> under<00:03:20.519> usage<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.060> should<00:03:21.269> see

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
here so right under usage you should see

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.540 
here so right under usage you should see
similar<00:03:21.900> stuff<00:03:22.230> for<00:03:22.530> required<00:03:22.860> capabilities

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
similar stuff for required capabilities

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.160 
similar stuff for required capabilities
so<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.330> just<00:03:24.480> need<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.720> get<00:03:24.810> rid<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.019> those

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
so you just need to get rid of those

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.970 
so you just need to get rid of those
lines<00:03:25.530> like<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:27.170> or<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.470> could<00:03:28.620> just<00:03:28.769> look<00:03:28.890> at

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
lines like so or you could just look at

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.320 
lines like so or you could just look at
my<00:03:29.130> screen<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:30.800> right<00:03:31.800> here<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.460> see<00:03:33.000> what<00:03:33.300> I

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
my screen and right here and see what I

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.500 
my screen and right here and see what I
have<00:03:33.569> and<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:33.930> can<00:03:34.260> just

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
have and you can just

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.820 
have and you can just
compare<00:03:34.659> that<00:03:34.780> with<00:03:34.900> what<00:03:34.959> you<00:03:35.230> have<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:35.739> then

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
compare that with what you have and then

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.320 
compare that with what you have and then
you<00:03:35.950> could<00:03:36.099> get<00:03:36.189> rid<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.370> anything<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.000> you

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
you could get rid of anything that you

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.640 
you could get rid of anything that you
don't<00:03:37.510> need<00:03:37.659> which<00:03:38.080> is<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.319> required

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
don't need which is the required

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.610 
don't need which is the required
capabilities<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.780> basically<00:03:41.079> we<00:03:41.290> need<00:03:41.379> to<00:03:41.500> do

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
capabilities so basically we need to do

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.289 
capabilities so basically we need to do
the<00:03:41.739> same<00:03:41.950> thing<00:03:42.280> for<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:44.200> usage<00:03:44.739> statistics

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
the same thing for the usage statistics

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.509 
the same thing for the usage statistics
plist<00:03:46.560> which<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.709> all<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.069> way<00:03:48.099> down<00:03:48.189> at<00:03:48.489> the

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.940 
plist which is all the way down at the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
bottom once again open it up with the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.289 
bottom once again open it up with the

iPad<00:03:55.629> which<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:55.959> think<00:03:56.319> that<00:03:56.379> this<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.799> still

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
iPad which I think that this is still

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.979 
iPad which I think that this is still
enabled<00:03:57.489> for<00:03:57.700> automatically<00:03:58.450> you're<00:03:58.840> going

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
enabled for automatically you're going

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.690 
enabled for automatically you're going
to<00:03:59.049> have<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.260> get<00:03:59.379> rid<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.530> just<00:03:59.769> two<00:04:00.250> bundles

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
to have to get rid of just two bundles

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.110 
to have to get rid of just two bundles
of<00:04:01.090> required<00:04:01.599> capabilities<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:03.159> over<00:04:04.060> at<00:04:06.120> so

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
of required capabilities so over at so

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.460 
of required capabilities so over at so
the<00:04:07.269> first<00:04:07.420> group<00:04:07.659> is<00:04:07.780> going<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.079> be<00:04:08.170> for<00:04:08.349> the

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
the first group is going to be for the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.080 
the first group is going to be for the
battery<00:04:08.859> percentage<00:04:09.040> if<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.519> just<00:04:09.700> skip<00:04:09.909> that

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
battery percentage if you just skip that

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.430 
battery percentage if you just skip that
because<00:04:10.390> that's<00:04:10.569> already<00:04:10.780> enabled<00:04:11.230> on<00:04:11.409> your

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
because that's already enabled on your

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.250 
because that's already enabled on your
device<00:04:11.670> but<00:04:12.670> you<00:04:12.700> can<00:04:12.909> see<00:04:13.030> some<00:04:13.329> for<00:04:13.750> usage

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
device but you can see some for usage

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.129 
device but you can see some for usage
header<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:16.180> right<00:04:16.419> here<00:04:16.600> we<00:04:16.660> have<00:04:16.690> usage

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
header so right here we have usage

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.659 
header so right here we have usage
header<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.680> don't<00:04:18.070> think<00:04:18.220> this<00:04:18.310> one<00:04:18.519> has<00:04:18.609> a

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
header I don't think this one has a

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.350 
header I don't think this one has a
required<00:04:19.060> capabilities<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.959> bunch<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:20.979> lines

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
required capabilities a bunch of lines

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.450 
required capabilities a bunch of lines
but<00:04:22.360> for<00:04:22.389> usage<00:04:22.990> elapsed<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:23.800> standby

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
but for usage elapsed and standby

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.060 
but for usage elapsed and standby
elapsed<00:04:25.000> these<00:04:25.449> ones<00:04:25.720> do<00:04:25.990> basically<00:04:26.800> just

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
elapsed these ones do basically just

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.620 
elapsed these ones do basically just
have<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.280> get<00:04:27.400> rid<00:04:27.520> of<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.760> three<00:04:28.000> or<00:04:28.150> so<00:04:28.360> lines

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
have to get rid of the three or so lines

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.230 
have to get rid of the three or so lines
that<00:04:28.870> are<00:04:29.430> associated<00:04:30.430> with<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.850> required

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
that are associated with the required

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.480 
that are associated with the required
capabilities<00:04:31.470> delete<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.620> save<00:04:33.100> your<00:04:33.280> file

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490

make<00:04:33.850> sure<00:04:34.000> there<00:04:34.150> aren't<00:04:34.330> any<00:04:34.680> empty<00:04:35.680> lines

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
make sure there aren't any empty lines

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.210 
make sure there aren't any empty lines
in<00:04:36.130> between<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:37.060> should<00:04:37.240> be<00:04:37.330> good<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.600> go

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
in between and you should be good to go

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.409 
in between and you should be good to go
now<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:39.250> know<00:04:39.430> that<00:04:39.550> this<00:04:39.669> was<00:04:39.849> a<00:04:39.880> very<00:04:40.090> bare

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
now I know that this was a very bare

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.850 
now I know that this was a very bare
tutorial<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.169> didn't<00:04:41.380> really<00:04:41.560> show<00:04:41.800> you

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
tutorial I didn't really show you

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.070 
tutorial I didn't really show you
anything<00:04:42.220> specific<00:04:42.789> but<00:04:43.000> this<00:04:43.479> is<00:04:43.599> very<00:04:43.810> easy

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
anything specific but this is very easy

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.360 
anything specific but this is very easy
you<00:04:44.320> just<00:04:44.349> have<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.680> get<00:04:44.830> rid<00:04:44.860> of<00:04:44.979> some<00:04:45.190> lines

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
you just have to get rid of some lines

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.390 
you just have to get rid of some lines
in<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.610> plist<00:04:45.940> files<00:04:46.240> save<00:04:47.139> it<00:04:47.380> open<00:04:48.160> up<00:04:48.250> your

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
in the plist files save it open up your

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.760 
in the plist files save it open up your
preferences<00:04:48.810> application<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:50.050> there<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.740> is

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
preferences application and there it is

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.100 
preferences application and there it is
and<00:04:51.130> this<00:04:51.910> basically<00:04:52.300> is<00:04:52.419> good<00:04:52.750> because<00:04:53.020> you

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
and this basically is good because you

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.960 
and this basically is good because you
can<00:04:53.260> see<00:04:53.410> your<00:04:53.800> usage<00:04:54.190> information<00:04:54.340> for<00:04:54.880> your

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
can see your usage information for your

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.640 
can see your usage information for your
battery<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:55.990> know<00:04:56.110> how<00:04:56.320> long<00:04:56.470> you've<00:04:56.620> been

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
battery you know how long you've been

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.350 
battery you know how long you've been
using<00:04:56.860> your<00:04:56.979> device<00:04:57.280> how<00:04:57.910> long<00:04:58.060> it's<00:04:58.210> been<00:04:58.270> on

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
using your device how long it's been on

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.529 
using your device how long it's been on
standby<00:04:58.810> standby<00:04:59.680> includes<00:05:00.310> usage<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:01.240> believe

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
standby standby includes usage I believe

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.510 
standby standby includes usage I believe
so<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.530> can<00:05:02.650> see<00:05:02.770> I've<00:05:02.860> been<00:05:02.949> using<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:03.340> for

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
so you can see I've been using it for

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.640 
so you can see I've been using it for
pretty<00:05:03.729> much<00:05:03.789> the<00:05:03.910> entire<00:05:04.060> time<00:05:04.410> that<00:05:05.410> it<00:05:05.530> has

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
pretty much the entire time that it has

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.290 
pretty much the entire time that it has
been<00:05:05.770> unplugged<00:05:06.130> sorry<00:05:06.699> about<00:05:06.940> not<00:05:07.120> moving

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
been unplugged sorry about not moving

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.570 
been unplugged sorry about not moving
the<00:05:07.599> iPad<00:05:08.139> over<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.440> little<00:05:08.590> bit<00:05:08.770> I'll<00:05:09.310> just

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
the iPad over a little bit I'll just

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.339 
the iPad over a little bit I'll just
zoom<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.539> camera<00:05:10.900> out<00:05:10.990> all<00:05:11.289> the<00:05:11.470> way<00:05:12.270> so<00:05:13.349> once

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
zoom the camera out all the way so once

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.520 
zoom the camera out all the way so once
again<00:05:14.470> it<00:05:14.889> is<00:05:15.099> a<00:05:15.130> very<00:05:15.430> bare<00:05:16.050> tutorial<00:05:17.050> so

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
again it is a very bare tutorial so

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.870 
again it is a very bare tutorial so
hopefully<00:05:18.039> you<00:05:18.159> guys<00:05:18.250> can<00:05:18.490> figure<00:05:18.639> it<00:05:18.789> out

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
hopefully you guys can figure it out

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.600 
hopefully you guys can figure it out
figure<00:05:19.240> this<00:05:19.479> out<00:05:19.630> on<00:05:19.900> your<00:05:19.960> own<00:05:20.169> but<00:05:20.650> that<00:05:20.919> is

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610
