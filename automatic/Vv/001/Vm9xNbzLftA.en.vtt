remaining deeper in the root the goal

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
remaining deeper in the root the goal
obviously<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.210> make<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> most

such<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.439> perforation<00:01:08.840> now<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> most<00:01:10.140> common

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530

kind of perforation in these such cases

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
kind of perforation in these such cases
is<00:01:13.290> basically<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.159> buccal<00:01:14.490> perforation<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
is basically a buccal perforation and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.429 
is basically a buccal perforation and
this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.229> lack<00:01:16.380> of

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
this is because of a lack of

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.710 
this is because of a lack of
compensation<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> lingual<00:01:18.060> orientation

the<00:04:08.160> application<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.820> sealer<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.239> easy

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
the application of the sealer is easy

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.449 
the application of the sealer is easy
because<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.230> material<00:04:10.800> is<00:04:10.950> already<00:04:11.100> in<00:04:11.370> the

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
because the material is already in the

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.180 
because the material is already in the
syringe<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.810> can<00:04:13.140> just<00:04:13.530> inject<00:04:13.890> it<00:04:14.040> into

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
syringe and you can just inject it into

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.670 
syringe and you can just inject it into
the<00:04:14.280> canal<00:04:14.870> using<00:04:15.870> this<00:04:15.959> technique<00:04:16.350> and
