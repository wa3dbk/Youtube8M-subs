the<00:01:06.299> filter<00:01:06.630> immediately<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> bought<00:01:08.670> this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the filter immediately so I bought this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
the filter immediately so I bought this
filter<00:01:09.299> about<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:10.229> week<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> half<00:01:11.400> ago<00:01:12.409> and

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
filter about a week and a half ago and

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.580 
filter about a week and a half ago and
so<00:01:14.369> far<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.970> been<00:01:15.210> absolutely<00:01:15.780> fine<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.320> took

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so far it's been absolutely fine it took

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.390 
so far it's been absolutely fine it took
about<00:01:19.250> took<00:01:20.250> about<00:01:20.540> 15<00:01:21.540> minutes<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.280> sit<00:01:23.280> up

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
about took about 15 minutes to sit up

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700 
about took about 15 minutes to sit up
and<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.729> running<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.290> really<00:01:25.590> really

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and get running so it is really really

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.670 
and get running so it is really really
quick<00:01:27.799> what<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> had<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.579> fill<00:01:29.939> this

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
quick what I had to do is fill this

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
quick what I had to do is fill this
little<00:01:31.680> section<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.729> about<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.329> glass

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
little section here with about a glass

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.550 
little section here with about a glass
of<00:01:33.720> water<00:01:34.850> turn<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:37.170> just

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
of water turn it on and it just

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.109 
of water turn it on and it just
automatically<00:01:38.340> began<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> water<00:01:41.700> flow<00:01:42.090> so

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
automatically began the water flow so

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.590 
automatically began the water flow so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.660 

the<00:01:46.600> filter<00:01:47.110> media<00:01:47.470> was<00:01:47.650> already<00:01:48.220> in<00:01:48.549> the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
the filter media was already in the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.109 
the filter media was already in the
canister<00:01:49.030> all<00:01:49.360> I<00:01:49.420> had<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.780> do<00:01:49.960> was<00:01:50.320> remove<00:01:51.009> the

quart<00:01:55.119> spy<00:01:55.540> rings<00:01:55.900> from<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.290> packet

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.950 

and<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.540> tubing<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:04.540> comped<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.600> big<00:02:05.750> long

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
and the tubing is comped a big long

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.660 
and the tubing is comped a big long
enough<00:02:06.260> so<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:06.950> reach<00:02:07.160> up<00:02:07.430> on<00:02:07.790> my<00:02:08.060> Rina<00:02:08.360> 450<00:02:09.670> as

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
enough so you reach up on my Rina 450 as

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.570 
enough so you reach up on my Rina 450 as
you<00:02:10.880> can<00:02:11.030> see<00:02:11.680> in<00:02:12.680> fact<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.010> could<00:02:13.130> probably<00:02:13.160> do

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
you can see in fact I could probably do

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.360 
you can see in fact I could probably do
with<00:02:13.690> could<00:02:14.690> have<00:02:14.780> done<00:02:14.990> with<00:02:15.200> cutting<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
with could have done with cutting the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.020 
with could have done with cutting the
tubing<00:02:17.120> down<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.330> little<00:02:17.570> bit<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:19.030> didn't

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
tubing down a little bit but I didn't

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.220 
tubing down a little bit but I didn't
risk<00:02:20.180> doing<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.020> end<00:02:22.510> here<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
risk doing that in the end here on the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.770 
risk doing that in the end here on the
inlet<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.620> outlet<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:27.140> two<00:02:28.780> switches

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
inlet and outlet you have two switches

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.910 
inlet and outlet you have two switches
which<00:02:30.350> allow<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:31.010> stop<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.090> flow<00:02:32.860> okay<00:02:33.860> so

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
which allow you to stop the flow okay so

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.470 
which allow you to stop the flow okay so
that<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.550> idle<00:02:35.450> Prime<00:02:36.020> at<00:02:36.890> 30<00:02:37.640> external

tubes<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.020> like<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.710> tank<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:46.430> is

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
tubes that like in the tank so this is

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.190 
tubes that like in the tank so this is
the<00:02:47.030> outlet<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.170> internet<00:02:53.200> but

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
the outlet this is the internet but

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.530 
the outlet this is the internet but
orange<00:02:54.560> band<00:02:54.860> there<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:55.340> put<00:02:56.180> on<00:02:56.300> there<00:02:56.510> to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
orange band there is put on there to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.650 
orange band there is put on there to
indicate<00:02:56.840> when<00:02:57.560> your<00:02:57.800> filter<00:02:58.310> needs<00:02:58.580> cleaning

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
indicate when your filter needs cleaning

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.550 
indicate when your filter needs cleaning
if<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:01.070> water<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.580> above<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:02.150> level<00:03:03.110> that's

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
if the water is above that level that's

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.870 
if the water is above that level that's
usually<00:03:04.190> when<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.670> would<00:03:04.820> need<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:06.760> clean<00:03:07.760> the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
usually when you would need to clean the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.850 
usually when you would need to clean the
filter<00:03:08.060> because<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.720> flow<00:03:08.990> has<00:03:09.350> been<00:03:09.560> reduced

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.710 

the<00:03:15.490> issue<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:15.940> pop<00:03:16.210> of<00:03:16.390> this<00:03:16.480> filter<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:17.700> it's

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
the issue a pop of this filter is it's

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:29.250 
the issue a pop of this filter is it's
taken<00:03:19.720> an<00:03:19.840> air<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:23.740> that<00:03:24.120> Inlet<00:03:25.120> pipe<00:03:28.260> when

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
taken an air so on that Inlet pipe when

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.880 
taken an air so on that Inlet pipe when
the<00:03:29.530> inlet<00:03:30.490> gets<00:03:30.850> covered<00:03:31.330> too<00:03:31.570> much<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.680> when

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
the inlet gets covered too much so when

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
the inlet gets covered too much so when
there's<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.850> buildup<00:03:34.210> of<00:03:34.360> dextrous<00:03:34.930> on<00:03:35.140> here<00:03:36.130> it

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
there's a buildup of dextrous on here it

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.210 
there's a buildup of dextrous on here it
starts<00:03:37.450> sucking<00:03:37.900> air<00:03:38.350> from<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.710> top<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:39.100> the

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
starts sucking air from the top of the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.320 
starts sucking air from the top of the
shoe<00:03:40.770> filling<00:03:41.770> the<00:03:42.310> filter<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:43.090> with<00:03:43.300> a

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
shoe filling the filter and with a

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.830 
shoe filling the filter and with a
mixture<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.780> air<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:44.050> water<00:03:45.450> just<00:03:46.450> softly<00:03:46.690> not

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
mixture of air and water just softly not

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.230 
mixture of air and water just softly not
what<00:03:47.050> you<00:03:47.170> want<00:03:47.700> so<00:03:48.700> that's<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.970> only<00:03:49.090> issue

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
what you want so that's the only issue

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.490 
what you want so that's the only issue
I've<00:03:49.510> had<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:50.380> would<00:03:51.190> say<00:03:51.430> probably<00:03:52.500> would

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
I've had so I would say probably would

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.120 
I've had so I would say probably would
not<00:03:53.620> recommend<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:55.690> hydro<00:03:56.020> Prime<00:03:56.290> 30<00:03:56.830> with<00:03:57.100> a

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
not recommend the hydro Prime 30 with a

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.120 
not recommend the hydro Prime 30 with a
heavily<00:03:57.640> planted<00:03:57.850> tank<00:04:01.020> because<00:04:02.020> you<00:04:02.740> know<00:04:02.860> so

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
heavily planted tank because you know so

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.150 
heavily planted tank because you know so
you<00:04:03.250> don't<00:04:03.490> want<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:04.240> be<00:04:05.080> constantly<00:04:05.440> checking

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
you don't want to be constantly checking

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:16.320 
you don't want to be constantly checking
your<00:04:06.340> tank<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:07.030> see<00:04:07.300> whether<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:15.239> filter<00:04:16.239> is

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
your tank to see whether the filter is

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.130 
your tank to see whether the filter is
blocked<00:04:16.660> or<00:04:17.049> taking<00:04:17.500> in<00:04:17.650> air<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.840> yeah<00:04:19.930> that's

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
blocked or taking in air so yeah that's

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.020 
blocked or taking in air so yeah that's
just<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.530> quick<00:04:20.709> review<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.310> hydro<00:04:21.669> prime

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
just a quick review of the hydro prime

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.940 
just a quick review of the hydro prime
30<00:04:26.490> thanks<00:04:27.490> for<00:04:27.610> watching
