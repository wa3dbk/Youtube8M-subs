00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290 
I'm going to show you how to do a mix

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.169 
I'm going to show you how to do a mix
between<00:00:01.439> two<00:00:01.740> songs<00:00:02.010> using<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.520> frequency

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
between two songs using the frequency

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.260 
between two songs using the frequency
mixed<00:00:03.750> mode<00:00:04.279> so<00:00:05.279> basically<00:00:05.670> I've<00:00:05.790> got<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> song

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
mixed mode so basically I've got a song

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
mixed mode so basically I've got a song
cued<00:00:06.839> up<00:00:06.899> on<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.080> channel<00:00:07.500> one<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:09.170> I've<00:00:10.170> got

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
cued up on a channel one and I've got

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.450 
cued up on a channel one and I've got
this<00:00:10.440> other<00:00:10.650> song<00:00:10.920> heat<00:00:11.910> up<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.090> channel<00:00:12.389> 4<00:00:13.460> and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
this other song heat up on channel 4 and

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.499 
this other song heat up on channel 4 and
i'll<00:00:14.580> show<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.759> how<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.940> mix<00:00:15.059> between<00:00:15.240> those

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
i'll show you how to mix between those

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.500 
i'll show you how to mix between those
two<00:00:15.719> using<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.369> special<00:00:17.369> mode<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.390> can

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
two using this special mode so you can

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.830 
two using this special mode so you can
see<00:00:18.660> right<00:00:18.690> now<00:00:19.100> on<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.279> touch<00:00:20.460> panel<00:00:20.840> with

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
see right now on the touch panel with

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840 
see right now on the touch panel with
all<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> faders<00:00:22.380> move<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.980> left<00:00:23.130> you're

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
all the faders move to the left you're

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.130 
all the faders move to the left you're
going<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.029> only<00:00:24.180> hear<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> frequencies<00:00:25.109> of

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
going to only hear the frequencies of

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.880 
going to only hear the frequencies of
the<00:00:26.130> song<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.699> playing<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:26.970> channel<00:00:27.000> one<00:00:27.449> and

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
the song is playing on channel one and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.970 
the song is playing on channel one and
so<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:28.980> means<00:00:29.189> even<00:00:29.670> when<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> effect<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.269> on

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
so that means even when the effect is on

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.600 
so that means even when the effect is on
you're<00:00:31.980> not<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> hear<00:00:32.309> any<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you're not going to hear any of the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.520 
you're not going to hear any of the
frequencies<00:00:33.059> that's<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.079> channel

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
frequencies that's on the on the channel

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.060 
frequencies that's on the on the channel
and<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.829> some<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:36.090> I'll<00:00:36.239> engage<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:37.070> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and for some so I'll engage that and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.500 
and for some so I'll engage that and
again<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.640> can't<00:00:39.120> hear<00:00:39.239> any<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
again I can't hear any of the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
again I can't hear any of the
frequencies<00:00:39.930> playing<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.260> channel<00:00:40.469> 4<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:43.100> now

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
frequencies playing on channel 4 so now

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.560 
frequencies playing on channel 4 so now
traditional<00:00:44.520> mixing<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:44.969> even<00:00:45.210> move<00:00:45.360> across

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
traditional mixing is even move across

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.150 
traditional mixing is even move across

can fade those back if I want to it's a
little<00:02:02.480> bit<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.860> I'll<00:02:04.010> do<00:02:04.160> just<00:02:04.190> like<00:02:04.400> a<00:02:04.460> real

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
little bit and I'll do just like a real

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:17.850 
little bit and I'll do just like a real
smooth<00:02:05.000> blend<00:02:05.770> again<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:07.040> district<00:02:07.460> recently

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.620 

being<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.520> little<00:02:18.700> bit<00:02:18.790> more<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.970> hide<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.510> as

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
being a little bit more to hide and as

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.940 
being a little bit more to hide and as
I'm<00:02:19.750> doing<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.050> again<00:02:20.350> I'm<00:02:20.470> taking<00:02:20.860> away

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
I'm doing this again I'm taking away

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.740 
I'm doing this again I'm taking away
frequencies<00:02:21.760> from<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.150> music<00:02:22.420> us<00:02:22.540> clean

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
frequencies from the music us clean

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.920 
frequencies from the music us clean
channel<00:02:23.140> word

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
channel word

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:37.949 
channel word
and<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.469> last<00:02:25.680> one<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.810> low<00:02:27.989> frequency

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.360 

there<00:02:38.959> you<00:02:39.050> have<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.470> smooth<00:02:39.860> mix<00:02:40.160> with

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
there you have it a smooth mix with

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.280 
there you have it a smooth mix with
using<00:02:40.730> only<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.209> frequencies<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.840> music<00:02:42.140> and

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
using only the frequencies of music and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.580 
using only the frequencies of music and
not<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.500> traditional<00:02:42.770> crossfade
