00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780

the 30 game I think I played a great
game<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.280> lost<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> game<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:37.010> la<00:00:38.010> la<00:00:38.340> la<00:00:38.790> parte

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
game I lost the game for la la la parte

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.700 
game I lost the game for la la la parte
but<00:00:40.020> he<00:00:40.739> had<00:00:41.780> amazing<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:42.989> hand<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> line

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
but he had amazing for hand on the line

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.190 
but he had amazing for hand on the line
and<00:00:43.890> two<00:00:44.040> very<00:00:44.280> good<00:00:44.340> passing<00:00:44.879> shots<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.840> I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and two very good passing shots so I

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.910 
and two very good passing shots so I
think<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.309> played<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.760> glaze<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.329> again<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.960> was

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
think I played a glaze it again but was

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.779 
think I played a glaze it again but was
not<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.670> game<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:52.399> keep<00:00:53.399> going

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
not the right game so just keep going

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.720 
not the right game so just keep going
and<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.120> thought<00:00:54.329> that's<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:55.050> way<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and I thought that's the right way to to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.299 
and I thought that's the right way to to
play<00:00:56.940> well<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.210> against<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:59.129> with

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
play well on against the way and with

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.209 
play well on against the way and with
the<00:00:59.399> wind<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> beginning<00:01:00.859> my<00:01:01.859> feeling<00:01:02.190> was

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the wind in the beginning my feeling was

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.399 
the wind in the beginning my feeling was
that<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.730> can't<00:01:03.059> cut<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> ball<00:01:04.229> because

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that I can't cut the ball because

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.510 
that I can't cut the ball because
everything<00:01:06.830> every<00:01:07.830> time<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.250> touch<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
everything every time that I touch the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.030 
everything every time that I touch the
ball<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.180> beginning<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.900> four<00:01:10.170> hands<00:01:10.380> three

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
ball the beginning to four hands three

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.820 
ball the beginning to four hands three
meters<00:01:11.369> behind<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:12.000> line<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.830> think

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
meters behind this line but I think

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.340 
meters behind this line but I think
because<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> i<00:01:14.820> moved<00:01:15.390> i<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:17.600> playing<00:01:18.600> too

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
because I i moved i was playing too

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.960 
because I i moved i was playing too
aggressive<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> shot<00:01:20.280> too<00:01:20.460> aggressive

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
aggressive the shot too aggressive

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.280 
aggressive the shot too aggressive
because<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.049> was<00:01:22.229> scared<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.830> playing<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:24.290> was

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
because I was scared I was playing I was

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.010 
because I was scared I was playing I was
moving<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.920> hands<00:01:26.310> faster<00:01:27.030> than<00:01:27.210> than<00:01:27.570> usual

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
moving the hands faster than than usual

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.490 
moving the hands faster than than usual
and<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:29.100> think<00:01:29.579> was<00:01:30.290> completely<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.350> other

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and I think was completely the other

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
and I think was completely the other
thing<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.220> had<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:33.030> move<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> hand

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
thing that I had to do is move the hand

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.550 
thing that I had to do is move the hand
is<00:01:34.229> low<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.340> i<00:01:35.850> found<00:01:36.780> that

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
is low and i found that

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.999 
is low and i found that
again<00:01:39.310> completely<00:01:39.729> gentle<00:01:40.290> do<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.409> like<00:01:41.680> the

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
again completely gentle do you like the

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.580 
again completely gentle do you like the
challenge<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:43.180> playing<00:01:43.390> in<00:01:43.810> different

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
challenge of playing in different

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.969 
challenge of playing in different
conditions<00:01:44.799> or<00:01:45.460> rather<00:01:45.820> every<00:01:46.240> day<00:01:46.390> was<00:01:46.979> not

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
conditions or rather every day was not

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.380 
conditions or rather every day was not
as<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.369> perfect<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.289> lot<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.740> wind<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:52.210> I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
as a perfect with a lot of wind but I

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.570 
as a perfect with a lot of wind but I
remember<00:01:52.869> I<00:01:53.079> always<00:01:53.110> played<00:01:53.619> good<00:01:54.159> matches

with<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:54.820> lot<00:01:55.509> of<00:01:55.630> wind<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:57.130> no<00:01:57.310> i<00:01:57.340> think<00:01:57.670> is

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
with the lot of wind and no i think is

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
to one side is a little bit more

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.040 
to one side is a little bit more
difficult<00:02:05.950> for<00:02:06.250> me<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.579> know<00:02:06.610> because<00:02:07.050> play

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
think I I played every day better and

think I I played every day better and
today<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:10.760> later<00:03:11.030> for<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.840> conditions<00:03:12.380> I

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
today it later for the conditions I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.340 
today it later for the conditions I
think<00:03:12.680> I'd<00:03:12.800> ladybird<00:03:13.280> much<00:03:13.460> very<00:03:13.700> much
