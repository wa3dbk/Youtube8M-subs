00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.419
 I 'll see we're back here in 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.599
 our program we're going to talk about one of 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:11.389
 the segments that I like the most and we're going to 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.429
 recommend a breed that I thought of 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.250
 It is suddenly recommended for spaces 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.660
 smaller as the chihuahua and 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.670
 we actually took over especially in 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.190
 in recent years about adopting the 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.860
 get this animal this kind of 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.350
 Puppies are usually very nervous 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.570
 I say from experience they tremble a lot with 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.020
 too often they do their 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.100
 needs at short time and also without 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.630
 notice above all when 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.160
 they solve a little bit so why 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.870
 that constant supervision is 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.060
 totally necessary especially the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.610
 first months to control a little bit 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.110
 and help him and teach him if you 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.060
 they want to know more about their care 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.000
 of this breed if you are thinking of adopting 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.570
 never as tight you pay attention to 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.570
 the following things 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.000
 Hahaha 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.950
 the Chihuahuas are a good breed for 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.570
 the city or for those who do not 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.390
 They have time to walk their dogs 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.610
 very often they feel happy in a 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.130
 department whenever they find 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.110
 to play and places to explore is very 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.790
 orders and loved by women 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.740
 the boys should take care 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.530
 normal of any more dog with 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.870
 regarding power to corrections 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.340
 to walks and all that is only done a little 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.160
 less because they are animals of 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.170
 small size this type of dog barks 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.240
 easily and therefore not 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.040
 easily adapt to changes in your 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.410
 environment and is distrustful of the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.090
 strangers' first if you're a stranger 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.009
 you have to do a soft approach 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.810
 true approaching space no 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.660
 establish eye contact with the animal 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.220
 do not make sudden movements and let 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.619
 first you smell that the animal is 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.390
 feel in trust with you and then 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.640
 that there if you can touch us and we are 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.680
 can grab and can pass them but 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.660
 I always usually do it slowly 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.940
 and his puppies show their fear of 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.580
 through body language thing that the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.950
 I love must be with the ears back 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.409
 it is fear and distrust tail between 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.270
 legs is fear or submission 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.640
 closed mouth and raised lips 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.789
 Teeth showing is a sign of 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.010
 threat and that will attack fast bark 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.769
 and with pause he is asking his master 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.840
 to investigate what is happening 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.400
 continuous and rapid barking in signal of 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.980
 alert that there is a stranger in his 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.720
 territory but what happened I knew if 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.030
 Lippi dogs instinct tend to 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.760
 mark their places this where they live 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.620
 true then dogs that have not 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.959
 been corrected since they are small they have the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.430
 custom to start marking all the 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.829
 places to leave your trail is a 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.930
 natural instinct of animals and that 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.760
 is obviously corrected is a process 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.920
 physiological of the animal but it is also 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.480
 behavioral and that can be corrected in 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.180
 the puppies that do that a good 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.160
 option is to castrate them and another option is 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.620
 that you have training and 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.480
 correct them in addition this dog breed 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.030
 it trembles very often either 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.609
 When you are afraid you are uncomfortable or very 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.440
 happy is a natural characteristic of 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.930
 them that has nothing to do with the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.510
 The chihuahuas are cold 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.329
 other races remember that if they are 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.160
 aggressive is by its nature since 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.420
 they try to protect their master 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.420
 person who takes care of him
