hopefully another good race last race I

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.080 
hopefully another good race last race I
don't<00:00:17.720> know<00:00:18.109> it<00:00:18.590> was<00:00:18.710> a<00:00:18.769> bit<00:00:19.010> 5050<00:00:19.910> in<00:00:19.970> my

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
don't know it was a bit 5050 in my

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.890 
don't know it was a bit 5050 in my
opinion<00:00:20.570> I<00:00:20.810> probably<00:00:21.499> should<00:00:22.160> have<00:00:22.900> really

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
opinion I probably should have really

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.259 
opinion I probably should have really
thought<00:00:24.169> about<00:00:24.349> what<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.490> Red<00:00:25.669> Bull<00:00:25.849> car<00:00:26.060> was

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
thought about what the Red Bull car was

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.720 
thought about what the Red Bull car was
going<00:00:26.419> to<00:00:26.480> be<00:00:26.570> doing<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.650> I<00:00:28.039> didn't<00:00:28.369> I<00:00:28.519> just

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
going to be doing and I didn't I just

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.819 
going to be doing and I didn't I just
really<00:00:29.300> didn't<00:00:29.599> anticipate<00:00:29.929> it<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:30.589> it<00:00:30.739> was

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
really didn't anticipate it and it was

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.270 
really didn't anticipate it and it was
it<00:00:31.640> was<00:00:31.730> bad<00:00:32.290> lost<00:00:33.290> my<00:00:33.410> front<00:00:33.620> wheels<00:00:33.890> but<00:00:34.250> a

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
it was bad lost my front wheels but a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.880 
it was bad lost my front wheels but a
third<00:00:34.640> race<00:00:34.910> in<00:00:34.940> five<00:00:35.930> or<00:00:36.230> whatever<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:36.710> I

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
third race in five or whatever and I

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.920 
third race in five or whatever and I
think<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.880> may<00:00:38.150> be<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.390> bit<00:00:38.660> too<00:00:38.810> aggressive

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
think I may be a bit too aggressive

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.590 
think I may be a bit too aggressive
that's<00:00:39.680> maybe<00:00:40.190> one<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.610> things<00:00:40.790> I'm<00:00:41.000> you

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
that's maybe one of the things I'm you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.870 
that's maybe one of the things I'm you
know<00:00:41.690> being<00:00:41.930> I<00:00:42.110> know<00:00:42.140> I've<00:00:42.440> got<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.680> pacing<00:00:43.100> in

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
know being I know I've got the pacing in

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.350 
know being I know I've got the pacing in
my<00:00:44.650> driving<00:00:45.650> skill<00:00:46.070> with<00:00:46.250> that<00:00:46.400> sounds<00:00:46.640> stupid

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
my driving skill with that sounds stupid

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.930 
my driving skill with that sounds stupid
but<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:48.170> got<00:00:48.320> no<00:00:48.500> I<00:00:48.530> know<00:00:48.800> got<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:49.670> skills

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
but I got no I know got the the skills

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.930 
but I got no I know got the the skills
to<00:00:50.590> you<00:00:51.590> know<00:00:51.680> be<00:00:51.890> close<00:00:52.160> to<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.490> points<00:00:52.820> in

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
to you know be close to the points in

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.140 
to you know be close to the points in
this<00:00:53.060> car<00:00:53.350> but<00:00:54.350> I<00:00:54.380> just<00:00:54.590> mess<00:00:55.010> up<00:00:55.040> and<00:00:55.520> maybe<00:00:56.030> a

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
this car but I just mess up and maybe a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.880 
this car but I just mess up and maybe a
bit<00:00:56.420> Eagle<00:00:56.810> in<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:56.960> first<00:00:57.170> lap<00:00:57.470> so<00:00:57.710> maybe

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
bit Eagle in the first lap so maybe

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.570 
bit Eagle in the first lap so maybe
she'd<00:00:58.190> be<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.340> bit<00:00:58.550> calmer<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.390> you<00:01:00.230> know<00:01:00.350> I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
she'd be a bit calmer and you know I

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.830 
she'd be a bit calmer and you know I
honestly<00:01:01.580> I<00:01:01.850> suppose<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:02.270> probably<00:01:02.540> would<00:01:02.810> have

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
honestly I suppose I probably would have

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.810 
honestly I suppose I probably would have
restarted<00:01:03.500> those<00:01:03.620> races<00:01:04.100> just<00:01:04.339> because<00:01:04.640> I

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
restarted those races just because I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.880 
restarted those races just because I
don't<00:01:05.180> want<00:01:05.449> to<00:01:05.509> put<00:01:05.659> out<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:05.840> video<00:01:06.049> that<00:01:06.829> is

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
don't want to put out a video that is

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.310 
don't want to put out a video that is
subpar<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:07.790> already<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.689> day<00:01:08.840> he<00:01:09.020> sort<00:01:09.260> of

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
subpar and already in the day he sort of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.649 
subpar and already in the day he sort of
stuff<00:01:09.500> part<00:01:09.800> but<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.790> know<00:01:10.909> it's<00:01:11.180> sort<00:01:11.330> of<00:01:11.360> the

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
stuff part but you know it's sort of the

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.290 
stuff part but you know it's sort of the
series<00:01:12.020> documenting<00:01:12.590> my<00:01:12.710> life<00:01:13.550> at<00:01:13.730> tour<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.240> I

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
series documenting my life at tour so I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.940 
series documenting my life at tour so I
don't<00:01:14.510> then<00:01:14.659> when<00:01:14.840> we<00:01:14.930> get<00:01:15.080> another<00:01:15.470> contract

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
don't then when we get another contract

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
don't then when we get another contract
somehow<00:01:17.560> but<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:18.800> know<00:01:19.130> what<00:01:19.250> I<00:01:19.310> mean<00:01:19.460> you

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
somehow but you know what I mean you

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.149 
somehow but you know what I mean you
know<00:01:20.000> it's<00:01:20.690> really<00:01:20.990> sticking<00:01:21.380> away<00:01:21.680> I'm

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
know it's really sticking away I'm

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.590 
know it's really sticking away I'm
losing<00:01:22.400> my<00:01:22.490> front<00:01:22.729> wheels<00:01:22.880> but<00:01:23.060> I<00:01:23.090> don't<00:01:23.360> think

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
losing my front wheels but I don't think

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.000 
losing my front wheels but I don't think
the<00:01:23.720> videos<00:01:23.990> are<00:01:24.140> enjoyable<00:01:24.500> because<00:01:24.800> of<00:01:24.890> it

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
the videos are enjoyable because of it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.710 
the videos are enjoyable because of it
and<00:01:25.159> I<00:01:25.220> think<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.700> really<00:01:26.300> makes<00:01:26.570> them

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
and I think that really makes them

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.450 
and I think that really makes them
subpar<00:01:27.200> but<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:27.830> know<00:01:27.950> leave<00:01:28.159> me<00:01:28.340> your
