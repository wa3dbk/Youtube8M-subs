00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.820
 you have put me squarely in this mess 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.060
 knowingly you 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.379
 who the hell was that jester from before 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.990
 and a murderer 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.810
 and my chin so you're part of a 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.660
 cult of lunatics we are murderers and 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.820
 we follow a creed in effect but we do not 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.809
 impele to act does not follow 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.809
 I would love to hear more 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.609
 nothing is watching 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.609
 everything is permitted 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:44.879
 is the only people everything is allowed 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.699
 I like that slogan to think as you want and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.559
 act as I please you repeat it as a 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.719
 parrot but you do not understand your sign you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.730
 put up haughty with me that I followed you 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.820
 as friends if you cheated on me 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.440
 you know by bringing those men here 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.640
 they had died for what you did in the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.640
 habana I combÃ©s them 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.190
 the road is blocked I think it's a 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.840
 rope 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.270
 and there should be some way to open it 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.380
 a mechanism somewhere like a 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.790
 winch 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.790
 our blocks above 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.470
 then the Templars walk behind 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.119
 your people around us were 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.710
 persecutors we made them flee 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.000
 frightened 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.000
 but now we 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.190
 it seems that the mechanism of the door 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.010
 It's broken 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.010
 let's find another way of man 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.450
 do not 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.450
 you 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.020
 good 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.830
 and still breathing enough 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.830
 to curse you kate 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.050
 there must be a great treasure I do not know what 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.750
 We wait at the end of the road but more 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.209
 it's worth it will depend on you 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.940
 how do you say what are you going to witness 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.890
 could make you go crazy 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.600
 I just hope you can overcome the 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.600
 I am already a senior 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.680
 ah 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.110
 this is already the great prize that you 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.730
 mentor told me that he will look for being 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.710
 say it but it does not look anything like 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.360
 The man who calls the wise man does not 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.610
 precipitates 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.610
 we still have a riddle to solve 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.969
 these statues are like the ones we saw 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.440
 before 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:43.260
 but they have drawings engraved on them 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.600
 there are also engravings on the ground but 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.170
 they are of another type there is some kind of 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.170
 relationship 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.090
 there is a difference between the animals of 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.090
 the statues and the soil 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.990
 the time 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.870
 if one are predators the other prisoners 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.070
 it feeds 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.070
 this is the thing 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.050
 well there you have the reduction there 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.050
 match predators companies 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.640
 two 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.180
 ah 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.890
 God is that of the wise 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:30.529
 but this thing will be hundreds of years old 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:33.229
 more than that surely that is the yes 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:35.229
 his eyes give him away they said 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.549
 templars so they needed it 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.600
 they threw some of their blood in a 

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:42.620
 glass jar 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.620
 like this 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.639
 yes 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.900
 they wanted to ask him also about the 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.900
 observatory but escaped 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.229
 We have already finished
