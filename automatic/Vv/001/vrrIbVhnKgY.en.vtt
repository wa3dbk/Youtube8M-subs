00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.450
 hello in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.809
 this scarf nothing else I will explain 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.710
 As I made this scarf, I already had it 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.830
 seen on the internet page but the 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.070
 hope lady roses have your channel 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.000
 how it is done what is she 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.730
 It has a neck in green but 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.439
 I wanted to make the scarf her nothing more 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:34.100
 has three braids and I did this in 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:38.210
 five this is the beginning with so 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.570
 start and here is the end is scarves 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.070
 in knit with double ball yola knitted with 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.660
 this stamen 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:54.830
 milk milk 2 balls together this 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.830
 size and this of this size how much is 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:03.170
 is 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.170
 199 grams 7 ounces 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.260
 355 yards this is the total that gives them 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:14.409
 I did not like that I would have liked 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.390
 have to make it longer but good at 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.229
 order this is the first one that I do of this 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:25.470
 stitch and I decided to make it in scarf 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:29.710
 with this one with fringed beards 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.810
 I'm here it 's targeted it's all right 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.170
 pure right 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.630
 the only thing that makes the difference here is 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.960
 that what is called here the lady 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.200
 hope is called berths then already 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.140
 then this will break two points and 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.179
 They are leaving the threads like that and it's like 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.780
 they are forming after these braids 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:57.320
 once you already undo these two points 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.110
 here you can not continue weaving 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.680
 along so I recommend that if 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.740
 someone wants 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.610
 get a scarf and want more 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.520
 long him also to use three or 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.970
 four balls have to prepare with 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.340
 the thread so that it does not happen to me 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:26.560
 then it 's how you are going to 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:30.940
 stay here are five points 25 25 25 25 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.810
 25 and as I say this is the first 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.540
 project that I'm going to weave in the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.590
 double strands that's why I bought two 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.660
 balls of the same color and are woven like this 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.959
 always being two and this is the size 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.350
 of everything that the ball gives, I hope that 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.180
 like my idea and if they do not find the 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.700
 video the video have it tell them the 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.530
 hope roses roses but on a neck 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.470
 green color 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.540
 Any questions you have or ask 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.540
 I'm happy to answer you
