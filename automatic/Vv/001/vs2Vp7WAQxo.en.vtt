here<00:01:30.360> has<00:01:31.140> dots<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.030> write<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
here has dots on it and as you write the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.319 
here has dots on it and as you write the
camera<00:01:34.350> reads<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.920> little<00:01:35.159> dots<00:01:35.430> outside<00:01:36.210> of

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
camera reads the little dots outside of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.420 
camera reads the little dots outside of
the<00:01:36.390> paper<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.439> how<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.189> doesn't

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the paper and that's how it it doesn't

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.160 
the paper and that's how it it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.540> you're<00:01:39.750> writing<00:01:39.900> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
necessarily see what you're writing I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.410 
necessarily see what you're writing I
just<00:01:40.409> notices<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.100> fine<00:01:41.430> dot<00:01:41.790> pattern<00:01:42.240> it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
just notices this fine dot pattern it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.139 
just notices this fine dot pattern it
connects<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> dots<00:01:43.290> Dave<00:01:43.740> exactly<00:01:44.610> does<00:01:44.820> now

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
connects the dots Dave exactly does now

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.420 
connects the dots Dave exactly does now
what's<00:01:45.420> nice<00:01:45.570> about<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:46.170> pen<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.189> don't

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
what's nice about this pen is you don't

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.249 
what's nice about this pen is you don't
need<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> computing<00:01:48.149> device<00:01:48.180> beside<00:01:49.049> it

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
need a computing device beside it

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.469 
need a computing device beside it
obviously<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.130> large<00:01:50.399> enough<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> can

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
obviously it's large enough that it can

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.630 
obviously it's large enough that it can
