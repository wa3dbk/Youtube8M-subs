00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:56.450
 a boring way, lent it over the garbage there 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.599
 I confess that in the beginning on the back I 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.910
 There was doubt but how much to enter the refrain 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.290
 convinced completely brings a lot of 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.190
 sincerity I felt it at least 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.269
 here from this side 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.550
 so I was working with time 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.269
 Because I think you can, but in this 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.920
 program 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:15.080
 likes to follow your hair like this 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:19.160
 crazy and hard because I just talk 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.660
 the hairdresser portugal the goiás who 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.549
 girls will get something that contributes 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.500

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.500
 big voice was working with you 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.640
 I really liked the energy of delivery. 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.230
 I really regretted that they accept that 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.500
 people saw here but I know it was not the 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:45.349

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.569

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.530
 with my mother and my mother so 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.470
 only women are less exact 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.720
 We're talking about the same page. 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.030
 I was looking to add another 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:05.570
 Woman, sorry, I think you already have your 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:07.050

 now I do not know maybe the next now 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.710
 Seriously, I think you 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.370
 would really simplify this program. 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.400
 the Portuguese voice and you could 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:34.440
 band and just listen and get 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:38.040
 to convey the drama to that 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.800
 Even strong feeling is of the letter and the 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:45.750
 music gets spoken very well 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.240

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:53.460

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.320
 Which is better on my team staying 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.260

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.330
 that choice you choose you feel 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.860

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.110

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.930

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.610
 further 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.919

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.180

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.320

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:52.569
