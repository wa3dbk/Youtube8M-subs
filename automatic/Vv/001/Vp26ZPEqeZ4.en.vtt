many<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.770> saw<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.250> video<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
many that you saw in the video for a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.310 
many that you saw in the video for a
couple<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.149> days<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.539> really<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.260> i

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
couple of days and I really like it i

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.860 
couple of days and I really like it i
think<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.430> low-cost<00:00:48.059> pc

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
think this is a really good low-cost pc

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
think this is a really good low-cost pc
certainly<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> fastest<00:00:50.309> low-cost<00:00:50.730> PC<00:00:51.180> we've

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
certainly the fastest low-cost PC we've

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
certainly the fastest low-cost PC we've
tried<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:52.230> least<00:00:52.440> since<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> chrome

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
tried out at least since the chrome

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.410 
tried out at least since the chrome
boxes<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:53.489> are<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> lot<00:00:53.850> harder<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.300> get

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
boxes which are a lot harder to get

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.850 
boxes which are a lot harder to get
windows<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> saw<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.739> could

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
windows on to it as you saw we could

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.470 
windows on to it as you saw we could
easily<00:00:56.190> put<00:00:56.399> different<00:00:56.730> operating<00:00:57.030> systems

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
easily put different operating systems

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.200 
easily put different operating systems
on<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> runs<00:00:58.530> windows<00:00:58.710> very<00:00:59.160> well<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.000> check

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
on to it runs windows very well so check

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.090 
on to it runs windows very well so check
out<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.600> full<00:01:00.780> series<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> videos<00:01:01.649> i<00:01:01.829> did<00:01:02.010> i'm

probably<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.220> something<00:01:08.460> with

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
probably going to do something with

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
probably going to do something with
gaming<00:01:09.150> i'm<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.810> sure<00:01:09.960> exactly<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.619> i'll

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
gaming i'm not sure exactly what i'll

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.289 
gaming i'm not sure exactly what i'll
probably<00:01:10.920> try<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> few<00:01:11.460> other<00:01:11.610> games<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.180> maybe

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
probably try a few other games and maybe

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
probably try a few other games and maybe
show<00:01:12.510> some<00:01:12.689> emulators<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.530> i'm<00:01:13.950> not

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
show some emulators as well i'm not

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.620 
show some emulators as well i'm not
gonna<00:01:14.189> go<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.580> into<00:01:14.820> death<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> problems<00:01:15.540> i

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
gonna go to into death is the problems i

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.149 
gonna go to into death is the problems i
can<00:01:15.750> never<00:01:15.930> show<00:01:16.170> every<00:01:16.590> game<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.979> everybody

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
can never show every game that everybody

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.890 
can never show every game that everybody
wants<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.670> see<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.119> i'll<00:01:18.210> try<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> few

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
wants to see but i'll try to do a few

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.149 
wants to see but i'll try to do a few
more<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.380> least<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> benchmark

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
more so at least you can get a benchmark

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
more so at least you can get a benchmark
and<00:01:20.610> maybe<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.150> good<00:01:21.360> idea<00:01:21.630> about<00:01:21.750> how<00:01:22.020> your

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
and maybe a good idea about how your

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.950 
and maybe a good idea about how your
machine<00:01:23.130> might<00:01:23.520> perform<00:01:23.750> under<00:01:24.750> certain

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
machine might perform under certain

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.420 
machine might perform under certain
circumstances<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.950> we're<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.250> check

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
circumstances so we're going to check

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.710 
circumstances so we're going to check
