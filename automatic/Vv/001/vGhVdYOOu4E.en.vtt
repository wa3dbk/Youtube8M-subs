00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
luckily it all come true for me and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.620 
luckily it all come true for me and
other<00:02:19.010> principles<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.790> same<00:02:19.820> or<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.420> very

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
other principles the same or is it very

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.180 
other principles the same or is it very
very<00:02:20.870> different<00:02:21.380> i<00:02:21.440> should<00:02:21.620> imagine<00:02:21.740> that's

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
very different i should imagine that's

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.500 
very different i should imagine that's
quite<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> big<00:02:22.640> gap<00:02:22.880> to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
quite a big gap to

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.580 
quite a big gap to
Ridge<00:02:23.629> isn't<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.930> what<00:02:24.049> we're<00:02:24.200> talking<00:02:24.470> from

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
Ridge isn't it what we're talking from

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.800 
Ridge isn't it what we're talking from
last<00:02:24.799> season<00:02:25.159> to<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.280> my<00:02:26.060> Master's<00:02:26.450> helpless

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
last season to this my Master's helpless

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.059 
last season to this my Master's helpless
Charlie<00:02:27.170> but<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.379> must<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.650> eight<00:02:27.769> divisions

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
Charlie but it must be eight divisions

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.640 
Charlie but it must be eight divisions
of<00:02:28.340> someone<00:02:28.610> isn't<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.909> yeah<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.720> mean<00:02:30.349> yeah

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
of someone isn't it yeah I mean yeah

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.170 
of someone isn't it yeah I mean yeah
it's<00:02:30.860> all<00:02:31.159> the<00:02:31.280> principles<00:02:31.700> you've<00:02:31.819> got<00:02:31.909> a<00:02:31.939> set

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
it's all the principles you've got a set

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.899 
it's all the principles you've got a set
yourself<00:02:32.510> right<00:02:32.810> but<00:02:33.230> every<00:02:33.500> game<00:02:34.010> every<00:02:34.730> day

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
yourself right but every game every day

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.509 
yourself right but every game every day
really<00:02:35.209> training<00:02:35.900> wise<00:02:36.829> just<00:02:37.159> as<00:02:37.280> well<00:02:37.430> as

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
really training wise just as well as

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.149 
really training wise just as well as
match<00:02:37.730> days<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.870> it's<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.110> big<00:02:39.260> difference<00:02:39.680> so

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
match days so it's a big difference so

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.520 
match days so it's a big difference so
that<00:02:40.370> feeling<00:02:40.879> when<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.420> not<00:02:41.690> she<00:02:41.930> first<00:02:42.230> goal

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530
