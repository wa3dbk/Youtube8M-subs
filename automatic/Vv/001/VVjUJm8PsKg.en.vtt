show a man i'm here at sigma we have

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.859 
show a man i'm here at sigma we have
five<00:00:19.960> new<00:00:20.470> lenses<00:00:21.189> to<00:00:21.519> talk<00:00:21.730> about<00:00:21.939> it<00:00:22.269> but

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
five new lenses to talk about it but

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.450 
five new lenses to talk about it but
there's<00:00:23.320> an<00:00:23.500> even<00:00:23.560> bigger<00:00:23.890> story<00:00:24.220> than<00:00:24.279> that

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
there's an even bigger story than that

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.249 
there's an even bigger story than that
and<00:00:24.789> that<00:00:24.970> is<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.240> fact<00:00:25.509> that<00:00:25.660> for<00:00:25.929> the<00:00:25.990> first

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
and that is the fact that for the first

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.769 
and that is the fact that for the first
time<00:00:26.500> sigma<00:00:27.369> is<00:00:27.519> making<00:00:27.910> use<00:00:28.119> of<00:00:28.150> a<00:00:28.419> new<00:00:28.570> kind

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
time sigma is making use of a new kind

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.390 
time sigma is making use of a new kind
of<00:00:28.960> blast<00:00:29.199> that's<00:00:29.560> never<00:00:29.830> been<00:00:30.039> used<00:00:30.099> before

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
of blast that's never been used before

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.049 
of blast that's never been used before
and<00:00:30.939> a<00:00:31.359> consumer<00:00:31.869> photographic<00:00:32.560> product

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and a consumer photographic product

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.190 
and a consumer photographic product
originally<00:00:34.059> designed<00:00:34.239> for<00:00:34.539> use<00:00:34.809> in<00:00:34.840> some

sigma<00:00:37.870> is<00:00:37.989> now<00:00:38.140> incorporating<00:00:38.920> a<00:00:38.980> glass<00:00:39.250> that

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
sigma is now incorporating a glass that

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.139 
sigma is now incorporating a glass that
we're<00:00:39.760> calling<00:00:40.180> FLD<00:00:41.050> which<00:00:41.949> is<00:00:42.160> a<00:00:42.190> special<00:00:42.910> low

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
we're calling FLD which is a special low

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.270 
we're calling FLD which is a special low
dispersion<00:00:43.539> glass<00:00:43.780> which<00:00:44.620> has<00:00:44.829> optical

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
dispersion glass which has optical

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.240 
dispersion glass which has optical
characteristics<00:00:45.910> of<00:00:46.530> exactly<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.710> same<00:00:47.949> as

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
characteristics of exactly the same as

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.229 
characteristics of exactly the same as
the<00:00:49.230> fluoride<00:00:50.230> elements<00:00:50.680> and<00:00:50.829> so<00:00:51.579> we<00:00:51.879> now<00:00:52.030> have

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
the fluoride elements and so we now have

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.810 
the fluoride elements and so we now have
a<00:00:52.270> lens<00:00:52.570> that<00:00:52.870> at<00:00:53.140> much<00:00:53.379> lower<00:00:53.649> cost<00:00:54.010> and<00:00:54.280> much

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
a lens that at much lower cost and much

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.330 
a lens that at much lower cost and much
lighter<00:00:55.359> weight<00:00:55.660> will<00:00:56.230> give<00:00:56.500> you<00:00:56.649> equivalent

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
lighter weight will give you equivalent

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.779 
lighter weight will give you equivalent
optical<00:00:57.760> performance<00:00:57.879> for<00:00:58.809> four<00:00:59.109> islands<00:00:59.590> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
optical performance for four islands and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.729
