tube<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.989> which<00:00:49.530> food<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.910> realize<00:00:51.750> whenever

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
tube is which food now realize whenever

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.990 
tube is which food now realize whenever
what<00:00:52.559> talking<00:00:52.860> about<00:00:53.010> weight<00:00:53.160> loss<00:00:53.190> insulin

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
what talking about weight loss insulin

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.529 
what talking about weight loss insulin
is<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> key<00:00:55.410> hormones<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.539> prevent

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
is one of the key hormones that prevent

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.750 
is one of the key hormones that prevent
you<00:00:57.870> from<00:00:58.079> losing<00:00:58.680> weight<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.190> burning<00:00:59.520> fat

you from losing weight and burning fat
so<00:01:00.539> whenever<00:01:00.870> insulins<00:01:01.530> hi<00:01:02.030> your<00:01:03.030> fat<00:01:03.570> burning

so whenever insulins hi your fat burning

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960 
so whenever insulins hi your fat burning
process<00:01:04.170> basically<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:05.189> inhibited<00:01:05.850> or

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
process basically is inhibited or

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.840 
process basically is inhibited or
stopped<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.780> its<00:01:06.990> tracks<00:01:07.250> okay<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.310> anytime

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
stopped in its tracks okay so anytime

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.000 
stopped in its tracks okay so anytime
sugar<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.390> consumed<00:01:09.930> you're<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.830> an

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
sugar is consumed you're going to see an

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.770 
sugar is consumed you're going to see an
increase<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.490> insulin<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
increase in insulin and that's going to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
increase in insulin and that's going to
prevent<00:01:13.049> weight<00:01:13.380> loss<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.280> we're<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.760> to

of<00:01:47.640> them<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.720> cup<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.170> frosted<00:01:49.710> flakes<00:01:49.920> so

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
of them is one cup of frosted flakes so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.460 
of them is one cup of frosted flakes so
that's<00:01:50.250> one<00:01:50.549> cup<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.880> apple<00:01:51.180> juice<00:01:51.210> 1<00:01:52.200> cup<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that's one cup of apple juice 1 cup of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.149 
that's one cup of apple juice 1 cup of
frosted<00:01:52.950> flakes<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:54.000> half<00:01:54.420> cup<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.170> packaged

frosted flakes one half cup of packaged
fruit<00:01:56.759> bowl<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.329> then<00:01:57.719> one<00:01:58.110> fruit<00:01:58.799> roll-up

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
fruit bowl and then one fruit roll-up

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.319 
fruit bowl and then one fruit roll-up
okay<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.270> which<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.540> which<00:02:00.899> here<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:02.329> which

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
okay so which is which here we go which

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.990 
okay so which is which here we go which
one<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:03.990> okay<00:02:04.700> this<00:02:05.700> is

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
one do you think this is okay this is

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.930 
one do you think this is okay this is
actually<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> fruit<00:02:07.140> roll-up<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.940> contains

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
actually the fruit roll-up it contains

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.860 
actually the fruit roll-up it contains
seven<00:02:09.720> grams<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.440> sugar<00:02:11.209> this<00:02:12.209> one<00:02:12.480> which<00:02:12.690> one

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
seven grams of sugar this one which one

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.910 
seven grams of sugar this one which one
do<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.020> think<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.349> one<00:02:13.560> was

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
do you think this one was

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
do you think this one was
and<00:02:14.099> here's<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.550> other<00:02:14.640> ones<00:02:14.880> which<00:02:15.690> one<00:02:15.900> do

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
and here's the other ones which one do

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.360 
and here's the other ones which one do
you<00:02:16.050> think<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.290> one<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you think this one is this is the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.880 
you think this one is this is the
packaged<00:02:17.940> fruit<00:02:18.599> bowl<00:02:18.870> look<00:02:19.410> at<00:02:19.530> how<00:02:19.650> much

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
packaged fruit bowl look at how much

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.699 
packaged fruit bowl look at how much
sugar<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.150> half<00:02:21.630> cup<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:22.110> packaged<00:02:22.470> fruit

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
sugar is in a half cup of packaged fruit

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.650 
sugar is in a half cup of packaged fruit
bowl<00:02:22.920> vs<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.610> fruit<00:02:23.880> roll-up<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.360> was<00:02:24.480> quite

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
bowl vs a fruit roll-up that was quite

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.809 
bowl vs a fruit roll-up that was quite
surprising<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.290> me<00:02:25.459> this<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:28.340> frosted<00:02:29.340> flakes

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
surprising to me this is frosted flakes

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.720 
surprising to me this is frosted flakes
this<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.480> cup<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.380> frosted<00:02:32.220> cornflakes

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
this is one cup of frosted cornflakes

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.059 
this is one cup of frosted cornflakes
again<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.270> just<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> sugar<00:02:33.989> content<00:02:34.319> not

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
again this is just the sugar content not

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.740 
again this is just the sugar content not
including<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.670> total<00:02:36.000> carbohydrate<00:02:36.569> content

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
including the total carbohydrate content

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.080 
including the total carbohydrate content
look<00:02:37.530> at<00:02:37.680> how<00:02:37.739> much<00:02:37.890> sugar<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.430> there<00:02:38.610> it's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
look at how much sugar is in there it's

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.300 
look at how much sugar is in there it's
actually<00:02:39.270> less<00:02:39.810> than<00:02:40.140> what's<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.920> package

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
actually less than what's in the package

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.339 
actually less than what's in the package
fruit<00:02:41.610> bowl<00:02:42.090> even<00:02:42.480> though<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.930> total

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
fruit bowl even though the total

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.380 
fruit bowl even though the total
carbohydrate<00:02:43.920> level<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.310> probably<00:02:44.670> higher<00:02:45.000> in

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
carbohydrate level is probably higher in

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.059 
carbohydrate level is probably higher in
the<00:02:45.630> frosted<00:02:46.260> cornflakes<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.739> just<00:02:46.920> look<00:02:47.040> at

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
the frosted cornflakes but just look at

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.259 
the frosted cornflakes but just look at
the<00:02:47.190> amount<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.430> sugar<00:02:47.580> that's<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:47.940> there<00:02:48.090> it

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
the amount of sugar that's in there it

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.720 
the amount of sugar that's in there it
looks<00:02:49.019> like<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.290> about<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.920> little<00:02:50.400> bit<00:02:50.580> over

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
looks like it's about a little bit over

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.940 
looks like it's about a little bit over
two<00:02:51.300> times<00:02:51.600> as<00:02:51.780> much<00:02:51.900> sugars<00:02:52.290> in<00:02:52.410> as<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.860> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
two times as much sugars in as in the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.280 
two times as much sugars in as in the
fruit<00:02:53.280> roll-up<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.970> then<00:02:54.450> finally<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:55.230> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
fruit roll-up and then finally this is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.059 
fruit roll-up and then finally this is
one<00:02:55.920> cup<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.670> apple<00:02:57.480> juice<00:02:57.510> look<00:02:58.470> at<00:02:58.680> how<00:02:58.890> much

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
one cup of apple juice look at how much

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.830 
one cup of apple juice look at how much
sugar<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.549> in<00:02:59.580> there<00:02:59.819> in<00:03:00.000> comparison<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.810> that

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
sugar is in there in comparison to that

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.170 
sugar is in there in comparison to that
one<00:03:01.260> cup<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.620> apple<00:03:01.920> juice<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.670> people<00:03:02.910> who

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
one cup of apple juice so people who

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.500 
one cup of apple juice so people who
think<00:03:03.360> they're<00:03:03.630> drinking<00:03:05.150> apple<00:03:06.150> juice<00:03:06.180> and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
think they're drinking apple juice and

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.020 
think they're drinking apple juice and
doing<00:03:06.750> their<00:03:06.900> bodies<00:03:07.230> good<00:03:07.769> are<00:03:08.069> actually

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
doing their bodies good are actually

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.699 
doing their bodies good are actually
loading<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.720> body<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.049> sugar<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.560> goes

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
loading the body of sugar and that goes

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.559 
loading the body of sugar and that goes
with<00:03:10.860> pretty<00:03:11.250> much<00:03:11.310> any<00:03:11.549> fruit<00:03:11.850> juice<00:03:12.090> all

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
with pretty much any fruit juice all

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.729 
with pretty much any fruit juice all
right<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:12.780> let's<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.080> let<00:03:13.440> me<00:03:13.530> give<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.680> a
