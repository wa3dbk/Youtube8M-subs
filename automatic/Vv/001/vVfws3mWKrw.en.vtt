to me from day one and I was some young

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.469 
to me from day one and I was some young
coach<00:04:40.889> that<00:04:41.100> really<00:04:41.310> didn't<00:04:42.000> have<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.240> listen

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
coach that really didn't have to listen

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.260 
coach that really didn't have to listen
to<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:43.080> I<00:04:43.229> think<00:04:43.259> that<00:04:43.560> showed<00:04:44.180> kind<00:04:45.180> of

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
to and and I think that showed kind of

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.550 
to and and I think that showed kind of
their<00:04:45.389> character<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:46.050> think<00:04:46.229> that's<00:04:46.380> why

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
their character and I think that's why

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.350 
their character and I think that's why
we<00:04:46.800> get<00:04:47.190> so<00:04:47.340> well<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.520> hear<00:04:47.759> is<00:04:47.970> that<00:04:48.210> they

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
we get so well I hear is that they

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.409 
we get so well I hear is that they
they're<00:04:48.810> really<00:04:49.050> opening<00:04:49.440> open<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.949> learning

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
they're really opening open to learning

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.610 
they're really opening open to learning
any<00:04:51.419> way<00:04:51.630> that<00:04:51.720> they<00:04:51.780> could<00:04:51.990> be<00:04:52.199> gettin<00:04:52.440> better

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
any way that they could be gettin better

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.890 
any way that they could be gettin better
anyway<00:04:52.800> they<00:04:53.070> could<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.910> I'm<00:04:54.539> they

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
anyway they could and I'm they

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.570 
anyway they could and I'm they
approached<00:04:55.229> everything<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.919> every<00:04:56.430> match

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
approached everything that every match

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.980 
approached everything that every match
every<00:04:56.880> practice<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.360> season<00:04:57.660> like<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:57.960> I

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
every practice that season like that I

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.469 
every practice that season like that I
think<00:04:58.139> that's<00:04:58.470> why<00:04:59.160> we<00:04:59.310> were<00:04:59.430> peaking<00:04:59.759> in<00:04:59.970> May

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
think that's why we were peaking in May

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.900 
think that's why we were peaking in May
the<00:05:00.509> way<00:05:00.750> we<00:05:00.870> did<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:02.340> was<00:05:02.400> just<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.669> was<00:05:02.729> an

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
the way we did and it was just it was an

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.400 
the way we did and it was just it was an
amazing<00:05:03.090> experience<00:05:03.330> for<00:05:03.750> me<00:05:03.990> just<00:05:04.259> as<00:05:04.380> a

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
amazing experience for me just as a

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.490 
amazing experience for me just as a
young<00:05:04.620> person<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:05.160> see<00:05:05.930> what<00:05:06.930> can<00:05:07.050> happen<00:05:07.080> when

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
young person to see what can happen when

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.650 
young person to see what can happen when
so<00:05:07.800> many<00:05:07.889> guys<00:05:08.160> are<00:05:09.060> really<00:05:09.210> not<00:05:09.389> only<00:05:09.509> to

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
so many guys are really not only to

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.060 
so many guys are really not only to
sacrifice<00:05:10.110> but<00:05:10.320> when<00:05:10.470> so<00:05:10.620> many<00:05:10.680> guys<00:05:10.860> are

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
sacrifice but when so many guys are

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.629 
sacrifice but when so many guys are
willing<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:11.460> kind<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.199> you<00:05:13.199> know<00:05:13.370> really<00:05:14.370> get

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
and install the same philosophy and

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.439 
and install the same philosophy and
liveth<00:05:16.949> I<00:05:17.130> was<00:05:17.400> very<00:05:17.610> tough<00:05:17.910> from<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.240> team

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
liveth I was very tough from the team

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.100 
liveth I was very tough from the team
that<00:05:18.930> fourth<00:05:19.289> year<00:05:19.470> very<00:05:20.449> they<00:05:21.449> hated<00:05:21.810> me<00:05:21.840> for

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
that fourth year very they hated me for

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.290 
that fourth year very they hated me for
it<00:05:22.169> in<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.380> lot<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.560> ways<00:05:22.830> but<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:23.610> think<00:05:24.090> in<00:05:24.180> the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
it in a lot of ways but I think in the

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.850 
it in a lot of ways but I think in the
end<00:05:24.330> they<00:05:24.750> all<00:05:24.990> believed<00:05:25.380> that<00:05:25.530> it<00:05:25.650> was<00:05:25.740> the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
end they all believed that it was the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.830 
end they all believed that it was the
best<00:05:26.039> for<00:05:26.580> them<00:05:26.789> and

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
best for them and

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.780 
best for them and
you<00:05:28.080> know<00:05:28.199> because<00:05:28.860> I<00:05:29.010> did<00:05:29.220> not<00:05:29.250> want<00:05:29.430> any

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
you know because I did not want any

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.180 
you know because I did not want any
regrets<00:05:30.210> leaving<00:05:30.990> that<00:05:31.260> year<00:05:31.530> with<00:05:31.889> them<00:05:32.040> all

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
regrets leaving that year with them all

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.040 
regrets leaving that year with them all
graduating<00:05:32.880> I<00:05:33.060> thought<00:05:33.300> we<00:05:33.389> could<00:05:33.540> win<00:05:33.690> it<00:05:33.840> and

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
graduating I thought we could win it and

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.350 
graduating I thought we could win it and
we<00:05:34.590> ended<00:05:34.740> up<00:05:34.830> doing<00:05:34.889> it<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.880> was<00:05:36.000> worth<00:05:36.210> it

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
we ended up doing it so it was worth it

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.379 
we ended up doing it so it was worth it
for<00:05:37.260> some<00:05:37.620> reaching<00:05:38.280> their<00:05:38.639> greatest<00:05:38.940> goal

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
for some reaching their greatest goal

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.600 
for some reaching their greatest goal
would<00:05:39.750> constitute<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.530> end<00:05:41.010> of<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.400> quest

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
would constitute the end of the quest

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.430 
would constitute the end of the quest
for<00:05:42.000> others<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:43.290> would<00:05:43.410> be<00:05:43.590> another<00:05:43.919> beginning
