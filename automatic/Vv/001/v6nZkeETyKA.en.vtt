here and see we have the old mass

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.670 
here and see we have the old mass
airflow<00:00:36.240> sensor<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:37.380> gonna<00:00:37.470> have<00:00:37.590> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
airflow sensor we're gonna have to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.430 
airflow sensor we're gonna have to
unsnap<00:00:38.400> this<00:00:38.760> connector<00:00:39.240> and<00:00:40.140> then<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.320> have

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
unsnap this connector and then we have

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.340 
unsnap this connector and then we have
some<00:00:40.620> bolts<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.100> where<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:41.640> connected<00:00:41.880> to

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
some bolts here where it's connected to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.600 
some bolts here where it's connected to
the<00:00:43.610> intake<00:00:45.020> so<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.680> those<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.070> taken<00:00:47.460> off

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the intake so get those all taken off

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.210 
the intake so get those all taken off
and<00:00:47.970> we<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.470> hopefully<00:00:49.470> make<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.710> quick<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
and we just hopefully make it quick and

00:00:50.220 --> 00:01:02.160 
and we just hopefully make it quick and
just<00:00:50.400> swap<00:00:50.580> it<00:00:50.610> right<00:00:50.880> out

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:20.980 

just<00:01:03.170> give<00:01:03.290> myself<00:01:03.410> enough<00:01:03.830> space<00:01:04.129> here

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.429 

okay<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.799> got<00:01:23.189> all<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.880> bolts<00:01:24.180> out

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
okay so I got all the little bolts out

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.210 
okay so I got all the little bolts out
there's<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.710> two<00:01:26.630> three<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.799> fourth<00:01:29.130> one

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
there's one two three and a fourth one

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.179 
there's one two three and a fourth one
down<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.670> corner<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:31.500> way<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> did<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
down in the corner the way I did it

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.740 
down in the corner the way I did it
might<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.149> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.479> bit<00:01:33.750> more<00:01:34.549> frustrating

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
might be a little bit more frustrating

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.320 
might be a little bit more frustrating
an<00:01:36.750> alternate<00:01:37.409> way<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.670> would

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
an alternate way of going about it would

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.609 
an alternate way of going about it would
be<00:01:39.479> removing<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.110> engine<00:01:40.470> cover<00:01:42.409> moving<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
be removing this engine cover moving the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.880 
be removing this engine cover moving the
throttle<00:01:43.950> body<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.960> then<00:01:45.960> having<00:01:46.200> more<00:01:46.500> space

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
throttle body and then having more space

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.850 
throttle body and then having more space
to<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.689> work<00:01:48.899> down<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.500> was<00:01:49.649> able<00:01:49.830> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
to to work down here but I was able to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.910 
to to work down here but I was able to
work<00:01:50.039> it<00:01:50.220> out<00:01:50.340> using<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.500> wrench<00:01:53.390> another<00:01:54.390> ways

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
work it out using a wrench another ways

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.160 
work it out using a wrench another ways
detaching<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.039> back<00:01:56.310> end<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.720> housing

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
detaching this back end of the housing

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.380 
detaching this back end of the housing
for<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.920> air<00:01:59.130> filter<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.729> then<00:02:00.240> just

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
for the air filter and then just

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.210 
for the air filter and then just
bringing<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.840> whole<00:02:01.080> piece<00:02:01.380> up<00:02:01.679> so<00:02:02.069> they

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
bringing this whole piece up so they

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.309 
bringing this whole piece up so they
have<00:02:02.429> more<00:02:02.640> access<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.509> easy<00:02:03.750> access<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
have more access you can easy access to

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.960 
have more access you can easy access to
the<00:02:04.409> bolts<00:02:04.679> but<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.490> able<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.819> that

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
the bolts but I was able to do that

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.480 
the bolts but I was able to do that
without<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.869> let's<00:02:07.440> get<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.740> off<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.950> here

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.300 

all<00:02:12.210> right<00:02:12.390> simple<00:02:12.930> as<00:02:13.020> that<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.890> soon<00:02:14.070> as<00:02:14.220> you

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
all right simple as that as soon as you

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.970 
all right simple as that as soon as you
can<00:02:14.430> see<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:14.820> have<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.030> sensor<00:02:15.500> on<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.620> inside

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
can see we have the sensor on the inside

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.740 
can see we have the sensor on the inside
of<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.630> tube<00:02:18.630> here<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:21.120> then<00:02:21.510> we're<00:02:21.630> gonna

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
of this tube here and then we're gonna

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.480 
of this tube here and then we're gonna
replace<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.250> with<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> brand<00:02:23.550> new<00:02:24.230> hitachi<00:02:25.490> mass

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
replace it with a brand new hitachi mass

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.150 
replace it with a brand new hitachi mass
airflow<00:02:26.730> sensor<00:02:27.500> all<00:02:28.500> right<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:28.860> let's<00:02:29.040> get

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
airflow sensor all right so let's get

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.070 
airflow sensor all right so let's get
that<00:02:29.310> put<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:30.680> now<00:02:31.680> before<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.100> put<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.820> new

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
that put in now before I put the new

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.120 
that put in now before I put the new
mass<00:02:34.080> airflow<00:02:34.290> sensor<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.830> I'm<00:02:34.980> going<00:02:35.070> to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
mass airflow sensor on I'm going to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.400 
mass airflow sensor on I'm going to
clean<00:02:35.370> off<00:02:35.520> this<00:02:35.700> area<00:02:36.000> back<00:02:36.180> here<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.840> the

make sure I get any dirt and dust off of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.720 
make sure I get any dirt and dust off of
there<00:02:43.020> because<00:02:43.170> it's<00:02:44.160> no<00:02:44.280> point<00:02:44.550> putting

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
there because it's no point putting

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.550 
there because it's no point putting
something<00:02:45.210> new<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.720> clean<00:02:45.960> on<00:02:46.170> if<00:02:46.410> you're

something new and clean on if you're

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:57.640 
something new and clean on if you're
gonna<00:02:47.000> just<00:02:48.000> keep<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.330> dirty<00:02:48.540> everywhere<00:02:48.930> else

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:25.960 

okay<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.220> think<00:02:58.340> we're<00:02:58.610> ready<00:02:58.640> for<00:02:58.819> that

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.210 

and<00:03:26.970> it's<00:03:27.270> in<00:03:27.390> there<00:03:27.510> pretty<00:03:27.540> well<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.770> just<00:03:28.950> got

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
and it's in there pretty well I just got

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.140 
and it's in there pretty well I just got
to<00:03:29.310> get<00:03:29.430> these<00:03:29.720> nuts<00:03:31.340> tightened<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.640> put<00:03:32.970> back

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
to get these nuts tightened and put back

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.570 
to get these nuts tightened and put back
in<00:03:33.330> place<00:03:36.830> now<00:03:37.830> there<00:03:38.010> are<00:03:38.099> other<00:03:38.280> mass

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
in place now there are other mass

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.520 
in place now there are other mass
airflow<00:03:39.140> sensors<00:03:41.660> where<00:03:42.660> all<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.230> do<00:03:43.410> is

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
airflow sensors where all you do is

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.010 
airflow sensors where all you do is
remove<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.550> actual<00:03:45.000> sensor<00:03:45.450> unit<00:03:45.870> and

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
remove that the actual sensor unit and

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.860 
remove that the actual sensor unit and
plug<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.739> new<00:03:46.890> one<00:03:46.920> but<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.489> one<00:03:47.730> makes<00:03:48.660> it

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
plug in a new one but this one makes it

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.990 
plug in a new one but this one makes it
even<00:03:49.080> easier<00:03:53.209> all<00:03:54.209> right<00:03:54.980> pretty<00:03:55.980> much<00:03:56.040> down

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
even easier all right pretty much down

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.059 
even easier all right pretty much down
to<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.239> finishing<00:03:57.569> steps<00:03:59.000> just<00:04:00.000> need<00:04:00.180> my<00:04:01.069> my

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:09.170 
to the finishing steps just need my my
ratchet<00:04:02.480> just<00:04:03.480> down<00:04:03.750> here<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:08.090> tighten<00:04:09.090> this

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.890 

now<00:04:49.930> this<00:04:50.080> entire<00:04:50.260> process<00:04:51.010> should<00:04:51.040> take<00:04:51.900> half

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
now this entire process should take half

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.400 
now this entire process should take half
an<00:04:53.110> hour<00:04:53.260> maybe<00:04:53.920> 45<00:04:54.250> minutes<00:04:54.760> tops<00:04:55.410> unless

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
an hour maybe 45 minutes tops unless
