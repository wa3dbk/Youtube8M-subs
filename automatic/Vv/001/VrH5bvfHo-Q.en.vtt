 bay leaves a little bit of 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.930
 time like that go ahead go about it compared to 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.949
 to appear salt because the evidence has 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.240
 worked the sausage meat that is 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.229
 already a little seasoned what not 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.630

 soft to have four minutes we have 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.500
 now added 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.619
 the cognac so we do not flambÃ© 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.549

 if you are like me you have 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.659
 inevitably preferred armagnac not that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.820
 it's a little more subtle than cognac 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.159
 here you evaporate a little bit 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.049
 the brandy Armagnac and there we will add 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.640
 absorbed the juice armagnac or cognac 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.759
 the really slow butter dramatic or 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.290
 then the maras from the in the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.290
 mix with bread 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.260
 they are given and it is a little 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.230
 warm up and your terminal stuffing 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.660

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.690
 watch out for sausage 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.210

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.280
 hand is super nice and there you go 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.080
 people there these areas and then we 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.080
 season makes the bread big and the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.470
 chestnut trees and after big round of 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.450
 poland or the page a zone 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.580
 it takes it a ditch on the salt 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.570
 all the attention if you have 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.000
 chosen a little relayed for their 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.459

 at dax that's the stuffing is over then 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.610
 that's where it's very homogeneous and 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.200
 especially not from the offer because that sense 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.280
 with too much that provided the drop is 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.570
 so either you 've stuck it a tiny 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.800
 little raw like that or so you take 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.940
 a small pan to taste a whole 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.080
 little bit of joke power would you 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.590
 this is suitable for rectifying 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.090
 seasoning 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.860

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.670
