itself<00:00:45.780> there's<00:00:46.410> been<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.830> discussion

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
itself there's been some discussion

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.189 
itself there's been some discussion
about<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.699> especially<00:00:48.150> since<00:00:48.540> pickleball

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
about this especially since pickleball

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.829 
about this especially since pickleball
and<00:00:49.379> tennis<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.400> exactly<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> same<00:00:51.239> so

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
and tennis are not exactly the same so

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.549 
and tennis are not exactly the same so
let's<00:00:52.170> break<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> down<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:53.129> step<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.580> a<00:00:53.640> time

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
let's break it down one step at a time

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.579 
let's break it down one step at a time
court<00:00:55.559> lines<00:00:55.769> are<00:00:56.070> good<00:00:56.900> okay<00:00:57.900> this<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.559> is

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
court lines are good okay this one is

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.229 
court lines are good okay this one is
pretty<00:00:58.890> straightforward<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.789> most<00:00:59.969> people

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
pretty straightforward and most people

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.010 
pretty straightforward and most people
already<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.750> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
already know it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.049 
already know it

of the ball another critical thing to

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.910 
of the ball another critical thing to
understand<00:01:15.539> is<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.080> tennis<00:01:16.470> ball<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
understand is that a tennis ball and a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
understand is that a tennis ball and a
pickleball<00:01:17.250> compressed<00:01:17.850> differently<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
pickleball compressed differently a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.690 
pickleball compressed differently a
tennis<00:01:19.380> ball<00:01:19.530> compresses<00:01:20.130> when<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.369> hits

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
tennis ball compresses when it hits

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.880 
tennis ball compresses when it hits
making<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.539> surface<00:01:22.020> area<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> ball<00:01:22.710> that

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
making the surface area of the ball that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.660 
making the surface area of the ball that
contacts<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> court<00:01:23.970> larger<00:01:24.690> a<00:01:25.670> pickleball

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
contacts the court larger a pickleball

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
contacts the court larger a pickleball
is<00:01:26.789> harder<00:01:27.179> and<00:01:27.210> does<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:27.660> compress<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.289> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
is harder and does not compress like a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.440 
is harder and does not compress like a
tennis<00:01:28.649> ball<00:01:28.800> basically<00:01:29.759> there's<00:01:29.970> no<00:01:30.149> give

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
tennis ball basically there's no give

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.420 
tennis ball basically there's no give
because<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.929> the<00:01:31.080> hardness<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> ball<00:01:31.860> this

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
because of the hardness of the ball this

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.370 
because of the hardness of the ball this
means<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.000> surface<00:01:33.240> area<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.960> pickleball

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
means the surface area of a pickleball

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
means the surface area of a pickleball
which<00:01:34.650> contacts<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> core<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.090> point<00:01:36.299> of

which contacts the core or the point of
contact<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.049> much<00:01:37.560> smaller<00:01:37.920> only<00:01:38.460> about<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
contact is much smaller only about the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.740 
contact is much smaller only about the
size<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.450> dime<00:01:40.490> point<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.610> contact<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.330> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
size of a dime point of contact is the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.710 
size of a dime point of contact is the
rule<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:44.490> point<00:01:44.790> where<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> ball<00:01:45.240> meets<00:01:45.540> the

rule the point where the ball meets the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.870 
rule the point where the ball meets the
court<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.170> what<00:01:46.560> determines<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.520> ball<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
court is what determines if the ball is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.080 
court is what determines if the ball is
in<00:01:48.150> or<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.869> pickleball<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:50.070> line<00:01:50.729> calls

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
in or out in pickleball all line calls

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969 
in or out in pickleball all line calls
are<00:01:51.360> only<00:01:51.570> determined<00:01:52.200> by<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.380> point<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
are only determined by this point of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.950 
are only determined by this point of
contact<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.360> means<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.900> that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
contact what that means is that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.990 
contact what that means is that
sometimes<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.860> ball<00:01:56.009> may<00:01:56.189> look<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.850> in

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
sometimes a ball may look like it's in

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.730 
sometimes a ball may look like it's in
because<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> curved<00:01:58.079> part<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> ball<00:01:58.619> is

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
because the curved part of the ball is

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.679 
because the curved part of the ball is
overlapping<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.430> line<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.329> actually

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
overlapping the line but it's actually
