of which of course being the grand piano

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.520 
of which of course being the grand piano
now<00:00:37.449> it<00:00:37.569> doesn't<00:00:37.809> just<00:00:37.989> stop<00:00:38.170> there<00:00:38.199> with<00:00:38.499> a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
now it doesn't just stop there with a

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.649 
now it doesn't just stop there with a
piano<00:00:38.769> I<00:00:39.129> can<00:00:39.339> actually<00:00:39.489> customize<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.269> tone

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:40.659 
piano I can actually customize the tone

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.779 
piano I can actually customize the tone
using<00:00:41.109> these<00:00:41.350> three<00:00:41.559> buttons<00:00:41.800> here<00:00:41.949> to<00:00:42.609> design

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
using these three buttons here to design

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.180 
using these three buttons here to design
a<00:00:42.969> piano<00:00:43.449> exactly<00:00:43.960> how<00:00:44.079> I<00:00:44.109> like<00:00:44.440> it<00:00:44.649> so<00:00:45.069> the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
a piano exactly how I like it so the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.919 
a piano exactly how I like it so the
first<00:00:45.309> option<00:00:45.670> that<00:00:45.850> I<00:00:46.030> can<00:00:46.210> edit<00:00:46.359> here<00:00:46.659> is

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
first option that I can edit here is

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.209 
first option that I can edit here is
what's<00:00:47.199> called<00:00:47.289> hammer<00:00:47.649> response

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
what's called hammer response

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.369 
what's called hammer response
now<00:00:48.670> that's<00:00:48.850> emulating<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.600> slight<00:00:49.899> time

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
now that's emulating the slight time

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.099 
now that's emulating the slight time
delay<00:00:50.769> between<00:00:51.069> me<00:00:51.909> striking<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.719> key<00:00:52.899> and

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
delay between me striking the key and

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:54.869 
delay between me striking the key and
the<00:00:53.469> hammer<00:00:53.679> reaching<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.190> string<00:00:54.489> on<00:00:54.789> the

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
the hammer reaching the string on the

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.759 
the hammer reaching the string on the
grand<00:00:55.089> piano<00:00:55.269> so<00:00:55.719> I<00:00:55.749> can<00:00:56.019> adjust<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.589> four

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
grand piano so I can adjust that to four

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.709 
grand piano so I can adjust that to four
different<00:00:56.920> levels<00:00:57.159> to<00:00:57.879> emulate<00:00:58.389> some<00:00:58.569> nice

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
different levels to emulate some nice

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.389 
different levels to emulate some nice
different<00:00:59.109> feel<00:00:59.289> on<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.530> piano<00:00:59.889> how<00:01:00.039> I<00:01:00.069> like

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
different feel on the piano how I like

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.969 
different feel on the piano how I like
it<00:01:00.429> I<00:01:00.760> can<00:01:01.479> also<00:01:01.629> change<00:01:02.049> the<00:01:02.709> string

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
it I can also change the string

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.610 
it I can also change the string
resonance<00:01:03.399> which<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.510> how<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.020> strings<00:01:05.440> are

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
resonance which is how the strings are

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.650 
resonance which is how the strings are
all<00:01:05.770> resonating<00:01:06.430> off<00:01:06.610> each<00:01:06.790> other<00:01:07.000> now<00:01:07.600> you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
all resonating off each other now you

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.330 
all resonating off each other now you
can<00:01:07.870> hear<00:01:08.020> this<00:01:08.200> if<00:01:08.410> I<00:01:08.560> press<00:01:09.010> down<00:01:09.040> the
