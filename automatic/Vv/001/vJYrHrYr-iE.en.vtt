00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
point you know that they don't have to

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.469 
point you know that they don't have to
pay<00:05:36.440> you<00:05:36.620> anymore<00:05:36.919> because<00:05:37.340> you<00:05:38.120> know<00:05:38.210> you're

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
pay you anymore because you know you're

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830
