I<00:01:17.439> feel<00:01:18.369> like<00:01:18.700> DC<00:01:19.240> has<00:01:19.450> become<00:01:19.930> absolutely

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
I feel like DC has become absolutely

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.039 
I feel like DC has become absolutely
integral<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.700> just<00:01:21.969> the<00:01:22.119> experience<00:01:22.299> of<00:01:22.750> the

game because without the DC multiverse
this<00:01:27.039> just<00:01:27.220> doesn't<00:01:27.520> work<00:01:27.670> with<00:01:28.210> what<00:01:28.390> we're

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
this just doesn't work with what we're

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.300 
this just doesn't work with what we're
trying<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.899> do<00:01:29.140> you<00:01:29.710> know<00:01:29.799> pushing<00:01:30.100> the

character story in multiple different
ways<00:01:33.939> it's<00:01:34.600> all<00:01:34.899> tied<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.979> really<00:01:36.939> well<00:01:36.970> with

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
ways it's all tied in really well with

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.770 
ways it's all tied in really well with
the<00:01:37.810> existing<00:01:38.350> DC<00:01:38.799> setting<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.720> the

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
biggest things that we bring to the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.880 
biggest things that we bring to the
table<00:01:42.159> is<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.750> recognition<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.470> comes<00:01:44.710> with

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.050 
reasons why that would just be a bad
idea<00:02:17.170> for<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.370> game<00:02:18.549> and<00:02:18.880> for<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
idea for the game and for the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.970 
idea for the game and for the
feasibility<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.569> making<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.560> try<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.739> find

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
feasibility of making so we try to find

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.309 
feasibility of making so we try to find
things<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.310> are<00:02:21.400> representative<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.239> him<00:02:22.450> in

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
things that are representative of him in

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.979 
things that are representative of him in
his<00:02:23.470> constructs<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.730> he<00:02:24.940> summons<00:02:25.329> a<00:02:25.390> giant<00:02:25.720> jet

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
his constructs so he summons a giant jet

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.050 
his constructs so he summons a giant jet
and<00:02:26.230> throws<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.799> at<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:27.970> course

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and throws it at you and that of course

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.430 
and throws it at you and that of course
represents<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> sort<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.750> backstory<00:02:29.109> is<00:02:29.260> being

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
represents a sort of backstory is being

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.900 
represents a sort of backstory is being
a<00:02:29.530> test<00:02:29.799> pilot<00:02:29.980> we're<00:02:30.430> always<00:02:30.549> looking<00:02:30.730> for

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
a test pilot we're always looking for

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.599 
a test pilot we're always looking for
ways<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.209> incorporate<00:02:31.750> DC<00:02:32.620> history<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.370> lower

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
ways to incorporate DC history and lower

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.849 
ways to incorporate DC history and lower
into<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.090> game<00:02:34.269> in<00:02:35.109> ways<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.380> make<00:02:35.560> sense

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
into the game in ways that make sense

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.710 
into the game in ways that make sense
for<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.340> competitive<00:02:36.639> environment<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.569> one<00:02:37.660> of

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
for a competitive environment and one of

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.960 
for a competitive environment and one of
the<00:02:37.780> ways<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.019> I'm<00:02:38.170> really<00:02:38.440> proud<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.459> what

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
the ways that I'm really proud of what

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.190 
the ways that I'm really proud of what
we've<00:02:40.060> done<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.329> is<00:02:40.510> through<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.780> artifacts

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
we've done that is through the artifacts

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.750 
we've done that is through the artifacts
now<00:02:41.470> these<00:02:41.620> are<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.829> items<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.250> players

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
now these are the items that players

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.030 
now these are the items that players
will<00:02:43.000> be<00:02:43.120> acquiring<00:02:44.109> from<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> artifact

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
will be acquiring from the artifact

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.580 
will be acquiring from the artifact
foundry<00:02:45.489> through<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.120> match<00:02:46.299> these<00:02:46.989> are

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
foundry through the match these are

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.340 
foundry through the match these are
items<00:02:47.769> that<00:02:48.010> increase<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.670> power<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.660> their

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
items that increase the power of their

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.199 
items that increase the power of their
champion<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.130> that<00:02:51.489> makes<00:02:51.670> them<00:02:51.850> better<00:02:51.940> able

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
champion so that makes them better able

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.629 
champion so that makes them better able
to<00:02:52.329> deal<00:02:52.389> with<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.989> threat<00:02:53.170> at<00:02:53.410> hand<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.400> each
