crazy I really liked this idea behind it
it's<00:02:03.899> better<00:02:04.079> than<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> ballistic<00:02:04.799> knife<00:02:04.829> or

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
it's better than the ballistic knife or

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.230 
it's better than the ballistic knife or
because<00:02:05.430> ballista<00:02:05.729> knife<00:02:05.880> or<00:02:06.030> kind<00:02:06.180> of

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
because ballista knife or kind of

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.510 
because ballista knife or kind of
pointless<00:02:06.600> after<00:02:06.780> round<00:02:07.079> 20<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.590> since<00:02:08.429> I

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
pointless after round 20 and since I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.760
