00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
very interesting because the xbox one

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.620 
very interesting because the xbox one
lost<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> ps4<00:00:26.039> last<00:00:26.550> month<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.179> it<00:00:27.449> was

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
lost to the ps4 last month but it was

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.050 
lost to the ps4 last month but it was
within<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:28.589> said<00:00:28.829> 13,000<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:29.999> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
within I think they said 13,000 so it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.759 
within I think they said 13,000 so it
was<00:00:30.150> pretty<00:00:30.390> good<00:00:30.599> pretty<00:00:30.869> even<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.619> more

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
was pretty good pretty even but more

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.400 
was pretty good pretty even but more
importantly<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.700> xbox<00:00:33.150> one<00:00:33.450> actually<00:00:34.050> saw<00:00:34.260> an

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
importantly the xbox one actually saw an

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.780 
importantly the xbox one actually saw an
increase<00:00:34.560> of<00:00:34.800> eighty-one<00:00:35.760> percent

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
increase of eighty-one percent

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.420 
increase of eighty-one percent
year-over-year<00:00:36.660> which<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.530> huge<00:00:37.950> absolutely

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
year-over-year which is huge absolutely

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.400 
year-over-year which is huge absolutely
huge<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.390> see<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> Xbox<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.380> is

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
huge and we see that the Xbox one is

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.280 
huge and we see that the Xbox one is
actually<00:00:40.680> doing<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.220> lot<00:00:41.400> better<00:00:41.460> than<00:00:42.090> uh<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
actually doing a lot better than uh you

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.960 
actually doing a lot better than uh you
know<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:43.590> previously<00:00:44.160> thought<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
know then previously thought and in the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.090 
know then previously thought and in the
previous<00:00:45.270> year<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.900> any<00:00:46.260> kind<00:00:46.470> of<00:00:46.620> growth<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
previous year so any kind of growth is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.530 
previous year so any kind of growth is
really<00:00:47.370> good<00:00:47.580> and<00:00:47.790> much<00:00:48.030> needed<00:00:48.240> and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
really good and much needed and

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.630 
really good and much needed and
appreciated<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:49.830> that<00:00:50.010> Microsoft

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
appreciated and I think that Microsoft

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.280 
appreciated and I think that Microsoft
has<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.060> xbox<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> right

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
has the xbox one going in the right

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.720 
has the xbox one going in the right
direction<00:00:52.470> you<00:00:53.100> know<00:00:53.220> maybe<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.520> was<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.700> little

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
direction you know maybe I was a little

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.490 
direction you know maybe I was a little
miscalculated<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.900> thinking<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.380> they

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
miscalculated with thinking that they

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.320 
miscalculated with thinking that they
wouldn't<00:00:55.740> lose<00:00:55.920> another<00:00:56.250> NPD<00:00:56.880> for<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.150> rest

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
wouldn't lose another NPD for the rest

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.180 
wouldn't lose another NPD for the rest
of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.540> year<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.410> bottom<00:00:58.710> line<00:00:58.740> is<00:00:58.950> that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
of the year but the bottom line is that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.920 
of the year but the bottom line is that
they're<00:00:59.700> doing<00:00:59.910> better<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.450> they<00:01:00.570> contagious

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
they're doing better and they contagious

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.930 
they're doing better and they contagious
continuously<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:02.070> growth<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.610> that's<00:01:02.760> more

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
continuously see growth and that's more

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.060 
continuously see growth and that's more
important<00:01:03.390> than<00:01:03.480> anything<00:01:03.750> else<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.830> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
important than anything else you know I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.710 
important than anything else you know I
feel<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.759> will<00:01:05.939> eventually<00:01:06.360> catch<00:01:06.509> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
feel like they will eventually catch the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.929 
feel like they will eventually catch the
ps4<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.530> North<00:01:07.829> America<00:01:08.340> especially<00:01:08.520> by<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
ps4 in North America especially by the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.310 
ps4 in North America especially by the
end<00:01:09.149> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.329> year<00:01:09.359> and<00:01:09.689> I'm<00:01:09.780> excited<00:01:10.109> about

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
end of the year and I'm excited about

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.870 
end of the year and I'm excited about
that<00:01:10.469> because<00:01:10.649> they<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.189> games<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that because they have games and the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.669 
that because they have games and the
PlayStation<00:01:12.359> 4<00:01:12.630> doesn't<00:01:13.140> exactly<00:01:13.200> have

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679 
PlayStation 4 doesn't exactly have

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:15.889 
PlayStation 4 doesn't exactly have
anything<00:01:14.039> that<00:01:14.429> screams<00:01:14.670> awesome<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.719> my

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
anything that screams awesome at my

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.330 
anything that screams awesome at my
opinion<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.740> think<00:01:16.859> it's<00:01:17.159> really

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
opinion and so I think it's really

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.760 
opinion and so I think it's really
important<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> mention<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.049> xbox<00:01:19.469> one

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
important to mention that the xbox one

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.440 
important to mention that the xbox one
isn't<00:01:20.460> doing<00:01:20.670> bad<00:01:20.819> there's<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.299> these

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
isn't doing bad there's all these

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.599 
isn't doing bad there's all these
misconceptions<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.380> because<00:01:22.859> the<00:01:22.979> xbox<00:01:23.369> one

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
misconceptions that because the xbox one

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:25.760 
misconceptions that because the xbox one
isn't<00:01:23.999> selling<00:01:24.359> quite<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.869> well<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.499> ps4

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
isn't selling quite as well as the ps4

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.559 
isn't selling quite as well as the ps4
that<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.429> selling<00:01:26.789> poorly<00:01:27.149> which<00:01:27.299> just

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
that it's selling poorly which just

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.179 
that it's selling poorly which just
isn't<00:01:27.749> the<00:01:27.990> case<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.649> think<00:01:28.679> that<00:01:29.069> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
isn't the case and I think that the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.249 
isn't the case and I think that the
sooner<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.609> we<00:01:29.999> get<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.359> fallacy<00:01:30.899> out<00:01:31.109> of

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
sooner that we get that fallacy out of

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.410 
sooner that we get that fallacy out of
the<00:01:31.380> way<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.770> better<00:01:32.039> and<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.579> am<00:01:32.700> excited<00:01:32.999> even

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the way the better and I am excited even

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.510 
the way the better and I am excited even
though<00:01:33.569> it<00:01:33.810> didn't<00:01:34.049> win<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.380> NPD<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.249> last

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
though it didn't win at NPD for last

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.099 
though it didn't win at NPD for last
month<00:01:35.819> that<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.210> actually<00:01:36.420> did<00:01:36.749> see<00:01:37.020> an

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
month that it actually did see an

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:38.660 
month that it actually did see an
increase<00:01:37.469> year-on-year<00:01:37.740> which<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.490> as

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
increase year-on-year which is just as

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.819 
increase year-on-year which is just as
important<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.509> eventually<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.679> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
important because eventually with the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.800
