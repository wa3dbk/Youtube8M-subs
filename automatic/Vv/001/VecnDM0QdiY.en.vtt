00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 is it possible to grow teeth extracted 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:19.619
 interesting question since i come from 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.220
 Soviet time then culture 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.669
 Teeth relationship was so very 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:30.000
 pragmatic and teeth were treated very badly 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.790
 it hurt them some 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.359
 feeling that it's scary is better with this not 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.980
 get involved and most often when you get 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:42.510
 itself sense in Soviet times this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.039
 finished with teeth removal but will create 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.809
 do you understand what is remote in childhood 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.879
 teeth really were not quite 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.469
 the right decision and would like them 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:56.370
 recover but somehow the technology is so 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.149
 which could grow much more than once 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.769
 common no yes yes you can 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.229
 implants insert or there bridges 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.450
 but I have several things in my life 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.710
 Such plots are very interesting first 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:19.610
 I went to the elder's business 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.540
 father sebastian man amazing 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.790
 the abbot was the abbot 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.670
 now the elder is a hermit though to him 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.060
 but the pilgrimage continues to be very 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.509
 active despite the fact that the legs are inside 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.320
 churches hierarchs to him are very solidly so 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.170
 difficult to relate 1 we heat came 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.189
 would have thought or teeth he was already in general 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.969
 old enough moment already went about it 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.969
 legends that 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.479
 unusual old man 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.890
 home with him a short talk me 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.979
 impressed by such a very sick relationship 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.110
 [music] 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.720
 let's say so loud a raspberry is great 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.510
 reversing the behavior of liturgy there 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.610
 holidays of some kind or ethologist 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.500
 next time a few years later I 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.450
 met when I came to him I was 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.020
 surprised at him you began to grow red 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:31.560
 hair and teeth grew in principle we know 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.300
 that in adulthood already in to old 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.450
 There are a lot of such cases 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.030
 when they start growing for the third time in 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.280
 first after dairy just ordinary 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.820
 then the third time started again nast it 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.510
 not wisdom teeth but it is a whole 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.550
 complex of teeth and that's when he had 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.890
 the whole teeth I was surprised it kind 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.519
 figure that in person is in 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:01.410
 very good condition once he has a day 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.790
 regenerated organs and in particular i 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.160
 met with one very interesting 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.640
 a psychic who assured that I 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.130
 I grow grown people, then I 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.930
 decided to try he traveled with us 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.269
 several expeditions very good my 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:22.140
 familiar and let's try me 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:23.010
 fangs because they along with his 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.380
 student 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.079
 did me three sessions on recovery 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.750
 teeth lined up means us mental 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.790
 the matrix then filled it with energy then 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:40.730
 profit means that in material 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:44.690
 built a real canine in a real body 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.230
 but nothing helped it worked and 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.959
 somehow eggs and abandoned 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.260
 then there were the experiences of my life such 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.680
 who allowed me to accept myself so 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.349
 what is and some teeth removed it 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.500
 just part of the way i 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:09.790
 which I go and go through and is 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:12.769
 Now part of this story is related but Sergei 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.750
 periodically me people who either 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:19.100
 grow or want to grow meet 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:22.070
 and I studied this topic looking for specialists 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.720
 who still could and in particular 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.050
 Such growing methods are described. 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.620
 teeth that you must enter the state 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.370
 when your teeth really grew 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.889
 try to remember 56 years when 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.840
 milk teeth changed to the real straight 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.300
 imagine that you have there in that 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.720
 a place where there is no rocked tooth fell out 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.220
 he begins to grow another even some 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.000
 worry pain is present you must 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.900
 consists in entering the state you do 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.289
 when your body is able to grow 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.580
 second naturally you have to submit 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.660
 technology point to imagine how he 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.030
 that's what it means right visually 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.430
 present try zulu language 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.060
 feel add on how would you rest 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.650
 him 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.900
 that is, spend on such visualizations 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.240
 quite a lot of time let's say this 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.630
 maybe three to six months there 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.780
 when you visualize every day 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.840
 I give it a lot of attention 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.340
 then visualize how inside is not 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.590
 only visualize feel 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.120
 look in the mirror out and it seems to you here 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.160
 it would be great to imagine 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.740
 it looked that is you in every way 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.479
 embed in your life the effect of that 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.760
 you have a tooth plus 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.919
 before that feel that all of you there 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.610
 five six years old when this shift 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.150
 happens 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.430
 maybe you can even survive 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.139
 condition earlier when you are up to years 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:56.039
 they are your first time began to grow 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:58.509
 being cut means after you 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.479
 learned to visualize naturally 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:05.469
 need a diet 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:08.110
 proper diet is best to switch to 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:10.479
 separate food and 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.309
 and remove some complicated dishes like 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.219
 meat and creatures are not very much energy 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:19.569
 mission to pick one choose 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:23.199
 a priori energy and separate 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:25.649
 products focus on what gives you 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:31.330
 most calcium 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:33.309
 mr literally greens same thing then 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.069
 eat here just eat a lot of them separately 

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:39.610
 a lot to get enough but separately one 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:41.259
 this one dish means well most likely 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.240
 after such a proposal many 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.879
 abandon the idea to grow teeth yourself 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.539
 because well hold out on the split 

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:49.059
 nutrition 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:51.369
 Magritte is harder than implant 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:56.270
 I 'll start if you don't 

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:57.599
 scared off then another recommendation this 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.149
 [music] 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:03.430
 try to live your life 

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:05.559
 retrograde survival as it was like 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.279
 would have been your life if you hadn't 

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:08.559
 I'm sitting 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:14.339
 if suddenly you are in any condition 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:14.339
 remained if the fund was still with you 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:24.899
 whole and here for 3 or 6 months 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:27.789
 changing my food + dedicate it 

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:30.069
 these fantasies these dreams enough 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:33.189
 a lot of time this positive 

00:07:30.069 --> 00:07:36.999
 the impression that it would be if they had 

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:37.449
 teeth giving these dreams too much 

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:40.059
 of time 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:45.179
 then it is very likely that 

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:45.179
 really you can grow teeth 

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:50.280
 if you yourself cannot determine 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:54.360
 Look for your old process 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:57.819
 videos in the u-tuba Kashpirovsky 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:01.529
 who as many of his 

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:04.210
 watched sage all managed to grow 

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:04.979
 many teeth restore teeth which 

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.629
 absent 

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:11.249
 add it well and after that write to 

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:14.550
 comments how did you get 

00:08:11.249 --> 00:08:14.550
 work on yourself
