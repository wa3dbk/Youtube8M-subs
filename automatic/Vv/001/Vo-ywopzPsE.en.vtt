get back into it again and this time

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
get back into it again and this time
going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.629> for<00:00:42.840> an<00:00:42.899> end<00:00:43.200> scale<00:00:43.500> layout<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.340 
going to go for an end scale layout and
so<00:00:44.250> forth<00:00:44.579> some<00:00:44.760> little<00:00:45.719> bits<00:00:45.840> events<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so forth some little bits events go to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.529 
so forth some little bits events go to
your<00:00:46.559> equipment<00:00:47.239> well<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.390> I'm<00:00:48.510> really

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
your equipment well what I'm really

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.360 
your equipment well what I'm really
gonna<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:49.050> now<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:50.360> obviously<00:00:51.360> blazing<00:00:51.809> track

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
gonna do now is obviously blazing track

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.630 
gonna do now is obviously blazing track
well<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.930> plan<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.440> they're<00:00:55.680> gonna<00:00:55.829> set<00:00:56.520> up

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
well the plan is they're gonna set up

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.799 
well the plan is they're gonna set up
some<00:00:56.670> block<00:00:57.059> detection<00:00:58.129> some<00:00:59.129> signals<00:00:59.809> have

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
some block detection some signals have

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.229 
some block detection some signals have
it<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.020> connected<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> computer<00:01:02.090> get<00:01:03.090> some

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it all connected to a computer get some

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
it all connected to a computer get some
training<00:01:03.480> automation<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:04.830> what

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
training automation going and see what

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.820 
training automation going and see what
I'm<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.060> do<00:01:09.470> alright<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.680> I've

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
I'm see what we can do alright so I've

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.280 
I'm see what we can do alright so I've
decided<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.340> go<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> DD<00:01:12.119> track<00:01:12.390> system

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
decided to go at the DD track system

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
decided to go at the DD track system
this<00:01:14.040> time<00:01:14.280> around<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:15.030> think<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
this time around I think this is a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.070 
this time around I think this is a
better<00:01:16.500> product<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.610> whole<00:01:18.080> train

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
better product to do the whole train

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.170 
better product to do the whole train
detection<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.860> signaling<00:01:20.790> stuff<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.119> they

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
detection and signaling stuff and they

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.300 
detection and signaling stuff and they
have<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.330> good<00:01:21.509> package<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> I've<00:01:23.070> gone<00:01:23.250> ahead

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
have a good package so I've gone ahead

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.429 
have a good package so I've gone ahead
and<00:01:23.549> start<00:01:23.880> by<00:01:24.330> buying<00:01:24.750> some<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> stuff<00:01:25.320> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
and start by buying some of the stuff I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.690 
and start by buying some of the stuff I
still<00:01:25.619> need<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> buy<00:01:26.040> some<00:01:26.280> more<00:01:26.310> buy<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
still need to buy some more buy the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.020 
still need to buy some more buy the
detection<00:01:27.090> board<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.049> signaling<00:01:28.619> board

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
detection board and the signaling board

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.899 
detection board and the signaling board
I've<00:01:30.030> got<00:01:30.150> enough<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:31.340> get<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> started

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
I've got enough here to get it started

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.819 
I've got enough here to get it started
and<00:01:32.970> keep<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.140> about<00:01:34.409> six

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
and keep it going so that about six

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.069 
and keep it going so that about six
switches<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.119> laughs<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.600> got<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> six

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
switches on this laughs I got the six

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.340 
switches on this laughs I got the six
pack<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.439> tortoise<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:40.049> know<00:01:40.140> we'll<00:01:40.229> be

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
pack of tortoise and you know we'll be

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.800 
pack of tortoise and you know we'll be
whirring<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:40.950> I've<00:01:41.220> gone<00:01:41.430> ahead<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.810> drawn

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
whirring it up I've gone ahead and drawn

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.399 
whirring it up I've gone ahead and drawn
up<00:01:42.930> some<00:01:43.079> plans<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.399> very<00:01:44.579> simple<00:01:44.939> layout

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
up some plans it's a very simple layout

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.350 
up some plans it's a very simple layout
it's<00:01:46.409> allowing<00:01:46.950> for<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.610> logos<00:01:48.000> actually

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it's allowing for the the logos actually

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
it's allowing for the the logos actually
cross<00:01:48.630> paths<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.350> hopefully<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
cross paths and hopefully in the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.999 
cross paths and hopefully in the
detection<00:01:50.280> will<00:01:50.869> work<00:01:51.869> well<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.290> stop<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> loco

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
detection will work well and stop a loco

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.789 
detection will work well and stop a loco
and<00:01:53.040> not<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.399> any<00:01:53.549> crashes<00:01:54.140> but<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
and not have any crashes but this is a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.499 
and not have any crashes but this is a
couple<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.159> wiring<00:01:56.369> diagrams<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.390> is

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
couple of wiring diagrams that this is

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.630 
couple of wiring diagrams that this is
just<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.869> them<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.310> if<00:01:59.310> I'm<00:01:59.520> actually

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
just one of them and if I'm actually

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.359 
just one of them and if I'm actually
gonna<00:01:59.880> attempt<00:02:00.450> whirring<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.369> even

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
gonna attempt whirring it all up even

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.740 
gonna attempt whirring it all up even
though<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> very<00:02:02.820> small<00:02:03.210> layout<00:02:03.479> this

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
though it is a very small layout this

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.240 
though it is a very small layout this
there's<00:02:04.200> still<00:02:04.290> gonna<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.590> quite<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> little

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
there's still gonna be quite a little

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.190 
there's still gonna be quite a little
bit<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.549> wiring<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.869> that's<00:02:07.049> pretty

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
bit of wiring in this so that's pretty

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.839 
bit of wiring in this so that's pretty
much<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.399> doing<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.759> this

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
much what I'm going to be doing on this

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.080 
much what I'm going to be doing on this
video<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.539> doing<00:02:09.750> videos<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:11.090> you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
video is I'm not doing videos on you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.460 
video is I'm not doing videos on you
know<00:02:12.209> track-laying<00:02:12.540> or<00:02:13.050> anyway

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
know track-laying or anyway

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
know track-laying or anyway
this<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.710> just<00:02:13.890> gonna<00:02:14.040> be<00:02:14.130> about<00:02:14.460> how<00:02:15.300> I'm

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
this is just gonna be about how I'm

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.350 
this is just gonna be about how I'm
gonna<00:02:15.540> wire<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:16.080> up<00:02:16.140> for<00:02:17.070> detection<00:02:17.940> and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
gonna wire this up for detection and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.140 
gonna wire this up for detection and
signaling<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.910> interfacing<00:02:20.910> with<00:02:20.940> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
signaling and interfacing with the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.140 
signaling and interfacing with the
computer<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:25.620> here's<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.920> little<00:02:26.610> close<00:02:26.910> look

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
computer so here's a little close look

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.240 
computer so here's a little close look
at<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.990> locator<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.530> bought<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.040> in

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
at the the locator that I bought it's in

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.870 
at the the locator that I bought it's in
scale<00:02:29.670> from<00:02:29.940> Cato<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.080> AC<00:02:31.610> 4400<00:02:32.610> this

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
scale from Cato it's the AC 4400 this

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.000 
scale from Cato it's the AC 4400 this
one<00:02:33.090> came<00:02:33.300> with<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.920> factory<00:02:34.920> installed

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
one came with a factory installed

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.780 
one came with a factory installed
decoder<00:02:35.610> has<00:02:35.850> no<00:02:36.090> sound<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:37.490> it's<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.610> nice

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
decoder has no sound and it's a nice

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.450 
decoder has no sound and it's a nice
logo<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:40.200> certainly<00:02:40.830> doesn't<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.220> same

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
logo it certainly doesn't have the same

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.060 
logo it certainly doesn't have the same
sort<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.670> level<00:02:41.730> details<00:02:42.360> hecho<00:02:42.960> but<00:02:43.290> what<00:02:43.950> can

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
sort of level details hecho but what can

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.260 
sort of level details hecho but what can
you<00:02:44.160> do<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.460> such<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.610> small<00:02:44.910> scale<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:48.060> if<00:02:48.150> we

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
you do it's such a small scale so if we

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.580 
you do it's such a small scale so if we
look<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.420> lot<00:02:48.630> closer<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.110> can<00:02:49.170> see<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.530> it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
look a lot closer you can see that it

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.490 
look a lot closer you can see that it
does<00:02:49.740> have<00:02:49.920> actually<00:02:50.220> have<00:02:50.340> ditch<00:02:50.640> lights<00:02:51.500> it

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
does have actually have ditch lights it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.230 
does have actually have ditch lights it
also<00:02:52.860> has<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.310> front<00:02:53.580> headlight<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.120> the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
also has the front headlight and the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.000 
also has the front headlight and the
number<00:02:54.570> board<00:02:54.780> lights<00:02:55.020> actually<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> lot<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.920> as

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
number board lights actually a lot of as

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.760 
number board lights actually a lot of as
well<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.520> they're<00:02:57.420> all<00:02:57.570> on<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.840> same<00:02:58.080> LED

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
well but it they're all on the same LED

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.240 
well but it they're all on the same LED
so<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.130> can't<00:02:59.610> control<00:02:59.910> them<00:03:00.120> separately<00:03:00.720> so

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
so you can't control them separately so

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.330 
so you can't control them separately so
that's<00:03:02.250> not<00:03:02.430> big<00:03:02.670> it's<00:03:03.120> not<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.390> bad<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.600> guess

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
that's not big it's not that bad I guess

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.710 
that's not big it's not that bad I guess
but<00:03:05.340> apart<00:03:05.610> from<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.820> it's<00:03:06.060> very<00:03:06.270> nice<00:03:06.480> logo

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
but apart from that it's very nice logo

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.060 
but apart from that it's very nice logo
alright<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:09.900> I've<00:03:10.020> got<00:03:10.050> another<00:03:10.440> one<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.950> these

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
alright so I've got another one of these

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.640 
alright so I've got another one of these
big<00:03:11.520> locos<00:03:12.150> on<00:03:12.420> order<00:03:12.660> exactly<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> same<00:03:13.470> as

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
big locos on order exactly the same as

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.030 
big locos on order exactly the same as
this<00:03:13.800> one<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.370> I'll<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.180> buying<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.870> digi<00:03:16.770> track

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
this one but I'll be buying a digi track

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.270 
this one but I'll be buying a digi track
sound<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> coder<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.150> installing<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.080> and

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
sound the coder and installing it and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.460 
sound the coder and installing it and
seeing<00:03:20.280> how<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.489> works<00:03:20.880> out<00:03:24.350> alright<00:03:25.350> so

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
seeing how that works out alright so

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.380 
seeing how that works out alright so
that<00:03:25.590> pretty<00:03:25.830> much<00:03:25.920> wraps<00:03:26.070> up<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.700> video<00:03:26.880> and

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
that pretty much wraps up this video and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.940 
that pretty much wraps up this video and
so<00:03:27.720> I'm<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:27.870> gonna<00:03:27.959> play<00:03:28.170> ahead<00:03:28.560> now<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
so I'm just gonna play ahead now and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.920 
so I'm just gonna play ahead now and
start<00:03:29.160> laying<00:03:29.400> some<00:03:29.519> track<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.720> whenever

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
start laying some track so whenever

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.170 
start laying some track so whenever
there's<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.430> point<00:03:32.430> where<00:03:32.580> I'm<00:03:32.670> doing<00:03:33.000> some

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
there's a point where I'm doing some

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.870 
there's a point where I'm doing some
wiring<00:03:33.420> I'll<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:33.870> posting<00:03:34.620> more<00:03:34.980> views<00:03:35.340> as<00:03:35.640> you
