worries<00:03:50.780> me<00:03:50.810> is<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:52.220> believe<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:53.120> don't

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
worries me is that I believe I don't

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.870 
worries me is that I believe I don't
know<00:03:53.420> if<00:03:53.510> it's<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.870> myth<00:03:54.320> but<00:03:54.620> DDT<00:03:55.280> is<00:03:55.520> still

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
know if it's a myth but DDT is still

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.030 
know if it's a myth but DDT is still
legal<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.450> Thailand<00:03:56.990> so<00:03:57.380> that<00:03:57.560> leads<00:03:57.740> me<00:03:57.860> to

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
legal in Thailand so that leads me to

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.850 
legal in Thailand so that leads me to
believe<00:03:58.070> that<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:58.940> this<00:03:59.120> is<00:03:59.270> not<00:03:59.420> DDT<00:04:00.080> then<00:04:00.710> it

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
believe that is this is not DDT then it

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.800 
believe that is this is not DDT then it
could<00:04:01.010> very<00:04:01.220> well<00:04:01.310> be<00:04:01.640> something<00:04:02.060> harmful<00:04:02.390> for
