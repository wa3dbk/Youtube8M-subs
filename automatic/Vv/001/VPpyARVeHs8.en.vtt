00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.599
 views 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.730
 hello to all viewers and the future 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:36.210
 Subscribers today we have another 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:41.210
 handle braid handle will apply to 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.420
 ze double crossroads 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.540
 that is, we have already considered single 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:54.470
 cross and this will be a double cross or 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:58.440
 take overlining as usual 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:05.210
 piece of paracord fold it in two 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.659
 and fasten our handle so 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.530
 fasten 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.530
 you do 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.060
 full turn 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.760
 here 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 It turns out such a picture 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.030
 we turn over and again we do full 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.030
 turn 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.830
 make sure that the overlap was 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.480
 in the middle 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.480
 in the middle of the handle the number of hostages 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.470
 mind and right 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.830
 it turns out 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.830
 screaming 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.140
 we turn 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.140
 and again make a full turn 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:33.189
 day make sure that turns 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.189
 we ran excesses in the middle 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.400
 doing again 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.230
 speak 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.450
 corrected by the middle 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.230
 if necessary, lose some with 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.230
 you 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.690
 why is it called double overlap 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.930
 because if there we were doing just here 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:29.790
 so they went to the other side 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:31.390
 here we do a full turn like this 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.930
 way 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.930
 full set 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:47.990
 the result is this 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.990
 beautiful weave handles 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.340
 cover 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.620
 matan the whole thing is fixable 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.920
 fixable 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.920
 dresses them 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.470
 sideways 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.330
 little ray 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.970
 again 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.710
 politeness 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:37.719
 that is, in fact, with this method 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.249
 braid it turns out that it turns out that with 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:42.549
 which side 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:46.829
 strand comes in the same direction on leaves 

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:50.799
 that is, here we take the strands and do 

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:55.299
 a turn here came this series and here 

00:05:50.799 --> 00:06:00.749
 came out it will come here came turned and 

00:05:55.299 --> 00:06:00.749
 here and went to the same side 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:06.129
 we turn over and in the same way it is strands 

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:10.049
 gone from there 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.049
 and it went here 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:20.440
 the result is weaving 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:23.440
 it is necessary to fix it so that it does not 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.440
 crawled away 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:36.000
 here we get such a policy 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:41.800
 about it turns out the volume is smooth here 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:47.240
 the poet's surface here he has a good 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:52.849
 enough that is not slip 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:54.470
 and decorate in the tool itself and 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:58.569
 decorate and make it more comfortable 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:01.699
 because it's time the port doesn't get wet and even 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:05.509
 if there is a sweaty hand that tool is not 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:07.160
 will slip out of your hands because 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:10.940
 slipping tool always 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:16.880
 is dangerous in this case 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.660
 it makes the tool safe today 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.830
 we studied 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:24.919
 another kind of pill tool 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:28.340
 tool handles i think someone he 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:31.039
 makes it seem useful 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.020
 shows quite slowly and 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:36.199
 is full enough that is if someone 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.470
 something incomprehensible or questions arise 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:43.130
 please contact lichku on channel 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:47.259
 I always give us all just answering 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.259
 bye everyone for now
