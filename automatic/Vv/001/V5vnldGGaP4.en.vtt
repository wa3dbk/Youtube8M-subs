00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
it's hard to be that close but you know

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.740 
it's hard to be that close but you know
really<00:02:02.140> I'm<00:02:02.409> debt<00:02:02.680> for<00:02:02.950> off<00:02:03.159> so<00:02:03.640> i<00:02:03.970> think<00:02:04.510> i

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
really I'm debt for off so i think i

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.950 
really I'm debt for off so i think i
might<00:02:04.930> have<00:02:05.580> shot<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.640> little<00:02:06.820> from<00:02:07.810> my

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
might have shot a little from my

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.540 
might have shot a little from my
expectations<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.649> little<00:02:08.679> bit<00:02:08.890> too<00:02:09.039> often

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
expectations a little bit too often

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.230 
expectations a little bit too often

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
not really happy with this say it's

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.350 
not really happy with this say it's
always<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> little<00:02:21.160> disappointment<00:02:21.970> whatever

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
you're that close but for all of us it

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.800 
you're that close but for all of us it
was<00:02:25.270> an<00:02:25.480> awesome<00:02:25.630> race<00:02:26.550> for<00:02:27.550> us<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.060> him<00:02:28.300> but<00:02:28.780> I

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
was an awesome race for us and him but I

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.050 
was an awesome race for us and him but I
know<00:02:29.170> it's<00:02:29.500> frustrating<00:02:30.190> when<00:02:30.640> your<00:02:30.850> back<00:02:31.030> was

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.710 
know it's frustrating when your back was
and<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.959> want<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.260> win<00:02:32.440> or<00:02:32.680> water<00:02:33.459> or<00:02:33.720> talkity

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
you know really it's my best move like

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.170 
you know really it's my best move like
grace<00:02:36.700> because<00:02:37.000> I've<00:02:37.420> never<00:02:39.000> ran<00:02:40.000> with<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
grace because I've never ran with the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.140 
grace because I've never ran with the
front<00:02:40.480> group<00:02:40.720> before<00:02:40.870> so<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:42.730> was<00:02:42.760> nice<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
front group before so that was nice and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.210 
front group before so that was nice and
I<00:02:43.360> get<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.690> not<00:02:44.170> race<00:02:44.440> with<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.709> guys<00:02:44.890> but<00:02:45.160> I

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
I get to not race with the guys but I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.890 
I get to not race with the guys but I
kind<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.459> got<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.700> see<00:02:45.910> how<00:02:46.120> few<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.420> them<00:02:46.630> race

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
kind of got to see how few of them race

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.690 
kind of got to see how few of them race
so<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.950> know<00:02:48.040> if<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.250> ever<00:02:48.400> had<00:02:48.580> that

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
so you know if I ever had that

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.960 
so you know if I ever had that
opportunity<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.510> race<00:02:49.690> with<00:02:49.810> them<00:02:49.989> again<00:02:50.970> you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
opportunity to race with them again you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.280 
opportunity to race with them again you
know<00:02:52.120> I'll<00:02:52.360> kind<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.690> know<00:02:52.780> how<00:02:52.930> their<00:02:53.080> grace

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
know I'll kind of know how their grace

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.920 
know I'll kind of know how their grace
also<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:55.180> gives<00:02:55.330> me<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> little<00:02:55.690> bit<00:02:55.810> of

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
also it gives me a little bit of

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.280 
also it gives me a little bit of
confidence<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.500> because<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.130> know<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.140> can

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
confidence to because I know that I can

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.440 
confidence to because I know that I can
run<00:02:59.620> with<00:02:59.799> those<00:02:59.950> guys<00:03:04.769> it's<00:03:05.769> weird<00:03:06.070> because

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
run with those guys it's weird because

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.850 
run with those guys it's weird because
I'm<00:03:07.450> having<00:03:07.630> these<00:03:07.810> furnance<00:03:08.290> lies<00:03:08.560> going

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
I'm having these furnance lies going

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.030 
I'm having these furnance lies going
through<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.100> chicane<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.750> don't<00:03:10.989> know<00:03:11.170> why

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
through the chicane and I don't know why

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.069 
through the chicane and I don't know why
because<00:03:12.340> I've<00:03:12.670> never<00:03:13.060> had<00:03:13.480> them<00:03:13.570> before<00:03:13.630> to

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
because I've never had them before to

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.740 
because I've never had them before to
the<00:03:14.200> race<00:03:14.380> started<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.000> don't<00:03:16.209> know<00:03:16.390> if<00:03:16.630> it

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
the race started so I don't know if it

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.830 
the race started so I don't know if it
was<00:03:16.840> tired<00:03:17.140> Mike<00:03:17.680> set<00:03:18.040> up<00:03:18.250> or<00:03:18.640> what<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:19.180> mean<00:03:19.780> I

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840

bikes<00:03:55.030> down<00:03:55.299> more<00:03:55.630> than<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.780> stroke<00:03:56.109> or<00:03:56.440> maybe

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
bikes down more than a stroke or maybe

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.009 
bikes down more than a stroke or maybe
we<00:03:56.920> need<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.120> there's<00:03:58.120> only<00:03:58.209> two<00:03:58.510> tires<00:03:58.780> to

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
we need to there's only two tires to

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.490 
we need to there's only two tires to
choose<00:03:59.260> from<00:03:59.500> so<00:04:00.489> maybe<00:04:00.670> we<00:04:00.910> need<00:04:01.120> to

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
choose from so maybe we need to

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.870 
choose from so maybe we need to
a different<00:04:01.950> tire<00:04:02.130> compound<00:04:02.760> but<00:04:04.730> you<00:04:05.730> know

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
a different tire compound but you know

a different tire compound but you know
we<00:04:06.060> have<00:04:06.210> to<00:04:06.240> we<00:04:06.510> have<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.660> figure<00:04:06.900> out

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
we have to we have to figure out

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.190 
we have to we have to figure out
something<00:04:07.140> because<00:04:07.800> me<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.130> Ben<00:04:08.430> both<00:04:08.730> are

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
something because me and Ben both are

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.750 
something because me and Ben both are
fighting<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.290> same<00:04:10.500> thing<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.430> know<00:04:11.580> we

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
both use a different front tires so we

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.930 
both use a different front tires so we
just<00:04:14.970> had<00:04:15.210> to<00:04:15.950> spend<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:17.010> long<00:04:17.160> time<00:04:17.190> looking<00:04:17.850> at

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
just had to spend a long time looking at

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.160 
just had to spend a long time looking at
the<00:04:18.030> computer<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.630> try<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.840> figure<00:04:19.049> something

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
the computer and try to figure something

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.069 
the computer and try to figure something
out<00:04:19.880> ok<00:04:20.880> we<00:04:21.090> made<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.269> few<00:04:21.480> changes<00:04:21.540> this

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
out ok we made a few changes this

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.780 
out ok we made a few changes this
morning<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.620> practice<00:04:23.100> these<00:04:23.310> having<00:04:23.700> a

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
morning to practice these having a

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.830 
morning to practice these having a
little<00:04:24.140> issue<00:04:25.140> with<00:04:26.390> their<00:04:27.390> parts<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:27.750> the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
little issue with their parts of the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.930 
little issue with their parts of the
track<00:04:28.080> well<00:04:28.440> yesterday<00:04:28.710> during<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.340> ring<00:04:29.520> but

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
I think we got it sorted out it will be

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.530 
I think we got it sorted out it will be
good<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.370> go<00:04:32.610> for<00:04:32.670> the<00:04:32.940> right<00:04:33.150> here<00:04:33.390> in<00:04:33.480> a

concept so once you know the team breaks

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.770 
concept so once you know the team breaks
it<00:04:53.160> all<00:04:53.310> down<00:04:53.340> they<00:04:53.790> realize<00:04:54.120> it's<00:04:54.360> usually

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
it all down they realize it's usually

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.950 
it all down they realize it's usually
it's<00:04:55.290> usually<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.710> same<00:04:56.040> thing<00:04:56.370> so<00:04:56.850> which<00:04:57.810> is

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
it's usually the same thing so which is

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.270 
it's usually the same thing so which is
nice<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.410> team<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.770> know<00:04:58.890> we<00:04:59.010> don't<00:04:59.100> have
