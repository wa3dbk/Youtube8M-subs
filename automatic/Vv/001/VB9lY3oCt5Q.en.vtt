happens<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.670> once<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.940> Sun<00:02:57.270> Goes<00:02:57.450> Down<00:02:57.510> we're

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
happens is once the Sun Goes Down we're

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.930 
happens is once the Sun Goes Down we're
supposed<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.830> start<00:02:59.070> secreting<00:02:59.610> melatonin

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
supposed to start secreting melatonin

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.570 
supposed to start secreting melatonin
one<00:03:00.510> or<00:03:00.630> two<00:03:00.750> hours<00:03:01.050> after<00:03:01.470> but<00:03:02.010> these<00:03:02.220> lights

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
one or two hours after but these lights

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.930 
one or two hours after but these lights
mimic<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:04.260> Sun<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.250> our<00:03:05.340> eyes<00:03:05.580> do<00:03:05.910> not

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
mimic the Sun and our eyes do not

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.300 
mimic the Sun and our eyes do not
discriminate<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.320> they<00:03:07.470> still<00:03:07.860> think<00:03:08.100> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
discriminate so they still think the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.220 
discriminate so they still think the
sun's<00:03:08.580> out<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.390> they<00:03:09.510> don't<00:03:09.540> start<00:03:10.050> producing

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
sun's out so they don't start producing

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.160 
sun's out so they don't start producing
the<00:03:10.920> melatonin<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:12.090> they<00:03:12.210> should<00:03:12.450> until<00:03:12.960> you

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
the melatonin that they should until you

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.380 
the melatonin that they should until you

go to bed you start producing melatonin

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.720 
go to bed you start producing melatonin
by<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.110> time<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.680> wait<00:03:22.920> late<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.580> you

your liver try to put it in my liver I

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.220 
your liver try to put it in my liver I
think<00:03:29.190> it's<00:03:29.310> there<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:29.850> then<00:03:30.720> by<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.020> time

you uh you're all groggy if you keep the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.400 
you uh you're all groggy if you keep the
melatonin<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.850> too<00:03:36.060> long<00:03:36.330> or<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:37.110> builds

the cycle you're gonna feel groggy and
you're<00:03:41.790> gonna<00:03:41.910> have<00:03:42.030> less<00:03:42.209> energy<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.870> that

long<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.239> cycle<00:03:45.570> think<00:03:45.750> about<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:46.019> what<00:03:46.200> if

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
long of a cycle think about this what if

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.009 
long of a cycle think about this what if
you<00:03:46.380> had<00:03:46.530> two<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:48.030> four<00:03:48.269> more<00:03:48.450> hours<00:03:48.660> of

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
you had two to four more hours of

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.250 
you had two to four more hours of
melatonin<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:50.130> your<00:03:50.250> system<00:03:50.700> for<00:03:50.880> ten<00:03:51.840> years

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
melatonin in your system for ten years

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.800 
melatonin in your system for ten years
you<00:03:52.530> know<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.800> has<00:03:53.030> exponential<00:03:54.030> huge

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
you know that has exponential huge

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.290 
you know that has exponential huge
benefits<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.920> energy<00:03:56.550> weight<00:03:57.030> loss

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
benefits and energy weight loss

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.090 
benefits and energy weight loss
seriously<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.930> will<00:03:58.050> lose<00:03:58.320> fat<00:03:58.680> it's

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
seriously you will lose fat it's

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.220 
seriously you will lose fat it's
scientific<00:03:59.910> studies<00:04:00.239> have<00:04:00.269> shown<00:04:00.600> that<00:04:00.630> you

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
scientific studies have shown that you

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.050 
scientific studies have shown that you
have<00:04:01.380> brown<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.680> white<00:04:02.100> fat<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.790> believe

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
have brown and white fat and I believe

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.900 
have brown and white fat and I believe
it's<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.420> white<00:04:03.630> fat<00:04:04.160> starts<00:04:05.160> when<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.580> sleep

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
it's the white fat starts when you sleep

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.430 
it's the white fat starts when you sleep
and<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.269> have<00:04:06.360> enough<00:04:06.570> melatonin<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.350> it

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
and you have enough melatonin and it

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.350 
and you have enough melatonin and it
actually<00:04:07.739> starts<00:04:07.980> getting<00:04:08.910> rid<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.180> on

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
actually starts getting rid of you on

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.610 
actually starts getting rid of you on
your<00:04:09.540> body<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.930> know<00:04:10.050> it<00:04:10.170> starts<00:04:10.410> getting

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
your body you know it starts getting

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.990 
your body you know it starts getting
converted<00:04:10.890> into<00:04:11.220> muscle<00:04:11.640> or<00:04:11.730> whatever

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
converted into muscle or whatever

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.360 
converted into muscle or whatever
something<00:04:12.480> happens<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:13.050> goes<00:04:13.170> away<00:04:13.440> so

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
something happens and it goes away so

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.699 
something happens and it goes away so
melatonin<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.330> huge<00:04:15.720> there's<00:04:15.959> ten<00:04:16.230> thousand

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
melatonin is huge there's ten thousand

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.830 
melatonin is huge there's ten thousand
eight<00:04:16.890> hundred<00:04:17.370> different<00:04:18.209> articles<00:04:18.630> written

eight hundred different articles written
on<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.590> importance<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.549> having<00:04:20.789> more

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
on the importance of having more

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.670 
on the importance of having more
melatonin<00:04:21.390> so<00:04:21.840> what

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
melatonin so what

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.590 
melatonin so what
there<00:04:22.830> was<00:04:23.009> a<00:04:23.039> way<00:04:23.250> these<00:04:23.789> glasses<00:04:24.150> that<00:04:24.389> you

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
could just have more melatonin every

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.800 
could just have more melatonin every
single<00:04:26.669> night<00:04:26.880> day<00:04:27.840> when<00:04:28.289> you<00:04:28.440> go<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.740> sleep
