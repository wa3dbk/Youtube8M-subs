large<00:00:13.050> piece<00:00:13.470> of<00:00:13.500> drawing<00:00:13.920> paper<00:00:14.220> that<00:00:15.120> I

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
large piece of drawing paper that I

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.689 
large piece of drawing paper that I
first<00:00:15.510> divided<00:00:15.960> into<00:00:16.260> six<00:00:16.529> inch<00:00:16.769> squares<00:00:17.220> like

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
first divided into six inch squares like

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.269 
first divided into six inch squares like
the<00:00:17.880> quilt<00:00:18.090> blocks<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.749> then<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.499> further

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the quilt blocks and then I further

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.429 
the quilt blocks and then I further
segmented<00:00:20.579> them<00:00:21.179> into<00:00:21.599> three<00:00:21.900> inch<00:00:22.050> squares

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
segmented them into three inch squares

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.380 
segmented them into three inch squares
with<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> center<00:00:23.220> dot<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.999> like<00:00:24.210> we

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
with the center dot just like we

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.259 
with the center dot just like we
prepared<00:00:24.749> the<00:00:24.900> quilt<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:26.099> practicing<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
prepared the quilt so practicing on the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.419 
prepared the quilt so practicing on the
real<00:00:27.419> size<00:00:27.720> here<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:29.009> to<00:00:29.069> be<00:00:29.159> the<00:00:29.279> best

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
real size here is going to be the best

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.330 
real size here is going to be the best
way<00:00:29.579> to<00:00:29.730> get<00:00:29.999> the<00:00:30.089> feel<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:30.329> this<00:00:30.659> pattern<00:00:31.340> you

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
way to get the feel for this pattern you

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.520 
way to get the feel for this pattern you
can<00:00:32.489> see<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> already<00:00:32.730> started<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.720> and<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.350> was

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
can see I already started here and I was

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.550 
can see I already started here and I was
quilting<00:00:35.330> our<00:00:36.330> practice<00:00:36.780> drawing<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.320> this

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
quilting our practice drawing in this

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.980 
quilting our practice drawing in this
direction<00:00:37.970> which<00:00:38.970> would<00:00:39.150> have<00:00:39.270> me<00:00:39.450> moving<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:39.990 
direction which would have me moving the

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.590 
direction which would have me moving the
quilt<00:00:40.200> away<00:00:40.560> from<00:00:40.860> me<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.420> same

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
quilt away from me as I so the same

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.390 
quilt away from me as I so the same
direction<00:00:42.810> that<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.290> normally<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.220> that

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
direction that we normally so so that

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.580 
direction that we normally so so that
feels<00:00:44.610> most<00:00:44.820> natural<00:00:45.240> to<00:00:45.390> me<00:00:45.540> you<00:00:46.140> could<00:00:46.350> start

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
feels most natural to me you could start

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.860 
feels most natural to me you could start
from<00:00:46.740> this<00:00:46.890> side<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.660> going

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
from this side and go up if that's going

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.590 
from this side and go up if that's going
to<00:00:48.960> feel<00:00:49.080> better<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.000> here<00:00:51.210> starting

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to feel better to you so here starting

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.210 
to feel better to you so here starting
at<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.720> top<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.200> has<00:00:52.230> come<00:00:52.470> down<00:00:52.650> to<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.980> first

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
at the top it has come down to the first

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.030 
at the top it has come down to the first
dot<00:00:53.540> and<00:00:54.540> then<00:00:54.630> I<00:00:54.720> start<00:00:54.960> arching<00:00:55.380> away<00:00:55.620> and

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
dot and then I start arching away and

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:06.470 
dot and then I start arching away and
drawing<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.150> pedals<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> pen<00:01:06.270> where

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
drawing the pedals so with the pen where

drawing the pedals so with the pen where
you<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.750> lots<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.110> control<00:01:07.640> it's<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
you have lots of control it's the

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.340 
you have lots of control it's the
perfect<00:01:08.760> opportunity<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.690> get<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> feel<00:01:10.140> for

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
perfect opportunity to get a feel for

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.670 
perfect opportunity to get a feel for
how<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.300> drawing<00:01:12.300> motion<00:01:12.690> feels<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.260> always

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
how the drawing motion feels I always

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.280 
how the drawing motion feels I always
stop<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.250> each<00:01:14.520> dot<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> research<00:01:15.930> put<00:01:16.140> my

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
stop at each dot and research put my

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.590 
stop at each dot and research put my
hands<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> quilt<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.610> prepare<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> go

right and when you're drawing not only

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
right and when you're drawing not only
is<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> repetition<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.830> helpful

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
is the repetition going to be helpful

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.130 
is the repetition going to be helpful
for<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> machine<00:01:39.510> but<00:01:40.049> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
for when you go to the machine but you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
for when you go to the machine but you
can<00:01:40.260> also<00:01:40.380> try<00:01:40.620> out<00:01:40.770> different<00:01:40.890> things<00:01:41.100> like

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
can also try out different things like

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.520 
can also try out different things like
maybe<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.049> more<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.440> an

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
maybe you want to do more of an

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.770 
maybe you want to do more of an
elongated<00:01:44.100> pedal<00:01:48.530> or<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> fat

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
elongated pedal or you can do a fat

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.330 
elongated pedal or you can do a fat
pedal<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:51.960> my<00:01:52.170> first<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.650> but<00:01:52.920> make<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
pedal like my first one but make the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.840 
pedal like my first one but make the
edges<00:01:53.670> dull<00:01:54.540> instead<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.290> pointed<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.580> lot

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
edges dull instead of pointed so a lot

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.219 
edges dull instead of pointed so a lot
of<00:01:56.880> repetition<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.110> your

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
of repetition is going to be in your
