00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.790 

all<00:02:38.330> right<00:02:38.480> guys<00:02:38.630> here's<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.050> second<00:02:39.530> one<00:02:39.560> we

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
all right guys here's the second one we

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.400 
all right guys here's the second one we
saw<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:41.300> one's<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.600> little<00:02:41.750> more<00:02:41.989> aggressive

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
saw this one's a little more aggressive

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.660 
saw this one's a little more aggressive
as<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.650> see<00:02:42.860> like<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.130> can't<00:02:43.340> really<00:02:43.489> touch

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
as you see like you can't really touch

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.560 
as you see like you can't really touch
it<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.120> without<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.480> being<00:02:44.660> feisty<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:46.220> uh

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
it and without it being feisty but uh

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.790 
it and without it being feisty but uh
the<00:02:47.570> reason<00:02:47.840> why<00:02:47.900> they're<00:02:48.080> called<00:02:48.110> ko<00:02:48.500> chips

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
the reason why they're called ko chips

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.130 
the reason why they're called ko chips
is<00:02:48.980> actually<00:02:49.310> because<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:50.209> tail<00:02:50.480> looks<00:02:50.989> like

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
is actually because the tail looks like

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.330 
is actually because the tail looks like
a<00:02:51.230> braided<00:02:51.530> whip<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:54.019> it's<00:02:54.709> because<00:02:55.100> the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
a braided whip and it's because the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.039 
a braided whip and it's because the
there's<00:02:55.610> like<00:02:55.730> black<00:02:55.970> borders<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.540> each<00:02:56.690> scale

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
there's like black borders on each scale

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.140 
there's like black borders on each scale
and<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.500> makes<00:02:57.709> gives<00:02:58.040> it<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.190> braided<00:02:58.549> look<00:02:58.730> and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
and it makes gives it a braided look and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.759 
and it makes gives it a braided look and
that's<00:02:59.600> what<00:02:59.780> this<00:02:59.870> thing<00:02:59.930> wishes<00:03:00.320> dudes<00:03:00.560> from
