 of the cover in the visuals of the games

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.590
 during a chat in

 active and at the last check point myself 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.450
 I spoke here along with exit that I think 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.250

 going down the wood in the game working 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.220
 It must be everything but now there's more 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.689

 to be just an illusion a wall and enter 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.500

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.630
 nohl channel rumor and cisco source 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.759

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.350

 fashion is now Gabriel is quiet crowd 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.740
 to think about the possibility of 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.290
 buy an accessory, right? 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.090
 a control before the machine itself 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.050
 device itself should be released and 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.120
 A lot of dope, right? 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.370
 but now we have news there about 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.780
 steam controller and also on the topic x 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.560
 it would be this madness that will give a funk 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.240
 good 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.460
 control that wants to revolutionize 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.950

 is already in pre-sale the starting price 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.230
 suggested is $ 50 out there and your 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.420
 format has been somewhat changed since its 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.060
 comes on the analog stick and 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.400
 buttons there are controls must be 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.870

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.530
 did well in the ad training of the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.960
 control 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.540

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.980
 Of course this meeting will work 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.600
 with any pc but if you want 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.820
 invest in the devices they want 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.680
 put a computer full on 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.670
 the closest format of your video game to the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.770

 these are committed to begin 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.460
 the delivery on November 10 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.800
 it is worth remembering that the list of machines 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.450
 is huge and prices are going from 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.110
 $ 449 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.800
 until then $ 4929 is very very large 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.410
 huh 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.230
 the bag that defines them all without 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.210
 date or price set in Brazil tá 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.190
 everything here in the video description and the 20 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.440
 take you there to the wonderful land of 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.360
 The games we saw and being 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.280
 several companies are playing games there 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.810
 a little before e3 to leave a 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.540
 more event to explain to show 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.940
 to the guys that they pick up where they left a 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.490
 point marked here you take the bus from 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.750
 game hype, there you will get to 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.850
 final destination that will be fast 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.370
 including grandson are doing it almost 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.710
 all with these companies betting on this 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.609
 approach but some are separating 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.519
 some surprises is not and Ubisoft 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.710
 the donor of prince of persia iran 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.379
 released a talking kit that is anxious 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.560
 by e3 with the hashtag prince by chan 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:30.569
 good is a rumor are nothing confirmed but 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.330
 it is still a message from 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.210
 someone directly linked to the franchise and 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.819
 Now we ask ourselves and Ubisoft is 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.710
 answer us are preparing a 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.000
 franchise reboot you need to see if it will 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.789
 come back is not finally wanting 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.379
 Brazil is crying out for it or 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.360
 Is it a remake of something like this? 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.189
 of the rdd itself 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.430
 the player lets himself understand that he is going 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:56.129
 roll something from the country the track on e3 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.860
 But what will that be? I said to people. 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.900
 time passes the time flies to enough 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.909
 music for today but the time is finally 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.029
 passing and more and more the generation 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.819
 past is more in the past, right? 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:11.219
 because it is the 360 ​​and ps3 are increasingly 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:13.139
 behind and the proof of this is the 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.479
 more recent proof is that the defense 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.300
 announced that speaker 4 will leave 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.389
 no way for the ps3 or xbox 360 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.819
 would be a detail the defense said no 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.099
 want to level the game underneath and 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.349
 intends to release a more 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.360
 Forward, how did it happen to me? 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.580
 workshop so who remember that you 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.099
 did four and xbox or before to realize 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.419
 well then it 's a redux version 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:42.150
 nene conversion ps3 and 360 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.129
 the company went further and said that 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.839
 game would never work in these 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.849
 old platforms 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:50.430
 now tell me you 're what you think 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.379
 This is good, this is bad, you think it is 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.379
 laziness of the company that really 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:57.300
 it makes sense to make the most of 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:59.339
 new consoles have to offer 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.169
