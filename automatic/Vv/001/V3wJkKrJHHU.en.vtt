00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.290
 here in my pan has a spoon of 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.559
 butter you can put the margarine 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.059
 also a box of condensed milk 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:18.460
 My people are already connected. 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.560
 each carton of condensed milk and 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.900
 put us sour cream will not stay 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.689
 very nauseous also created a texture 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.199
 Better to stay one more line is 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.630
 different from the common brigadeiro that I 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.030
 I have two spoons I'm 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.909
 putting the colleges of cocoa powder goes 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.250
 stay very strong mine you can put 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:41.350
 like cocoa one of the chocolates you do not 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.379
 I want very strong and here I have 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.379
 also a box of sour cream 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.900
 You have to take advantage of everything 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.879
 do not understand well this can be wasted 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.379
 anything 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.089
 now it's just messing about chocolate 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.390
 a kitchen in condensed milk 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.830
 I'm facing good night, I have milk. 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.020
 be ready for our brigadeiro 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.530
 Folks stuffed our our tube of pasta 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.530
 from claire 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.650
 always stirring so as not to stick it will stay 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.440
 more soft even because of milk 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.150
 milk or stir I'll show you to 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.850
 you 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.950
 he has the speck that this point 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.480
 our brigadeiro 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.540
 he has to stay a little softer than 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.240
 The normal thing is to start eating spoon, right? 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.680
 but it will not happen, it has to stay this way 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.110
 when they think it will get more 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.350
 firm make to move on average more or less 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.820
 We stopped in for five minutes opel 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.910
 off because it's already at the point you 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.360
 You'll leave it here, cool down, cool. 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.790
 even you put in the cones streets 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.280
 not clear will obviously melt 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.130
 show your other steps then 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.030
 I need to let my head and stuffing 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.030
 by industry this year
