00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.570
 with this video we want one 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.250
 Addendum to our first mountain report 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.470
 deliver video to the andys 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.570
 Although some have been in the meantime 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.520
 patchnotes of dice regarding the text 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.890
 released the most serious back 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.599
 namely the tv that is always 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.730
 still unprocessed and we also have that 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.650
 impression as if that until the present 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.830
 time not noted 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.870
 what kind of bugs so it is now the 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.129
 cell phones in battlefield 4 affect the 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.910
 we are not in our food video yet 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.640
 have mentioned 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.559
 First of all is to mention that one 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.379
 sometimes and that is more or less 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.659
 chance depending on risks or of 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.250
 hit by tv rockets arbitrarily 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.559
 is tilted to the side and then in 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.000
 it does not affect you 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.479
 more allows you to catch it 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.460
 one then inevitably supports 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.680
 especially annoying is the car sound 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.740
 look back where it sounds like 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.460
 ghana all the time 30 mm 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.720
 fire it though it is natural 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.280
 actually not good 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.320
 sometimes this bug is only possible 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.680
 This will fix the vehicle 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.000
 destroyed as in our first mountain 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.460
 report video already shown is the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.170
 person of tv now completely protect 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.750
 identical to the tv rocket as soon as you 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.609
 in the air is a very interesting 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.590
 feature or also back in this 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:32.210
 regard is that of the tv protect 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.640
 can actually die if he is with the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.979
 tv rocket mines or others 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.020
 explosives hits or more randomly 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.890
 Wise in a just supporting house 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.990
 shoot into it 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.729
 if the timing is reasonable 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.940
 hinbekommt then it is possible that one 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.470
 scott may protect on tv protect spawn 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.720
 For this he must be the time 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.909
 Watch out when the tva kÃ¤the just 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.580
 is shot down and then he falls 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.830
 out of it all of a sudden 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.810
 again, it allows one to 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.369
 game modes that actually no 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.500
 Infantry allowed on the ground like this 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.729
 superiore di we have a video about it 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.160
 made that link to this 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.020
 in the upper left corner 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.480
 ground to run around and with fingers 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.200
 or esra the opposing team duly 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.440
 to annoy 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.440
 the hit boxes of the zeppelin or the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.959
 central mountain in the first game mode of 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.340
 golden peaks are terribly made like 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.800
 you can see here are the edges of the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.170
 objects very roughly cut and the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.810
 bowl with the 30 mm remain on 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.730
 invisible walls hang the next 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.040
 the topic is the squad screen sheikh speak 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.930
 the wreck in the camera as soon as the 30 mm 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.790
 cannon is operated by Ghana 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.280
 there were in the last patches 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.230
 various change times there were at the 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.450
 further below , no screen sheikh 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.459
 but for the 10th 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.380
 There is also now 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.329
 screenshot of children because the men's bock 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.190
 I have not tested in part yet 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.049
 and the key point is that 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.700
 in the patchnotes this no 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.100
 message 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.170
 completely unacceptable and what to 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.030
 Time of appearance of this video 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.950
 for a behavior of 30 mm too 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.410
 We will have to watch each other 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.670
 Let's surprise you 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.410
 several times we have such 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.140
 ghosting said loosening 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.630
 that means that you can use laser 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.000
 designation like the pld or the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.829
 offline by apparently massive 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.079
 objects can be lured through 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.700
 that's how our example shows 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.660
 some of the skyscrapers on seed of 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.040
 Shanghai the fall 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.079
 I am sure her child for this 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.110
 further examples leave one behind 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.209
 comment on it on greenpeace has the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.790
 front mountain from view of the us side 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.340
 special feature if a helicopter 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.320
 comes from above and this comes on 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.570
 another helicopter behind the mountain 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.579
 heated celebrates then fly the 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.799
 kiezkicker through the works by and 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.270
 still hit target though as I said 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.920
 there is no visual connection 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.570
 We thank teams as always 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.790
 turn on link here 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.310
 first part of our bug reports series in 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.190
 We talk everywhere the teddies 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.820
 as well as to god wood classics the protect 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.820
