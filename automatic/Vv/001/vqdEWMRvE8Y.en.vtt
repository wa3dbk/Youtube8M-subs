00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
the actual I'm Peter but the pump is the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.470 
the actual I'm Peter but the pump is the
pump<00:00:24.470> is<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.740> little<00:00:25.550> pond<00:00:25.849> pump<00:00:26.150> I<00:00:26.240> got<00:00:26.390> off

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
pump is a little pond pump I got off

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.290 
pump is a little pond pump I got off
Amazon<00:00:26.720> for<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:27.890> want<00:00:28.550> to<00:00:28.609> say<00:00:28.699> like<00:00:28.820> seven<00:00:29.179> or

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
Amazon for I want to say like seven or

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.270 
Amazon for I want to say like seven or
eight<00:00:29.390> dollars<00:00:29.539> and<00:00:29.990> it<00:00:30.109> pumps<00:00:32.260> sixty<00:00:33.280> no

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
eight dollars and it pumps sixty no

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.960 
eight dollars and it pumps sixty no
eighty<00:00:34.580> gallons<00:00:34.850> per<00:00:35.270> hour<00:00:35.440> so<00:00:36.730> that<00:00:37.730> means

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
eighty gallons per hour so that means

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.000 
eighty gallons per hour so that means
you<00:00:38.420> know<00:00:38.510> basically<00:00:38.990> it<00:00:39.079> pumps<00:00:39.380> 80<00:00:39.590> gallons

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
you know basically it pumps 80 gallons

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.100 
you know basically it pumps 80 gallons
in<00:00:40.220> one<00:00:40.370> hour<00:00:40.520> but<00:00:40.850> that's<00:00:41.060> actually<00:00:41.480> counting

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
in one hour but that's actually counting

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.410 
in one hour but that's actually counting
as<00:00:42.260> water<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.190> it's<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:43.970> little<00:00:44.150> bit<00:00:44.270> of<00:00:44.360> a

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
as water so it's a little bit of a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.660 
as water so it's a little bit of a
different<00:00:44.720> number<00:00:44.990> it's<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.320> lot<00:00:45.500> less<00:00:45.800> main

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
different number it's a lot less main

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.130 
different number it's a lot less main
mineral<00:00:46.940> oil<00:00:47.150> since<00:00:47.360> its<00:00:47.510> oil<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:47.930> it's<00:00:48.020> a<00:00:48.050> lot

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
mineral oil since its oil and it's a lot

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.170 
mineral oil since its oil and it's a lot
harder<00:00:48.170> to<00:00:48.470> push<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:48.950> you<00:00:49.580> can<00:00:49.700> see<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:49.880> have<00:00:50.060> it

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
harder to push so you can see I have it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.810 
harder to push so you can see I have it
coming<00:00:50.330> up<00:00:50.630> this<00:00:50.900> tube<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:51.950> then<00:00:52.340> you<00:00:52.430> can<00:00:52.610> see

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
coming up this tube and then you can see

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.280 
coming up this tube and then you can see
right<00:00:53.030> up<00:00:53.240> here<00:00:53.540> there's<00:00:53.750> a<00:00:53.870> little<00:00:54.050> air

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
right up here there's a little air

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.010 
right up here there's a little air
pocket<00:00:54.830> where<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.970> know<00:00:56.090> I<00:00:56.120> can't<00:00:56.450> quite<00:00:56.690> push

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
pocket where you know I can't quite push

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.020 
pocket where you know I can't quite push
that<00:00:57.320> much<00:00:57.590> so<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.070> kind<00:00:58.250> of<00:00:58.280> dies<00:00:58.520> down<00:00:58.820> up

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
that much so it kind of dies down up

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.450 
that much so it kind of dies down up
there<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.480> then<00:01:00.140> over<00:01:00.440> here<00:01:00.890> I<00:01:01.100> have<00:01:01.250> my

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
there and then over here I have my

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.810 
there and then over here I have my
radiator<00:01:02.180> with<00:01:03.080> a<00:01:03.410> I<00:01:03.680> believe<00:01:04.010> it's<00:01:04.159> a<00:01:04.250> Corsair

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
radiator with a I believe it's a Corsair

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.660 
radiator with a I believe it's a Corsair
silent<00:01:05.479> series<00:01:05.869> fan<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:07.189> pretty<00:01:07.520> nice

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
silent series fan so it's pretty nice

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.520 
silent series fan so it's pretty nice
and<00:01:07.729> then<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:08.150> have<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:08.540> on<00:01:08.630> um<00:01:08.900> basically<00:01:09.439> well

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
and then I have it on um basically well

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.500 
and then I have it on um basically well
I<00:01:09.740> consider<00:01:10.310> risers<00:01:10.729> but<00:01:10.909> really<00:01:11.119> I<00:01:11.150> just<00:01:11.210> have

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
I consider risers but really I just have

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.470 
I consider risers but really I just have
it<00:01:11.660> screwed<00:01:11.930> in<00:01:12.140> like<00:01:12.320> half<00:01:12.560> way<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:13.670> that's

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
it screwed in like half way and that's

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.210 
it screwed in like half way and that's
because<00:01:14.870> as<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:15.470> can<00:01:15.620> see<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:15.890> is<00:01:16.040> really

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
because as you can see this is really

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.950 
because as you can see this is really
there's<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.760> little<00:01:17.000> bit<00:01:17.120> of<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.300> gap<00:01:17.480> here<00:01:17.750> but

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
there's a little bit of a gap here but

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.990 
there's a little bit of a gap here but
not<00:01:18.170> much<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:19.010> you<00:01:19.160> guys<00:01:19.310> can<00:01:19.490> actually<00:01:19.580> see

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
not much that you guys can actually see

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.180 
not much that you guys can actually see
you<00:01:20.600> see<00:01:20.810> yeah<00:01:20.990> if<00:01:21.110> I<00:01:21.230> go<00:01:21.350> right<00:01:21.560> there<00:01:21.800> and<00:01:21.830> air

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
you see yeah if I go right there and air

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.670 
you see yeah if I go right there and air
just<00:01:22.400> escapes<00:01:22.790> right<00:01:23.060> through<00:01:23.330> there<00:01:23.510> so<00:01:24.350> do

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
just escapes right through there so do

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.050 
just escapes right through there so do
the<00:01:24.800> fight<00:01:24.980> there's<00:01:25.159> not<00:01:25.280> much<00:01:25.400> air<00:01:25.610> flow<00:01:25.640> it's

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
the fight there's not much air flow it's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.460 
the fight there's not much air flow it's
really<00:01:26.360> loud<00:01:26.570> if<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:26.900> have<00:01:27.050> it<00:01:27.140> against<00:01:27.409> the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
really loud if I have it against the

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.320 
really loud if I have it against the
radiator<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.250> that's<00:01:28.880> why<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.060> have<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.240> on

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
radiator so that's why I have it on

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.760 
radiator so that's why I have it on
risers<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:29.780> it'll<00:01:30.050> blow<00:01:30.200> through<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:30.680> it

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
risers so it'll blow through and then it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.920 
risers so it'll blow through and then it
comes<00:01:30.980> out<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:31.400> way<00:01:31.670> I<00:01:31.880> need<00:01:32.540> to<00:01:32.630> figure<00:01:32.870> out

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
comes out this way I need to figure out

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.600 
comes out this way I need to figure out
a<00:01:32.990> little<00:01:33.140> bit<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.650> better<00:01:33.860> way<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.100> do<00:01:34.370> that

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
a little bit of a better way to do that

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.120 
a little bit of a better way to do that
and<00:01:34.820> then<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.720> can<00:01:35.900> see<00:01:36.229> I'm<00:01:36.560> assuming<00:01:37.010> all<00:01:37.070> of

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
and then you can see I'm assuming all of

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.050 
and then you can see I'm assuming all of
the<00:01:37.340> free<00:01:37.550> guys<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:39.710> fluid<00:01:40.159> exits<00:01:40.340> right<00:01:40.790> over

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
the free guys the fluid exits right over

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.140 
the free guys the fluid exits right over
here<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.690> can<00:01:42.260> see<00:01:42.500> how<00:01:42.710> much<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.100> um<00:01:43.250> it

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
here and you can see how much it um it

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.170 
here and you can see how much it um it
actually<00:01:44.180> dies<00:01:44.750> down<00:01:45.400> because<00:01:46.400> let<00:01:46.820> me<00:01:46.850> point

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
actually dies down because let me point

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.580 
actually dies down because let me point
to<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:47.510> you<00:01:47.630> can<00:01:47.750> see<00:01:47.960> right<00:01:48.170> there

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
to it you can see right there

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.950 
to it you can see right there
it's<00:01:49.010> pretty<00:01:49.250> much<00:01:49.370> all<00:01:49.610> air<00:01:49.909> is<00:01:50.210> except<00:01:50.930> for

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
it's pretty much all air is except for

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.330 
it's pretty much all air is except for
right<00:01:51.260> at<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.500> bottom<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:51.979> can<00:01:52.100> see<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
right at the bottom you can see the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.780 
right at the bottom you can see the
fluid<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:54.170> would<00:01:54.799> definitely<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.549> know<00:01:55.670> if

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
fluid so I would definitely you know if

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.460 
fluid so I would definitely you know if
I<00:01:55.940> had<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.240> do<00:01:56.840> this<00:01:56.960> again<00:01:57.260> I<00:01:57.320> would

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
I had to do this again I would

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.690 
I had to do this again I would
definitely<00:01:57.560> buy<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.010> little<00:01:58.370> bit<00:01:58.460> more

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
definitely buy a little bit more

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.539 
definitely buy a little bit more
powerful<00:01:59.180> pump<00:01:59.799> because<00:02:00.799> this<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:01.130> one<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.340> the

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
powerful pump because this is one of the

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.460 
powerful pump because this is one of the
lowest<00:02:01.970> gallon<00:02:02.450> per<00:02:02.600> hour<00:02:02.630> pump<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:03.320> can

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
lowest gallon per hour pump so you can

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.300 
lowest gallon per hour pump so you can
get<00:02:03.680> that's<00:02:03.920> an<00:02:04.070> actual<00:02:04.310> pond<00:02:04.580> pump<00:02:06.070> but<00:02:07.070> yeah

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
get that's an actual pond pump but yeah

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.619 
get that's an actual pond pump but yeah
now<00:02:07.580> I'm<00:02:07.670> gonna<00:02:07.790> go<00:02:07.970> ahead<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.119> get<00:02:08.269> to<00:02:08.390> doing

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
now I'm gonna go ahead and get to doing

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.210 
now I'm gonna go ahead and get to doing
actual<00:02:09.019> tests<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.500> guys<00:02:09.619> can<00:02:09.830> see<00:02:10.039> what<00:02:10.099> this

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
actual tests you guys can see what this

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.640 
actual tests you guys can see what this
pump<00:02:10.489> will<00:02:10.640> do<00:02:10.840> alright<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.140> we're<00:02:12.260> back<00:02:12.290> now

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
pump will do alright so we're back now

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.650 
pump will do alright so we're back now
it's<00:02:13.430> been<00:02:13.700> about<00:02:13.909> an<00:02:14.150> hour<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.870> five<00:02:15.709> minutes

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
it's been about an hour and five minutes

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.720 
it's been about an hour and five minutes
since<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.080> CPU<00:02:17.620> test<00:02:17.860> has<00:02:18.040> been<00:02:18.070> running<00:02:18.580> at

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
since the CPU test has been running at

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.960 
since the CPU test has been running at
full<00:02:18.970> speed<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:20.230> right<00:02:21.070> up<00:02:21.190> here<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.430> have<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
full speed so right up here I have the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.180 
full speed so right up here I have the
CPU<00:02:22.600> temperatures<00:02:23.110> pulled<00:02:23.410> up<00:02:23.590> for<00:02:23.980> both

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
CPU temperatures pulled up for both

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.050 
CPU temperatures pulled up for both
cores<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:25.000> around<00:02:25.840> 30<00:02:26.230> will<00:02:27.040> say<00:02:27.190> 33<00:02:27.760> degrees

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
cores so around 30 will say 33 degrees

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.290 
cores so around 30 will say 33 degrees
Celsius<00:02:28.090> an<00:02:28.660> average<00:02:29.050> which<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.470> about<00:02:30.300> what

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
Celsius an average which is about what

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.880 
Celsius an average which is about what
would<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.420> be<00:02:31.570> about<00:02:31.660> 90<00:02:32.080> degrees<00:02:32.170> Celsius

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
would that be about 90 degrees Celsius

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.940 
would that be about 90 degrees Celsius
maybe<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.790> little<00:02:33.940> bit<00:02:34.120> above<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.350> then

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
maybe a little bit above that and then

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.590 
maybe a little bit above that and then
you<00:02:36.040> can<00:02:36.190> see<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.520> ambient<00:02:36.910> temperature<00:02:37.030> is

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
you can see the ambient temperature is

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.460 
you can see the ambient temperature is
about<00:02:37.810> 85<00:02:38.470> degrees<00:02:38.500> why<00:02:39.070> surely<00:02:40.230> for<00:02:41.230> an<00:02:41.290> me<00:02:41.440> a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
about 85 degrees why surely for an me a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.560 
about 85 degrees why surely for an me a
temperature<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.100> want<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.310> add<00:02:42.430> about<00:02:42.610> 4<00:02:43.360> or<00:02:43.390> 5

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
temperature you want to add about 4 or 5

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.720 
temperature you want to add about 4 or 5
degrees<00:02:43.870> Fahrenheit<00:02:44.590> from<00:02:44.860> some<00:02:45.070> test<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.520> did

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
degrees Fahrenheit from some test I did

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.700 
degrees Fahrenheit from some test I did
so<00:02:46.000> we'll<00:02:46.630> say<00:02:46.780> it's<00:02:46.960> about<00:02:47.140> 90<00:02:47.590> degrees

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
so we'll say it's about 90 degrees

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.100 
so we'll say it's about 90 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:48.460> inside<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.240> tank<00:02:49.540> right<00:02:49.750> now<00:02:49.780> and

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
Fahrenheit inside the tank right now and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.990 
Fahrenheit inside the tank right now and
that's<00:02:50.710> been<00:02:51.100> running<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.820> whole<00:02:51.850> time

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
that's been running the whole time

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.890 
that's been running the whole time
without<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:53.400> pump<00:02:54.400> on<00:02:54.610> for<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.300> radiator<00:02:55.630> fan

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
without the pump on for the radiator fan

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.260 
without the pump on for the radiator fan
so<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:57.070> whole<00:02:57.190> time<00:02:57.430> it's<00:02:57.670> been<00:02:57.850> without<00:02:58.090> a

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
so the whole time it's been without a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.570 
so the whole time it's been without a
pump<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.590> now<00:02:59.680> we're<00:02:59.770> gonna<00:02:59.860> turn<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.160> pump<00:03:00.400> on

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
pump so now we're gonna turn the pump on

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.640 
pump so now we're gonna turn the pump on
and<00:03:01.240> you<00:03:01.330> can<00:03:01.450> see<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.750> liquid<00:03:01.990> climbing<00:03:02.530> up

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
and you can see the liquid climbing up

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.470 
and you can see the liquid climbing up
into<00:03:02.950> bit<00:03:03.100> there

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
into bit there

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.750 
into bit there
so<00:03:04.960> I<00:03:05.020> have<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.260> hiccups<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.830> now<00:03:06.520> we're<00:03:06.670> gonna

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
so I have the hiccups so now we're gonna

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.010 
so I have the hiccups so now we're gonna
see<00:03:07.030> if<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.240> actually<00:03:07.270> lowers<00:03:07.720> the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
see if that actually lowers the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.080 
see if that actually lowers the
temperatures<00:03:08.500> at<00:03:08.650> all<00:03:08.740> so<00:03:09.010> like<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:09.700> said<00:03:09.970> we

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
temperatures at all so like I said we

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.260 
temperatures at all so like I said we
have<00:03:10.470> eighty<00:03:11.470> five<00:03:11.800> point<00:03:12.220> one<00:03:12.490> which<00:03:13.030> we'll

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
have eighty five point one which we'll

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.710 
have eighty five point one which we'll
say<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.600> about<00:03:13.800> ninety<00:03:14.800> degrees<00:03:15.720> Fahrenheit

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
say is about ninety degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.370 
say is about ninety degrees Fahrenheit
and<00:03:16.930> then<00:03:17.170> right<00:03:18.010> up<00:03:18.040> here<00:03:18.370> we<00:03:18.610> have<00:03:19.380> eighty

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
and then right up here we have eighty

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.600 
and then right up here we have eighty
what<00:03:21.340> do<00:03:21.400> we<00:03:21.520> have<00:03:21.610> 85<00:03:22.380> 84<00:03:23.380> we'll<00:03:23.770> say<00:03:24.040> about<00:03:24.190> 84

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
what do we have 85 84 we'll say about 84

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.360 
what do we have 85 84 we'll say about 84
on<00:03:24.700> average<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:26.050> we<00:03:26.320> have<00:03:26.680> about<00:03:26.890> yeah<00:03:27.190> that's

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
on average so we have about yeah that's

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.250 
on average so we have about yeah that's
about<00:03:27.490> right<00:03:27.610> so<00:03:27.910> we<00:03:28.030> have<00:03:28.120> 94<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.660> process<00:03:29.080> in

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
about right so we have 94 the process in

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.280 
about right so we have 94 the process in
the<00:03:29.380> 93<00:03:29.860> ambient<00:03:30.280> temperature<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:31.600> we're

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
the 93 ambient temperature so we're

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.040 
the 93 ambient temperature so we're
gonna<00:03:32.380> see<00:03:32.620> if<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.709> makes<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.070> difference<00:03:34.050> all

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
gonna see if that makes a difference all

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.900 
gonna see if that makes a difference all
right<00:03:35.230> guys<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:35.860> been<00:03:36.070> another<00:03:36.580> hour

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
right guys so it's been another hour

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.280 
right guys so it's been another hour
since<00:03:37.750> then<00:03:38.050> as<00:03:38.320> you<00:03:38.530> can<00:03:38.680> see<00:03:38.950> two<00:03:39.220> hours<00:03:39.610> now

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
since then as you can see two hours now

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.220 
since then as you can see two hours now
okay<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:42.430> can<00:03:42.700> see<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.240> max<00:03:43.570> temperature

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
okay so you can see the max temperature

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.590 
okay so you can see the max temperature
has<00:03:44.620> gotten<00:03:44.950> up<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.070> 44<00:03:45.820> degrees<00:03:45.850> Celsius<00:03:46.540> but

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
has gotten up to 44 degrees Celsius but

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.720 
has gotten up to 44 degrees Celsius but
I've<00:03:46.780> been<00:03:46.989> going<00:03:47.260> by<00:03:47.470> what<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.400> current

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
I've been going by what the current

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.060 
I've been going by what the current
temperature<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.209> which<00:03:49.390> is<00:03:49.540> right<00:03:49.780> there<00:03:50.070> so

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
temperature is which is right there so

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.490 
temperature is which is right there so
you<00:03:51.670> can<00:03:51.820> see<00:03:52.030> about<00:03:52.270> 40<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:52.900> 42<00:03:53.230> degrees

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
you can see about 40 to 42 degrees

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.680 
you can see about 40 to 42 degrees
Celsius<00:03:54.190> which<00:03:54.459> here's<00:03:55.270> where<00:03:55.510> I<00:03:55.570> actually

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
Celsius which here's where I actually

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.470 
Celsius which here's where I actually
did<00:03:56.050> my<00:03:56.080> math<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.860> prove<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.820> has<00:03:57.850> helped

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
did my math to prove that it has helped

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.740 
did my math to prove that it has helped
with<00:03:58.540> temperature<00:03:59.110> wise<00:03:59.350> so<00:04:00.480> basically<00:04:01.480> we

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
with temperature wise so basically we

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.540 
with temperature wise so basically we
started<00:04:02.170> off<00:04:02.380> at<00:04:02.650> about<00:04:02.860> 62<00:04:03.280> degrees

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
started off at about 62 degrees

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.100 
started off at about 62 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.330> would<00:04:04.480> have<00:04:04.570> been<00:04:04.690> for<00:04:04.989> the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
Fahrenheit that would have been for the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.890 
Fahrenheit that would have been for the
ambient<00:04:05.500> temperature<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.370> CPU<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.570> we

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
ambient temperature and the CPU and we

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.380 
ambient temperature and the CPU and we
had<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.080> 29<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:09.010> 30<00:04:09.220> degree<00:04:09.550> fahrenheit<00:04:10.150> gain

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
had a 29 to 30 degree fahrenheit gain

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.500 
had a 29 to 30 degree fahrenheit gain
after<00:04:10.780> one<00:04:10.989> hour<00:04:11.130> so<00:04:12.130> you<00:04:12.280> can<00:04:12.520> see<00:04:12.760> from<00:04:13.420> our

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
after one hour so you can see from our

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.930 
after one hour so you can see from our
one<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.959> two<00:04:14.170> we<00:04:15.130> went<00:04:15.310> from<00:04:15.370> ninety<00:04:15.730> point

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
one to two we went from ninety point

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.680 
one to two we went from ninety point
five<00:04:16.239> degrees<00:04:16.690> Fahrenheit<00:04:17.700> on<00:04:18.700> average<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.660> a

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
five degrees Fahrenheit on average to a

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.390 
five degrees Fahrenheit on average to a
hundred<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.350> seven

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
hundred and seven

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.939 
hundred and seven
Fahrenheit<00:04:22.240> so<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.050> was<00:04:23.139> only<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.410> 16<00:04:23.740> point

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
Fahrenheit so that was only a 16 point

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.750 
Fahrenheit so that was only a 16 point
five<00:04:24.310> Fahrenheit<00:04:24.910> game<00:04:25.120> so<00:04:25.570> basically<00:04:26.760> you

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
five Fahrenheit game so basically you

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.909 
five Fahrenheit game so basically you
know<00:04:27.880> one<00:04:28.120> hour<00:04:28.300> without<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.840> pump<00:04:29.020> on<00:04:29.199> it<00:04:29.650> was

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
know one hour without the pump on it was

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.580 
know one hour without the pump on it was
about<00:04:30.490> thirty<00:04:30.729> degrees<00:04:31.060> fahrenheit<00:04:31.570> gain<00:04:31.780> one

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
about thirty degrees fahrenheit gain one

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.280 
about thirty degrees fahrenheit gain one
hour<00:04:32.770> with<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.160> radiator<00:04:33.520> on<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:34.510> was<00:04:34.810> sixteen

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
hour with the radiator on it was sixteen

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.250 
hour with the radiator on it was sixteen
point<00:04:35.620> five<00:04:36.000> Fahrenheit<00:04:37.000> gains<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:37.510> it<00:04:38.110> was

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
point five Fahrenheit gains so it was

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.159 
point five Fahrenheit gains so it was
about<00:04:38.380> half<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:39.100> temperature<00:04:39.639> that<00:04:40.169> the

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
about half the temperature that the

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.800 
about half the temperature that the
other<00:04:41.320> one<00:04:41.530> was<00:04:41.740> at<00:04:41.919> so<00:04:42.360> I'm<00:04:43.360> sorry

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
other one was at so I'm sorry

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.969 
other one was at so I'm sorry
half<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.440> temperature<00:04:45.210> without<00:04:46.210> with<00:04:47.199> okay

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
half the temperature without with okay

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.590 
half the temperature without with okay
you<00:04:48.370> guys<00:04:48.520> get<00:04:48.760> what<00:04:48.880> I'm<00:04:48.970> saying<00:04:49.180> I<00:04:49.300> don't

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
you guys get what I'm saying I don't

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.689 
you guys get what I'm saying I don't
even<00:04:49.840> know<00:04:49.930> what<00:04:50.020> I'm<00:04:50.080> talking<00:04:50.350> about<00:04:50.410> so<00:04:51.340> yeah

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
even know what I'm talking about so yeah

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.120 
even know what I'm talking about so yeah
it<00:04:52.090> definitely<00:04:52.210> does<00:04:52.510> significantly<00:04:52.810> help

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
it definitely does significantly help

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.159 
it definitely does significantly help
I<00:04:54.160> do<00:04:54.580> wish<00:04:54.970> although<00:04:55.389> because<00:04:55.810> I<00:04:55.840> know<00:04:56.020> I

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
I do wish although because I know I

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.629 
I do wish although because I know I
could<00:04:56.440> have<00:04:56.500> gotten<00:04:56.770> better<00:04:56.889> temperatures<00:04:57.490> oh

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
could have gotten better temperatures oh

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.909 
could have gotten better temperatures oh
wait<00:04:57.850> wait<00:04:58.060> when<00:04:58.660> I<00:04:58.690> have<00:04:58.810> one<00:04:58.870> more<00:04:59.050> think<00:04:59.320> so

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
wait wait when I have one more think so

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.620 
wait wait when I have one more think so
this<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.400> ambient<00:05:00.760> temperature<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:01.479> was

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
this the ambient temperature that was

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.270 
this the ambient temperature that was
just<00:05:01.810> me<00:05:01.960> measuring<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.380> CPU<00:05:02.800> temperature

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
just me measuring the CPU temperature

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.969 
just me measuring the CPU temperature
when<00:05:03.400> I<00:05:03.430> said<00:05:03.639> it<00:05:03.729> was<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:03.850> sixteen<00:05:04.300> point<00:05:04.570> five

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
when I said it was a sixteen point five

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.740 
when I said it was a sixteen point five
Fahrenheit<00:05:05.979> gain<00:05:06.240> for<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.330> ambient

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
Fahrenheit gain for the ambient

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.290 
Fahrenheit gain for the ambient
temperature<00:05:08.669> let's<00:05:09.669> see<00:05:09.789> I<00:05:09.820> had<00:05:09.940> about<00:05:10.120> five

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
temperature let's see I had about five

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.290 
temperature let's see I had about five
degrees<00:05:10.479> so<00:05:11.050> it's<00:05:11.560> only<00:05:11.770> about<00:05:12.070> a<00:05:12.280> hundred<00:05:12.760> and

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
degrees so it's only about a hundred and

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.050 
degrees so it's only about a hundred and
three<00:05:13.990> Fahrenheit<00:05:14.620> there<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.310> it's<00:05:15.880> actually

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
three Fahrenheit there so it's actually

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.020 
three Fahrenheit there so it's actually
a<00:05:16.270> little<00:05:16.449> bit<00:05:16.630> less<00:05:16.870> there<00:05:17.199> even<00:05:17.530> so<00:05:18.039> um<00:05:18.280> it

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
a little bit less there even so um it

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.400 
a little bit less there even so um it
definitely<00:05:19.360> does<00:05:19.510> help<00:05:19.750> with<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:19.930> overall

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
definitely does help with the overall

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.790 
definitely does help with the overall
temperature<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.580> tank<00:05:21.850> and<00:05:22.600> I<00:05:22.960> do<00:05:23.020> wish<00:05:23.320> I

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
temperature of the tank and I do wish I

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.050 
temperature of the tank and I do wish I
would<00:05:24.280> have<00:05:24.310> gone<00:05:24.460> a<00:05:24.520> little<00:05:24.729> bit<00:05:24.880> more

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
would have gone a little bit more

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.750 
would have gone a little bit more
powerful<00:05:25.360> pump<00:05:25.780> this<00:05:26.590> pump<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:27.070> very<00:05:27.400> good<00:05:27.610> for

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
powerful pump this pump is very good for

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.370 
powerful pump this pump is very good for
the<00:05:27.849> application<00:05:28.479> because<00:05:28.780> obviously<00:05:28.990> I'm

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
the application because obviously I'm

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.659 
the application because obviously I'm
not<00:05:29.500> going<00:05:29.680> to<00:05:29.770> be<00:05:29.860> constantly<00:05:30.490> you<00:05:30.639> know

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
not going to be constantly you know

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.370 
not going to be constantly you know
forty<00:05:31.060> hours<00:05:31.180> straight<00:05:31.360> using<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.840> CPU<00:05:32.289> at

forty hours straight using the CPU at
100%<00:05:32.740> like<00:05:33.130> that<00:05:33.340> but<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:35.560> know<00:05:35.650> I<00:05:35.680> would

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
100% like that but you know I would

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.200 
100% like that but you know I would
definitely<00:05:36.190> would<00:05:36.610> have<00:05:36.700> liked<00:05:36.910> a<00:05:37.000> little<00:05:37.060> bit

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
definitely would have liked a little bit

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.490 
definitely would have liked a little bit
more<00:05:37.300> than<00:05:37.630> eighty<00:05:37.810> gallons<00:05:38.020> per<00:05:38.410> hour

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
more than eighty gallons per hour

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.159 
more than eighty gallons per hour
because<00:05:38.770> although<00:05:39.700> it<00:05:40.150> is<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.599> know<00:05:40.690> keeping

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
because although it is you know keeping

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.960 
because although it is you know keeping
up<00:05:41.380> I<00:05:41.620> can<00:05:41.860> still<00:05:42.130> see<00:05:42.340> that<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:42.550> temperature

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
up I can still see that the temperature

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.750 
up I can still see that the temperature
is<00:05:43.180> you<00:05:43.479> know<00:05:43.570> very<00:05:43.930> slowly<00:05:44.500> rising<00:05:45.099> although

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
is you know very slowly rising although

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.610 
is you know very slowly rising although
it<00:05:45.849> seems<00:05:46.090> to<00:05:46.270> have<00:05:46.389> pretty<00:05:46.840> much<00:05:47.080> maxed<00:05:47.349> out

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
it seems to have pretty much maxed out

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.770 
it seems to have pretty much maxed out
now<00:05:47.800> it's<00:05:47.979> been<00:05:48.160> a<00:05:48.190> you<00:05:48.880> know<00:05:49.000> about<00:05:49.240> forty

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
now it's been a you know about forty

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.159 
now it's been a you know about forty
forty<00:05:50.680> ish<00:05:50.860> degrees<00:05:51.520> Celsius<00:05:52.030> for<00:05:52.060> you<00:05:53.050> know

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
forty ish degrees Celsius for you know

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.719 
forty ish degrees Celsius for you know
quite<00:05:53.410> a<00:05:53.440> while<00:05:53.650> now<00:05:53.680> and<00:05:54.130> then<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.340> ambient

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
quite a while now and then the ambient

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.010 
quite a while now and then the ambient
temperature<00:05:54.820> hasn't<00:05:55.300> gone<00:05:55.389> up<00:05:55.570> much<00:05:55.810> more

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
temperature hasn't gone up much more

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.800 
temperature hasn't gone up much more
since<00:05:56.320> then<00:05:56.530> so<00:05:57.460> the<00:05:57.880> only<00:05:58.000> thing<00:05:58.210> I<00:05:58.300> would<00:05:58.419> you

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
since then so the only thing I would you

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.260 
since then so the only thing I would you
know<00:05:58.930> change<00:05:59.800> or<00:06:00.130> recommend<00:06:00.729> if<00:06:00.910> you<00:06:01.030> wanted

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
know change or recommend if you wanted

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.360 
know change or recommend if you wanted
to<00:06:01.360> be<00:06:01.479> putting<00:06:01.690> more<00:06:01.930> heat<00:06:02.139> it's<00:06:02.830> just<00:06:03.070> a<00:06:03.190> more

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
to be putting more heat it's just a more

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.969 
to be putting more heat it's just a more
powerful<00:06:03.520> pump<00:06:04.060> because<00:06:04.449> you<00:06:05.229> can<00:06:05.410> see<00:06:05.620> right

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
powerful pump because you can see right

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.279 
powerful pump because you can see right
up<00:06:06.280> here<00:06:06.729> right<00:06:07.030> at<00:06:07.510> the<00:06:07.539> top<00:06:07.630> of<00:06:07.930> this<00:06:08.020> tube

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
up here right at the top of this tube

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:09.900 
up here right at the top of this tube
there's<00:06:09.039> that<00:06:09.190> little<00:06:09.310> bubble<00:06:09.729> right<00:06:09.789> there

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
there's that little bubble right there

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.279 
there's that little bubble right there
that's<00:06:10.240> where<00:06:10.389> air<00:06:10.599> is<00:06:10.630> getting<00:06:11.050> in<00:06:11.169> because

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
that's where air is getting in because

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.890 
that's where air is getting in because
you<00:06:11.530> can<00:06:11.650> see<00:06:11.860> it<00:06:12.580> can<00:06:12.729> only<00:06:12.849> push<00:06:13.180> up<00:06:13.389> so<00:06:13.660> much

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
you can see it can only push up so much

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.930 
you can see it can only push up so much
and<00:06:14.289> then<00:06:14.530> it<00:06:15.010> doesn't<00:06:15.310> even<00:06:15.430> fill<00:06:15.639> the<00:06:15.760> tube

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
and then it doesn't even fill the tube

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.670 
and then it doesn't even fill the tube
many<00:06:16.120> more<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:16.900> then<00:06:17.050> coming<00:06:17.349> out<00:06:17.470> on<00:06:17.590> the

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
many more and then coming out on the

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.020 
many more and then coming out on the
other<00:06:17.770> side<00:06:17.889> I'm<00:06:18.550> gonna<00:06:18.669> see<00:06:18.760> if<00:06:18.820> I<00:06:18.880> can<00:06:19.000> zoom

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
other side I'm gonna see if I can zoom

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.370 
other side I'm gonna see if I can zoom
in<00:06:19.270> on<00:06:19.360> that<00:06:19.510> and<00:06:19.630> get<00:06:19.690> it<00:06:19.810> focused<00:06:20.169> for<00:06:20.289> you

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
in on that and get it focused for you

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.350 
in on that and get it focused for you
guys<00:06:20.530> easy<00:06:21.340> coming<00:06:21.880> out<00:06:22.000> on<00:06:22.060> the<00:06:22.150> other<00:06:22.240> side

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
guys easy coming out on the other side

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.810 
guys easy coming out on the other side
you<00:06:23.349> can<00:06:23.380> see<00:06:23.620> that<00:06:23.770> little<00:06:23.919> line<00:06:24.250> I'm<00:06:24.520> sipping

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
you can see that little line I'm sipping

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.490 
you can see that little line I'm sipping
point<00:06:25.060> to<00:06:25.120> it<00:06:25.210> right<00:06:25.389> about<00:06:25.599> there<00:06:25.660> that's

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
point to it right about there that's

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.250 
point to it right about there that's
where<00:06:26.860> the<00:06:27.160> mineral<00:06:27.490> oil<00:06:27.669> is<00:06:27.940> coming<00:06:28.720> out<00:06:29.050> at

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
where the mineral oil is coming out at

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.480 
where the mineral oil is coming out at
so<00:06:29.560> you<00:06:29.620> can<00:06:29.740> see<00:06:29.919> it's<00:06:30.070> actually<00:06:30.250> a

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
so you can see it's actually a

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.279 
so you can see it's actually a
significant<00:06:31.210> drop<00:06:31.450> you<00:06:31.990> know<00:06:32.080> it's<00:06:32.229> only

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 
significant drop you know it's only

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:33.480 
significant drop you know it's only
trickling<00:06:32.890> out<00:06:33.010> at<00:06:33.190> that

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
trickling out at that

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.120 
trickling out at that
so<00:06:33.880> it's<00:06:34.599> really<00:06:34.840> not<00:06:35.080> regulating<00:06:35.860> you<00:06:36.009> know

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
so it's really not regulating you know

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.129 
so it's really not regulating you know
as<00:06:36.310> much<00:06:36.550> as<00:06:36.610> it<00:06:36.910> could<00:06:37.180> be<00:06:37.360> for<00:06:37.660> a<00:06:37.690> five<00:06:37.930> gallon

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
as much as it could be for a five gallon

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.140 
as much as it could be for a five gallon
tank<00:06:38.530> like<00:06:38.740> that<00:06:38.949> even<00:06:39.639> though<00:06:39.759> it<00:06:39.819> really<00:06:39.849> was

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
tank like that even though it really was

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.120 
tank like that even though it really was
only<00:06:40.240> about<00:06:40.449> 2.5<00:06:41.199> gallon<00:06:41.710> why<00:06:41.830> she<00:06:42.039> knows

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
only about 2.5 gallon why she knows

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.439 
only about 2.5 gallon why she knows
about<00:06:42.340> three<00:06:42.580> gallons<00:06:42.970> in<00:06:43.060> there<00:06:43.180> right<00:06:43.270> now

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
about three gallons in there right now

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:46.980 
about three gallons in there right now
so<00:06:45.150> you<00:06:46.150> know<00:06:46.180> could<00:06:46.449> definitely<00:06:46.569> be<00:06:46.840> doing

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
so you know could definitely be doing

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.300 
so you know could definitely be doing
better<00:06:47.289> with<00:06:47.470> a<00:06:47.500> little<00:06:47.770> bit<00:06:47.860> more<00:06:48.009> powerful

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
better with a little bit more powerful

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.870 
better with a little bit more powerful
pump<00:06:48.669> like<00:06:48.940> maybe<00:06:49.210> 160<00:06:50.220> gallons<00:06:51.220> powder<00:06:51.669> I

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
pump like maybe 160 gallons powder I

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.770 
pump like maybe 160 gallons powder I
think<00:06:52.150> would<00:06:52.330> probably<00:06:53.910> and<00:06:54.910> I<00:06:55.360> don't<00:06:55.660> know<00:06:55.750> I

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
think would probably and I don't know I

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.059 
think would probably and I don't know I
don't<00:06:55.990> want<00:06:56.139> to<00:06:56.289> make<00:06:56.560> some<00:06:56.889> random

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:57.069 
don't want to make some random

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:58.800 
don't want to make some random
difference<00:06:57.610> but<00:06:57.849> I<00:06:58.090> think<00:06:58.300> wouldn't<00:06:58.690> make<00:06:58.780> a

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
difference but I think wouldn't make a

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.360 
difference but I think wouldn't make a
really<00:06:59.289> big<00:06:59.470> difference<00:06:59.650> compared<00:07:00.190> to<00:07:00.220> this

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.370 
really big difference compared to this

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.580 
really big difference compared to this
one<00:07:00.639> but<00:07:00.849> it<00:07:01.389> definitely<00:07:01.810> was<00:07:02.020> the<00:07:02.050> difference

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
one but it definitely was the difference

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.050 
one but it definitely was the difference
is<00:07:02.800> you<00:07:02.919> can<00:07:03.039> tell<00:07:03.220> what<00:07:03.430> the<00:07:03.550> temperature<00:07:03.910> was

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
is you can tell what the temperature was

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.050 
is you can tell what the temperature was
cut<00:07:04.300> in<00:07:04.509> about<00:07:04.750> half<00:07:05.020> so<00:07:05.500> I<00:07:05.740> am<00:07:06.430> impressed<00:07:06.789> with
