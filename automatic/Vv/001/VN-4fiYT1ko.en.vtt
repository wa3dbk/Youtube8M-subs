00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
the reason I didn't do my last checking

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.859 
the reason I didn't do my last checking
which<00:00:17.010> was<00:00:17.190> supposed<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.609> be<00:00:17.730> checking<00:00:17.760> six<00:00:18.480> on

which was supposed to be checking six on

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.870 
which was supposed to be checking six on
the<00:00:19.770> fourteenth<00:00:20.609> i<00:00:20.850> think<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.880> after

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
the fourteenth i think was because after

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.849 
the fourteenth i think was because after
that<00:00:24.060> last<00:00:24.240> check-in<00:00:25.080> i<00:00:25.410> was<00:00:25.529> having<00:00:25.710> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
that last check-in i was having a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.679 
that last check-in i was having a
difficult<00:00:25.980> time<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.880> i<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.180> stuck<00:00:27.539> at<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
difficult time and i was stuck at a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.490 
difficult time and i was stuck at a
plateau<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.769> thought<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.369> would<00:00:30.439> take<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
plateau so I thought I would take a

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.650 
plateau so I thought I would take a
break<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.520> still<00:00:32.759> working<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.630> I
