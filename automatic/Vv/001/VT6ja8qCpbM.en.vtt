00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.700 
anyway I just keep going into my flurry
because<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.610> hit<00:01:53.850> harder<00:01:54.210> look<00:01:55.170> at<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.380> extra

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
because I hit harder look at that extra

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.709 
because I hit harder look at that extra
hit<00:01:55.860> since<00:01:56.070> I'm<00:01:56.189> faster<00:01:56.579> than<00:01:56.610> him<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:57.570> in

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
hit since I'm faster than him that's in

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.660 
hit since I'm faster than him that's in
pretty<00:01:57.840> much<00:01:57.990> every<00:01:58.350> pet<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.920> rabbit<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
pretty much every pet the rabbit is

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.980 
pretty much every pet the rabbit is
ridiculously<00:02:00.270> crazy<00:02:00.479> fast<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.680> he<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:03.570> setting

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
ridiculously crazy fast so he is setting

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.109 
ridiculously crazy fast so he is setting
up<00:02:04.170> his<00:02:04.409> heart<00:02:04.890> if<00:02:05.159> he<00:02:05.280> takes<00:02:05.460> any<00:02:05.640> damage

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
up his heart if he takes any damage

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.630 
up his heart if he takes any damage
wallets<00:02:06.899> out<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:08.039> he'll<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.280> extra<00:02:08.580> damage

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
wallets out then he'll do extra damage

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.529 
wallets out then he'll do extra damage
so<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.149> obviously<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.200> avoid

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
so I'm obviously just going to avoid

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.809 
so I'm obviously just going to avoid
this<00:02:10.719> round<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.769> then<00:02:11.980> he<00:02:12.129> takes<00:02:12.280> off<00:02:12.489> because

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
this round and then he takes off because

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.119 
this round and then he takes off because
he<00:02:12.909> knows<00:02:13.090> he<00:02:13.120> can't<00:02:13.540> with<00:02:13.719> this<00:02:13.900> next<00:02:14.769> up<00:02:14.890> a

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
he knows he can't with this next up a

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.009 
he knows he can't with this next up a
little<00:02:15.609> harder<00:02:15.849> of<00:02:15.879> a<00:02:15.969> team<00:02:16.150> mr.<00:02:16.629> bigglesworth

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.339 
little harder of a team mr. bigglesworth
a<00:02:17.469> little<00:02:18.659> something<00:02:19.659> and<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.930> forget<00:02:20.200> it's

plague and absorb and I have my my
absorb<00:04:37.480> actually<00:04:37.810> does<00:04:37.960> more<00:04:38.200> damage

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
absorb actually does more damage

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.800 
absorb actually does more damage
consumed<00:04:39.190> because<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:40.030> has<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.180> one-round<00:04:40.540> cool

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810
