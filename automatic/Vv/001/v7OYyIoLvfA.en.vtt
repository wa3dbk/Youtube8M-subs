 Rear looks with the blade and one 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.799
 classic as you see him in here 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.750
 besides, this knife has one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.760
 black belt club I find a lot 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.009

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.470
 from this desert comeau as well as 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.200
 the black bolts where the poet 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:28.020
 black thumb pin and the black ones 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.840
 a lok now we come sda 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.340
 klinger has a lot so this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.290
 once you can knife one- handed operation 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.200
 make through these two thumb pins 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.210
 suitable for left and right-handed or 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.490
 in the back through this pinball 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.439
 built-in flights to open the knife 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.950
 combi to day longer the blade exists 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.020
 from a 420 steel tube ostfriese 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.020
 blade is coated is that I 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.850
 looks like the back part 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.540
 the blade, the blade length is 9 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.969
 centimeter and on the klinger is the 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.220
 This is why designation is notable here 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.729
 force of black much and the military 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.129
 want a logo 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.090
 then you can see a partial payment of the 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:20.180
 Messers the partly sawtooth is good for that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.709
 for example, to line up neatly 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.720
 disconnect with a train 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.250
 I have already tried that myself 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:33.049
 is perfect and you can see them very much 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.180
 half of the ettlinger is partly saw 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.150
 Payment say nothing was just that and 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.959
 only a very small part succeed here 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.319
 You can see it up here 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.519
 inset holes I find very nice 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.920
 that we come to the grip of the 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.299
 Messers the knife song very very much 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.700
 Good thing you have all this up here 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.079
 a really good pressure point and man 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.459
 the thumb can create really nice 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.819
 and really put pressure on the things 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.920
 can 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.190

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.010
 also against it 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:30.139
 by the pressure you put on top of it 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.870
 knife on the knife blade gives the 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.579
 Locking the blade is a lionel 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.940

 go through these screws 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.109
