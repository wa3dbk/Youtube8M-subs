depending on what apps you can actually
write<00:00:40.860> programs<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.750> will<00:00:42.750> take<00:00:42.960> that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
write programs for this will take that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
write programs for this will take that
off<00:00:44.390> yeah<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:46.200> not<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.649> sexiest<00:00:47.340> looking

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
off yeah it's not the sexiest looking

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.529 
off yeah it's not the sexiest looking
thing<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.120> um<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.770> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.489> knew<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
thing and um it's kind of I knew what it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.220 
thing and um it's kind of I knew what it
was<00:00:51.690> before<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.079> ordered<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
was before I ordered it this is that

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.520 
was before I ordered it this is that
Kickstarter<00:00:55.230> program<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.980> went<00:00:56.719> viral<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
Kickstarter program that went viral and

Kickstarter program that went viral and
I<00:00:58.710> definitely<00:00:58.890> had<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.640> because<00:00:59.969> I

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
I definitely had to get on it because I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
I definitely had to get on it because I
I<00:01:00.390> wanted<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:00.960> able<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> write<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.859> own

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
I wanted to be able to write my own

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.650 
I wanted to be able to write my own
programming<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.699> working<00:01:03.000> out<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> run

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
programming for working out when I run

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.910 
programming for working out when I run
and<00:01:03.899> stuff<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.199> want<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.470> specialized

and stuff I want to have specialized

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.090 
and stuff I want to have specialized
programs<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.510> change<00:01:07.350> pace<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
programs for like when I change pace and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.390 
programs for like when I change pace and
or<00:01:08.400> change<00:01:09.240> my<00:01:09.840> workout<00:01:10.170> routines<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.860> want<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
or change my workout routines I want to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.359 
or change my workout routines I want to
be<00:01:11.460> able<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.909> programmed<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
be able to have that programmed so that

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.090 
be able to have that programmed so that
you<00:01:14.369> get<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> better<00:01:14.729> workout<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you get a better workout from it it's a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.330 
you get a better workout from it it's a
very<00:01:17.549> nice<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.240> colored<00:01:19.229> orange<00:01:19.590> um<00:01:19.830> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
very nice kind of colored orange um it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.880 
very nice kind of colored orange um it
is<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.729> cheap<00:01:21.060> band<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:21.930> least<00:01:22.049> it

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
is a very cheap band but at least it

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.710 
is a very cheap band but at least it
won't<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.939> know<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.360> were<00:01:24.450> other

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
won't you know if it were other

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.899 
won't you know if it were other
materials<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.500> would<00:01:25.619> wear<00:01:25.799> down<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.670> then

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
materials it would wear down and then

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.690 
materials it would wear down and then
you<00:01:27.000> would<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.150> stuck<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.750> replacing<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.700> so

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
you would be stuck with replacing it so

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
you would be stuck with replacing it so
if<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.689> don't<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> band<00:01:31.380> you'd<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
if you don't like the band you'd have to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.330 
if you don't like the band you'd have to
probably<00:01:32.579> change<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:34.070> it's<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.159> some

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
probably change that out it's got some

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.200 
probably change that out it's got some
buttons<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> side<00:01:37.520> and<00:01:38.520> even<00:01:38.850> says

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
buttons on the side and even says

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.660 
buttons on the side and even says
Kickstarter<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> back<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
Kickstarter on the back like that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.200 
Kickstarter on the back like that
Kickstarter<00:01:41.670> edition<00:01:42.439> mm-hmm<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.060> looks

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
Kickstarter edition mm-hmm and it looks

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.069 
Kickstarter edition mm-hmm and it looks
like<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.450> comes<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.950> like<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> magnet<00:01:47.490> mount

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
like it comes with a like a magnet mount

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.200 
like it comes with a like a magnet mount
USB<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.009> don't<00:01:50.460> even<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.000> like

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
USB so you don't even have to have like

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.490 
USB so you don't even have to have like
something<00:01:51.540> plugged<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> looks<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.320> it's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
something plugged in it looks like it's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.730 
something plugged in it looks like it's
just<00:01:52.680> gonna<00:01:52.860> magnet<00:01:53.460> mount<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.000> ya

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
just gonna magnet mount right on ya

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.929 
just gonna magnet mount right on ya
snaps<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.340> that's<00:01:56.460> gonna<00:01:56.579> charge

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
snaps right on and that's gonna charge

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.840 
snaps right on and that's gonna charge
it<00:01:57.180> well<00:01:57.950> well<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.070> clever<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.579> won't<00:01:59.759> be

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it well well that's clever you won't be

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.389 
it well well that's clever you won't be
breaking<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.299> off<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:01.130> don't<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
breaking that off I don't know if it

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.069 
breaking that off I don't know if it
turns<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.820> anything<00:02:03.180> right<00:02:03.600> now<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.960> probably

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
turns on anything right now it probably
