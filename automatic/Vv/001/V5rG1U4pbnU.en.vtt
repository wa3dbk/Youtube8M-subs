this<00:00:34.000> way<00:00:34.329> my<00:00:34.870> weights<00:00:35.110> been<00:00:35.410> down<00:00:35.620> I've<00:00:35.920> had

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
this way my weights been down I've had

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.979 
this way my weights been down I've had
shoots<00:00:36.399> in<00:00:36.610> between<00:00:37.030> my<00:00:37.570> last<00:00:37.780> competition

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989

until<00:00:38.410> now<00:00:38.620> so<00:00:38.950> I've<00:00:39.309> just<00:00:39.370> literally<00:00:39.940> like<00:00:40.120> a

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
until now so I've just literally like a

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.420 
until now so I've just literally like a
pound<00:00:40.510> difference<00:00:40.840> to<00:00:41.320> where<00:00:41.469> I<00:00:41.739> was<00:00:42.010> on<00:00:42.040> stage

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430

knowing<00:00:43.330> that<00:00:43.660> I'm<00:00:44.350> just<00:00:44.590> doing<00:00:44.800> different

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
knowing that I'm just doing different

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.710 
knowing that I'm just doing different
things<00:00:45.310> you<00:00:45.550> know<00:00:45.670> I'm<00:00:46.150> not<00:00:46.270> training<00:00:46.600> as<00:00:46.690> much

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
things you know I'm not training as much

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.810 
things you know I'm not training as much
arms<00:00:47.470> I'm<00:00:47.770> doing<00:00:47.950> a<00:00:48.010> little<00:00:48.100> bit<00:00:48.250> lighter<00:00:48.460> reps

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
arms I'm doing a little bit lighter reps

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.200 
arms I'm doing a little bit lighter reps
a<00:00:49.000> lot<00:00:49.240> of<00:00:49.360> stretching<00:00:49.930> my<00:00:50.650> cardio<00:00:51.040> is<00:00:51.100> not<00:00:51.370> too

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
a lot of stretching my cardio is not too

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.210 
a lot of stretching my cardio is not too
much<00:00:52.570> because<00:00:53.140> I<00:00:53.380> don't<00:00:53.410> want<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.800> get<00:00:53.920> too

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
much because I don't want to get too

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.780 
much because I don't want to get too
lean<00:00:54.850> too<00:00:55.180> quick<00:00:55.740> so<00:00:56.740> I'm<00:00:56.980> basically<00:00:57.130> kind<00:00:57.670> of

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
lean too quick so I'm basically kind of

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.500 
lean too quick so I'm basically kind of
just<00:00:58.829> doing<00:00:59.829> my<00:01:00.010> training<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.579> where<00:01:01.240> I<00:01:01.270> think

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
just doing my training to where I think

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.479 
just doing my training to where I think
I<00:01:01.930> need<00:01:01.989> a<00:01:02.380> little<00:01:02.620> bit<00:01:02.739> of<00:01:02.860> improvement<00:01:02.950> I'd

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
strategy I've been following pre-contest

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.800 
strategy I've been following pre-contest
is<00:01:40.880> basically<00:01:43.689> experimenting<00:01:44.689> with

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
is basically experimenting with

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.480 
is basically experimenting with
different<00:01:45.130> carb<00:01:46.130> ranges<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.299> fat<00:01:47.659> ranges<00:01:48.490> I'm

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
different carb ranges and fat ranges I'm

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.039 
different carb ranges and fat ranges I'm
altering<00:01:49.820> my<00:01:49.939> carbs<00:01:50.240> Mike<00:01:50.420> that's<00:01:50.570> basically

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
altering my carbs Mike that's basically

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.389 
altering my carbs Mike that's basically
my<00:01:51.259> proteins<00:01:51.590> always<00:01:51.860> high<00:01:51.979> I'm<00:01:52.250> always

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
my proteins always high I'm always

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.010 
my proteins always high I'm always
eating<00:01:52.610> six<00:01:52.940> meals<00:01:53.119> every<00:01:53.390> two<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.630> two<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:53.930> a

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
eating six meals every two to two and a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.109 
eating six meals every two to two and a
half<00:01:54.110> three<00:01:54.350> hours<00:01:54.759> it's<00:01:55.759> just<00:01:55.850> different

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
half three hours it's just different

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.399 
half three hours it's just different
because<00:01:56.479> of<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.690> fact<00:01:56.720> like<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.080> said<00:01:57.259> I'm

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
because of the fact like I said I'm

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.740 
because of the fact like I said I'm
already<00:01:57.830> going<00:01:58.340> into<00:01:58.759> this<00:01:58.880> Olympia<00:01:59.360> like

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
already going into this Olympia like

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.620 
already going into this Olympia like
wait<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:01.130> know<00:02:01.250> I'm<00:02:01.399> at<00:02:01.580> my<00:02:01.759> weight<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.479> it's

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
wait you know I'm at my weight so it's

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.710 
wait you know I'm at my weight so it's
basically<00:02:03.020> monitoring<00:02:03.740> my<00:02:03.890> body<00:02:04.509> daily<00:02:05.509> to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
basically monitoring my body daily to

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.680 
basically monitoring my body daily to
weekly<00:02:05.899> basis<00:02:06.759> this<00:02:07.759> time<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.239> difference<00:02:08.360> is

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
weekly basis this time the difference is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.740 
weekly basis this time the difference is
I<00:02:08.810> can<00:02:08.840> probably<00:02:09.259> include<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:10.310> cheat<00:02:10.640> meal<00:02:10.750> once

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
I can probably include a cheat meal once

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.199 
I can probably include a cheat meal once
every<00:02:12.230> depending<00:02:12.860> on<00:02:12.980> getting<00:02:13.640> closer<00:02:13.850> up<00:02:14.090> to

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
every depending on getting closer up to

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.330 
every depending on getting closer up to
about<00:02:14.330> three<00:02:14.569> weeks<00:02:14.780> before<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.140> show<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:16.100> just

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
about three weeks before a show it just

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:24.929 
about three weeks before a show it just
helps<00:02:16.670> me<00:02:16.730> break<00:02:17.120> through<00:02:17.299> a<00:02:17.330> plateau

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.750 

this<00:02:25.269> here's<00:02:25.599> Olympia<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.170> first<00:02:26.500> anticipated

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
this here's Olympia I first anticipated

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.190 
this here's Olympia I first anticipated
123<00:02:27.760> but<00:02:28.299> I<00:02:28.329> was<00:02:28.510> once<00:02:28.659> went<00:02:28.840> through<00:02:28.930> my<00:02:29.019> last

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
123 but I was once went through my last

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.660 
123 but I was once went through my last
show<00:02:29.409> and<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.680> think<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.040> might<00:02:30.189> want<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.400> come<00:02:30.549> in

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
show and I think I might want to come in

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.459 
show and I think I might want to come in
a<00:02:30.700> bit<00:02:31.060> leaner<00:02:31.359> so<00:02:31.629> I<00:02:31.659> think<00:02:31.750> I'm<00:02:32.019> looking<00:02:32.170> at

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
a bit leaner so I think I'm looking at

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.089 
a bit leaner so I think I'm looking at
probably<00:02:32.799> about<00:02:32.890> 121<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.409> the<00:02:35.409> the

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
probably about 121 and the the

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.740 
probably about 121 and the the
difference<00:02:36.549> with<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.819> weight<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:37.299> was

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
difference with this weight is I was

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.330 
difference with this weight is I was
five<00:02:38.170> pounds<00:02:38.709> heavier

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
five pounds heavier

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.490 
five pounds heavier
where<00:02:39.459> I'm<00:02:39.579> normally<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.269> can<00:02:40.450> get<00:02:40.719> up<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:40.930> eight

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
where I'm normally I can get up to eight

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.099 
where I'm normally I can get up to eight
to<00:02:41.769> ten<00:02:42.010> pounds<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:42.609> I<00:02:43.030> like<00:02:43.659> to<00:02:43.840> kind<00:02:44.049> of

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
to ten pounds so I like to kind of

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.009 
to ten pounds so I like to kind of
maintain<00:02:44.430> five<00:02:45.430> pounds<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.180> way<00:02:46.299> I<00:02:46.329> can<00:02:46.629> it's

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
maintain five pounds that way I can it's

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.479 
maintain five pounds that way I can it's
an<00:02:47.170> easier<00:02:47.469> prep<00:02:47.709> for<00:02:47.950> me<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.159> don't<00:02:48.310> want<00:02:48.430> to

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
an easier prep for me I don't want to

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.390 
an easier prep for me I don't want to
have<00:02:48.609> to<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:49.150> know<00:02:49.290> eat<00:02:50.290> eat<00:02:50.829> eat<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.250> then

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
have to you know eat eat eat and then

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.429 
have to you know eat eat eat and then
you<00:02:51.639> know<00:02:51.730> bust<00:02:52.090> my<00:02:52.269> butt<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.629> starve<00:02:52.930> because

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
you know bust my butt and starve because

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.890 
you know bust my butt and starve because
so<00:02:53.620> I'd<00:02:53.709> rather<00:02:53.859> just<00:02:54.159> kind<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.459> keep<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.939> right

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
so I'd rather just kind of keep it right

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.229 
so I'd rather just kind of keep it right
around<00:02:56.049> you<00:02:56.470> know<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> nice<00:02:57.069> comfortable<00:02:57.760> level

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
around you know a nice comfortable level

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.330 
around you know a nice comfortable level
but<00:02:58.750> yeah<00:02:59.169> I<00:02:59.200> mean<00:02:59.379> this<00:02:59.650> time<00:02:59.889> I<00:02:59.919> was<00:03:00.129> five

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
but yeah I mean this time I was five

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.860 
but yeah I mean this time I was five
pounds<00:03:00.549> off<00:03:00.819> but<00:03:01.000> I've<00:03:01.090> been<00:03:01.239> eight<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.659> ten

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
pounds off but I've been eight to ten

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.899 
pounds off but I've been eight to ten
pounds<00:03:02.200> off<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:03.310> now<00:03:03.430> we're<00:03:03.609> looking<00:03:03.700> at

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
pounds off and and now we're looking at

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:13.010 
pounds off and and now we're looking at
between<00:03:04.120> like<00:03:04.419> 121<00:03:05.290> 123<00:03:06.069> onstage

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.320 

there<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.740> fine<00:03:13.950> line<00:03:14.100> between<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.700> bikini

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
there is a fine line between the bikini

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.430 
there is a fine line between the bikini
division<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.530> figure<00:03:16.770> division<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
division and the figure division and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.240 
division and the figure division and
fortunately<00:03:19.440> I've<00:03:19.620> been<00:03:19.770> told<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.160> do

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
fortunately I've been told that I do

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.310 
fortunately I've been told that I do
have<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.610> good<00:03:20.820> balance<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.300> feminine<00:03:21.990> and

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
have a good balance of feminine and

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.500 
have a good balance of feminine and
athleticism<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:24.090> Anna<00:03:24.300> still

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
athleticism and it's Anna still

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.870 
athleticism and it's Anna still
maintaining<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.620> curvy<00:03:26.040> shape<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.550> think<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
maintaining a curvy shape I think the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.940 
maintaining a curvy shape I think the
difference<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.270> not<00:03:27.450> coming<00:03:27.930> in<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.410> we<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
difference is not coming in so we and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.150 
difference is not coming in so we and
have<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.550> nice<00:03:29.760> layer<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.990> know<00:03:31.160> softness

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
have a nice layer of you know softness

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.190 
have a nice layer of you know softness
over<00:03:32.610> your<00:03:32.760> muscle<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.570> don't<00:03:34.200> lift<00:03:34.830> too<00:03:35.150> heavy

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
over your muscle I don't lift too heavy

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.580 
over your muscle I don't lift too heavy
it's<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.350> lot<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.590> super<00:03:37.920> sets<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.520> lot<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.590> you

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
it's a lot of super sets a lot of you

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.900 
it's a lot of super sets a lot of you
know<00:03:40.620> interval<00:03:41.520> training<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.330> lot<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:43.910> triceps

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
know interval training a lot of triceps

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.850 
know interval training a lot of triceps
and<00:03:45.240> keeping<00:03:45.570> your<00:03:45.690> heart<00:03:45.900> rate<00:03:46.080> up<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.530> in

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
and keeping your heart rate up and in

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.440 
and keeping your heart rate up and in
different<00:03:47.160> intensity<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.580> think<00:03:47.820> with<00:03:48.000> doing

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
different intensity I think with doing

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.470 
different intensity I think with doing
that<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:49.110> just<00:03:49.350> allows<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.430> not<00:03:51.060> put<00:03:51.240> on<00:03:51.330> an

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
that it just allows you to not put on an

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.650 
that it just allows you to not put on an
extra<00:03:51.780> size<00:03:52.080> I<00:03:52.620> keep<00:03:52.920> my<00:03:53.040> rest<00:03:53.280> period<00:03:53.700> short<00:03:54.060> I

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
extra size I keep my rest period short I

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.450 
extra size I keep my rest period short I
just<00:03:55.230> think<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.010> if<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.190> saw<00:03:56.310> myself

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
just think that and if I saw myself

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.220 
just think that and if I saw myself
getting<00:03:56.730> too<00:03:56.940> big<00:03:57.060> then<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.480> would<00:03:57.600> back<00:03:57.750> off<00:03:57.930> on

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
getting too big then I would back off on

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.810 
getting too big then I would back off on
the<00:03:58.440> weight<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.770> amount<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.040> weight<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.250> use<00:03:59.520> so

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
the weight the amount of weight I use so

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.690 
the weight the amount of weight I use so
I<00:04:00.000> just<00:04:00.330> always<00:04:00.510> tailor<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:01.590> know<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.740> to<00:04:02.400> look

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
I just always tailor you know to to look

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.520 
I just always tailor you know to to look
to<00:04:02.940> where<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.090> think<00:04:03.210> that<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.930> division<00:04:04.350> is

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
to where I think that the division is

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.350 
to where I think that the division is
going<00:04:04.770> I<00:04:05.160> like<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.520> maintain<00:04:05.670> fullness

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
going I like to maintain fullness

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.830 
going I like to maintain fullness
femininity<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.260> do<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.220> with<00:04:08.720> keeping<00:04:09.720> the
