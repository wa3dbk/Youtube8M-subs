00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
keep coming up so if I had to find

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.010 
keep coming up so if I had to find
something<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.729> compare<00:02:02.179> this<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.569> I<00:02:02.660> would<00:02:02.989> say

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
something to compare this to I would say

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.800 
something to compare this to I would say

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
much much darker and twisted version of

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.999 
much much darker and twisted version of
it<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.629> of<00:02:09.200> course<00:02:09.440> that's<00:02:09.590> one<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
it and of course that's one of the

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.190 
it and of course that's one of the
things<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.340> love<00:02:10.550> about<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:11.000> if<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.780> compare<00:02:12.170> it

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
that's where the problem with the series

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.620 
that's where the problem with the series
happens<00:03:26.260> as<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.340> mentioned<00:03:27.670> earlier<00:03:27.940> it's<00:03:28.420> only

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
four episodes long and that to me sucks

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.900 
four episodes long and that to me sucks

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
because I loved it so much that I

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.759 
because I loved it so much that I
watched<00:03:34.269> through<00:03:34.570> four<00:03:34.780> episodes<00:03:35.230> not<00:03:35.470> even

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
watched through four episodes not even

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.350 
watched through four episodes not even
realizing<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.549> was<00:03:36.579> over<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.120> then<00:03:37.209> when

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
realizing that it was over and then when

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.000 
realizing that it was over and then when
I<00:03:37.390> got<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.810> end<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:38.049> was<00:03:38.170> just<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:38.470> sad<00:03:38.739> I

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
I got to the end I was just so sad I

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.979 
I got to the end I was just so sad I
think<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.180> may<00:03:40.450> have<00:03:40.480> been<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.810> good

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
think that this may have been a good

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.229 
think that this may have been a good
thing<00:03:41.100> maybe<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:42.310> prevented<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.850> show<00:03:43.000> from

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
thing maybe it prevented the show from

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.430 
thing maybe it prevented the show from
being<00:03:43.450> too<00:03:43.660> drawn<00:03:43.959> out<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.290> getting

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
being too drawn out and getting

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.650 
being too drawn out and getting
repetitive<00:03:44.950> but<00:03:45.579> I<00:03:45.640> really<00:03:46.299> wish<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:46.480> I

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
repetitive but I really wish that I

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.990 
repetitive but I really wish that I
could<00:03:46.840> have<00:03:46.959> seen<00:03:47.079> more<00:03:47.489> so<00:03:48.489> with<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:48.790> being

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
could have seen more so with that being

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000 
could have seen more so with that being
said<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.450> totally<00:03:49.989> recommend<00:03:50.320> watching<00:03:50.680> this

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
said I totally recommend watching this

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.310 
said I totally recommend watching this
if<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.310> haven't<00:03:51.489> already<00:03:51.700> seen<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:53.140> only

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
if you haven't already seen it the only

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.170 
if you haven't already seen it the only
thing<00:03:53.799> that<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.040> would<00:03:54.190> say<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.519> watch<00:03:54.730> out<00:03:54.970> for

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
thing that I would say to watch out for

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.930 
thing that I would say to watch out for
is<00:03:55.480> just<00:03:56.290> remember<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.070> it<00:03:57.220> was<00:03:57.310> released<00:03:57.730> in

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
is just remember that it was released in

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.420 
is just remember that it was released in
1999<00:03:58.510> so<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.079> style<00:03:59.320> of<00:03:59.530> horror<00:03:59.860> is<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.130> lot

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
1999 so the style of horror is a lot

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.160 
1999 so the style of horror is a lot
different<00:04:00.880> from<00:04:00.970> what<00:04:01.150> people<00:04:01.630> might<00:04:01.840> be<00:04:01.959> used

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
different from what people might be used

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.259 
different from what people might be used
to<00:04:02.320> right<00:04:02.530> now<00:04:02.680> there<00:04:03.610> aren't<00:04:03.850> any<00:04:03.940> jump

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
to right now there aren't any jump

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.660 
to right now there aren't any jump
scares<00:04:04.570> there's<00:04:04.959> no<00:04:05.140> over-the-top<00:04:06.100> gore<00:04:06.400> I

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
scares there's no over-the-top gore I

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.770 
scares there's no over-the-top gore I
mean<00:04:06.820> there's<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.000> little<00:04:07.180> bit<00:04:07.269> of<00:04:07.329> gore<00:04:07.510> but

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
mean there's a little bit of gore but

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.810 
mean there's a little bit of gore but
nothing<00:04:08.530> nothing<00:04:08.680> too<00:04:08.920> crazy<00:04:09.070> so<00:04:09.459> if<00:04:09.640> you're
