00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.370
 It's just in that moment you want me. 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.460
 cinch 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.730
 he comes the 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.970
 the strong consultant is another novelty is the 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.059

 strong in mclaren who came with niki lauda 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.400
 and with the next to win the title 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.809
 was the beginning of this great part of 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.550
 mclaren 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:44.239
 from 83 to here the beginning of the great plot 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.909
 falls 84 side after the then himself 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.519
 the types of feathers and even more the jewels 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.570
 of her own 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:55.070
 but then want me to Bandstand see only 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.399
 he does not have so much concern in order to 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.160
 get off slow for a warmup lap 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.320
 will take the time that can continue the 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.960
 that it is important that you flynn while you 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.550
 Nobody can handle the pilots. 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.429
 that you have an option 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.380
 they are entitled to two sets of tires 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:14.600
 with two sets of only two tires are 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.399
 marked and trustworthy are the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.530
 each output of box 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.170
 so they have the option to choose two 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.979
 games-training on the ground machine com 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.610
 santa grip on the track he lost a 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.500
 Slow turn for those who have rain 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.810
 pouring because it goes from the stretch and the other 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.450
 To go home the way you already have. 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.040
 understood to deteriorate 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.130
 everyone in both games like that and I will 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.020
 to risk twice the one game of losing 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.969
 rhythm because you have an hour to 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.950
 work work work and is 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.170
 used by those who did not have the correct 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.350
 car even though after a single 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.350
 chance with another game to give registered 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.689
 love and success by the way he 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.840
 has left the printer box that is 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.729
 tire said he will take advantage of 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.189
 carrying the cross came out of the back and 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.509
 will take advantage of the beginning to try 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.189
 I'm even better set 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.590
 only then seek your time but 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.530
 wrote now is to do almost 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.210
 going through this is the big cheap one 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.420
 making time 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.910
 I'm there to see what happens 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.430
 moretto that always looks forward to 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.690
 I stay here for you box owner 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.760
 the young man was not in his car and dark 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.860
 who are in the same blow 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.350
 everything is still standing there in mclaren 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.100
 much agitation waiting for an exit from 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:41.240
 airton if he wins take him there 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:45.290
 favorite time of the ticket 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.870
 on the first day it appears in 26th that the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.260
 last wave on the starting grid 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.810
 he scored 29 06 technicians we'll see 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.840
 now he gets better goes with the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.420
 strong power guaranteed reliability 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.670
 it is also great to know the moment 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.360
 now pouring a winch and 7 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.760
 383 is way better than he did yesterday 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.820
 with this time of 1 and 27 love and sobe 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.070
 to the 20th position 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.590
 another important detail the time does not 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.020
 change the time of love and sex 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.160
 this is the charm of the stretch already determined 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.160
 that the fastest lane
