00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.209
 so many things touched me 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.080
 not having the means 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.870
 to accompany some people who 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.070
 are likely to have a disability 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.240
 I also think of schools as they 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.369
 are not equipped to accommodate 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.990
 some children with disabilities all full 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.939
 of things necessarily I was touched and 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.520
 I'm here because because he 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.349
 must be I think it's normal I 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.599
 just find it abnormal that all the 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.090
 world knows as soon as artists are 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.080
 present to communicate on these 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.059
 serious things 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.860
 and did you already have 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.780
 the opportunity to meet the duo that 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.610
 to pass after good on stage beings 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.379

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.440
 that it was a beautiful lesson of life 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.699
 at the same time and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.350

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.809
