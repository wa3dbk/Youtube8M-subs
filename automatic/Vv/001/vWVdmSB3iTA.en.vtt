00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.420
 new technology sloth video then want 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.300
 Let's go with the golden iphone 5 s 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.800
 Let's have our dream of meeting 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.379
 we are already ready on the right 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:20.670
 page is then the sim cards for the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.359
 nano sim card is very important and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.210
 clean with the corner beautiful pure 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.109
 Back to the device and that was it 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.769
 already 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.930
 around the proportion knob 1234 and then 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.390
 already the apple logo and off you go 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.710
 nano sim card is still said that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.600
 of course you get from a provider 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.649
 The hardcore guys can do that on themselves 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.280
 make your own 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.620
 but apple has again clearly 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.719
 we let communicate with a broken one 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.390
 device in which then a nano sim card 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.219
 is the apple store is that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.969
 one sends or whatever because 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.030
 honest then the warranty is there 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.690
 even unlocks sorry once the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.320
 language then choose country and region 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.450
 choose germany wi-fi network choose 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.680
 We do not have to set up 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.170
 absolutely we can do the iphone 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.960
 of course also connect with itunes for 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.700
 activate or even over then 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
 via our mobile internet connection 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.210
 but set even if we but here 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.580
 times such a foul voters then have 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.979
 use was the next step 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.869
 then the regulatory services are natural 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.930
 I would like to have location I would like yes 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.400
 Maps and co then use iphone 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.140
 configure ours here again 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.640
 Standard question it is a new device 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.280
 or do I have a backup somewhere? 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.979
 Fly around either online in the iCloud 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.560
 or offline at itunes on the computer or 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.189
 mac I take here just my iCloud 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.509
 backup there is something and therefore must 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.860
 I now log in to apple 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.470
 so I also to my account 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.610
 rankomme and with the connection to 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 iCloud will also be the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.780
 conditions of use are due to me 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.090
 Of course you must accept otherwise 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.240
 I do not use the device here if it is 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.979
 Several backups are always in the cloud 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.450
 account then i can give you here now 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.090
 I'll just take that one 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.190
 Last thing I did that 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.470
 get back to doing that now 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.490
 takes a few 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.590
 minutes and a reboot and then does 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.170
 it's easy with the set-up process 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.970
 again and after the restart 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.970
 we had to once again the password for 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.010
 Enter the apple id and we are in 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.260
 next step and now it works 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.070
 of course, the new fingerprint 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.380
 sensor own touch id now set up 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.300
 We have the thumb or the thumb 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.090
 finger we want to set up 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.000
 a few times up and down so that 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.680
 sensor certain picture a certain year 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.900
 once we scan completely 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.720
 if we can handle it then 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.850
 Once we move the thumb out 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.880
 different angles so you can do it too 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.880
 Well said from different angles 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.580
 then set up or activate so 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.050
 finished we are saved of course 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.320
 I can finger more later 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.760
 we do not add now and 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.160
 Now there is the security code 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.900
 which is needed again and again when 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.380
 I want to change things or after one 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.570
 reboot as additional in 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.220
 quote the security feature 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.620
 code we must enter 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.989
 and now we still want to ask if we 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.300
 our fingerprint also for 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.650
 want to use in-app purchases and yes 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.019
 That's what we want that is 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.910
 really not always that 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.280
 to type in complete passwords normally 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.450
 and there we are already in the new one 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.760
 homescreen or in the old and that starts 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.459
 download all apps again now 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.660
 and to install the beautiful we are 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.180
 The apps do not have to be redone 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.700
 to arrange but because it saved everything 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.650
 the folders as we had them and the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.330
 apps are now with and with and with 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.400
 Of course , it can take a while to download 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.500
 comes to your internet connection to the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.290
 number of apps and of course the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.480
 size of the apps yes and that was it afterwards 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.680
 we are ready to go here and there 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.170
 you have to be in some 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.970
 services register again so twitter.com 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.239
 password again give a google + 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.130
 password and and and and and that should 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.650
 then go relatively fast and afterwards 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.109
 use her new iphone as well as yours 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.880
 old normal 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.739
 that was many thanks for watching 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.739
 do it well and see you for the next video
