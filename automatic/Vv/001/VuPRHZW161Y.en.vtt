00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.379
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.240
 online school video now what 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.800
 we are going to do is remove it eliminate the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.440
 plague that has to certainly this what 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.450
 I have now what 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.710
 put a bag well and throw it out 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.710
 so you do not get my trees 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.460
 what we're going to do first is take it 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.620
 all the stove to the one so that it has left 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.000
 so it's first to attack the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.620
 illness because the program that in 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.809
 this tree on the one hand is bad cultivation 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.300
 and on the other hand disease the problem 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.449
 of this cochineal limpet is that shell 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.800
 what is impossible to me 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.140
 spray of a medicine over 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.260
 and to eliminate them because they are armored 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.980
 then the form we have two forms of 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.079
 to do it one is with an insecticide that 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.879
 correspond systemic that what it does 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.469
 is to poison the sap of the tree is 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.310
 innocuous for long the program is the 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.640
 bug or directly remove it from 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.640
 manual 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.570
 and end of the problem but there is a lot of limpet and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 you have to remove it all so we have 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.490
 to be careful with that look what 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.939
 touch now you will see my chest 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.150
 my chest hurts these are those days 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.940
 of the month 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.770
 let's water this 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.770
 and we are going to throw him with fidelity 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.270
 the longest rock in the world 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.509
 of osmosis water is worth half a liter of 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.509
 osmosis water 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.250
 the corresponding dose of with fidelity 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.670
 set 20 lgs this is against the 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.849
 cochineal the for but 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.370
 so fighting alone on the outside now look 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.650
 what I'm going to do 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.590
 see what I am going to do as I have already 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.500
 said that it is difficult to eradicate 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.239
 cochinilla the for the I do not know if it is a 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.410
 exoskeleton but the shell that 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.290
 have 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.080
 I'm going to throw here a second one half 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.080
 glass of water solution with fidelity 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.970
 ah 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.790
 yes 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.799
 and with the nylon brush 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.930
 the nylon that means all night 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.930
 only throughout the night 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.140
 I go 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.090
 to rub him the areas where he has to 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.620
 example here 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.620
 Look, we like them 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.750
 AHA 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.420
 You see, I wanted to continue, it's already here 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:09.609
 down well now with my brush 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.220
 imbued with fidelity what I am going to 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.370
 do is 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.300
 remove 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.760
 these mealybugs lapa 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.910
 and I 'm not only eliminating it but 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.819
 I am imbuing the tree of 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.799
 confirm in case I could have 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.290
 some small cochineal that I 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.180
 I escaped from sight or eggs or 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.430
 under the bark that is also a 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.549
 classic above all the cochineal 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.549
 cottony 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.280
 in this way I will eliminate all the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.280
 night and all the cochineal for 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.060
 and I'm healing and protecting the bonsai 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.520
 you have to see the performance that is 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.160
 pull out a nylon brush this you can 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.640
 do with a toothbrush not 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.980
 use and then 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.780
 although if you will have the cochineal for 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.150
 that the molars 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.680
 let's give it everywhere well that 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.010
 there is no cochineal left and if it remains 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.010
 some then drink the insecticide 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.019
 this is making the cochineal dad 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.220
 It is also used to remove it 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.220
 listerine mouthwash 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.790
 if you can use a product 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.440
 specific better and look that I have to 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.460
 be careful so that these things do not 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.460
 fall into the pond 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.450
 that by the way the pond inside 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.920
 little to which the channel of the 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.470
 pond we're going to make that too hand 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.980
 here a little job where we are going to 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.380
 put another water pump so that the 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.040
 filtration is much stronger and it does not 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.810
 accumulate waste at a good end 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.280
 Well, I think this is almost there, I do not 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.460
 I see more scale insects larvae by no 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.460
 side 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.990
 it still does not smell vinegar and oil 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.490
 the good thing also of having removed all 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.830
 the branch that I had 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.630
 is that it makes it much easier for us now 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.750
 for 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.910
 the good treatment as always 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.940
 if you liked the video probably 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.520
 did not subscribe to the channel you have there the 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.249
 social networks facebook twitter and the 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.480
 web page that is the most complete 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:33.170
 where you can find everything 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.170
 Water 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.500
 you can subscribe you must subscribe 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.169
 who liked the video that surely 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.240
 because it has been a lot of fraud but good 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.360
 you already have to do it and this tree 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:50.250
 will again make a glorious tree a 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.250
 hug and until the next video
