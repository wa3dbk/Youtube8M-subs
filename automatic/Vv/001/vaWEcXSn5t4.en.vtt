 Be early summer day, such as rising daytime temperatures even up to four of the 22 Seoul today 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.500

 In such a case, how efficiently you should match the objects is the answer to the space utilization problem 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.700
 That's it. 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:49.980
 If you look around the house, there will definitely be a dead space. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.969
 If you take advantage of these areas, you can use the same area as much as you want. 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:59.309
 Good idea to put in a small house Furniture is also popular with me 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.329
 First of all, do not spend a lot of money on things you do not use, 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.930
 It's a ghost. 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.930

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.450
 The important thing for consumers is to move the function image unit of the furniture 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.979
 Let's have a little space. 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:35.259
 Many can you have such an education for a few minutes to read a lot gotman get AIDS 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:40.330
 As the popularity of large houses is easy to grow in the small house demand for narrow spaces 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:44.350

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:49.570

 When the bed is folded out, there is a sawtooth wave. 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.710
 The sofa disorder is the space utilization by storing the bedding or the pillow. 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.860
 Raised 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:31.200
 The remaining space is a product that maximizes the number of marbles as much as possible . 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.840
 In this way, the furniture industry has practical furniture that combines various functions 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.180

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.609
 Buy furniture that is not just ready-made and that fits your desired space 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.019
 We are also increasingly writing homes. 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:12.090

 You can use it all the way to the ceiling. 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.209
 By utilizing the narrow space, the advantage of self-tell use that space 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.340

 Ppaleo will create the space so I like judging a book can take books on bookshelves 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.820

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:06.800
 I have an interior effect. 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.920

 It can be used for 12 and a lot of usages. 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:28.130

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:47.660
 Not least in the area of copper enabled moved hasigoyo think what is the sseulji 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:53.210
 The copper line looks at about 80 cm . So when you see the space 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:58.780
 If you think space is 80 cm nuggets careful if you have installed the Air gabyeok 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:03.610
 It is better to give up Aniltena space separation.

 Please tell us 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:46.360
 The most important thing to use space widely is to clean things that are not used without fuss. 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:51.460
 That's it. 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:57.010
 Frequently used items are often written where it looks good neundeyo put in a box 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:02.080
 It would be easier to find and write if you display the content 5 on the three-letter side. 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:06.250

 It is impossible to find out that our family is comfortable 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.960

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:47.690
 There is 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:52.060
 A smart idea to widen the space from furniture to household servants also changed the atmosphere
