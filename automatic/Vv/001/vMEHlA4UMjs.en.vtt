again<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.020> can<00:02:14.170> practice<00:02:14.560> any<00:02:14.740> one<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:14.950> the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
again you can practice any one of the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.920 
again you can practice any one of the
three<00:02:15.310> hinge<00:02:15.550> actions<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.480> was<00:02:16.630> horizontal

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
three hinge actions that was horizontal

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.160 
three hinge actions that was horizontal
the<00:02:17.710> longest<00:02:18.190> travel<00:02:18.610> right<00:02:18.960> what<00:02:19.960> would<00:02:20.050> be

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the longest travel right what would be

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.790 
the longest travel right what would be
the<00:02:20.290> next<00:02:20.500> longest<00:02:20.710> travel<00:02:22.350> angle<00:02:23.350> right

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
the next longest travel angle right

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.860 
the next longest travel angle right
right<00:02:24.190> there<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.580> see<00:02:24.760> now<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.450> angled

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
right there you see now that it's angled

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.730 
right there you see now that it's angled
across<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.290> line

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740

a backward motions of the hand and it's
not<00:02:37.690> one<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.900> need<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.260> employ<00:02:38.530> much<00:02:38.890> but<00:02:39.850> if

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
not one you need to employ much but if

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.810 
not one you need to employ much but if
you<00:02:40.030> do<00:02:40.210> then<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:41.350> produces<00:02:41.680> maximum<00:02:42.220> lay<00:02:42.640> back

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
you do then it produces maximum lay back

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.130 
you do then it produces maximum lay back
of<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.060> club<00:02:43.240> face<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.750> can<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.740> very<00:02:44.950> useful

all right after again pitch shot then

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.020 
all right after again pitch shot then
into<00:02:50.290> here<00:02:50.530> notice<00:02:51.160> again<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.640> club<00:02:51.850> still

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
into here notice again the club still

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.530

not blow the hands above the hands next

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.430 
not blow the hands above the hands next
phase<00:02:55.780> would<00:02:55.990> be<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.230> punch<00:02:56.440> shot<00:02:56.680> here<00:02:58.440> club

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
phase would be the punch shot here club

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.990 
phase would be the punch shot here club
is<00:02:59.620> still<00:02:59.860> not<00:03:00.070> permitted<00:03:00.460> to<00:03:00.490> go<00:03:00.580> above<00:03:00.820> the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
that shot could you see that here and

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.800 
that shot could you see that here and

follow-through which is both arms
straight<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.830> got<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.130> have<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.250> way<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.430> do

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
straight you got to have a way to do

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.460 
straight you got to have a way to do
that<00:03:15.850> there<00:03:16.810> has<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:16.990> be<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.200> bridge<00:03:17.410> between

follow through and finish and that

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.850 
follow through and finish and that
bridge<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.820> bridges<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.300> finished<00:03:22.780> swim<00:03:23.200> so

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
bridge that bridges the finished swim so

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.610 
bridge that bridges the finished swim so
now<00:03:24.130> for<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.580> first<00:03:24.760> time<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:26.200> club<00:03:26.350> is

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
now for the first time the club is

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.500 
now for the first time the club is
allowed<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.860> get<00:03:27.130> above<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.580> hands<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.420> we

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
allowed to get above the hands and we

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.000 
allowed to get above the hands and we
did<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:28.840> by<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.050> rotation<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.680> these<00:03:29.830> two

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
did that by the rotation of these two

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.970 
did that by the rotation of these two
bones<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.489> forearm<00:03:31.560> ulna<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.920> radius

bones in the forearm ulna and the radius
EA<00:03:33.610> team<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.450> again<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.360> but<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.930> can<00:03:38.050> still

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
EA team and again so but you can still

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.430 
EA team and again so but you can still
see<00:03:38.560> there<00:03:38.680> was<00:03:38.800> a<00:03:38.830> definite<00:03:39.370> hit<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:41.230> shot

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
see there was a definite hit in the shot

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.210 
see there was a definite hit in the shot
it<00:03:41.590> was<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.709> crisp

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
it was a crisp

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.930 
it was a crisp
I<00:03:42.520> was<00:03:43.330> boom<00:03:44.050> right<00:03:44.709> there<00:03:45.070> and<00:03:45.220> then<00:03:45.550> finished

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
I was boom right there and then finished

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.560 
I was boom right there and then finished
here<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:47.530> then<00:03:47.739> finally<00:03:48.239> from<00:03:49.239> there<00:03:49.450> we

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
here and then finally from there we

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.229 
here and then finally from there we
moved<00:03:49.720> into<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.989> complete<00:03:50.440> motion<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:54.239> hands

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
moved into a complete motion so hands

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.820 
moved into a complete motion so hands
above<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.630> shoulder<00:03:55.959> shaft

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
above the shoulder shaft

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.590 
above the shoulder shaft
you<00:03:57.310> know<00:03:57.400> approaching<00:03:58.060> parallel<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.510> the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
you know approaching parallel to the

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.960 
you know approaching parallel to the
ground<00:03:58.750> so<00:03:59.530> what<00:03:59.709> we<00:03:59.830> did<00:04:00.010> was<00:04:00.250> we<00:04:00.489> work<00:04:00.700> from<00:04:00.820> a

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
ground so what we did was we work from a

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.210 
ground so what we did was we work from a
chip<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.680> pitch<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.330> a<00:04:04.330> punch<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.739> punch

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
chip to a pitch to a punch to a punch

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.050 
chip to a pitch to a punch to a punch

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
with swivel to the finish motion just

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
bill and you call through impact you had

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.039 
bill and you call through impact you had
one<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.549> those<00:04:16.639> three<00:04:16.910> motions<00:04:17.090> angled

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
one of those three motions angled

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.270 
one of those three motions angled
vertical<00:04:18.650> or<00:04:18.950> horizontal<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:21.200> so<00:04:21.950> that's<00:04:22.100> what

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
vertical or horizontal so so that's what
