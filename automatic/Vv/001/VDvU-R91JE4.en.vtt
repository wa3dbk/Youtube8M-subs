00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.380
 hello today we will consider a trick 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.509
 called finger 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.439
 This is how it looks 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.999
 im grant dinka 1 2 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.999
 but accordingly there are 2 3 2 3 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.689
 3 4 3 4 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:21.800
 spectacle 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.279
 percent 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.890
 it is done like this: 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 position 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.589
 that is, to the main part 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.689
 the masses of the handle one wanted a nation 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.689
 inside experience 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.410
 but the button was closer 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 and that's such a movement 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.350
 we will try to push the handle 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.350
 yes and slot 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.670
 learning to start pushing 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.380
 continue to catch 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.250
 and also to catch 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.300
 she is 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.100
 it's usually here 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.619
 I do not think that you will have straight 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.200
 difficulties of such 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.580
 just usually 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.960
 and also remove 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.980
 Well, that is, he is a little bit of us 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.040
 percent 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 middle finger whole and descent stylus denmark and 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.640
 clamp enters 1 2 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.310
 here's the price of the possible with 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.260
 problem occurrence 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.500
 with 2 3 and other exams ie 3 2 3 3 4 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.930
 that's when you will 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.860
 here to get on here will bother you 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.960
 forefinger maybe it will 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.900
 closed position 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.900
 so that it does not interfere 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.810
 not appropriately vodka 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.160
 also bend 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.280
 To France 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.020
 does not interfere 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 that one if there are still Perez feds 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 This is how it looks 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 the concept is basically the same implementation 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.300
 that is, we are on the contrary 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.780
 forefinger hold a wave so 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.989
 aam position 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.389
 average 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.519
 how to push out 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.979
 and that is the side of yourself 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.519
 push 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.730
 but also a testament to recover 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.939
 towers he goes 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.939
 you press the outside of the palm 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.989
 lessons I say they need to be here more 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.929
 deft so to speak 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.929
 catch her 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.649
 Ars from 1 1 and 2 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.979
 also reverse 2 3 years 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.429
 because 3 4 thousand 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.309
 percent 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.039
 these are basic concepts I think 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.369
 percent and still have 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.369
 context 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.679
 Veteran Contini Taxi Services 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.849
 cartridges 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.849
 is done 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.839
 just like with other conferences we are again 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.449
 to him the proceeds in that position in which 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.369
 she was originally 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.949
 that is, girls do a little percentage 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:14.079
 more way 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.919
 than usual 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.939
 she tricks performed by him 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.569
 variations 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.639
 and getting at the beginning of the slot 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.109
 lever position 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.779
 and thus can continue 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:29.059
 motion 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.059
 percent 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.829
 Well, in principle, on this all 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.829
 in practice, good luck to all 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.409
 may it be with you
