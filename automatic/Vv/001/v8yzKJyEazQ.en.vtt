00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.879
 Do not you recognize him? That's over 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.880
 riva the best swordsman the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.759
 Gerald has always been seen north 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.269
 even more in the witcher 3 than ever 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.760
 whether on pc or konsolen the newest 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.230
 adventure of the witcher is a 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.840
 become a first class roleplaying game 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.660
 but the pc version has its own again 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.390
 very own strengths 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.000
 the graphic above all a real one 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.830
 witcher is the knew the beautiful things 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.830
 of life has always been appreciated 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:43.800
 I hope you will not return to this 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.200
 under 3 drives a lot of nice things 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.600
 especially with its lighting moods 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.550
 magic of the beautiful painting like 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.780
 Scenes on the screen 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
 who wants a breathtaking 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.390
 has the prospect of never have to search long 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 Just saddle the horse and put in one 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.100
 any heavenly direction go horse riding 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.049
 whether a cozy meadow in the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.650
 sunshine or the thriving metropolis 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.830
 novigrad something is always there to see 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.630
 in direct comparison with the ps4 shines 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.750
 the pc version with among others 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.520
 sharper textures and more foresight 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.799
 we recognize, for example, the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.409
 Forests on the mountains on the horizon 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.380
 but you have to say that the game 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.320
 even looked even better 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.500
 namely in this trailer of 2014 one 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.750
 certain downgrade has therefore visible 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.270
 place 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.630
 an eye-candy historian but three 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.910
 still and where the consoles just around 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.940
 to create 30 frames per second 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.800
 flog pc witch also with 60 or more 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.690
 there are also the great animations 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.240
 even better to the validity 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.060
 anyway if she gives the hardware 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.369
 with a really strong graphics card 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.240
 nvidia herr works can also be added 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.550
 switch 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.130
 that about the mane of our horse and 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.950
 the hair of this grab trophy 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.440
 this is much more realistic animated 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.250
 by the way also with a amd graphics card 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.509
 but then beat even more power 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.390
 Fortunately, the witcher 3 offers 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.130
 a bulging option menu with the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.840
 we play the best possible on our 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.420
 system can adjust 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.810
 For this we turn at every screw 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.000
 in up to four gradings 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.310
 for comparison here the highest 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.320
 Graphics settings for that though 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.230
 Neat raking power under the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.360
 hood and that's how it looks 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.400
 play at lowest settings 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.380
 especially the muddy 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.200
 Textures on and the sight goes 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.410
 neat down but ugly 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.330
 witcher 3 still not 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.090
 oh yes and where we were with menus 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.400
 even on the PC, the game does not always shine 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.260
 with best survey but so on 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.390
 Inventory can be with the mouse then 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.630
 but serve much more pleasant 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.610
 Another advantage of the PC version 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.769
 We can not use the consoles 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.570
 import score from the witcher 2 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.269
 about our old decisions 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.620
 take 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.570
 instead, we give an audition 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.190
 with the kaiser gerais hitherto 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.100
 adventure to protocol 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.620
 this is how we define the most important points 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.410
 but we are just answering 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.329
 five questions the interview covers long ago 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.030
 not everything we did in the witcher 2 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.799
 could do so 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.110
 pc players are allowed their savegame from the 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.269
 predecessor directly import 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.880
 that will do more than just this 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.130
 five choices though as well 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.840
 not all, for example, is everything 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.310
 under the table what we in the first 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.150
 witcher done 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.670
 still have the pc here the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.380
 most possibilities for work 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.630
 savegame has more or just the 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.440
 predecessor has not played too 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.209
 just go through the questionnaire here 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.400
 the pc version is so clear the 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.060
 most beautiful version of the witcher 3 and 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.040
 the ones with the most options but they 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.660
 not only applause but deserves 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.660
 also performs some unnecessary 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.170
 schnitzel we show in another 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.170
