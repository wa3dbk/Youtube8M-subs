this figure is excellent my only
complaint<00:01:00.910> in<00:01:01.240> the<00:01:01.660> combined<00:01:02.560> mode<00:01:02.829> of<00:01:02.980> Furth

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
complaint in the combined mode of Furth

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.880 
complaint in the combined mode of Furth
mode<00:01:03.579> is<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.600> backpack<00:01:05.199> which<00:01:05.439> is<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.590> little

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
mode is the backpack which is a little

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.469 
mode is the backpack which is a little
bit<00:01:05.979> garish<00:01:06.189> but<00:01:06.340> that<00:01:06.909> could<00:01:07.060> be<00:01:07.090> dealt<00:01:07.390> with

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
bit garish but that could be dealt with

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.080 
bit garish but that could be dealt with
and<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:08.380> weird<00:01:08.740> chest<00:01:09.130> it's<00:01:09.399> the<00:01:09.579> same<00:01:09.820> as<00:01:09.970> the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
and the weird chest it's the same as the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.240 
and the weird chest it's the same as the
original<00:01:10.210> Zhen<00:01:10.780> gets<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.170> but<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:11.890> chest

original Zhen gets you but the chest

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.429 
original Zhen gets you but the chest
kind<00:01:12.939> of<00:01:13.030> sticks<00:01:13.299> out<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.509> little<00:01:13.810> bit<00:01:13.990> too<00:01:14.170> far

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
kind of sticks out a little bit too far

zenkutsu<00:02:03.790> then<00:02:04.600> in<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.140> original<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:06.010> only

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
zenkutsu then in the original the only

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.950 
zenkutsu then in the original the only
other<00:02:06.369> difference<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.150> black<00:02:07.360> paint<00:02:07.689> with

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
other difference is the black paint with

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.109 
other difference is the black paint with
on<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.289> on<00:02:08.439> the<00:02:08.679> inside<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:09.189> the<00:02:09.250> body<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.819> in

on the on the inside of the body and in
the<00:02:10.239> armpit<00:02:10.689> and<00:02:10.899> that's<00:02:11.349> it<00:02:11.560> otherwise<00:02:12.250> they

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
the armpit and that's it otherwise they

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.699 
the armpit and that's it otherwise they
are<00:02:12.610> virtually<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:13.299> same<00:02:13.450> figure<00:02:14.019> but<00:02:14.230> there

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
are virtually the same figure but there

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.089 
are virtually the same figure but there
is<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> difference<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.939> isn't<00:02:16.500> shown<00:02:17.500> here

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
is a difference that isn't shown here

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.159 
is a difference that isn't shown here
that<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.519> can't<00:02:18.790> really<00:02:19.029> see<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.779> that<00:02:19.989> is

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:20.169 
that you can't really see and that is

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.739 
that you can't really see and that is
the<00:02:20.319> quality<00:02:21.069> of<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.430> plastic<00:02:21.669> for<00:02:22.569> some

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:22.749 
the quality of the plastic for some

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.420 
the quality of the plastic for some
reason<00:02:23.109> the<00:02:23.409> original<00:02:23.889> Zeng<00:02:24.069> gets

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
reason the original Zeng gets

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.990 
reason the original Zeng gets
feels<00:02:24.819> very<00:02:25.420> cheap<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.260> kind<00:02:26.950> of<00:02:27.010> fragile<00:02:27.370> the

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:31.719 
new one no not at all it's solid the

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.990 
new one no not at all it's solid the

only place that I can even see any

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.599 
only place that I can even see any
problems<00:02:34.659> are<00:02:35.109> in<00:02:35.349> these<00:02:35.590> shoulder<00:02:36.099> bits<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
problems are in these shoulder bits the

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.550 
problems are in these shoulder bits the
plastic<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.209> still<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.569> little<00:02:37.840> weird<00:02:38.290> and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
plastic is still a little weird and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.500 
plastic is still a little weird and
looks<00:02:38.769> warped<00:02:39.250> there<00:02:39.519> but<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.120> rest<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.390> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
looks warped there but the rest of the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.410 
looks warped there but the rest of the
figure<00:02:40.659> feels<00:02:41.049> absolutely<00:02:42.010> fine<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.549> also

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
figure feels absolutely fine I also

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.789 
figure feels absolutely fine I also
wanted<00:02:43.719> to<00:02:43.780> get<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.049> guys<00:02:44.079> a<00:02:44.230> nice<00:02:44.500> good

close-ups<00:02:45.459> on<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.969> head<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.480> can<00:02:46.569> see<00:02:46.959> the

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
close-ups on the head so you can see the

close-ups on the head so you can see the
changes

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:47.969 
changes

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.819

besides the transformation of the melon

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.470 
besides the transformation of the melon
itself<00:02:51.250> what<00:02:51.459> makes<00:02:51.639> this<00:02:51.760> henshin<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.239> little

itself what makes this henshin a little

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.140 
itself what makes this henshin a little
bit<00:02:52.569> different<00:02:52.989> is<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:54.010> fact<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.519> he's<00:02:54.909> got

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
bit different is the fact that he's got

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.110 
bit different is the fact that he's got
these<00:02:55.359> extra<00:02:55.599> bits<00:02:56.439> underneath<00:02:57.340> his<00:02:57.639> antenna

right above my finger if you don't
you're<00:03:09.040> not<00:03:09.189> going<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.400> get<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.639> melon<00:03:09.939> on

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
you're not going to get the melon on

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.209 
you're not going to get the melon on
it's<00:03:10.439> just<00:03:11.439> that<00:03:11.650> simple

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:12.219 
it's just that simple

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.949 
it's just that simple
so<00:03:12.790> plump<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.269> melon<00:03:13.540> on<00:03:14.730> pull<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:16.000> back<00:03:16.419> away

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
so plump a melon on pull the back away

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.159 
so plump a melon on pull the back away
from<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.379> figure<00:03:17.879> pull<00:03:18.879> the<00:03:19.090> front<00:03:19.359> away<00:03:19.930> from

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
from the figure pull the front away from

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.599 
from the figure pull the front away from
the<00:03:20.260> figure<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.680> fold<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.069> up<00:03:21.159> to<00:03:21.189> form<00:03:21.489> the

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
the figure and fold it up to form the

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.149 
the figure and fold it up to form the
chest<00:03:21.939> and<00:03:22.299> then<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.109> shoulder<00:03:23.319> will<00:03:23.769> flip

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
chest and then the shoulder will flip

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.360 
chest and then the shoulder will flip
over<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:25.180> head<00:03:25.620> collapse<00:03:26.620> in<00:03:26.889> upon<00:03:27.340> itself

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
over the head collapse in upon itself

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.550 
over the head collapse in upon itself
and<00:03:28.000> form<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.900> really<00:03:29.470> nifty<00:03:30.099> shoulder<00:03:30.790> pad

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
and form a really nifty shoulder pad

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.520 
and form a really nifty shoulder pad
shinsen<00:03:32.560> get<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.889> look<00:03:33.099> so<00:03:33.639> cool<00:03:34.569> and<00:03:35.049> I<00:03:35.199> like

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
shinsen get to look so cool and I like

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.890 
shinsen get to look so cool and I like
him<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.949> lot<00:03:35.979> I<00:03:36.639> think<00:03:36.940> he<00:03:37.120> actually<00:03:37.299> looks<00:03:37.750> a

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
him a lot I think he actually looks a

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.780 
him a lot I think he actually looks a
lot<00:03:38.169> better<00:03:38.440> than<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.919> original<00:03:38.949> zangetsu

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
lot better than the original zangetsu

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.309 
lot better than the original zangetsu
it's<00:03:40.720> just<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.199> extra<00:03:41.739> orange<00:03:41.979> and<00:03:42.609> the<00:03:42.669> extra

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
it's just the extra orange and the extra

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.449 
it's just the extra orange and the extra
translucent<00:03:44.319> coloring<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:44.919> plastic

translucent coloring in the plastic

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.240 
translucent coloring in the plastic
really<00:03:46.060> make<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.419> figure<00:03:46.750> pop<00:03:47.019> also<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.829> didn't

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
really make the figure pop also I didn't

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.830 
really make the figure pop also I didn't
realize<00:03:48.609> that<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:48.909> figure<00:03:49.180> needed<00:03:49.599> more

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
realize that the figure needed more

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.259 
realize that the figure needed more
