wasn't<00:03:57.900> working<00:03:58.020> see<00:03:58.500> before<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.940> would<00:04:00.090> stop

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
wasn't working see before it would stop

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.199 
wasn't working see before it would stop
this<00:04:00.540> right<00:04:00.810> there<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:02.250> wouldn't<00:04:02.610> go<00:04:02.730> down<00:04:02.760> no

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
this right there it wouldn't go down no

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.000 
this right there it wouldn't go down no
further<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:04.050> could<00:04:04.260> just<00:04:04.410> pick<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.650> up<00:04:04.830> and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010

further and I could just pick it up and
pull<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.280> up<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.700> window<00:04:05.970> would<00:04:06.120> move

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
pull it up and the window would move

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.890 
pull it up and the window would move
freely<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.959> was<00:04:07.050> off<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.230> track<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:09.720> know
