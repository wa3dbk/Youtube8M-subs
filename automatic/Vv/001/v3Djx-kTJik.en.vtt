okay so I'm gonna show you a help

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.960 
okay so I'm gonna show you a help
replace<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.240> PCV<00:00:04.020> valve<00:00:04.859> on<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.400> Subaru<00:00:05.819> Legacy

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
replace the PCV valve on a Subaru Legacy

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.790 
replace the PCV valve on a Subaru Legacy
GT<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:07.189> haven't<00:00:08.189> seen<00:00:08.400> anything<00:00:08.670> on<00:00:09.620> youtube<00:00:10.620> so

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
GT I haven't seen anything on youtube so

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.039 
GT I haven't seen anything on youtube so
when<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.519> make<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.880> for<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.360> people<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.780> don't

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
when I make it for the people that don't

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.640 
when I make it for the people that don't
know<00:00:13.340> how<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.230> basically<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.590> is

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
know how to do it so basically this is

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.150 
know how to do it so basically this is
the<00:00:16.940> well<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.119> go<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.050> dealer<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.710> goes

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
the well you go to a dealer this goes

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.609 
the well you go to a dealer this goes
for<00:00:20.430> around<00:00:20.670> 40<00:00:21.090> bucks<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:23.990> this<00:00:24.990> comes<00:00:25.260> as<00:00:25.470> an

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
for around 40 bucks and this comes as an

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.029 
for around 40 bucks and this comes as an
assembly<00:00:26.150> so<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.359> PCV<00:00:27.689> valve<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.410> actually<00:00:28.980> in

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
assembly so the PCV valve is actually in

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.429 
assembly so the PCV valve is actually in
here<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.210> can<00:00:30.420> see<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.810> metal<00:00:31.109> thing

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
here so you can see this metal thing

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.959 
here so you can see this metal thing
here<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.989> PCB<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> screws<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
here so the PCB see is the screws I

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.770 
here so the PCB see is the screws I
don't<00:00:36.450> if<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:37.260> screw<00:00:37.710> inside<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.820> just

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
don't if it's screw inside here or just

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.840 
don't if it's screw inside here or just
push<00:00:40.050> inside<00:00:40.469> by<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.489> small

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
push inside by this just this small

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.779 
push inside by this just this small
metal<00:00:42.210> thing<00:00:42.540> right<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.579> mean<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.700> not

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
metal thing right here I mean it's not

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.700 
metal thing right here I mean it's not
recommended<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.450> take<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.440> mean

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
recommended you take it out but I mean

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.580 
recommended you take it out but I mean
when<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.100> buy<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.930> PCB<00:00:48.930> from<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> dealer

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
when you buy the a a PCB from the dealer

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920 
when you buy the a a PCB from the dealer
you<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.160> assembly<00:00:50.670> which<00:00:51.510> comes<00:00:51.840> very

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you get this assembly which comes very

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.520 
you get this assembly which comes very
much

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
much

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.459 
much
three<00:00:53.010> hoses<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.660> looks<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.050> here

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
three hoses and what it looks like here

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
three hoses and what it looks like here
a<00:00:55.500> sensor<00:00:56.100> oops<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.449> some<00:00:57.840> sort<00:00:59.149> there<00:01:00.199> okay<00:01:01.199> so

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
a sensor oops on some sort there okay so

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.399 
a sensor oops on some sort there okay so
you<00:01:02.489> gotta<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.940> pretty<00:01:03.300> easy<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:04.049> no<00:01:04.229> big

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
you gotta is pretty easy it's no big

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.670 
you gotta is pretty easy it's no big
deal<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.739> gotta<00:01:05.100> struggle<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.119> a

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
deal you just gotta struggle with this a

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.109 
deal you just gotta struggle with this a
clamps<00:01:07.680> right<00:01:07.860> here<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.310> goes<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> hose

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
clamps right here it goes in this hose

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.359 
clamps right here it goes in this hose
but<00:01:09.530> other<00:01:10.530> than<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.159> pretty

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
but other than that it's pretty

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.490 
but other than that it's pretty
straightforward

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
straightforward

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.490 
straightforward
so<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.460> remove<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.210> intercooler<00:01:15.720> like

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
so you just remove the intercooler like

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.859 
so you just remove the intercooler like
this<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.950> you're<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> access<00:01:18.420> you're

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
this and you're going to access you're

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.539 
this and you're going to access you're
going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> work<00:01:19.259> from<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> passenger<00:01:20.310> side

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
going to work from the passenger side

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.130 
going to work from the passenger side
from<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:22.430> okay<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> then<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.840> look<00:01:24.990> from

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
from here okay and then if you look from

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.260 
from here okay and then if you look from
the<00:01:25.229> passenger<00:01:25.650> side<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.430> PCB<00:01:26.970> well<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the passenger side the PCB well I

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.270 
the passenger side the PCB well I
already<00:01:27.840> installed<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.890> new<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:31.280> it's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
already installed the new one so it's

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.920 
already installed the new one so it's
writer<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:34.500> shiny<00:01:35.009> new<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:36.060> plastic<00:01:36.689> pane

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
writer that shiny new my plastic pane

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.980 
writer that shiny new my plastic pane
right<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.220> basically<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.270> PCV<00:01:39.659> valves

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
right there so basically a PCV valves

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.109 
right there so basically a PCV valves
going<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.320> look<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
going to look like that so it's going to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.569 
going to look like that so it's going to
be<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.960> house<00:01:43.229> gonna<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:43.770> towards

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
be like this one house gonna go towards

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.310 
be like this one house gonna go towards
the<00:01:44.729> middle<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> engine<00:01:45.659> which<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:45.930> this

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the middle of the engine which is this

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.249 
the middle of the engine which is this
little<00:01:46.710> hose<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.329> your<00:01:48.329> host<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> same

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
little hose and your host with the same

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.370 
little hose and your host with the same
source<00:01:49.530> pinnacle<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.610> way<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.380> basically

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
source pinnacle this way I basically

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.580 
source pinnacle this way I basically
goes<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.890> way<00:01:53.130> PCV<00:01:53.880> valve<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.409> gotta

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
goes this way PCV valve so it's gotta

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.780 
goes this way PCV valve so it's gotta
undo<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.790> clamp<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.810> small<00:01:58.259> hose<00:01:58.790> just

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
undo that clamp on the small hose just

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.539 
undo that clamp on the small hose just
add<00:02:00.030> either<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> unplug<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
add either then you can unplug the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.510 
add either then you can unplug the
sensor<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.829> plug<00:02:05.369> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
sensor from this one I'm just plug it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.300 
sensor from this one I'm just plug it
and<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:07.110> should<00:02:07.320> come<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.740> right<00:02:07.950> out<00:02:08.099> like

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
and you should come just right out like

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.980 
and you should come just right out like
that

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
that

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.870 
that
and<00:02:10.440> then<00:02:10.710> you<00:02:10.800> put<00:02:10.980> it<00:02:11.070> back<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.250> spritzer

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
and then you put it back in spritzer

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.710 
and then you put it back in spritzer
forward<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.080> only<00:02:13.320> difficulty<00:02:13.950> will<00:02:14.220> be

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
forward so the only difficulty will be

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.000 
forward so the only difficulty will be
to<00:02:15.720> get<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:17.630> this<00:02:18.630> clamp<00:02:18.990> from<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.380> from<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
to get a this clamp from the from the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.770 
to get a this clamp from the from the
bottom<00:02:22.640> these<00:02:23.640> little<00:02:23.940> clamps<00:02:24.120> are<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.510> really

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
bottom these little clamps are is really

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.620 
bottom these little clamps are is really
tricky<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.200> get<00:02:25.410> out<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.120> one<00:02:27.330> was

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
tricky to get out so this one was

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.380 
tricky to get out so this one was
supposed<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.470> two<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:29.040> one<00:02:29.250> goes<00:02:29.520> on<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
supposed to have two so one goes on the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.930 
supposed to have two so one goes on the
top<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.530> thick<00:02:31.830> hose<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.760> then

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
top of that of the thick hose and then

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.240 
top of that of the thick hose and then
the<00:02:33.150> other<00:02:33.270> one<00:02:33.420> goes<00:02:33.570> on<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.780> bottom<00:02:33.990> on<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
the other one goes on the bottom on the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.490 
the other one goes on the bottom on the
new<00:02:35.490> PCB<00:02:36.060> assembly<00:02:36.510> going<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.780> get<00:02:36.960> one<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.410> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
new PCB assembly going to get one on the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500 
new PCB assembly going to get one on the
top<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:38.550> don't<00:02:38.730> need<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.910> worry<00:02:39.090> about<00:02:39.150> that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
top you don't need to worry about that

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.320 
top you don't need to worry about that
and<00:02:40.410> for<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.800> bottom<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.520> took<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.060> out

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
and for the bottom I just took this out

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.480 
and for the bottom I just took this out
I'm<00:02:43.110> putting<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.340> screw<00:02:45.410> another<00:02:46.410> Club<00:02:47.160> that

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
I'm putting a screw another Club that

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.040 
I'm putting a screw another Club that
the<00:02:47.730> one<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.150> screwing<00:02:48.720> with<00:02:48.990> a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
the one that you screwing with a

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.580 
the one that you screwing with a
screwdriver<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:50.540> that's<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.930> mean<00:02:52.110> order

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
screwdriver and that's it I mean order

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.040 
screwdriver and that's it I mean order
that's<00:02:52.800> pretty<00:02:53.250> straightforward<00:02:53.490> so<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.300> can

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
that's pretty straightforward so I can

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.710 
that's pretty straightforward so I can
show<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:55.710> so<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.030> main<00:02:57.270> PCB

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
show you here so this is the main PCB

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.740 
show you here so this is the main PCB
valve<00:02:58.080> between<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:59.820> take<00:03:00.030> house<00:03:00.210> cost<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
valve between that take house cost the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.590 
valve between that take house cost the
flat<00:03:01.200> top<00:03:01.410> Ranger<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.300> small

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
flat top Ranger and you have a small

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.160 
flat top Ranger and you have a small
hose<00:03:03.840> goes<00:03:04.620> over<00:03:04.890> here<00:03:05.660> letter<00:03:06.660> clamp<00:03:06.990> this

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
hose goes over here letter clamp this

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.490 
hose goes over here letter clamp this
one<00:03:07.520> either<00:03:08.520> one<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.150> really<00:03:09.390> inside<00:03:09.870> there<00:03:10.170> so

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
one either one is really inside there so

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.220 
one either one is really inside there so
I<00:03:10.740> mean<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.580> really<00:03:11.730> see<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.930> goes<00:03:13.200> from

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
I mean you can really see it goes from

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.850 
I mean you can really see it goes from
here<00:03:15.110> there<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:17.400> makes<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.150> smooth<00:03:18.390> turn

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
here there and just makes a smooth turn

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.990 
here there and just makes a smooth turn
if<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:19.920> see<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.370> White<00:03:20.610> Fang<00:03:20.880> breather<00:03:23.000> with

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
if you see that White Fang breather with

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.390 
if you see that White Fang breather with
a<00:03:24.060> clamp<00:03:24.420> that's<00:03:26.000> this<00:03:27.000> black<00:03:27.360> thing<00:03:28.160> which<00:03:29.160> on

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
a clamp that's this black thing which on

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.460 
a clamp that's this black thing which on
a<00:03:29.430> new<00:03:29.670> one<00:03:29.850> comes<00:03:30.060> white<00:03:30.390> so<00:03:30.810> that's<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.320> little

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
a new one comes white so that's a little

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.170 
a new one comes white so that's a little
different<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:33.050> whether<00:03:34.050> that's<00:03:34.260> good<00:03:34.560> well

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
different so whether that's good well

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.270 
different so whether that's good well
the<00:03:36.180> reason<00:03:36.540> I'm<00:03:36.660> changing<00:03:37.080> this<00:03:37.320> is<00:03:37.650> was<00:03:37.980> I

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
the reason I'm changing this is was I

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.480 
the reason I'm changing this is was I
had<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> blown<00:03:39.540> well<00:03:39.960> not<00:03:40.350> really<00:03:40.560> blown<00:03:40.890> by<00:03:41.100> had

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
had a blown well not really blown by had

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.460 
had a blown well not really blown by had
a<00:03:41.520> leak<00:03:41.820> on<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.450> passenger<00:03:43.970> gasket<00:03:44.970> for<00:03:45.240> the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
a leak on the passenger gasket for the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.070 
a leak on the passenger gasket for the
valve<00:03:46.470> cover<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.940> mechanic<00:03:48.450> told<00:03:48.780> me<00:03:48.900> that

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
valve cover so the mechanic told me that

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.040 
valve cover so the mechanic told me that
I<00:03:49.190> had<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.220> replace<00:03:50.520> it<00:03:50.790> because<00:03:50.910> probably<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
I had to replace it because probably the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.050 
I had to replace it because probably the
PCB<00:03:52.500> was<00:03:52.710> stuck<00:03:53.040> but<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.910> isn't<00:03:55.550> it<00:03:56.550> rattles

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
PCB was stuck but it isn't it rattles

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.450 
PCB was stuck but it isn't it rattles
just<00:03:57.300> a<00:03:57.420> little<00:03:57.780> bit<00:03:57.960> nobody's<00:03:58.890> not<00:03:59.190> really

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
just a little bit nobody's not really

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.600 
just a little bit nobody's not really
stuck<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.000> PC<00:04:00.570> being<00:04:00.780> here<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.370> probably<00:04:02.370> well

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
stuck the PC being here so probably well

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.640 
stuck the PC being here so probably well
my<00:04:02.760> car<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.120> almost<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.630> hundred<00:04:03.780> sixty<00:04:04.410> a

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
my car is almost a hundred sixty a

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.340 
my car is almost a hundred sixty a
hundred<00:04:04.800> sixty<00:04:05.550> thousand<00:04:05.910> miles

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
hundred sixty thousand miles

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.780 
hundred sixty thousand miles
so<00:04:07.350> probably<00:04:07.710> was<00:04:07.890> route<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.340> casket<00:04:08.700> was

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
so probably was route the casket was

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.440 
so probably was route the casket was
getting<00:04:09.090> old

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
getting old

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.500 
getting old
and<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:09.990> know<00:04:10.140> dry<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.830> I<00:04:11.100> just<00:04:12.060> replaced<00:04:12.360> it

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
and you know dry so I just replaced it

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.990 
and you know dry so I just replaced it
just<00:04:12.690> in<00:04:12.780> case<00:04:12.990> I<00:04:13.290> went<00:04:14.040> do<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.280> myself<00:04:14.430> because

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
just in case I went do it myself because

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.700 
just in case I went do it myself because
I'm<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.240> kind<00:04:15.420> of<00:04:15.450> want<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.750> charge<00:04:15.990> me<00:04:16.020> too<00:04:16.560> much

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:16.710 
I'm a kind of want to charge me too much

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.520 
I'm a kind of want to charge me too much
money<00:04:16.950> for<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.690> so<00:04:18.690> order<00:04:19.049> does<00:04:19.200> should<00:04:19.440> be

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
money for this so order does should be

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.460 
money for this so order does should be
good<00:04:19.710> so<00:04:19.950> these<00:04:20.850> are<00:04:21.060> 2005<00:04:21.720> through<00:04:22.020> legacy<00:04:22.590> GT

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
good so these are 2005 through legacy GT

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.110 
good so these are 2005 through legacy GT
I<00:04:23.500> guess<00:04:24.190> that's<00:04:24.400> called<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.700> same<00:04:24.850> for<00:04:25.060> the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
I guess that's called the same for the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.750 
I guess that's called the same for the
same<00:04:25.300> engine<00:04:25.690> on<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.080> on<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:27.010> outback<00:04:27.430> I'm

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
same engine on the on the outback I'm

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.270 
same engine on the on the outback I'm
