00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.549
 of words or data today as you see 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.650
 for the title I bring you a beautiful new 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.090
 I had not done wraps in a long time 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.730
 and is that a good in April had a 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.199
 small problem with the clips speaks to us 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.199
 in April I had a little problems with 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.790
 with the kits he had recorded and so 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.560
 you never have but I hope to get 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.989
 a day with this and another pack that I'm going to 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.989
 record shortly and that's it 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.420
 what is unbearable used 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.190
 I 'm dying and then I'm going to try 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.250
 finish soon to suffer less and 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.410
 Also to wind me too well 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.790
 that the first book I read in May was 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.470
 study in scarlet arthur conan 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.450
 I doyle a book that I liked very much 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.590
 I think 24 14 and a half the truth is that 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.690
 it's a book that surprised me a lot 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.240
 I really want to read something of 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.830
 Sherlock or some tender story a 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.810
 whole flan because having heard some 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.370
 adaptations in English for the school 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.100
 that the whole way of telling the 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.020
 events is like a cold fist not 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.810
 you find the events are resolved 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.520
 the case assignments and little else but 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.960
 obviously it's a classic also happens 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 a little bit what not with the idols by 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.590
 example of agatha christie is that that 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.630
 teach a lot to tell the facts and little 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.180
 more but in particular in the subject 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.070
 party that deepening is more 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.290
 well scarce more than in other books that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.790
 read 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.280
 Now I'm very happy 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.300
 I liked it a lot and I hope to read more books 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.920
 of Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock and everything and 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.010
 the truth is that I loved watson 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.880
 I did not know I believe the real watson of 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.160
 these stories and I loved it 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.960
 know her thanks to this book the 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.640
 next reading was a total and 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.770
 complete exception was the final lesson 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.930
 the third and last part of the trilogy 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.500
 the weavers of destinations the first 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.110
 I liked the book, I still do not know, I do not know 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.850
 how to explain it is a book that does very 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.490
 confusing for me first thing because when 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.490
 the store of previous books and what 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.289
 second because it seemed to me that 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.780
 the author has to finish some 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.489
 forms the book and has left but has not 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.319
 could then leave by the end 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.060
 the end for nothing clear that it is not that 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.560
 can you understand or find a 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.239
 meaning after having done the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.310
 Reading the book is like you've wanted 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.019
 do something epic that has not been 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.610
 the novel was badly structured and bad 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.230
 written because it was like the truth that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.540
 he called with his very well although he recognizes 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.220
 but it was like for example they spoke 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.950
 of one character and another that had not 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.019
 seen throughout the trilogy will repeat like this 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.819
 it is like that who already like but if you never 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.830
 you have really known or I have 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.720
 very bad memory or come on I know that we 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.489
 you have known because some were 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.769
 good the story of two worlds 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.110
 different you do not know in a world like you 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.090
 you know not about things so jr 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.069
 my next reading was the fake side 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.600
 of sally greene that is a prequel one 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.850
 very short novel as you see just 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.190
 It has 50 pages that goes to just before 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.530
 of the dark side and he has published the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.480
 last month the great ocean editorial 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.569
 expensive and the truth is that it has 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.140
 liked a lot has a lot of depth and 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.560
 they develop the characters very well 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.300
 Some 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.700
 that appear later on the dark side and 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.010
 on the wild side of this trilogy and 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.390
 sending this little book to read 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.780
 novel because he has been able to know 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.780
 best 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.040
 The next reading that I made was a 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.160
 dangerous game of marin you one of 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.710
 the news of maya last month of 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.360
 May because it is possible that this video 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.860
 is being in July and thanks 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.260
 it's a book that I quite liked maybe 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.060
 it made me a bit heavy a bit by 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.530
 under some parts but I liked it a lot 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.920
 talks a bit about the ins and outs of 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.300
 fashion and a murder and good things that 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.500
 happen around her and the time is that 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.700
 is very good because the truth is that 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.110
 it's very good I think it 's very 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.000
 structured very well elaborated 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.430
 any I did not imagine was going to be 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.160
 he the murderer not until the end and now 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.710
 it's great how it relates to all the 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.180
 author, I liked it a lot 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.700
 I really liked the books these 3 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.569
 thriller narrated or written by authors 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.609
 and Nordic authors who have a way 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.349
 peculiar to what I told you in this 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.239
 with study in scarlet to those authors 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.239
 action a peculiar record form 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:13.060
 is that it is very cold I think it is quite 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.530
 cold but still yes they try 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.259
 present also the characters 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.850
 developed well that we sometimes like 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.620
 the cinema I think you will like it and 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.840
 also it is very interesting to see it 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.419
 Well, all the ins and outs of fashion 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.340
 of the catwalks of the models because 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.020
 have to go through what I do not feel 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.460
 that today you will see so many noises on the street 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.680
 but what 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.780
 have the window view because if not and 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.759
 they are under my pot window 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.440
 he wants to talk and it's a book they eat 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.970
 other film lovers and more like 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.530
 this type of Nordic authors the 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.000
 penultimate reading that I did in the month of 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.039
 May was I wish you were here from 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.300
 french mira reads is a book that the 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.550
 I really liked it, I liked it 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.229
 very much but six thousand there is an author 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.789
 that I quite like with this book the 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.590
 truth is that they were because it has caused me 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.599
 I loved this book is not so much 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.729
 of youthful and I think because good more 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:59.560
 that nothing the protagonists are rather 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.330
 adults are not 30 years old 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.470
 very good story very moving that 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.180
 So it has good writing 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.650
 particular of francesc miralles is a 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.320
 writing that I think is very 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.599
 nice but it's also pretty 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.789
 mysterious you will pose all the time 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.650
 unknowns that poses new situation 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.870
 it's a bit like your two little realistic 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.150
 credible but then have your explanation and 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.740
 they were therefore credible at the end like this 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.860
 how good it seems to me a very novel 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.080
 original very good very emotional and that 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.699
 Of course, love and what 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.110
 important that is for people like that 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.090
 how good is a reading of the mind 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.030
 incredible I loved it in the case of 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.040
 the best reading of the month so I'll tell you 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.290
 I recommend a lot and the last book of 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.360
 month is the end of 118 street declares 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.520
 cuts is a book that I highly recommend 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.990
 read because good apart from that I think that 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.760
 everybody because you already know the 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.970
 author is a very young girl who has 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.160
 18 19 years is written wonderfully this 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.120
 book is worth reading just for 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.610
 how do you write 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.080
 It seems incredible and a talent 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.880
 wonderful not that such a person 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.340
 young can write also and 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.050
 get excited and move both inside and 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.720
 is what it is at the end of 18th Street a 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.670
 book that moves you that thrills you and that 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.430
 captivates you the bad of this story is 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.840
 that may be a bit controversial 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.160
 because it deals with some issues a little 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.790
 dedicated as for example the 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.790
 prostitution 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:21.389
 but removing that also bothers in 

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:23.759
 Absolute have given me the beginning to the end 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:28.249
 but the good thing is that I like it 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.249
 I really liked this book and I already tell you 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.220
 enjoying prose and the 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.360
 narrative of each cuts and well this is 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.520
 everything for today I hope you liked it 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.200
 much the video that good because they have 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.880
 liked the readings that I have taught you 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.680
 remember that in the comments you can 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.630
 leave me what you want about these 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.730
 books you liked if you did not or if the 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.320
 you will have read if you want to read them too 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.120
 are the information booth all the 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.940
 links to my profiles on the networks 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.540
 social and nothing we see a blunder the 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.540
 new video
