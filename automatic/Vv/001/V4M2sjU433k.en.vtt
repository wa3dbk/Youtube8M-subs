00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello everyone welcome to another program 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.020
 of playcast and this time we're going to 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.740
 see what is inside here and what 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.480
 It is what it is 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.920
 I'm going to show you some dolls that 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.290
 they will be very good for us 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.290
 dolls that are these four bis 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.140
 and well, what we are going to see today is 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.880
 a little doll that came out in the kiosks and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.090
 that comes in handy to complement 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.500
 our dolls and they are urbis no 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.720
 I know if you remember the firm ones are 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 dolls that started to come out 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.590
 a few years in the opening more or less 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.840
 more than 10 years ago, they have enough 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.910
 time that they are dolls that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.680
 the intelligent dolls interacted 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.989
 in which you could feed them 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.210
 that you could talk to them and the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.860
 doll was like learning and every 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.720
 each time I was taking the different one 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.970
 personality and there were different 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.010
 colors and also recently have taken 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.540
 a reissue in which are already more 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.430
 digital and more modern but this 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.140
 doll we will see in another show today 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.600
 I'm going to teach these that are here 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.489
 stuck and why because they are very 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.050
 interesting to play with our 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.890
 dolls because they are urbis 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.960
 in little one these little dolls came out 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.420
 in the kiosks and at a price that were 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.110
 350 I do not know if there will still be some or not 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.390
 and they are like soft rubber band that 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.630
 you can pachorra and deform 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.580
 they are how I go they do as well as if 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.260
 had the fluid inside this kind of 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.540
 dolls that you can choose them that have 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.050
 come out a lot there are many who are like 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.670
 of monsters and things like that whatever 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.020
 be careful that inside they have as a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.310
 liquid as we start to squeeze them 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.810
 much to bite children can be 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.990
 spoil and I the truth that I do not know is the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.690
 liquid inside will be good or not 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.880
 I imagine that not good, well, these 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.930
 dolls came six models 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.880
 once it was this orange fury 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.270
 we have the orange furby with the eyes 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.780
 oranges 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.980
 then and also what extremadura there was 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.039
 we had also 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.039
 the purple 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.530
 it's purple whole with eyes too 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.360
 moraditos 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.680
 it sounds like a little sticky if it's 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.280
 when we are somewhere 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.319
 are left with a little bit like glued 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:28.400
 what else do we have this here 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.999
 which is already the colors the little hair is 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.769
 Rosita but what is the rest of the 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:36.650
 body be what are the little ears and 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:40.730
 little feet are quotes and eyes 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.909
 but then the rabito and the eye shadow 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.700
 is in a good abode if you look at the 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.530
 detail on the top this 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.319
 triangulito from here this little one 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.389
 here black that was the sensor with which 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.599
 the furby hated your movements or what 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:58.250
 what you did and then you could do it 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.069
 tickle and feed him but hey 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.150
 that I will not teach with the other let's see 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.290
 what more colors do we have 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.319
 here we have another color more 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.109
 what is orange 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.829
 This is how it happens with this one here 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.959
 has three colors orange pelito the 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.439
 Eyes the legs and the little ears in 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.659
 celestial and then the little hair the little branch in 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.220
 yellow and the umbrella also in 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.400
 yellow 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.970
 we have another one 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.670
 that this is back to the ready this 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.209
 it's all blue and the eyes too 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.209
 blue 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.790
 and the last one I have here 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.310
 is this that is this time of two 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.750
 colors one of three colors is also 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.780
 the little white hair is the little ears 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.670
 eyes and legs in blue milestone and 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.180
 then the shadow and the hairs in 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.790
 yellow is more or less is very similar 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.690
 to this but with the little hair another color and 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.690
 the shade of another tone 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.980
 for example these two if they have all 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.560
 very similar colors 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.860
 Well, these are the six models 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.070
 that they took out of furbi that are three of 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.870
 plain colors and three colors 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.169
 combined 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.300
 and they are very cool then they came with some 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.460
 instructions inside stating that 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.680
 They are not recommended for children under 3 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.419
 years because they have small pieces and 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.400
 clear you can swallow imagine the 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.139
 children who are so small have love 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.520
 of things can be distributed is 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.560
 Very easy for this to be a rubber band 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.199
 very soft part not and now we are going to 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.330
 see how I told you that it comes very well 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.770
 for the size of our dolls by 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.060
 example if I take it here 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.930
 in queens 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.199
 if you notice, it comes in perfect size 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.540
 to play with the dolls with the 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:05.110
 doll 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.890
 I can also catch a talk 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.890
 I have here 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.540
 raise her arms and that she does not 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.540
 be ours articulated like the other 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.990
 that falls, take it well walk 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.990
 Oh 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.980
 wants to catch 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.980
 the wig 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.480
 It also comes in handy for the size of 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.460
 our blinds because we have to do 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.190
 some trick so I can take it 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.650
 because by not bending your arms do not 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.320
 take well that another doll we can catch 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.710
 to do well for example one of 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.430
 our monster high 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:59.150
 for franchise and we also put the 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:02.720
 little raven does not like the furby baby 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.900
 It does not have very clear what she's 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.900
 football 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.200
 Well, we can do like that and take 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.200
 as well 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.650
 to the future and to play for nancy to 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.449
 a boat as well because 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.430
 vans have now taken them out in more 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.660
 sizes there is a larger size there is 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.060
 a smaller size but good 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:28.210
 It also comes very well to our 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.370
 Nancy to play you also have a 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.620
 accompaniment team good as well as 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.870
 you can see the furbi come very well 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.010
 for any kind of dolls that 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.650
 let's have it with the 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.449
 Accompaniment perfectly 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.340
 well then until today's program 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.169
 Today I showed you some dolls that 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.150
 we can find the kiosks that 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.650
 better we could think that they are ugly or 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.180
 they do not go with us anymore but if 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.310
 we do not think they can come in very well for 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.990
 accompany our dolls like these 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.610
 dolls there are many more 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.460
 the issue is going through the kiosks 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.660
 and look because these were three and a half 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.610
 but there are also from one euro 2 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.100
 euros different dolls that if we go 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.050
 looking for them we can use them to play with 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.840
 the rest of the toys because nothing that we 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.410
 we see here in play that kas the channel to 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.410
 play with the dolls
