00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
switchover from analogue digital is

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.720 
switchover from analogue digital is
based<00:00:26.140> on<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.439> fact<00:00:26.680> that<00:00:26.770> the<00:00:26.919> FCC<00:00:27.099> raised

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
based on the fact that the FCC raised

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.999 
based on the fact that the FCC raised
over<00:00:27.939> 19<00:00:28.540> billion<00:00:28.779> dollars<00:00:29.230> selling<00:00:29.800> the

industry<00:00:32.110> this<00:00:32.950> then<00:00:33.280> mandated<00:00:33.880> the<00:00:33.910> TV

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
industry this then mandated the TV

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.670 
industry this then mandated the TV
industry<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.870> start<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.320> digital

unfortunately<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.860> changeover<00:00:39.399> has<00:00:39.579> been

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
unfortunately the changeover has been

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.639 
unfortunately the changeover has been
fraught<00:00:40.090> with<00:00:40.120> challenges<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:41.469> I'm<00:00:41.620> sure

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
fraught with challenges now I'm sure

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.380 
fraught with challenges now I'm sure
that<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:42.160> FCC<00:00:42.280> would<00:00:42.789> do<00:00:42.969> it<00:00:43.059> a<00:00:43.120> little

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
that the FCC would do it a little

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.939 
that the FCC would do it a little
differently<00:00:43.929> if<00:00:44.199> they<00:00:44.379> could<00:00:44.530> get<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.679> do-over

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
differently if they could get a do-over

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.099 
differently if they could get a do-over
but<00:00:45.489> we<00:00:45.609> all<00:00:45.789> know<00:00:45.969> that<00:00:45.999> this<00:00:46.300> is<00:00:46.480> not<00:00:46.749> going

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
but we all know that this is not going

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.770 
but we all know that this is not going
to<00:00:47.199> happen<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.640> what<00:00:48.909> we<00:00:49.149> need<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.359> know<00:00:49.510> in

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
to happen so what we need to know in

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.479 
to happen so what we need to know in
order<00:00:49.839> to<00:00:50.019> understand<00:00:50.499> a<00:00:50.559> transition<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.280> how

order to understand a transition and how

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.310 
order to understand a transition and how
it<00:00:51.640> affects<00:00:51.940> us<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.300> what<00:00:52.780> can<00:00:52.960> we<00:00:53.079> do<00:00:53.289> for

or<00:01:59.789> you<00:01:59.940> will<00:02:00.060> also<00:02:00.210> need<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.539> converter<00:02:00.780> box<00:02:01.170> as

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
or you will also need a converter box as

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.490 
or you will also need a converter box as
well<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.940> reason<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.600> converter<00:02:03.960> box<00:02:04.229> is

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
well the reason for the converter box is

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.810 
well the reason for the converter box is
so<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.920> digital<00:02:05.100> signal<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.789> be

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
so that the digital signal can be

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.999 
so that the digital signal can be
converted<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.660> an<00:02:06.840> analog<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:07.890> can

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
converted into an analog so that it can

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.910 
converted into an analog so that it can
