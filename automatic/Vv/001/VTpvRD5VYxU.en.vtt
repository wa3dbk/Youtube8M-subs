00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.050 
well because it has a silky finish I
highly<00:02:25.950> suggest<00:02:26.280> those<00:02:26.700> silky<00:02:27.239> or<00:02:28.140> satiny

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
highly suggest those silky or satiny

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.400 
highly suggest those silky or satiny
scarf<00:02:30.060> I'm<00:02:30.510> pretty<00:02:30.780> sure<00:02:30.959> it's<00:02:31.110> made<00:02:31.260> of

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
scarf I'm pretty sure it's made of

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.120 
scarf I'm pretty sure it's made of
polyester<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.519> feels<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:33.000> Sun<00:02:34.130> and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
polyester but it just feels like Sun and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.620 
polyester but it just feels like Sun and
I<00:02:35.250> tie<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.910> that's<00:02:36.209> it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
I tie it and that's it

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.190 
I tie it and that's it
I<00:02:36.690> would<00:02:36.870> did<00:02:37.110> leave<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.040> overnight<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:39.200> think

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
I would did leave it overnight I think

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.520 
I would did leave it overnight I think
an<00:02:40.320> hour<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:41.070> really<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:42.060> good<00:02:42.630> method<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:43.380> if

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
an hour is really a good method like if

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.290 
an hour is really a good method like if
you're<00:02:43.739> in<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.010> rush<00:02:44.250> somewhere<00:02:44.670> an<00:02:44.760> hour<00:02:44.970> I

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
you're in a rush somewhere an hour I

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.509 
you're in a rush somewhere an hour I
want<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.660> try<00:02:45.870> with<00:02:45.930> 15<00:02:46.440> minutes<00:02:46.739> seven<00:02:46.980> try<00:02:47.130> 15

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
want to try with 15 minutes seven try 15

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.000 
want to try with 15 minutes seven try 15
minutes<00:02:47.790> yet<00:02:48.000> that's<00:02:48.420> my<00:02:48.630> next<00:02:48.930> thing<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.410> think

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
minutes yet that's my next thing I think

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.910 
minutes yet that's my next thing I think
it<00:02:50.160> would<00:02:50.310> work<00:02:50.550> with<00:02:50.760> 15<00:02:51.150> minutes<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.769> can

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
it would work with 15 minutes so you can

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.380 
it would work with 15 minutes so you can
try<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.310> out<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.519> let<00:02:53.790> me<00:02:53.820> know<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.209> you've

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
try that out and let me know if you've

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.660 
try that out and let me know if you've
tried<00:02:54.660> using<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.410> with<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> 15<00:02:56.370> minute<00:02:56.640> time

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
tried using this with a 15 minute time

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.880 
tried using this with a 15 minute time
frame<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.810> how<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.200> worked<00:02:58.380> out<00:02:58.560> for<00:02:58.800> you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
frame and how that worked out for you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.300 
frame and how that worked out for you
but<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.970> slept<00:03:00.269> on<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:00.660> overnight<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.650> that's

but I slept on not overnight and that's

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.949 
but I slept on not overnight and that's
what<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.610> looks<00:03:02.790> like<00:03:02.970> I'm<00:03:03.209> gonna<00:03:03.510> leave<00:03:03.750> the
