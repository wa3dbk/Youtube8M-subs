00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
still trying to figure out like the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.700 
still trying to figure out like the
screen<00:01:57.149> still<00:01:57.509> seems<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.320> small

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
screen still seems like a little small

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
screen still seems like a little small
like<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.549> can't<00:01:59.790> really<00:01:59.880> tell<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:00.659> me

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
like you can't really tell but for me

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.990 
like you can't really tell but for me
the<00:02:01.439> font<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> lot<00:02:02.219> smaller<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.640> i<00:02:02.850> think

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the font is a lot smaller and i think

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.190 
the font is a lot smaller and i think
it's<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.299> i<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> bigger<00:02:03.810> screen

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's just because i have a bigger screen

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.839 
it's just because i have a bigger screen
um<00:02:05.009> i<00:02:05.969> don't<00:02:06.270> know<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:07.409> i<00:02:07.920> will<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.429> fiddling

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849

it's<00:04:35.190> pretty<00:04:35.310> big<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.729> think<00:04:35.940> it's<00:04:36.530> it's<00:04:37.530> 15<00:04:38.160> the

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
it's pretty big I think it's it's 15 the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.050 
it's pretty big I think it's it's 15 the
screens<00:04:38.940> 15<00:04:39.510> inches<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.590> it's<00:04:41.550> about<00:04:41.790> eight

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
screens 15 inches and it's about eight

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.560 
screens 15 inches and it's about eight
pounds<00:04:42.390> i<00:04:42.810> think<00:04:42.840> so<00:04:43.289> it's<00:04:43.470> pretty<00:04:43.710> heavy<00:04:44.010> um

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
pounds i think so it's pretty heavy um

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.450 
pounds i think so it's pretty heavy um
but<00:04:45.570> it's<00:04:45.870> definitely<00:04:46.110> worth<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.620> price<00:04:46.770> so

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
but it's definitely worth the price so

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.300 
but it's definitely worth the price so
