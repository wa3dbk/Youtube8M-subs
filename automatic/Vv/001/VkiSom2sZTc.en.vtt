00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
I think Britain could do better I think

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.460 
I think Britain could do better I think
we<00:02:17.470> see<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.190> here<00:02:18.519> is<00:02:18.870> stamped<00:02:19.870> this

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
we see this this here is stamped this

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.310 
we see this this here is stamped this
this<00:02:20.769> stamp<00:02:21.190> as<00:02:21.370> well<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.510> actually<00:02:22.690> even

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
this stamp as well and actually even

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.750 
this stamp as well and actually even
this<00:02:23.470> writing<00:02:23.860> here<00:02:24.070> brightening<00:02:24.550> it's

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
this writing here brightening it's

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.180 
this writing here brightening it's
machined<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:25.870> they<00:02:26.380> kind<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.650> manage<00:02:26.980> to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
machined in but they kind of manage to

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.240 
machined in but they kind of manage to
give<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.519> this<00:02:27.640> kind<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.030> stamp<00:02:28.420> feeling<00:02:29.250> into

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
give it this kind of stamp feeling into

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.350 
give it this kind of stamp feeling into
it<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.610> think<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:33.340> they<00:02:33.610> machine<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.120> clasp

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
it so I think if they machine the clasp

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.890 
it so I think if they machine the clasp
just<00:02:34.980> reduce<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.130> radius<00:02:36.580> here<00:02:37.000> make<00:02:37.870> it

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
just reduce this radius here make it

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.040 
just reduce this radius here make it
