 appreciate the truth is very interesting 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.540
 practically your computer acquires the 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.350
 aspect of what the system is 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.850

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.849
 start earlier 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.349
 if they want to access the same thing so that 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.400
 we also access the same to the 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.740
 documents let's say 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.600
 or we want to do the recycling paper or 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.900
 the same music if you have saved 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.419
 some music 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.330
 save in the folder here if we want to go 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.759
 to home that is where the discs appear 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.550
 and they have more partitions 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:30.990

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.820
 has data also data disc 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.340
 in short since it changes practically 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.969
 to the operating system to the version 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.829
