 hi people from youtube in this video 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.260
 tutorial I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.050
 feints and tricks with the keyboard in the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.810
 fish 2015 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.970
 first we go to configuration that is 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.300
 on the desktop with the root folder 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.269
 after 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.949
 now we go to where it says keyboard and we 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.949
 we direct to the bottom right 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.910
 surely you are going to have this 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.300
 Empty should avoid the keys like 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.300
 I have 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.570
 Once this is done we can do the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.570
 friendly and tricks 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.179
 the first soul is going to be the bicycle is 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.129
 the simplest just have to 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.129
 squeeze and ch repetitively 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.680
 the second nobody is the blackboard of the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.840
 ball to do we will keep it to 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.800
 squeeze ours and then let's go 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.800
 forward 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.320
 the third product is the roulette for 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.780
 this we have to keep the 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.780
 letter j and then go forward 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.450
 the quarter mesh is the ink for this 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.680
 we will keep pressing to the letter h and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.680
 let's go forward 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.480
 the fifth to marquez is the footprint of 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.180
 ball this probably all 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.980
 know but I still leave the only thing 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.730
 you have to do is apply the keys 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.730
 walk 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.030
 Now let's practice the hat for 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.670
 this the only thing we do is accept two 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.670
 times the number two key to do it 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.579
 the last threat of hitting the bow is 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.560
 very simple just press the key and 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:42.000
 before he hits the ball 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.000
 we press the letter x 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.719
 well that was all I hope you have 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.719
 served goodbye
