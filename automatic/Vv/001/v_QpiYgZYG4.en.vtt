00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.100
 we take out the anti shock protection 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.100
 our sleeve 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.960
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.560
 raise a little bit the sticker that we 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.830
 comes on top of the protector 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.110
 anti blows to have it ready and start 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.369
 to paste it before pasting the first thing 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.740
 we have to do is clean with the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.620
 suede that comes to us in the in the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.829
 protective 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.989
 the screen to avoid so that we are 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.850
 any speck of dust and we were 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.840
 Creates bubbles when placing 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.850
 our protector 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.990
 Then what we have to do is 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.330
 place the top part first and 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.440
 when we believe that it is well stuck in 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.440
 a correct position 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.970
 we put some pressure 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.420
 once done a little pressure we see 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.200
 how the screen saver will stick 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.200
 without any problem 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.700
 and then with the small spatula or 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.670
 small little carton that gives us 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.259
 the article we are going to go squeezing little to 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.210
 little doing a little bit of pressure like 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.570
 you see in the video 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.240
 and at the same time with the other hand go 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.300
 gradually removing the plastic that 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.940
 covers our anti shock protector 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.310
 little by little we will get it to go 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.170
 sticking our protector to the screen 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.659
 of our device without creating any 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.659
 kind of bubbles like you see in the video 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.399
 when we are reaching the end there will be 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.850
 to completely remove the plastic for 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.869
 to be able to paste it at all and with very much 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.840
 watch out 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.239
 we are stretching all possible 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.190
 bubbles that may appear in a 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.180
 last moment out is 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.629
 guaranteed that these bubbles 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.440
 they will disappear because it is a great product 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.060
 and of good quality 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.980
 finally the only thing that we have to 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.710
 to do is remove a thin protective layer 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.180
 transparent green color that we 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.610
 comes in the product so that 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.600
 keep the quality better and do not come 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.470
 damaged this anti hit shield 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.470
 medically 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.100
 once we are in this thin layer of 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.050
 green color we can see how 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.430
 we get that we have the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.580
 screen protector completely 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.680
 placed and in a correct way if you 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.300
 you fix the anti-shock protector well 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.050
 completely placed in a 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.850
 correct way and prepared for use 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.000

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.380
 screen in a fast and cheap way you 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.380
