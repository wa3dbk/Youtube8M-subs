00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.830
 That's the final solution for us 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.910
 very big problem we can for 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.940
 concerned stop work only preventively 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.240
 That's why we have to stop there 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.370
 to build consistent protection that is 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.870
 every week or every 14 days 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.980
 phytophthora infestans inject contrast 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.440
 the exciter of the herb and tuber blight 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.050
 is the worst enemy of the world 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 potato in europe go about 15 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.560
 percent of the potato harvest through the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.600
 Late blight lost 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.250
 the annual costs are due 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.710
 harvest losses and plant protection 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.190
 expenses will be incurred on more 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.930
 estimated as a billion euros 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.880
 phytophthora is a mushroom or too 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.799
 algae fungus in particular at 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.740
 damp warm weather fast-paced 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.990
 disseminated from latent 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.090
 infected seed tubers grows pathogens 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.579
 in the stalk up and attacks the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.049
 Potato herb become the mushroom spore 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.049
 carried on by rain and wind 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.999
 The farmers are left with nothing else 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.929
 left over as a pesticide 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:51.209
 deploy 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.330
 in conventional and integrated 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:56.410
 cultivation 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.520
 double with different politics we 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:03.660
 depending on there a bit with the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.490
 with the length of the growth together from 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.800
 the effect of the so-called rows 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.470
 closed or worse 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.170
 or bitterness as soon as the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.920
 touch potatoes in a row because then 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.800
 the contact as is given to stop the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.650
 they are the ones after that 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.290
 species can be five sprit tongues there 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.650
 but also depending on the variety 19 and 12 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.850
 estimates are the gray tuber blight 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.410
 partly comes through though 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.000
 the root or over the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.150
 Tuber is brought along we can 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.459
 but just above on the as 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.500
 above-ground protect and clearly goes 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.080
 unfortunately not the exciter yet 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.790
 resistance to pesticides 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.040
 must have occurred a resistance 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.720
 management has to be made 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.770
 Now try with every injection 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.870
 try somewhere else 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.959
 also to use the active ingredient 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.480
 somehow attacks the exciter differently 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.430
 so we do not stop and resident 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.510
 come here to clean up afterwards 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.510
 no longer under control 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.400
 Mexican sweet 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.669
 scientist of the university 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.690
 wageningen explore for some 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.690
 years a promising one 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.539
 possibility of phytophthora permanently and 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:42.680
 to combat sustainably 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:44.300
 the team is project is the goods always 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.130
 Scientists are following one 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.750
 so-called cis no approach 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.909
 that means they work with you 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.949
 genetic engineering methods but they 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.789
 use only hereditary material 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.789
 potatoes 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:09.229
 unfortunately it will be if you are in the 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.050
 conventional breeding wild potato 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.520
 cross with common potato varieties 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.000
 First of all the good taste and 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.400
 lost other properties 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.110
 over many regressions these must 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:40.390
 Back in the potato one bred 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:42.130
 Become a permanent resistance 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.980
 The scientists are watching 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.030
 very exactly if the used 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.560
 Resistance genes may be of 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.340
 phytophthora overcome again 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:06:03.300
 were 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:06:09.070
 he cures the monitors much sven the 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:12.250
 infected by one of the things that 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:16.030
 The present deck is has become 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.790
 overcome example daughter in the lab 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.830
 Resistance checks are made every 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.350
 Year will lead to an infected person 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.010
 Fields collected and cultures thereof 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.010
 created
