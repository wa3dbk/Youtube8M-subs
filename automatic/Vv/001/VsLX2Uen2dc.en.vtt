00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:05.979
Three to go! In what has been a truly dramatic
world championship. Is Vettel going to spoil

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.249
Hamilton's party? Hamilton's got a bunch of
traffic ahead of him, there is some it, the

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:15.090
Force India, get out of the way! Because they're
coming through! And Hamilton's gone wide!

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.590
Oh my goodness me, Vettel is now right with
him! 2 to go, Hamilton has forced his way

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.291
through, here comes Kubica and he passes,
ha! He passes Vettel, that's delayed Vettel

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.980
a little bit. And Kubica is... Well it's a
bit naughty. Kubica's unlapped himself.He's

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.250
a lap down he's unlapping himself, he would
argue he's entitled to do that. Hamilton let's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.809
him through. So- he's gone wide! Hamilton's
lost it! Oh my goodness me!! Vettel's taken

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.969
the place! And that could cost Hamilton the
world championship! It's now raining hard,

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.010
and that means Glock is going to be in trouble!
He's in 4th place and with just 2 laps to

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.010
go, the question now is can Timo Glock, in
the Toyota, keep it on the island? If he cannot,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.910
then Hamilton might have a chance of getting
the title back at the moment 6th will not

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:10.810
do it for him. Can you believe it? Right now,
it's all down to whether Glock can handle

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.080
the rain- let's look at Glock's sector times
- they're fine! Sector 1 is fine! Hamilton is

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.230
not going to the championship right now! If
it doesn't rain harder it's all about Glock

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.760
now, or can he get back at Vettel? And he's
held up there behind the Honda. Well, he's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.330
got nothing to lose now, Hamilton, in many
ways. I mean, he'll be monitoring the Glock

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.260
situation. He just doesn't seem to have any
grip even though he has the right tires on.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.410
Vettel is driving away from him! And we're
entering the last lap shortly; Race leader

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.390
Felipe Massa has just started the last lap.
It's all about whether Hamilton wants it,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.590
whether he feels he can get back on the tail.
The frustration must be colossal. He can see

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.490
the back of that Toro Rosso and that is the
situation. Hamilton and Massa would be tied

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.820
on points but by virtue of the extra win from
Massa it would give the Brazilian driver the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.820
world championship and only one lap remains.
Glock's sector times are perfectly healthy

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.820
on the dry tire, he's doing fine, and the
championship is slipping away from Lewis Hamilton.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.340
Right, Glock's done a 1.28 but he's 15 seconds
clear of them! So Glock can tip-toe around

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.530
the last lap and get the job done. Hamilton
then, has got to have a major attack on Vettel,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.610
has he got the pace to do that? And of course
Vettel is powered by the Ferrari engine so

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.750
he is highly motivated and you can see that
the back of Vettel's car swirling away- Hamilton

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.160
just doesn't seem to have the pace when it
matters. He needs 5th or better! To win the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.980
world championship he is currently 6th and
he runs one of whoa. Late on the braking,

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.980
he just needs now some luck to intervene I
said in the beginning it would come down to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.290
luck and that's exactly what's happening he
had it all under control in the dry conditions

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.430
and in these conditions, it's all about these
last few corners now. We're expecting Massa

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.980
anytime now, he comes through, to claim his
6th victory of the season. He has done everything

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.600
he needed to do. We wait now to find out who
will be the world champion of 2008. Can Hamilton

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.980
do anything? Can he run it up the inside of
Vettel? Only a few corners to go now, and

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.540
DESPERATION starts to creep in.. for Lewis
Hamilton.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.560
Raikkonen's 3rd. and uh, is that- is that Glock? is that Glock going slowly? It is, that's Glock!!

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.860
Oh my goodness me! Hamilton's back in position
again, a million - a hundred thousand local

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.240
hearts, sink in the grandstands. It's handed
the place back to Hamilton! He comes through,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.569
and if I'm absolutely right, I'm sure he is
going to claim 5th place, which is all he

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.560
needs to do to become *YES!* the 2008 Formula
1 world champion! Lewis Hamilton! And you

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.300
will, well, the Ferrari boys are celebrating.They
both think they won, but Ferrari are wrong.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.700
They are absolutely wrong. You're wrong guys.
Hamilton's finished 5th, and Lewis, the father

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.709
has just realized that he celebrated a little
too early. And Nicole Scherzinger, the girlfriend

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.599
of Lewis Hamilton, hugs Aki Hintsa, his head
doctor. You will never see a more dramatic

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.469
conclusion to any motor race, let alone a
grand prix than that. And the result of it

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:25.410
all. Is that, in the most harum scarum way
possible, he doesn't make it easy for himself

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.240
does he? Lewis Hamilton.. is the World Champion.
Unbelievable.
