creating<00:01:13.549> a<00:01:13.670> hybrid<00:01:14.030> world<00:01:14.530> now<00:01:15.530> what's

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
creating a hybrid world now what's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.529 
creating a hybrid world now what's
awesome<00:01:15.920> about<00:01:16.280> using<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.729> hybrid<00:01:16.909> setup<00:01:17.390> is

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
awesome about using a hybrid setup is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.840 
awesome about using a hybrid setup is
that<00:01:17.689> you<00:01:17.780> can<00:01:17.960> use<00:01:18.470> your<00:01:18.619> existing<00:01:19.250> stands

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
that you can use your existing stands

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.389 
that you can use your existing stands
and<00:01:20.030> just<00:01:20.509> buy<00:01:21.020> rack<00:01:21.289> pieces<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.829> fit<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.220> them

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
and just buy rack pieces to fit to them

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:23.710 
and just buy rack pieces to fit to them
you<00:01:22.520> don't<00:01:22.610> have<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:22.939> go<00:01:23.030> out<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.180> buy<00:01:23.479> an

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
you don't have to go out and buy an

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.620 
you don't have to go out and buy an
entire<00:01:24.080> rack<00:01:24.380> set<00:01:24.649> up<00:01:24.770> now<00:01:25.429> I've<00:01:25.909> got<00:01:26.149> my<00:01:26.330> Tom's

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
entire rack set up now I've got my Tom's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.870 
entire rack set up now I've got my Tom's
in<00:01:26.899> the<00:01:27.170> primary<00:01:28.039> configuration<00:01:28.670> of<00:01:28.789> eight

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
in the primary configuration of eight

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.370 
in the primary configuration of eight
ten<00:01:29.060> twelve<00:01:29.330> right<00:01:29.479> across<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.929> front<00:01:30.049> and

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
ten twelve right across the front and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.380 
ten twelve right across the front and
let's<00:01:31.130> have<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.340> look<00:01:31.579> at<00:01:31.789> how<00:01:31.909> I<00:01:31.939> was<00:01:32.060> able<00:01:32.270> to

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
let's have a look at how I was able to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.419 
let's have a look at how I was able to
keep<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.720> symbols<00:01:33.049> in<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.380> exact<00:01:33.740> same<00:01:34.159> order

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
keep the symbols in the exact same order

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.749 
keep the symbols in the exact same order
so<00:01:35.079> let's<00:01:36.079> have<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.229> look<00:01:36.380> at<00:01:36.470> our<00:01:36.530> core<00:01:36.920> we<00:01:37.579> got

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
so let's have a look at our core we got

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.539 
so let's have a look at our core we got
eight<00:01:38.000> ten<00:01:38.360> twelve<00:01:38.689> rack<00:01:38.960> toms<00:01:39.549> fourteen
