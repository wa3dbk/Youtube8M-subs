what we're going to do is fill that with

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.049 
what we're going to do is fill that with
about<00:00:33.620> three<00:00:33.920> inches<00:00:34.129> of<00:00:34.309> sand<00:00:34.489> and<00:00:35.769> water<00:00:37.059> and

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
about three inches of sand and water and

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.689 
about three inches of sand and water and
that<00:00:38.420> way<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:38.720> will<00:00:38.809> stick<00:00:39.140> for<00:00:39.440> us<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:39.800> we<00:00:40.550> can

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
that way it will stick for us and we can

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.850 
that way it will stick for us and we can
actually<00:00:41.000> pull<00:00:41.239> this<00:00:41.390> off<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.809> carve<00:00:42.019> it<00:00:42.110> so

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
actually pull this off and carve it so

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.200 
actually pull this off and carve it so
we're<00:00:42.980> going<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.129> do<00:00:43.250> is<00:00:43.370> fill<00:00:43.640> this<00:00:43.790> all<00:00:43.970> up

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
we're going to do is fill this all up

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.260 
we're going to do is fill this all up
take<00:00:44.870> it<00:00:45.019> off<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:45.409> then<00:00:45.770> carve<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.180> now

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
take it off and then carve it so now

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.729 
take it off and then carve it so now
we've<00:00:47.449> got<00:00:47.570> three<00:00:47.750> inches<00:00:47.989> of<00:00:48.170> sand<00:00:48.320> in<00:00:48.559> there

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
we've got three inches of sand in there

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.520 
we've got three inches of sand in there
just<00:00:49.219> about<00:00:49.460> here<00:00:50.230> we're<00:00:51.230> going<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.379> add

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
just about here we're going to add

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.819 
just about here we're going to add
enough<00:00:51.739> water<00:00:52.039> to<00:00:52.309> this<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:53.000> flood<00:00:53.359> it<00:00:53.510> all

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
enough water to this to flood it all

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.340 
enough water to this to flood it all
that<00:00:54.829> way<00:00:55.010> there's<00:00:55.579> no<00:00:55.910> dry<00:00:56.570> sand<00:00:56.989> in<00:00:57.170> there

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
that way there's no dry sand in there

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.610 
that way there's no dry sand in there
and<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:58.370> swirl<00:00:58.579> it<00:00:58.760> around<00:00:59.320> make<00:01:00.320> sure<00:01:00.500> that

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
and you swirl it around make sure that

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.799 
and you swirl it around make sure that
it's<00:01:00.739> all<00:01:00.890> mixed<00:01:01.039> up<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.640> water<00:01:01.879> gets<00:01:02.539> all

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
it's all mixed up so the water gets all

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.509 
it's all mixed up so the water gets all
the<00:01:02.989> way<00:01:03.079> through<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:03.440> if<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:03.890> find<00:01:04.129> any<00:01:04.280> rocks

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
the way through it if you find any rocks

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.880 
the way through it if you find any rocks
or<00:01:04.699> anything<00:01:04.910> throw<00:01:05.330> them<00:01:05.420> outside<00:01:05.710> so<00:01:06.710> long

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
or anything throw them outside so long

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.889 
or anything throw them outside so long
as<00:01:07.039> there's<00:01:07.220> water<00:01:07.490> on<00:01:07.640> top<00:01:08.000> of<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.330> sand<00:01:08.600> all

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
as there's water on top of the sand all

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.359 
as there's water on top of the sand all
the<00:01:09.080> time<00:01:09.259> you're<00:01:09.410> filling<00:01:09.649> this<00:01:09.710> up<00:01:09.920> it's

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
the time you're filling this up it's

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.249 
the time you're filling this up it's
going<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.700> work<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.660> what<00:01:11.750> we<00:01:11.840> want<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.110> do

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
going to work so what we want to do

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.770 
going to work so what we want to do
first<00:01:13.009> layer<00:01:13.250> with<00:01:13.490> sand<00:01:13.820> then<00:01:14.240> water

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
first layer with sand then water

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.290 
first layer with sand then water
second<00:01:15.380> layer<00:01:15.560> is<00:01:15.950> going<00:01:16.160> to<00:01:16.250> be<00:01:16.369> water<00:01:16.640> base

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
second layer is going to be water base

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.510 
second layer is going to be water base
and<00:01:17.660> so<00:01:18.560> we're<00:01:18.649> going<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.800> put<00:01:19.009> in<00:01:19.099> some<00:01:19.280> water

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
and so we're going to put in some water

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.820 
and so we're going to put in some water
in<00:01:19.729> there<00:01:20.050> we're<00:01:21.050> going<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.229> add<00:01:21.380> some<00:01:21.649> of<00:01:21.740> the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
in there we're going to add some of the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.870 
in there we're going to add some of the
sand<00:01:22.130> here<00:01:23.259> we<00:01:24.259> add<00:01:24.440> in<00:01:24.619> a<00:01:24.709> couple<00:01:25.039> three

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
sand here we add in a couple three

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.080 
sand here we add in a couple three
inches<00:01:26.149> again<00:01:27.250> any<00:01:28.250> time<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:28.610> start<00:01:28.670> getting

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
inches again any time you start getting

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.370 
inches again any time you start getting
the<00:01:29.149> sand<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.509> stick<00:01:29.720> up<00:01:29.869> above<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.259> water

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
the sand to stick up above the water

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.389 
the sand to stick up above the water
probably<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> good<00:01:31.520> time<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:31.819> swirl<00:01:33.099> you<00:01:34.099> swirl

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
probably a good time to swirl you swirl

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.979 
probably a good time to swirl you swirl
that<00:01:34.580> again<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.149> make<00:01:35.300> sure<00:01:35.330> there's<00:01:35.690> water<00:01:35.810> on

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:35.989 
that again to make sure there's water on

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:38.199 
that again to make sure there's water on
top<00:01:36.259> of<00:01:36.410> all<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.679> sand<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.160> then<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.060> keep

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
top of all the sand and then just keep

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.540 
top of all the sand and then just keep
doing<00:01:38.509> that<00:01:38.630> until<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:39.080> get<00:01:39.200> fall<00:01:39.489> and<00:01:40.489> that's

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
doing that until you get fall and that's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.600 
doing that until you get fall and that's
only<00:01:40.789> a<00:01:40.910> few<00:01:41.090> layers

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.930 

just<00:01:47.610> water<00:01:47.910> sand<00:01:48.540> swirl<00:01:49.050> water<00:01:49.950> sand<00:01:50.490> swirl

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
just water sand swirl water sand swirl

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.710 
just water sand swirl water sand swirl
that's<00:01:51.720> all<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.110> got<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.410> do<00:01:53.450> got<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.570> make

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that's all you got to do got to make

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.270 
that's all you got to do got to make
sure<00:01:54.840> there's<00:01:55.050> water<00:01:55.080> on<00:01:55.380> top<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.010> sand

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
sure there's water on top of the sand

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.870 
sure there's water on top of the sand
and<00:01:56.570> it'll<00:01:57.570> all<00:01:57.720> drain<00:01:57.930> through<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:58.730> make<00:01:59.730> it

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and it'll all drain through and make it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.370 
and it'll all drain through and make it
work<00:02:00.620> and<00:02:01.620> a<00:02:01.770> little<00:02:02.010> bit<00:02:02.130> more<00:02:02.310> water<00:02:06.380> fill

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
work and a little bit more water fill

bucket pulling this bucket off there's

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.900 
bucket pulling this bucket off there's
the<00:02:28.470> difference<00:02:28.830> between<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.370> five-year-old

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
the difference between a five-year-old

the difference between a five-year-old
and<00:02:30.209> Arnold<00:02:30.480> Schwarzenegger<00:02:30.990> if<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.680> don't

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
have this bucket cleaned off at the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.730 
have this bucket cleaned off at the
bottom<00:02:33.180> you've<00:02:33.990> got<00:02:34.110> an<00:02:34.230> inch<00:02:34.380> around<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
bottom you've got an inch around the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.800 
bottom you've got an inch around the
bottom<00:02:35.130> it'll<00:02:35.700> be<00:02:35.790> almost<00:02:36.000> impossible<00:02:36.720> to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
bottom it'll be almost impossible to

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.110 
bottom it'll be almost impossible to
lift<00:02:36.959> up<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.860> all<00:02:38.040> clean<00:02:38.340> comes<00:02:38.730> off<00:02:38.880> real

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
lift up it's all clean comes off real

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.320 
lift up it's all clean comes off real
easy<00:02:39.300> okay<00:02:40.340> now<00:02:41.340> we're<00:02:41.940> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.120> make<00:02:42.300> a

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
easy okay now we're going to make a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.949 
easy okay now we're going to make a
groove<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> top<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:44.670> bucket<00:02:44.959> we're

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
groove in the top of the bucket we're

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.080 
groove in the top of the bucket we're
going<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.140> put<00:02:46.320> water<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.740> this<00:02:46.890> groove<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
going to put water in this groove the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.090 
going to put water in this groove the
water<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.750> going<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.959> slide<00:02:49.290> down<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.560> plastic

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
water is going to slide down the plastic

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.759 
water is going to slide down the plastic
makes<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.519> lot<00:02:50.730> easier<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.180> pull<00:02:51.330> up<00:02:54.560> get<00:02:55.560> that

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
makes a lot easier to pull up get that

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:56.870 
makes a lot easier to pull up get that
cleaned<00:02:56.010> out<00:02:56.130> you're<00:02:56.280> trying<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.550> get<00:02:56.670> right

cleaned out you're trying to get right
to<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.180> plastic<00:02:57.660> here<00:02:57.840> all<00:02:58.830> right<00:02:58.980> now<00:02:59.130> we<00:02:59.190> add

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
to the plastic here all right now we add

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.060 
to the plastic here all right now we add
water<00:02:59.700> into<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.380> enough<00:03:01.380> water<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.860> flood

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
water into that enough water to flood

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.009 
water into that enough water to flood
this<00:03:02.220> whole<00:03:02.400> thing<00:03:02.640> we<00:03:03.269> tap<00:03:03.540> on<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.900> in

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
this whole thing we tap on it in

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.170 
this whole thing we tap on it in
opposite<00:03:04.440> sides<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.550> jiggle<00:03:05.880> it's<00:03:05.970> just<00:03:06.090> a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
opposite sides and a jiggle it's just a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.449 
opposite sides and a jiggle it's just a
little<00:03:06.330> bit<00:03:06.570> make<00:03:07.380> sure<00:03:07.530> your<00:03:07.680> handles<00:03:08.040> up<00:03:08.220> and

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
little bit make sure your handles up and

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.210 
little bit make sure your handles up and
pull<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.150> up<00:03:09.530> check<00:03:10.530> make<00:03:10.739> sure<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.040> good

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
pull this up check make sure it's good

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.440 
pull this up check make sure it's good
let<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> water<00:03:12.300> drain<00:03:12.570> out<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.780> little<00:03:12.959> bit

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
let the water drain out a little bit

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.580 
let the water drain out a little bit
as<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.230> water<00:03:15.410> drains<00:03:15.709> out<00:03:15.920> pull<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.610> on<00:03:16.790> up

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
as the water drains out pull this on up

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.860 
as the water drains out pull this on up
okay<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:19.160> little<00:03:19.459> bit<00:03:19.610> of<00:03:19.730> crack<00:03:20.420> off<00:03:20.629> here

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
okay a little bit of crack off here

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.580 
okay a little bit of crack off here
that's<00:03:21.080> okay

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
that's okay

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.559 
that's okay
that's<00:03:22.099> just<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.370> thin<00:03:22.580> layer<00:03:22.610> that's<00:03:23.330> only

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
that's just a thin layer that's only

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.270 
that's just a thin layer that's only
because<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.080> sticks<00:03:24.349> to<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.560> plastic<00:03:25.069> when<00:03:25.160> it

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
because it sticks to the plastic when it

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.650 
because it sticks to the plastic when it
comes<00:03:25.430> up<00:03:25.610> it's<00:03:25.760> wider<00:03:25.970> here<00:03:26.300> than<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.510> is<00:03:26.599> here

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
comes up it's wider here than it is here

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.680 
comes up it's wider here than it is here
so<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.440> breaks<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.800> when<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.010> comes<00:03:28.190> out<00:03:28.660> now<00:03:29.660> I

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
so it breaks it when it comes out now I

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.690 
so it breaks it when it comes out now I
need<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.200> tube<00:03:30.970> from<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.120> tube<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:33.700> we're

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
need a tube from you tube and we're

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.220 
need a tube from you tube and we're
going<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:34.910> make<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:37.330> castle<00:03:38.330> taller<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:39.019> go<00:03:39.140> on

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
going to make a castle taller to go on

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.990 
going to make a castle taller to go on
top<00:03:39.410> that<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:39.800> we<00:03:39.890> just<00:03:40.099> use<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.250> five-gallon<00:03:40.849> or

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
top that so we just use a five-gallon or

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.720 
top that so we just use a five-gallon or
a<00:03:41.030> plastic<00:03:41.599> pipe<00:03:42.019> here<00:03:42.290> just<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:42.980> PVC<00:03:43.280> pasty

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
a plastic pipe here just a PVC pasty

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.170 
a plastic pipe here just a PVC pasty
pipe

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
pipe

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.360 
pipe
we<00:03:44.690> set<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:44.930> on<00:03:45.200> down<00:03:45.379> don't<00:03:45.739> set<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.040> up<00:03:46.129> here

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
we set that on down don't set it up here

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.550 
we set that on down don't set it up here
set<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.030> on<00:03:47.209> down<00:03:47.420> here<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.290> we're<00:03:48.410> going<00:03:48.500> to

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
set it on down here and we're going to

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.780 
set it on down here and we're going to
fill<00:03:48.799> that<00:03:48.920> up<00:03:48.980> just<00:03:49.340> like<00:03:49.459> we<00:03:49.580> did<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.760> last

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
fill that up just like we did the last

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.199 
fill that up just like we did the last
one

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
one

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.789 
one
we're<00:03:50.959> going<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.140> fill<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:51.349> up<00:03:51.500> with<00:03:51.680> about

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
second while it's top weird to see if we

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.040 
second while it's top weird to see if we
can<00:05:01.370> get<00:05:01.490> this<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.760> work<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.150> I<00:05:02.660> put<00:05:02.870> a<00:05:02.900> little

can get this to work so I put a little

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.620 
can get this to work so I put a little
bit<00:05:03.230> in<00:05:03.380> there<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:03.850> tap<00:05:04.850> on<00:05:05.090> it<00:05:05.270> with<00:05:05.390> anything

solid<00:05:06.140> and<00:05:06.800> I<00:05:07.490> pull<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.880> right<00:05:08.000> on<00:05:08.060> up<00:05:08.390> when<00:05:09.260> I

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
solid and I pull it right on up when I

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.560 
solid and I pull it right on up when I
get<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.650> top<00:05:09.830> I<00:05:10.070> stop<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.550> wait<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:11.390> let

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
get to the top I stop and wait and let

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.410 
get to the top I stop and wait and let
the<00:05:11.690> water<00:05:11.930> drain<00:05:12.290> through<00:05:12.850> the<00:05:13.850> water<00:05:14.060> drains

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
the water drain through the water drains

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.270 
the water drain through the water drains
through<00:05:14.920> should<00:05:15.920> be<00:05:16.070> good<00:05:16.280> should<00:05:16.730> be<00:05:16.850> solid
