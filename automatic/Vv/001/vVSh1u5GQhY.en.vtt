2 or of course the Clone Wars movie and

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.849 
2 or of course the Clone Wars movie and
animated<00:04:15.549> series<00:04:16.560> okay<00:04:17.590> and

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
animated series okay and

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.709 
animated series okay and
she<00:04:19.009> can<00:04:19.280> let<00:04:19.519> me<00:04:19.609> see<00:04:19.849> him<00:04:20.060> pretty<00:04:20.419> sure<00:04:20.569> she

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:20.719 
she can let me see him pretty sure she

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:25.390 
she can let me see him pretty sure she
can<00:04:20.840> hold<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.729> well<00:04:23.889> okay<00:04:24.889> well<00:04:25.069> it<00:04:25.219> doesn't

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
can hold it well okay well it doesn't

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.770 
can hold it well okay well it doesn't
seem<00:04:25.669> like<00:04:25.819> she<00:04:25.849> can<00:04:26.060> hold<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.419> that<00:04:26.449> well

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
seem like she can hold it that well

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.629 
seem like she can hold it that well
immediately<00:04:27.439> but<00:04:27.650> anyway<00:04:27.949> she<00:04:28.340> does<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.580> a

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
immediately but anyway she does have a

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.119 
immediately but anyway she does have a
working<00:04:28.969> holster<00:04:29.389> hair<00:04:30.289> blaster<00:04:30.740> can<00:04:30.860> fit<00:04:31.009> in

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
working holster hair blaster can fit in

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:32.170 
working holster hair blaster can fit in
there<00:04:31.250> I'm<00:04:31.340> just<00:04:31.460> not<00:04:31.639> gonna<00:04:31.729> take<00:04:31.969> it<00:04:32.060> off

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
there I'm just not gonna take it off

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.929 
there I'm just not gonna take it off
right<00:04:32.300> now<00:04:32.620> so<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.949> guess<00:04:34.219> that's<00:04:34.430> pretty<00:04:34.610> much

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:34.939 
right now so I guess that's pretty much

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.409 
right now so I guess that's pretty much
it<00:04:36.099> really<00:04:37.099> a<00:04:37.129> cool<00:04:37.460> figure<00:04:37.849> I<00:04:37.879> think<00:04:38.330> they

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
it really a cool figure I think they

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.450 
it really a cool figure I think they
could<00:04:38.569> have<00:04:38.689> added<00:04:39.080> more<00:04:39.620> articulation<00:04:40.189> with

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
could have added more articulation with

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.249 
could have added more articulation with
her<00:04:40.550> at<00:04:40.789> least<00:04:41.000> if<00:04:41.270> not<00:04:41.449> with<00:04:41.629> the<00:04:41.719> arms<00:04:42.020> at

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
her at least if not with the arms at

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.740 
her at least if not with the arms at
least<00:04:42.409> with<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.650> knees<00:04:42.860> or<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.569> ankles<00:04:44.569> but<00:04:44.689> I

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
least with the knees or the ankles but I

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.390 
least with the knees or the ankles but I
guess<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.469> would<00:04:45.590> have<00:04:45.680> been<00:04:45.800> too<00:04:45.979> hard<00:04:46.219> for

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
guess it would have been too hard for

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.279 
guess it would have been too hard for
Hasbro<00:04:46.610> at<00:04:46.939> least<00:04:47.090> for<00:04:47.300> now<00:04:47.419> to<00:04:47.479> do<00:04:48.259> that

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
Hasbro at least for now to do that

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.740 
Hasbro at least for now to do that
because<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:49.400> plastic<00:04:49.759> is<00:04:49.849> really<00:04:50.150> thin<00:04:50.509> it's

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
because the plastic is really thin it's

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.290 
because the plastic is really thin it's
really<00:04:51.050> small<00:04:51.469> so<00:04:52.400> it'd<00:04:52.580> probably<00:04:53.060> be

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
really small so it'd probably be

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.600 
really small so it'd probably be
difficult<00:04:54.110> but<00:04:54.289> anyway<00:04:54.650> I'm<00:04:54.889> still<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.370> cool

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
difficult but anyway I'm still a cool

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.439 
difficult but anyway I'm still a cool
figure<00:04:55.849> I<00:04:56.210> definitely<00:04:57.050> give<00:04:57.139> this<00:04:57.289> um<00:04:57.560> I<00:04:58.449> still
