00:00:00.701 --> 00:00:03.604
 Stop camping stupid newbies! 

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:04.761
 Shut! 

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:10.362
 Alright guys, the video game industry is stinking right now. 

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:15.327
 So we should get something fresh. No more stupid first-person shooters like Call of Duty! 

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:22.319
 If someone has an idea, that looks something like Call of Duty, they will throw it away now! 

00:00:27.743 --> 00:00:31.083
 Is not there anyone who has new ideas ?! 

00:00:31.422 --> 00:00:33.900
 Because otherwise I will have to fire all of you. 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.337
 But I have children. 

00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:37.348
 Then I will fire them too! 

00:00:43.463 --> 00:00:47.121
 I think I have one. It is called shadow man. 

00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:51.984
 You play like this guy and you have to avoid the shadows. 

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:55.682
 -If you touch one, you will die. -So it's a platform. 

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:58.599
 Exact. Then in the game ... 

00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:02.471
 You pick up this AK-47 and you must shoot your way out of the nightmare! 

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.632
 No, heck! No more shooters! 

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:11.531
 Yes, it was also an AK-74U, not an AK-47. Fool! 

00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:17.429
 It is clearly an AK-47 with folding provision. Playing Call of Duty does not make you an expert in weapons. 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.596
 -If it does! -Boys! Shut the *** mouth! 

00:01:20.883 --> 00:01:23.834
 Nobody has ideas for a game that does not include shooting ?! 

00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:27.579
 I have an idea. It's called Tierra Dulce ... 

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.143
 Fair of Modern Sweets. 

00:01:30.143 --> 00:01:33.970
 - That sounds like a shooter. -Do not! It is for children who like ... 

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:36.483
 ... the sweets and ... 

00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:38.375
 ...the lands. 

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.235
 In this game you are the Man of Sweets. 

00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:46.812
 And your goal is to collect as many white marshmallows as possible. 

00:01:46.812 --> 00:01:49.184
 While you avoid blacks. 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.877
 And the best part is that when you collect 11 white marshmallows in a round ... 

00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:59.636
 You can call an AC-130, fuck *** mar! 

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:06.344
 If I hear another copy of Call of Duty, I'll jump through the window! 

00:02:07.123 --> 00:02:09.336
 -We are on the first floor. -You are fired! 

00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:12.139
 Well, if you're going to fire him, he'll have to fire me. 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.495
 Very well. 

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:14.946
 My***. 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:22.155
 Your! You better give me an idea right now. 

00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:27.411
 I got it! 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.648
 How are you... 

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:30.031
 ... Call of Duty ... 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.275
 That is all. The video game industry is lost. 

00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:42.713
 Does anyone want sandwiches? 

00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:45.397
 Your! You must have an idea. 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.998
 Please. Please help me. 

00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:52.916
 I had an idea for a game, but it does not involve shooting. 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.616
 Very good, he continues. 

00:02:54.834 --> 00:03:00.355
 Well, it's from a father who lost his daughter in a paranormal accident, which left him strange powers. 

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:05.116
 That is brilliant! What is your name? 

00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:07.687
 Magical Daddy Rescue Force? 

00:03:09.303 --> 00:03:09.971
 I love it. 

00:03:11.143 --> 00:03:15.659
 Together, you and I will change this world. 

00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:18.842
 Just wait and see. 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:20.956
 Can I go home? 

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:22.082
 Shut the *** mouth! 

00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:24.322
 Defeated! 

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:26.927
 BE PROMOTED! MORON. 

00:03:26.927 --> 00:03:28.782
 3 YEARS LATER. 

00:03:32.868 --> 00:03:34.566
 Do you have a new great game? 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.578
 Yes, we have a great new one called ... 

00:03:38.076 --> 00:03:39.654
 ... Magic Daddy Rescue Force. 

00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:40.554
 Check it. 

00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:45.703
 Boring! 

00:03:48.968 --> 00:03:50.024
 Call of Duty 12? 

00:03:52.304 --> 00:03:53.565
 I'll take it! 

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:56.248
 BE PROMOTED! STUPID CONSUMER
