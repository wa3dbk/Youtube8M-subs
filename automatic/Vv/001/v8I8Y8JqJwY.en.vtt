00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
already full you can move around very

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.960 
already full you can move around very
simply<00:01:48.399> obviously<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:49.460> doesn't<00:01:49.580> come<00:01:49.790> with<00:01:49.940> a

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
simply obviously it doesn't come with a

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.460 
simply obviously it doesn't come with a
lot<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.330> memory<00:01:50.570> built<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.229> can<00:01:57.350> do

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
lot of memory built in and you can do

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.710 
lot of memory built in and you can do
all<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.649> this<00:01:57.830> zooming<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.970> 3-inch<00:01:59.360> screen<00:01:59.570> oh
