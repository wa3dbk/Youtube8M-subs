hey guys I'm Heath Manning of manic use
this<00:00:07.529> video<00:00:07.890> is<00:00:08.190> going<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.460> be<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.790> slow<00:00:09.120> drag

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:09.770 
this video is going to be on slow drag

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.040 
this video is going to be on slow drag
slow<00:00:10.770> drink<00:00:11.100> basically<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.150> when<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.809> cue

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 
slow drink basically is when the cue

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.499 
slow drink basically is when the cue
ball<00:00:13.230> comes<00:00:14.160> out<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.519> having<00:00:14.639> backspin<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.360> it

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
ball comes out of having backspin on it

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.450 
ball comes out of having backspin on it
through<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.929> skid<00:00:16.259> and<00:00:16.470> just<00:00:16.950> starts<00:00:17.279> that

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
through a skid and just starts that

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.729 
through a skid and just starts that
topspin<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.170> before<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.259> connects<00:00:19.560> your

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:19.739 
topspin on before it connects your

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.409 
topspin on before it connects your
object<00:00:20.070> cloth<00:00:20.779> well<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> use<00:00:22.079> a<00:00:22.110> slow<00:00:22.410> drag<00:00:22.680> shot

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
object cloth well I use a slow drag shot

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.170 
object cloth well I use a slow drag shot
slow<00:00:24.419> drag<00:00:24.720> shot<00:00:25.820> basically<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.970> very

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
slow drag shot basically is very

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.600 
slow drag shot basically is very
important<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:28.380> controlling<00:00:28.649> your<00:00:29.130> cue<00:00:29.399> ball

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
important for controlling your cue ball

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.990 
important for controlling your cue ball
and<00:00:29.960> having<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.160> confident<00:00:32.160> shot<00:00:32.369> when<00:00:32.880> you're

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
and having a confident shot when you're

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.610 
and having a confident shot when you're
doing<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.550> go<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> any<00:00:36.000> pool<00:00:36.300> hall

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
doing it you can go to any pool hall

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.790 
doing it you can go to any pool hall
okay<00:00:37.620> right<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:38.280> anywhere<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.150> want<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
guarantee you there will be tables in

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.750 
guarantee you there will be tables in
there<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> are<00:00:42.480> not<00:00:42.630> level<00:00:43.340> that<00:00:44.340> may<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
there that are not level that may have a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.330 
there that are not level that may have a
little<00:00:45.030> bit<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.420> dirt<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.750> them<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.190> that<00:00:47.190> may

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
little bit of dirt on them and that may

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.510 
little bit of dirt on them and that may
not<00:00:47.550> play<00:00:47.880> true<00:00:48.470> so<00:00:49.470> when<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.130> get<00:00:50.310> down<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
not play true so when you get down to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.940 
not play true so when you get down to
shoot<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.910> shot<00:00:51.150> you<00:00:51.960> may<00:00:52.110> not<00:00:52.290> be<00:00:52.440> confident

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950

okay I can shoot that shot all day
now<00:01:05.360> that<00:01:06.360> shot<00:01:06.689> was<00:01:06.930> even<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.290> little<00:01:07.439> harder

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
now that shot was even a little harder

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.469 
now that shot was even a little harder
let<00:01:08.610> me<00:01:08.790> actually<00:01:09.000> play<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.810> finesse<00:01:10.620> shot

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
let me actually play a finesse shot

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.080 
let me actually play a finesse shot
where<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.680> slow<00:01:13.950> roll<00:01:14.220> my<00:01:14.670> cue<00:01:14.909> ball

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
where I can just slow roll my cue ball

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
where I can just slow roll my cue ball
down<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:16.890> worry<00:01:17.190> about<00:01:17.520> grit<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.930 

can<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.680> day<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.460> shape<00:01:23.700> for

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
can do that all day and have shape for

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.920 
can do that all day and have shape for
the<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> side<00:01:24.570> pocket<00:01:25.790> now<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> do

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the one in the side pocket now what I do

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.350 
the one in the side pocket now what I do
that<00:01:28.170> over<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:28.650> pool<00:01:28.920> hall<00:01:29.360> absolutely

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
that over in the pool hall absolutely

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.800 
that over in the pool hall absolutely
not

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
not

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.620 
not
why<00:01:31.310> because<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> wouldn't<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.820> confident<00:01:33.450> in

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
why because I wouldn't be confident in

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.830 
why because I wouldn't be confident in
the<00:01:33.690> shot<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.520> wouldn't<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:36.090> wouldn't<00:01:36.659> be

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
the shot I wouldn't be I wouldn't be

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.080 
the shot I wouldn't be I wouldn't be
risking<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> game<00:01:40.260> on<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.979> finesse<00:01:41.549> shot<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
risking the game on a finesse shot on a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.440 
risking the game on a finesse shot on a
table<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.659> may<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.350> may<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:43.530> roll<00:01:44.040> true

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
table that may or may not roll true

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.480 
table that may or may not roll true
depending<00:01:45.450> temperature<00:01:46.260> even<00:01:46.409> changes<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
depending temperature even changes the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.950 
depending temperature even changes the
way<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> table<00:01:48.030> plays<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.540> there's<00:01:48.750> many

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
way a table plays so there's many

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.609 
way a table plays so there's many
variables<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.880> just<00:01:50.880> know<00:01:51.000> how<00:01:51.150> mine<00:01:51.390> plays<00:01:51.780> so

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
variables I just know how mine plays so

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.690 
variables I just know how mine plays so
the<00:01:53.130> slow<00:01:53.400> drag<00:01:53.640> works<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.900> this<00:01:55.700> we're

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the slow drag works like this we're

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.359 
the slow drag works like this we're
going<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> measure<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.330> distance<00:01:57.840> between

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
going to measure the distance between

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.730 
going to measure the distance between
the<00:01:59.369> cue<00:01:59.640> ball<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.950> object<00:02:02.490> ball<00:02:02.640> okay

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
the cue ball and the object ball okay

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.670 
the cue ball and the object ball okay
right<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.580> object<00:02:06.000> ball<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.680> about

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
right now the object ball is about

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.789 
right now the object ball is about
three-quarters<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.489> diamond<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.799> the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
three-quarters of a diamond up on the

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.009 
three-quarters of a diamond up on the
side<00:02:11.459> rail<00:02:11.700> here<00:02:11.969> so<00:02:12.569> I'm<00:02:12.689> going<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.870> measure

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
side rail here so I'm going to measure

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.710 
side rail here so I'm going to measure
that<00:02:13.290> up<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.769> table<00:02:14.159> one

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
that up the table one

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.680 
that up the table one
two<00:02:14.930> three<00:02:15.590> four<00:02:16.100> five<00:02:16.970> diamonds<00:02:17.570> and

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
two three four five diamonds and

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.160 
two three four five diamonds and
distance<00:02:18.080> away<00:02:18.260> from<00:02:18.800> my<00:02:19.010> cue<00:02:19.280> ball<00:02:20.020> if<00:02:21.020> you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
distance away from my cue ball if you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.750 
distance away from my cue ball if you
haven't<00:02:21.500> watched<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.890> stop<00:02:22.190> short<00:02:22.460> video<00:02:22.730> I

have on YouTube or the sheet from a stop

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.770 
have on YouTube or the sheet from a stop
shot<00:02:25.100> please<00:02:25.670> watch<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.030> because<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.630> will

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
shot please watch that because this will

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.710 
shot please watch that because this will
make<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.110> much<00:02:27.260> more<00:02:27.470> sense<00:02:28.390> five<00:02:29.390> diamonds

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
make so much more sense five diamonds

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.740 
make so much more sense five diamonds
away<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:31.340> want<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.730> hit<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:31.970> three<00:02:32.510> ball

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
away and I want to hit that three ball

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.410 
away and I want to hit that three ball
with<00:02:33.260> just<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.680> little<00:02:33.860> bit<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.420> forward

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
with just a little bit of forward

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.820 
with just a little bit of forward
momentum<00:02:35.660> when<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.080> hit<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.350> just<00:02:36.590> enough<00:02:36.800> to

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
momentum when I hit it just enough to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.400 
momentum when I hit it just enough to
come<00:02:37.130> off<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.490> rail<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.700> out<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:38.840> have<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
come off the rail and out so I have the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.190 
come off the rail and out so I have the
one<00:02:39.590> ball<00:02:39.830> but<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.190> can't<00:02:40.490> use<00:02:40.760> finesse<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.960> how

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
one ball but I can't use finesse so how

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.470 
one ball but I can't use finesse so how
am<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.380> gonna<00:02:42.560> do<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.980> what<00:02:43.670> I'm<00:02:43.760> gonna<00:02:43.880> do<00:02:44.180> is

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
am I gonna do it what I'm gonna do is

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.670 
am I gonna do it what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:02:45.320> going<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.800> measure<00:02:46.670> my<00:02:47.260> distance<00:02:48.260> which

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
I'm going to measure my distance which

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.860 
I'm going to measure my distance which
is<00:02:48.830> five<00:02:49.040> diamonds<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.880> now<00:02:50.420> I'm<00:02:50.540> gonna<00:02:50.660> say

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
is five diamonds and now I'm gonna say

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.280 
is five diamonds and now I'm gonna say
okay<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.470> want<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.280> have<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.850> want<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.990> cue<00:02:54.260> ball

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.110 
three diamond with backspin I want the
skit<00:03:00.320> for<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> diamond<00:03:00.920> which<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.670> diamonds

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
skit for a diamond which is for diamonds

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.510 
skit for a diamond which is for diamonds
in<00:03:02.270> length<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.780> then<00:03:03.500> make<00:03:03.740> contact<00:03:04.310> with<00:03:04.459> a

three ball so I have to cue ball with
three<00:03:10.160> tips<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.820> bottom<00:03:11.860> before<00:03:12.860> three

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
three tips of bottom before three

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.540 
three tips of bottom before three
diamonds<00:03:13.700> of<00:03:14.000> English<00:03:15.010> then<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.160> will<00:03:16.280> have<00:03:16.520> a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
diamonds of English then it will have a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.390 
diamonds of English then it will have a
transfer<00:03:17.120> period<00:03:17.570> of<00:03:17.720> one<00:03:18.500> diamond<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.100> skid

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
transfer period of one diamond of a skid

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.020 
transfer period of one diamond of a skid
and<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.300> will<00:03:20.390> have<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:21.190> diamond<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.340> four

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
and that it will have a diamond of four

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.940 
and that it will have a diamond of four
momentum<00:03:23.660> which<00:03:23.870> will<00:03:24.050> carom<00:03:24.350> off<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.709> three

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
momentum which will carom off the three

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.680 
momentum which will carom off the three
ball<00:03:25.160> into<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.640> rail<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.000> out<00:03:26.090> for<00:03:26.300> shape<00:03:26.480> on

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
ball into the rail and out for shape on

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.720 
ball into the rail and out for shape on
the<00:03:26.810> one<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:28.130> now<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.940> shoot<00:03:29.300> that<00:03:30.220> get<00:03:31.220> set

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
the one so now to shoot that get set

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.030 
the one so now to shoot that get set
I<00:03:31.760> already<00:03:32.450> know<00:03:32.690> where<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.840> want<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.170> hit<00:03:36.040> okay

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
I already know where I want to hit okay

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.910 
I already know where I want to hit okay
and<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.730> come<00:03:38.150> oh<00:03:38.269> now<00:03:38.510> you've<00:03:39.200> probably<00:03:39.410> seen

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
and I come oh now you've probably seen

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.289 
and I come oh now you've probably seen
the<00:03:40.430> cue<00:03:40.700> ball<00:03:41.140> come<00:03:42.140> through<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.500> skid

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
the cue ball come through the skid

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.060 
the cue ball come through the skid
you've<00:03:44.299> seen<00:03:44.570> it<00:03:44.720> have<00:03:44.870> backspin<00:03:45.380> then<00:03:45.739> pause

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
you've seen it have backspin then pause

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.640 
you've seen it have backspin then pause
and<00:03:46.430> then<00:03:46.580> roll<00:03:46.790> forward<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:47.470> now<00:03:48.470> I've

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
and then roll forward and now I've

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.910 
and then roll forward and now I've
gotten<00:03:48.950> my<00:03:49.100> shape<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.870> very<00:03:51.590> very

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
gotten my shape that is a very very

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.750 
gotten my shape that is a very very
important<00:03:52.670> shot<00:03:53.260> now<00:03:54.260> understand<00:03:54.860> that<00:03:55.220> if

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
important shot now understand that if

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.940 
important shot now understand that if
you<00:03:55.910> put<00:03:56.120> any<00:03:56.269> spin<00:03:56.660> on<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.049> cue<00:03:57.260> ball<00:03:57.290> left<00:03:57.739> or

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
you put any spin on the cue ball left or

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.550 
you put any spin on the cue ball left or
right<00:03:58.130> when<00:03:59.060> it<00:03:59.180> comes<00:03:59.450> out<00:03:59.600> of<00:03:59.630> that<00:03:59.750> skid<00:04:00.200> it

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
right when it comes out of that skid it

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.720 
right when it comes out of that skid it
will<00:04:01.750> take<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.989> spin<00:04:03.350> and<00:04:03.680> go<00:04:04.040> left<00:04:04.370> or<00:04:04.489> right

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
will take that spin and go left or right

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.530 
will take that spin and go left or right
depending<00:04:04.880> on<00:04:05.209> what<00:04:05.360> spin<00:04:05.600> you<00:04:05.720> put<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:06.049> it<00:04:06.200> so

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
depending on what spin you put on it so

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.229 
depending on what spin you put on it so
make<00:04:08.540> sure<00:04:08.570> that<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:10.340> controlling<00:04:10.850> your<00:04:11.060> ball

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
make sure that you controlling your ball

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.060 
make sure that you controlling your ball
know<00:04:11.900> what<00:04:12.110> spin<00:04:12.350> you're<00:04:12.500> putting<00:04:12.830> on<00:04:12.950> it

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
know what spin you're putting on it

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.710 
know what spin you're putting on it
because<00:04:13.250> if<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.549> are<00:04:13.760> putting<00:04:14.000> spin<00:04:14.360> you<00:04:14.540> have

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
because if you are putting spin you have

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.310 
because if you are putting spin you have
to<00:04:14.870> compensate<00:04:15.230> for<00:04:15.620> that<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:17.049> measure<00:04:18.049> your

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
to compensate for that and measure your

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.770 
to compensate for that and measure your
shots<00:04:18.650> you<00:04:18.979> know<00:04:19.220> how<00:04:19.820> much<00:04:20.090> draw<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.419> put<00:04:20.660> on

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
shots you know how much draw to put on

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.020 
shots you know how much draw to put on
the<00:04:20.900> ball<00:04:21.109> so<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:22.010> know<00:04:22.310> where<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.550> skin<00:04:22.789> zone
