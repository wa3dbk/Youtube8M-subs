00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.929
 the problem of sharpness also happens 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.610
 in the best families what 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.080
 maybe during shooting and watching 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.020
 in the camera screen there 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.060
 looked good once opened in a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.480
 computer when we have the chance 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.910
 to enlarge and see what happens 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 if in great record we realize that 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.349
 mangano missing detail definitions 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.120
 this shot was taken with a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.450
 telephoto and a shutter speed 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.760
 too slow to freeze for 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.690
 being able to continue the movement of the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.610
 of my hand here that is born in this 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.480
 new version of photoshop in the menu 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.270
 sharpening filter effect reduction 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.430
 moved we go to check we see that 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.649
 what can happen part automatically 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.780
 as soon as this opens a window 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.500
 reading he is doing is the law on 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.379
 this box that automatically yes 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.740
 defines what we can do is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.200
 choose which area 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.780
 perform this reading a click on the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.100
 central part allows us to move 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.250
 maybe in the area that interested us 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:24.240
 improve and make the reading 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.939
 we see that in this field in this in 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.030
 this cursor is running again 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:35.070
 reading and corrections will do it 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.820
 let's finish let's see what happens 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.640
 first in the area where it was located 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.900
 too much 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.750
 too central where maybe intentionally 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.610
 the blur was in the background in the area 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.979
 instead more in the foreground where instead it is 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.280
 more natural than it is in focus or 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.930
 placed this box we try to 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.869
 zoom in a bit to see if they are there 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.700
 differences then the big reason 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:08.270
 always better doing the work of 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.030
 render to show me what 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.480
 happens with this intervention if I remove 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.470
 the preview I see what can change 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.230
 seem a minimal correction, however, the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.720
 There is a difference, of course, alone 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.239
 recycle again we can 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:33.230
 juggle with these sliders then 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.900
 limit or not the reading of what is 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.280
 the rough in the area we have 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.830
 selected and evaluate the effect after 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.590
 which is finished rendering then the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.680
 re sampling work of 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:53.000
 adjustment that makes the program over 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.980
 to this first little square that I have 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.530
 used this reading square 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.510
 there is the possibility of adding others 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.360
 so with this tool that of 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.610
 I can usually automatically part 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.910
 go and define another area one 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.940
 beam that maybe isn't 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.610
 it is not in perfect focus or 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.480
 I want it to be improved in type 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.330
 this position where the fire is the flower 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.150
 further back and slightly out of focus 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.800
 also due to limit problems 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.480
 the goal then I add another 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.900
 reading and we see him here he did his 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.760
 therefore I work in bed also in this one 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.190
 what area was not clear what 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.040
 could be moved and of course has 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.140
 made his corrections in this 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.720
 squares point here if we make a 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.530
 click let's see what the situation was like 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:54.070
 first store by clicking now I leave e 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.620
 later in this position he is reading 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.700
 so behind it is not the area that there 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.940
 interested in reading we can 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.780
 drag us instead to the area we are 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.780
 interested to see better then the 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.180
 possibility with a click to see the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.030
 things like they were releasing the mouse 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.890
 to see how the 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.720
 correction 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.640
 when we are happy when we have 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.050
 recovered a photograph maybe 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.910
 unmissable made at a time when 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.280
 we didn't get the chance to 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.710
 adjust the camera better now 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.020
 photoshop has further implemented 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.130
 this tool allowing us to 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.890
 recovering situations that perhaps with the 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.590
 previous versions was not possible 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:48.250
 recover an ok to confirm make 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.580
 immediately the correction if zumbo a 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.540
 little bit so we evaluate globally 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:00.430
 the thing against z a step backwards 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:04.000
 so that 's how it was and that 's how it is 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.960
 become recovery is normal that a 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.249
 sometimes certain situations if a moved 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.379
 can not be carried out 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:14.899
 however, it is a big step that has been taken 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:18.399
 another big step to improve 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:22.249
 sharpness in many photographs 

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:24.469
 problem is that it happens I said at the beginning 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.369
 in the best families and also in the 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.369
 professional photographers
