00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
thin things on the side and then when

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.639 
thin things on the side and then when
you<00:00:41.550> get<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> neck<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.840> really<00:00:43.379> really

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
you get to the neck be really really

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.860 
you get to the neck be really really
careful<00:00:43.829> I've<00:00:44.280> had<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.760> redo<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
careful I've had to redo this one a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
careful I've had to redo this one a
couple<00:00:45.899> times<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.920> neck<00:00:47.100> area<00:00:47.280> which<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.670> also

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
couple times the neck area which is also

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.450 
couple times the neck area which is also
partially<00:00:48.300> why<00:00:48.390> I'm<00:00:48.510> scrapping<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.460> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
partially why I'm scrapping this the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100 
partially why I'm scrapping this the
next<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.879> still<00:00:51.059> fragile<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.809> make<00:00:51.930> sure

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
next is still fragile just make sure

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.900 
next is still fragile just make sure
that<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.440> get<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.070> straight

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
that you get it on there straight

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.060 
that you get it on there straight
otherwise<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.500> angled<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
otherwise it's going to be angled and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.340 
otherwise it's going to be angled and
kind<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> throw<00:00:56.520> off<00:00:56.579> everything<00:00:56.969> else

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
kind of throw off everything else

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.130 
kind of throw off everything else
don't<00:00:58.829> put<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.370> body<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.789> backwards<00:01:00.570> which<00:01:00.870> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
don't put the body on backwards which I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.630 
don't put the body on backwards which I
made<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> mistake<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.920> doing<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.280> first<00:01:02.309> time

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
made the mistake of doing the first time

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.979 
made the mistake of doing the first time
I<00:01:02.670> thought<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.120> was<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.390> front<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:03.960> I

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
I thought this was the front because I

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.359 
I thought this was the front because I
thought<00:01:04.170> made<00:01:04.409> more<00:01:04.530> sense<00:01:04.799> than<00:01:04.949> having<00:01:05.250> this

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
thought made more sense than having this

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.390 
thought made more sense than having this
big<00:01:05.580> line<00:01:05.850> down<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.360> front<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> model<00:01:07.500> but

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
big line down the front of the model but

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
big line down the front of the model but
I<00:01:08.460> did<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.729> backwards<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.360> had<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:10.049> out

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
I did that backwards and had to take out

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.469 
I did that backwards and had to take out
off<00:01:10.439> redo<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.979> hands<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:11.880> pretty<00:01:12.030> easy<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
off redo it hands are pretty easy and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.450 
off redo it hands are pretty easy and
straightforward<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:13.920> you'll<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
straightforward you know you'll have the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.370 
straightforward you know you'll have the
P<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.760> file<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.390> doing<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.720> right<00:01:15.960> so

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
P do file if you're doing this right so

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.289 
P do file if you're doing this right so
you'll<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.890> able<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.130> follow<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.790> here's

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
you'll be able to follow that and here's

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.140 
you'll be able to follow that and here's
where<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.570> gets<00:01:19.080> complicated<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> she's<00:01:21.000> got

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
where it gets complicated so she's got

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.210 
where it gets complicated so she's got

I<00:01:32.220> did<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.360> wrong<00:01:33.900> apparently<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:34.920> guessing

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
I did this wrong apparently I'm guessing

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.810 
I did this wrong apparently I'm guessing
because<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> did<00:01:36.240> was<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.829> took<00:01:37.829> her<00:01:38.340> legs

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
because what I did was I took her legs

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.840 
because what I did was I took her legs
I<00:01:38.850> attached<00:01:39.180> them<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.659> um<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:41.189> these<00:01:41.369> there's

I attached them to um all these there's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.249

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
are putting to this putting together

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.980 
are putting to this putting together
this<00:02:29.340> model<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.910> what<00:02:30.030> I'm<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:30.660> next

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
this model and what I'm going to do next

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.400 
this model and what I'm going to do next
time<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.470> I'm<00:02:32.280> going<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.580> take<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.820> torso

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
time is I'm going to take the torso

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.830 
time is I'm going to take the torso
attach<00:02:34.410> this<00:02:34.770> white<00:02:35.190> band<00:02:35.790> for<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.600> skirt

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
attach this white band for the skirt

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.030 
attach this white band for the skirt
first<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.770> then<00:02:38.280> attach<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:39.560> almost<00:02:40.560> saw<00:02:40.830> say

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
first and then attach I almost saw say

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.240 
first and then attach I almost saw say
you<00:02:41.100> do<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.370> white<00:02:41.880> part<00:02:42.180> over<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.540> next<00:02:43.350> but<00:02:43.560> I

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
you do the white part over it next but I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.980 
you do the white part over it next but I
think<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.880> also<00:02:45.000> be<00:02:45.210> argued<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.900> do

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
think it also be argued that you can do

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.560 
think it also be argued that you can do
the<00:02:46.080> green<00:02:46.260> part<00:02:46.500> under<00:02:47.310> -<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.820> big<00:02:48.180> thing<00:02:48.210> is

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
the green part under - the big thing is

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.870 
the green part under - the big thing is
put<00:02:48.990> this<00:02:49.140> white<00:02:49.380> band<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.280> waist<00:02:50.460> first

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
put this white band on the waist first

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.000 
put this white band on the waist first
make<00:02:51.630> sure<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.840> fits<00:02:52.200> because<00:02:52.380> that's<00:02:52.680> going

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
make sure that fits because that's going

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.530 
make sure that fits because that's going
to<00:02:53.100> be<00:02:53.190> what<00:02:53.340> everybody<00:02:53.580> else<00:02:53.880> sees<00:02:54.060> nobody

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
to be what everybody else sees nobody

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.390 
to be what everybody else sees nobody
even<00:02:54.720> sees<00:02:54.990> like<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.380> pelvis<00:02:55.800> part<00:02:56.070> or<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
even sees like this pelvis part or the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.110 
even sees like this pelvis part or the
top<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.760> green<00:02:56.910> part<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.390> inside<00:02:57.420> um

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
top of the green part on the inside um

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.000 
top of the green part on the inside um
so<00:03:00.120> yeah<00:03:00.270> it's<00:03:00.780> actually<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.620> really

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
so yeah it's actually a really

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.360 
so yeah it's actually a really
complicated<00:03:02.640> model<00:03:03.830> there's<00:03:04.830> tons<00:03:05.070> of<00:03:05.190> little

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
complicated model there's tons of little

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.540 
complicated model there's tons of little
little<00:03:05.910> pieces<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.010> I'm<00:03:08.010> finding<00:03:08.370> out

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
little pieces on it and I'm finding out

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.980 
little pieces on it and I'm finding out
that<00:03:08.730> because<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.270> fact<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.750> have

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
that because of the fact that you have

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.320 
that because of the fact that you have
four<00:03:10.320> layers<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.310> paper<00:03:11.610> essentially<00:03:12.120> you've
