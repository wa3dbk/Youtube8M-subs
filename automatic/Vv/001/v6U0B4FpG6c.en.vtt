00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.300
 hello people are you watching a video from the channel 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.400
 walking tractor tv 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:13.170
 My name is Artem and today we will talk 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:18.060
 about mine on wheels motorcycle firms 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:21.960
 and weight model x 0 2 the price of these then knees to 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.349
 at 107 dollars per item that is they 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.910
 go they are sold not paired when this 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.720
 when i bought these knee pads i did this 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.600
 I did not know and I was very surprised when I 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.030
 I came one kneecap I looked 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 the main road with the parcel there was a helmet 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.199
 all that form to us I walked 2 I thought 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.469
 a fig at all deceived me something 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:51.179
 wacky moto sport dot com 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:53.699
 by the way it turned out wrong but then in 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.170
 Description I saw that there are big 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.059
 written in red letters 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.390
 they are sold in a pair of floor you have to be 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.560
 idiot something like that but so let's start with 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.000
 the fact that I don't know why I chose them 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.630
 just flipping through the catalog saw knee pads 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.820
 for 107 dollars I think yes, yes, not bad 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.079
 Generally ordered if I ordered 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.990
 now kneecaps 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:29.119
 they would have been completely different tell 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.119
 why in these knee pads is missing 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.399
 lower leg protection instead of classic 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.240
 plastic protection in the shin at the top 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.969
 protection means just stuff here 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.619
 bottom this foam 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:46.560
 that is quite soft material 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.039
 bending naturally and from above on top 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.890
 nothing at all of course this is not a plus for 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.759
 I had a situation when I was driving in my 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.990
 first shoes and they were orderly 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.840
 worn out and I had no jeans on 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.159
 jeans on top of the cheapest plastic 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.759
 chinese knee pads 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.250
 I drove along a narrow narrow path in the bushes 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.360
 I caught a stump I at speed 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:19.080
 right 30 per hour kicked 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.180
 knee up just shin about this 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.960
 stump 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.180
 I just did not see him and saved me 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.790
 shin protection at the cheapest 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.090
 Chinese knee pads saved me 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.340
 worn shoes so I think 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.220
 lower leg protection 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.900
 pretty important in these lap or 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.250
 no between boot 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.500
 and myself between the boot plastic protection 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.480
 knee quite a long distance 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.520
 probably 15-20 centimeters so if 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.310
 the kneecaps would die now they were 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.170
 a little bit different on now we 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.620
 Consider these knee pads 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.959
 so I tell you that they can first 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.090
 they are quite comfortable they are completely 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:12.120
 dress up sock laptops like this 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.510
 when you wanted you forget about them they 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.510
 very comfortable cool but if your 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.280
 motorcycle with the Kickstarter you'll be a 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.560
 do not remember every time you will 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.970
 start a motorcycle because as 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.540
 there is a lot of material everywhere before bending 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.989
 a leg 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.320
 it gets a little harder that is 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:38.480
 that's all plus motorcycle pants and 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:42.690
 it all creates a little bit which one 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.690
 interference and you need to put more 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.440
 efforts to understand well and then start 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.480
 motorcycle 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.299
 but if you have an electric starter 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.010
 you will not remember 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.980
 that there is some discomfort there 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.170
 to be in these knee pads in fact how much 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.540
 I went to them 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.730
 so I did not remember them, and they are very 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.650
 comfortable and when riding 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.930
 you just forget about them 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.570
 metal frames then aluminum 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:15.420
 regulator inserts leg flexion 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.760
 and can be adjusted like flexion 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.310
 top top guide so and 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.710
 lower so you can limit 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.720
 to discern the scope of bending legs can 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.000
 limit leg flexion from below 80 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.919
 knee 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.389
 and the adjustment of course with two 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.450
 parties 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:36.389
 material used which dress 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.690
 on foot it is so comfortable that even when 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:43.250
 you sweat in these on your knees sweat you 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:48.150
 constantly in these on their knees because 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:52.860
 they are pretty thick you all 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:58.620
 it is also very easy to take off as well 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:00.840
 it's easy to put these knee pads on never 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.150
 slide that is, I did not never 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.100
 I slipped they are different sizes 1 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.020
 size or another and another other on 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.760
 lap size xl i decided 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.479
 experiment when ordered 2 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.850
 knee pad 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:18.870
 Well, in general, they approached me but 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.510
 their site is a little big size first 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.830
 I thought it would crawl but nothing 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.440
 similar with screed which they are 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.520
 prevent 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.160
 but he himself and this material from 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.390
 which is made on his lap which 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.760
 inside is pretty nice and does not give 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.490
 crawling to my knee with these knees i 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.020
 very pleased and 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:50.310
 the next couple of seasons probably will not 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.990
 change them but the bike should be 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.530
 necessarily with electric starter to not 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.250
 remember the disadvantages of these knee pads 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.590
 if you have any questions 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:05.010
 suggestions or do you want to give me money 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.990
 suddenly write about it to everyone in 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.830
 comments like 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.230

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:18.380
