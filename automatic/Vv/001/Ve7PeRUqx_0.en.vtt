00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
it but the blaster itself was a brand

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.880 
it but the blaster itself was a brand
new<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:03.869> got<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.259> about<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.860> year<00:02:05.819> ago<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
new and I got it about a year ago and

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.680 
new and I got it about a year ago and
yes<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.069> stickers<00:02:08.429> were<00:02:08.700> completely<00:02:09.420> dried<00:02:09.660> up

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
just fell off to prove just how old this

in powerup mode like that just place
your<00:02:40.920> fingers<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.579> wings<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:41.909> this<00:02:42.090> and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
your fingers in the wings like this and

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.509 
your fingers in the wings like this and
it's<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.879> lot<00:02:45.030> more<00:02:45.239> powerful<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.970> yes<00:02:48.180> um

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
it's a lot more powerful so yes um

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.490 
it's a lot more powerful so yes um
pretty<00:02:50.519> cool<00:02:50.639> blaster<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.569> as<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.260> Delta

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
pretty cool blaster that as the Delta

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.809 
pretty cool blaster that as the Delta
Corps<00:02:52.650> here<00:02:52.829> are<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.010> three<00:02:53.190> folding<00:02:53.519> pieces

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
Corps here are the three folding pieces

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.610 
Corps here are the three folding pieces
just<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.090> blazing<00:02:54.510> kaiser<00:02:54.690> for<00:02:55.109> a<00:02:55.139> more

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
just like blazing kaiser for a more

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.599 
just like blazing kaiser for a more
powerful<00:02:55.769> shot<00:02:56.159> and<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:57.450> has<00:02:57.629> wing<00:02:58.019> armor

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
powerful shot and it has wing armor

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.849 
powerful shot and it has wing armor
which<00:02:59.689> gives<00:03:00.689> it<00:03:00.780> even<00:03:00.840> more<00:03:01.079> power<00:03:01.349> when<00:03:01.709> it's

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
which gives it even more power when it's

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.199 
which gives it even more power when it's
in<00:03:01.980> there<00:03:02.159> and<00:03:02.340> then<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.609> can<00:03:02.760> give<00:03:02.879> it<00:03:03.000> three

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
in there and then you can give it three

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.910 
in there and then you can give it three
times<00:03:03.420> as<00:03:03.599> more<00:03:03.810> power<00:03:03.989> when<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.379> use<00:03:04.650> the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
times as more power when you use the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.470 
times as more power when you use the
power<00:03:05.099> up<00:03:05.250> mode<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.930> yes<00:03:07.079> it's<00:03:07.290> pretty<00:03:07.439> cool

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
power up mode so yes it's pretty cool

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.119 
power up mode so yes it's pretty cool
this<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.780> predecessor<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:10.920> cobalt

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
this is the predecessor to the cobalt

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.509 
this is the predecessor to the cobalt
super<00:03:11.430> fire<00:03:11.639> my<00:03:12.180> later<00:03:12.389> reviews<00:03:12.780> as<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:14.400> can

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
super fire my later reviews as you can

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.170 
super fire my later reviews as you can
tell

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
tell

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.080 
tell
actually<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.290> don't<00:03:16.739> know<00:03:16.799> why<00:03:16.980> but<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.549> me<00:03:17.879> he

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
actually I don't know why but to me he

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.599 
actually I don't know why but to me he
feels<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.629> lot<00:03:18.840> stronger<00:03:19.169> than<00:03:19.379> a<00:03:19.859> cobalt<00:03:20.400> saber

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
feels a lot stronger than a cobalt saber

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.839 
feels a lot stronger than a cobalt saber
fire<00:03:21.829> just<00:03:22.829> in<00:03:23.010> general<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.459> don't<00:03:23.489> know<00:03:23.669> why

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
fire just in general I don't know why

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.170 
fire just in general I don't know why
but<00:03:24.169> it's<00:03:25.169> I<00:03:25.769> tested<00:03:26.370> them<00:03:26.459> out<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:26.790> they<00:03:26.970> seem

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
but it's I tested them out and they seem

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.000 
but it's I tested them out and they seem
to<00:03:27.209> be<00:03:27.329> pretty<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:28.530> one<00:03:28.709> seems<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:28.919> be

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
to be pretty this one seems to be

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.990 
to be pretty this one seems to be
stronger<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.970> don't<00:03:30.599> know<00:03:30.659> about<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:31.019> but

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
stronger so I don't know about that but

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.170 
stronger so I don't know about that but
what<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.120> supposed<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.419> mean<00:03:33.629> but<00:03:33.989> uh<00:03:35.000> yeah

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
what that supposed to mean but uh yeah

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.589 
what that supposed to mean but uh yeah
so<00:03:37.220> again<00:03:38.220> not<00:03:38.790> much<00:03:39.030> other<00:03:39.329> than<00:03:39.359> that

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
so again not much other than that

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.710 
so again not much other than that
there's<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.459> as<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:42.030> can<00:03:42.120> see<00:03:42.239> sticker<00:03:42.510> fell
