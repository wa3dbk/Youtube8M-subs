00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.809
 small novelty of 2011 is the adjustment of the Catalan tuye small reminder 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.139
 of the kill that adjusts and can be said to judge them w 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.710
 so we're going to let these all the police found here 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 the click 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.990
 so kill him when we find him here in the moline graph all the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.649
 wish 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.979
 or else m simply when you put it must 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.159
 you find him 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.270
 auxerre 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.410
 I am looking for blame 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.530
 ok here 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.250
 and that's in the milk formations related to the coast feels the departure 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.010
 for the novelties we will see here 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.490
 it's cecile let's look a little bit is used right now so here's where 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.740
 pointed eugenia cidap also that he cultivated my texture directly in the 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.670
 old Port 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.510
 I'm going to switch to wired mode by pressing ps3 and I get here at 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.250
 middle 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.830
 people can loose 3 and we can see that I'm going to pull the texture 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830
 which is relative to the selected vertices 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.690
 at the jetty below so we can see that I'm moving here in relation to 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.910
 vertex which is for the chooses 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.890
 the death of saif attention 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.540
 ok 2 to disable the yucaipa classic option 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.250
 it's not just the principle here it's what interests me 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.100
 understand 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.540
 for aqua cerles click then 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.770
 the world 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.450
 the click here click% and I can handle with more control 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.950
 directly outside and with schists the interior takes place at the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.899
 force and the area of ​​influence 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.770
 and if I work on the vw map match at gold number nesle 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.619
 while jose% 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.070
 a now go get what I want to back up beforehand 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.290
 and let's look a little bit here is a shape that has been completely stretch 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.290
 and whose low texture suffered state to formations and that's not terrible 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.680
 so we're just going to watch what the well can do beautiful avoid moving 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.280
 in this way it is useless 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.259
 on the other hand if you press one does not use the tüik stop 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.969
 you then relaxed and it allowed acts 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.900
 2 directly directly 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.070
 loosening and properly redistributing w washers it's a 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.269
 relaxe who is directly 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.840
 included in the tuc here so for them to continue my work I support everything 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.180
 just on total ah that's also one of the novelties quite 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.090
 interesting that allows like that to replace it puts textures and power 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.519
 redistribute my textures a bit more cleanly on an object that has undergone like 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.219
 that deformations and fairness shots 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.329
 simply the texts 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.819
 gold for alger call auger summer like this so we will reload it ourselves 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.169
 want to show 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.479
 so I'm doing shit 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:54.069
 to reload it and I do a duplicate of this geometry 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:58.100
 so I open it I take it with a figure that can do a double 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.529
 so that we can see the issues 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.779
 kiya on the geometry before she took 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:07.219
 so I'm going to actually use these and I insist that I support everything 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.799
 simply safe stop 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.799
 and I redistribute the texture 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.649
 pressing palettes 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:17.619
 correctly 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.619
 so if I go out for two of relaxing years 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.249
 we see now also I want to compare with this one 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:39.989
 the corrections that were made
