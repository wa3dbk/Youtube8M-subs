you can feel they're a little more
knifey<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.799> they<00:01:34.979> drop<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.030> bit

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
knifey that they drop down a little bit

more from the top when your weights back
here<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> helps<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> push<00:01:38.880> off<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> wave

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
about 511 169 foot 2 is really good for

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.740 
about 511 169 foot 2 is really good for
me<00:01:49.610> some<00:01:50.610> people<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.000> longer<00:01:51.240> boards<00:01:51.659> just

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
me some people like longer boards just

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.210 
me some people like longer boards just
because<00:01:52.140> there's<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.500> much<00:01:52.680> easier<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.100> get

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
because there's so much easier to get

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.840 
because there's so much easier to get
into<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:54.600> want<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> look<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.200> is

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
into what you really want to look for is

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
into what you really want to look for is
does<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> board<00:01:57.210> keep<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.140> above<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.469> water

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
does the board keep you above the water

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.510 
does the board keep you above the water
and<00:01:59.390> is<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.860> enough<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.219> keep<00:02:02.340> in

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
and is it enough for you to keep in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.490 
and is it enough for you to keep in
control<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.630> were<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.840> go<00:02:03.960> out<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> surf

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
control if I were to go out in the surf

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.929 
control if I were to go out in the surf
for<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> 12<00:02:04.979> foot<00:02:05.100> board<00:02:05.340> I'd<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> hard

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
for the 12 foot board I'd have a hard

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.819 
for the 12 foot board I'd have a hard
time<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.210> know<00:02:06.360> running<00:02:07.200> back<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> tail

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
time you know running back to the tail

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.619 
time you know running back to the tail
and<00:02:08.069> lean<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> whole<00:02:08.849> thing<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.270> turn<00:02:09.479> it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
and lean in the whole thing to turn it

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.020 
and lean in the whole thing to turn it
so<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.530> really<00:02:10.800> don't<00:02:10.920> want<00:02:11.039> to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
so you really don't want to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.480 
so you really don't want to
put<00:02:12.450> too<00:02:12.600> much<00:02:12.750> work<00:02:13.020> into<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.310> you

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
put too much work into it this is you

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.040 
put too much work into it this is you
know<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> good<00:02:15.150> length<00:02:15.330> for<00:02:15.570> me<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:15.870> it

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
know this is a good length for me but it

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.810 
know this is a good length for me but it
really<00:02:16.230> depends<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.740> your<00:02:17.070> height<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.550> your

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
really depends on your height and your

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.760 
really depends on your height and your
weight<00:02:17.850> keeps<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.630> afloat<00:02:18.720> what<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.560> feel

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
weight keeps you afloat what you feel

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.760 
weight keeps you afloat what you feel
comfortable<00:02:19.800> with<00:02:20.310> surfing<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.770> that's

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
comfortable with surfing on and that's

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.150 
comfortable with surfing on and that's
pretty<00:02:22.890> much<00:02:23.010> how<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.400> choose<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> longboard
