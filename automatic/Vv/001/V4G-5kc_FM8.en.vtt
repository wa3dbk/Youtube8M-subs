00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.799
 Already today our society is in 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.280
 highly dependent on resources 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.160
 future technologies, for example 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.540
 Electromobility will be this situation 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.700
 due to the rising demand 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.450
 critical and expensive raw materials continue 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.949
 toughen 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.980
 Therefore, the training of professionals 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.510
 in an efficient and sustainable way 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.310
 with resources of vital importance 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.449
 meaning for strategy and try 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.090
 we make the connections between 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.050
 lifestyle and use of materials 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.710
 of raw materials 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.540
 We are trying efficient raw material 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.090
 value chain and we 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.860
 then try new ones for the future 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.260
 to show the way with materials 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.680
 be efficiently and sustainably bypassed 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.050
 can 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.360
 we are on the verge of lightweight construction 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.340
 new technology in the order 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.820
 Of course that has to be emptied 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.100
 become 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.780
 we are beyond that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.149
 are subject to diverse resources 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.120
 price and availability risks more modern 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.140
 Business can be a decisive one 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.910
 competitive advantage through a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.769
 Economic evaluation of these risks 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.020
 get in front of the company 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.520
 challenge the long-term 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.240
 Impact of resource scarcity too 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.830
 manage 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.260
 to pass this challenge 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.960
 on the one hand that in the long term the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.759
 commodity prices are rising exponentially and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.759
 on the other hand is short term too 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.619
 violent price fluctuations can occur 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.900
 therefore they need techno economically 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.820
 qualified decision makers the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.430
 on the one hand are able 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.850
 all technological possibilities for 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.500
 Reduction of raw material use too 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.290
 use or on the other side in the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.380
 location are the remaining price risks 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.850
 to manage financially 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.890
 That's why we train our students in 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.990
 both areas out so they later 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.149
 as decision-makers are in a position to 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.700
 a contribution to the sustainable 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.329
 long-term use of raw materials too 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.579
 Afford 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.500
 in financial methods 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.810
 technical innovations carry the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.659
 lightweight construction for sustainable use 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.310
 scarce resources we develop 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.450
 materials where the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.430
 material development already 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.120
 account 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.740
 how is the raw material 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.330
 situation in which quantity comes the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.550
 raw material before which ministries would have 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.770
 be used to reduce it at 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.410
 take into account the product development 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.960
 We that the production process material 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.170
 and energy must be efficient and that 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.490
 product must be able to recycle 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.390
 example here in augsburg are the 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.040
 carbon fiber reinforced plastics 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.380
 a super lightweight material with the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.630
 lecturing mechanical properties 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.230
 These are a necessity for the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.800
 electromobility 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.750
 economic engineers thus create 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.370
 bridge between 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.180
 business administration and engineering you 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.670
 are due to their 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.180
 business management and 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.980
 scientific technical 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.380
 strong training at the labor market 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.660
 asked mark of the in his 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.910
 orientation throughout Germany 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.990
 unique augsburg study course 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.750
 Business engineer is the connection 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.790
 of the three partial areas described 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.470
 resources strategy 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.820
 economics and 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.990
 Materials science graduate of the 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.330
 augsburg study program 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.460
 economic engineer and therefore optimal 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.180
 on the challenges in research 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.520
 and practice prepared students went in 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.550
 augsburg lernet optimal equipment in 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.700
 Great surroundings and the best 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.040
 care ratios the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.870
 bridge between 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.140
 Business administration and technology the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.640
 campus university is ideal for that 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.080
 study site with green areas and 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.480
 to see a park with 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.340
 besides, libraries are mensa at 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.480
 Lecture places close to each other 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.130
 gain competencies to one 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.459
 unique in Germany 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.459
 constellation
