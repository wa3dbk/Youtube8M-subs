preparation<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.280> 94<00:00:50.180> was<00:00:50.330> actually<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:50.780> good

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
preparation so 94 was actually a good

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.979 
preparation so 94 was actually a good
move<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.409> Knight<00:00:51.620> f3<00:00:51.830> and<00:00:52.239> takes<00:00:53.239> on<00:00:53.479> g2<00:00:53.809> King

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
takes you to a five and this was still

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.670 
takes you to a five and this was still
all<00:00:56.540> my<00:00:56.690> preparation<00:00:57.110> it<00:00:57.199> was<00:00:57.320> mentioned

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
all my preparation it was mentioned

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.740 
all my preparation it was mentioned
actually<00:00:58.040> I<00:00:58.070> think<00:00:58.369> in<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.549> article<00:00:59.180> I<00:00:59.330> think<00:00:59.690> it

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
actually I think in a article I think it

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.700 
actually I think in a article I think it
was<00:00:59.900> on<00:01:00.049> chess<00:01:00.260> base<00:01:00.549> dot-com<00:01:01.549> and<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.710> this

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
was on chess base dot-com and so this

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.830 
was on chess base dot-com and so this
line<00:01:03.949> is<00:01:03.979> supposed<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.519> be<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.699> force<00:01:05.330> draw<00:01:05.570> I

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
line is supposed to be a force draw I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.530 
line is supposed to be a force draw I
look<00:01:06.350> at<00:01:06.440> it<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.590> bit<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.010> force<00:01:07.580> draw<00:01:07.850> yeah

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
look at it a bit and force draw yeah

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.899 
look at it a bit and force draw yeah
apart<00:01:08.990> if<00:01:09.170> Y<00:01:09.799> defended<00:01:10.310> well<00:01:10.460> but<00:01:10.640> I<00:01:10.670> think

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
apart if Y defended well but I think

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.719 
apart if Y defended well but I think
like<00:01:11.060> us<00:01:11.240> absolutely<00:01:11.750> no<00:01:11.869> problems<00:01:12.289> but<00:01:13.070> um<00:01:13.340> I

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
like us absolutely no problems but um I

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.029 
like us absolutely no problems but um I
saw<00:01:14.420> this<00:01:14.570> in<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:14.869> chess<00:01:15.170> base<00:01:15.350> article<00:01:15.710> I<00:01:15.829> think

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
saw this in a chess base article I think

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.700 
saw this in a chess base article I think
so<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.159> wasn't<00:01:16.640> expecting<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:17.539> to<00:01:17.840> be<00:01:18.109> employed

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
so I wasn't expecting it to be employed

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.310 
so I wasn't expecting it to be employed
because<00:01:18.950> I'm<00:01:19.250> pretty<00:01:19.579> sure<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:20.049> Vasily<00:01:21.049> knew

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
because I'm pretty sure that Vasily knew

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.800 
because I'm pretty sure that Vasily knew
it<00:01:21.469> but<00:01:21.710> apparently<00:01:22.490> he<00:01:22.670> didn't<00:01:23.030> which<00:01:23.509> was<00:01:23.780> a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
it but apparently he didn't which was a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.149 
it but apparently he didn't which was a
good<00:01:24.530> thing<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:26.200> after<00:01:27.200> Knight<00:01:27.560> g2<00:01:27.920> which

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
good thing and after Knight g2 which

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.550 
good thing and after Knight g2 which
very<00:01:28.490> good<00:01:28.609> move<00:01:28.729> King<00:01:28.909> do<00:01:29.030> 285<00:01:29.509> I<00:01:29.750> think<00:01:30.439> maybe

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
very good move King do 285 I think maybe

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.959 
very good move King do 285 I think maybe
as<00:01:31.399> vasily<00:01:31.909> said<00:01:32.090> maybe<00:01:32.299> c4<00:01:32.780> or<00:01:32.929> a4<00:01:33.619> but<00:01:34.340> he

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
as vasily said maybe c4 or a4 but he

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.480 
as vasily said maybe c4 or a4 but he
took<00:01:35.119> on<00:01:35.270> e7<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.899> which<00:01:36.380> Queen<00:01:36.890> takes<00:01:36.979> e7<00:01:37.399> and

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
took on e7 and which Queen takes e7 and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.370 
took on e7 and which Queen takes e7 and
c3<00:01:37.939> which<00:01:38.119> was<00:01:38.329> probably<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.749> mistake<00:01:38.929> after

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
c3 which was probably a mistake after

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.580 
c3 which was probably a mistake after
rook<00:01:39.890> a6<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:41.479> position<00:01:41.869> became<00:01:42.170> difficult

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
rook a6 the position became difficult

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.770 
rook a6 the position became difficult
for<00:01:42.859> him<00:01:43.100> in<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.369> force<00:01:43.640> draw<00:01:43.880> became<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.659> kind

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
for him in a force draw became the kind

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.560 
for him in a force draw became the kind
of<00:01:44.929> like<00:01:45.049> a<00:01:45.079> forced<00:01:45.380> win<00:01:45.530> for<00:01:45.710> black<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.570> did

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
of like a forced win for black and did

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.510 
of like a forced win for black and did
you<00:01:47.719> speak<00:01:47.960> with<00:01:47.990> him<00:01:48.200> after<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.619> game<00:01:48.649> I<00:01:49.009> yes

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
you speak with him after the game I yes

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.410 
you speak with him after the game I yes
he<00:01:49.729> mentioned

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
he mentioned

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.380 
he mentioned
instead<00:01:50.869> of<00:01:51.020> his<00:01:51.229> move<00:01:51.409> C<00:01:51.619> 3<00:01:51.799> C<00:01:52.069> 4<00:01:52.100> maybe<00:01:53.350> but<00:01:54.350> I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
instead of his move C 3 C 4 maybe but I

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.109 
instead of his move C 3 C 4 maybe but I

five<00:02:08.990> actually<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.679> position<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.780> kind<00:02:11.780> of

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
five actually the position is kind of

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.899 
five actually the position is kind of
simple<00:02:12.110> because<00:02:12.440> doctor<00:02:13.130> turns<00:02:13.340> through<00:02:13.489> a6

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
simple because doctor turns through a6

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.119 
simple because doctor turns through a6

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
of no time to make defensive moves but

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
of no time to make defensive moves but
um<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:25.360> really<00:02:26.360> wasn't<00:02:26.540> expecting<00:02:27.230> anyone<00:02:27.950> to
