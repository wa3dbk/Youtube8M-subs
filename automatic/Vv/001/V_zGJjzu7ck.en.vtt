especially<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.610> place<00:00:38.820> like<00:00:39.030> dome<00:00:39.300> which

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
especially on the place like dome which

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.799 
especially on the place like dome which
is<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> smallest<00:00:39.899> map<00:00:40.260> um<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.420> it's<00:00:42.420> just

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
is the smallest map um and it's just

have two people so um what we did is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.530 
have two people so um what we did is
basically<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.589> camp<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.880> end<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
basically just camp on that end and I

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.090 
basically just camp on that end and I
camped<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.500> starts<00:01:07.950> out

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
camped on this and in it starts out

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.899 
camped on this and in it starts out
really<00:01:08.909> slow<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.130> only<00:01:11.700> one

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
really slow because of there is only one

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.550 
really slow because of there is only one
person<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.390> kill<00:01:12.630> people<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.140> usually<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
person that can kill people so usually I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.620 
person that can kill people so usually I
run<00:01:13.740> out<00:01:13.890> try<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.790> six<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:15.479> seven

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630

run out try to get like six or seven
kills<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.799> once<00:01:17.250> there's<00:01:17.520> four<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:17.850> five

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.080 
kills and then once there's four or five
people<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.229> usually<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:20.310> crack<00:01:20.759> up<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
people then I usually can crack up the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.820 
people then I usually can crack up the
cosi<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.720> more<00:01:21.900> now<00:01:22.350> I'm<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> speed<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
cosi or more now I'm going to speed it

cosi or more now I'm going to speed it
up<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.759> gets<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
up just a little because this gets a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.149 
up just a little because this gets a
little<00:01:24.150> boring<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.500> also<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.830> down<00:01:25.979> when

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
little boring and then also it down when

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
little boring and then also it down when
the<00:01:26.250> good<00:01:26.400> part<00:01:26.610> gets<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.090> um<00:01:27.350> yeah<00:01:28.350> this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the good part gets in but um yeah this

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.109 
the good part gets in but um yeah this
I'm<00:01:28.799> just<00:01:28.950> going<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.159> talk<00:01:29.340> about<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.880> in

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

and<00:01:49.760> it<00:01:50.760> started<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.570> whenever<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.470> had

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680

and it started out in whenever you had
44<00:01:53.100> magnums<00:01:53.520> vs.<00:01:53.909> knife<00:01:54.090> because<00:01:55.610> infection

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
44 magnums vs. knife because infection

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.859 
44 magnums vs. knife because infection
people<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.090> infected<00:01:57.270> always<00:01:57.720> have

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
people that are infected always have

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.690 
people that are infected always have
knives<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.800> don't<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.040> any<00:01:59.220> guns<00:01:59.400> unless

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
knives they don't have any guns unless

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.969 
knives they don't have any guns unless
of<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> first<00:02:00.300> align<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.960> they're<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.830> first

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
of the first align if they're the first

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.969 
of the first align if they're the first
that's<00:02:02.310> infected<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:04.080> versus<00:02:04.470> 17<00:02:04.830> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that's infected if it's one versus 17 it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.200 
that's infected if it's one versus 17 it
would<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.190> little<00:02:05.340> cheap<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.640> only<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
would be a little cheap with only a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.600 
would be a little cheap with only a
knife<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.140> they<00:02:07.470> sometimes<00:02:07.770> start<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.399> with

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
knife so they sometimes start out with

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.510 
knife so they sometimes start out with
guns<00:02:09.239> until<00:02:09.600> they<00:02:09.959> get<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.289> next<00:02:10.500> kill<00:02:10.679> they

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
guns until they get the next kill they

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.059 
guns until they get the next kill they
give<00:02:11.819> only<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.300> knife<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.780> they<00:02:13.470> used<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.920> have

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
give only a knife and they used to have

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.010 
give only a knife and they used to have
it<00:02:14.280> where<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.730> was<00:02:14.880> only<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.330> knife<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
it where it was only a knife and a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.449 
it where it was only a knife and a
throwing<00:02:16.380> knife<00:02:16.410> which<00:02:17.100> made<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.430> very

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
throwing knife which made it very

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.320 
throwing knife which made it very
difficult<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.360> camp<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.080> places<00:02:19.590> or<00:02:19.860> i<00:02:20.610> guess<00:02:21.180> a

we just can't but back to what i was
saying<00:02:43.100> they<00:02:44.100> had<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> throwing<00:02:44.670> knife<00:02:44.700> until<00:02:45.030> a

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
saying they had a throwing knife until a

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.059 
saying they had a throwing knife until a
recent<00:02:45.780> patch<00:02:45.959> which<00:02:46.230> was<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.560> believe<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.860> day

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
recent patch which was I believe a day

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.210 
recent patch which was I believe a day
after<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.880> think<00:02:48.319> after<00:02:49.319> Sunday<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.100> it

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
after it I think after Sunday that it

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.710 
after it I think after Sunday that it
was<00:02:50.340> released<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.880> they<00:02:51.300> took<00:02:51.480> away<00:02:51.600> all

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
was released and they took away all

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.880 
was released and they took away all
throwing<00:02:52.140> knives<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:55.650> know<00:02:56.040> no<00:02:56.810> infected

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
it at all other than the fact that I

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.490 
it at all other than the fact that I
wanted<00:05:35.210> to<00:05:35.300> get<00:05:35.389> my<00:05:35.449> best<00:05:35.930> kill<00:05:36.139> streak<00:05:36.169> which

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
wanted to get my best kill streak which
