00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.399 

see<00:04:21.909> it's<00:04:22.909> starting<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.360> take<00:04:23.509> shape<00:04:23.569> it<00:04:24.169> is

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:24.409 
see it's starting to take shape it is

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.040 
see it's starting to take shape it is
it's<00:04:24.740> all<00:04:24.830> coming<00:04:25.159> clear<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.580> me<00:04:25.699> now<00:04:25.729> okay<00:04:26.210> so

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
it's all coming clear to me now okay so

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.350 
it's all coming clear to me now okay so
then<00:04:27.440> we<00:04:27.590> just<00:04:27.620> do<00:04:27.979> right<00:04:28.190> sides<00:04:28.460> together<00:04:28.759> and

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
then we just do right sides together and

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.140 
then we just do right sides together and
you<00:04:29.479> match<00:04:29.659> the<00:04:29.990> side<00:04:30.199> scenes<00:04:30.639> you<00:04:31.639> just<00:04:31.879> slide

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
you match the side scenes you just slide

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.760 
you match the side scenes you just slide
this<00:04:32.690> right<00:04:33.430> over<00:04:34.430> your<00:04:34.460> skirts<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.770> then

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
once you have it in position you're

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.420 
once you have it in position you're
going<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.080> pin<00:04:39.379> and<00:04:39.560> stitch<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.280> you're

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
going to pin and stitch it and you're

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.719 
going to pin and stitch it and you're
going<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.580> stitch<00:04:40.819> like<00:04:41.090> right<00:04:41.360> along<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:42.139> top

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
going to stitch like right along the top

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.080 
going to stitch like right along the top
it<00:04:43.729> will<00:04:43.909> look<00:04:44.030> just<00:04:44.060> like<00:04:44.330> this<00:04:45.909> so<00:04:46.909> now<00:04:47.030> we

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
it will look just like this so now we

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.360 
it will look just like this so now we
just<00:04:47.150> need<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.539> make<00:04:47.659> that<00:04:47.720> case<00:04:48.139> in<00:04:48.250> so<00:04:49.250> we

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
just need to make that case in so we

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.360 
just need to make that case in so we
need<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:49.610> turn<00:04:49.909> it<00:04:50.110> wrong<00:04:51.110> side<00:04:51.440> out<00:04:53.110> mm-hmm

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
need to turn it wrong side out mm-hmm

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.350 
need to turn it wrong side out mm-hmm
and<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.789> first<00:04:56.000> time<00:04:56.210> I<00:04:56.240> did<00:04:56.509> this<00:04:56.690> I<00:04:58.360> just

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
and the first time I did this I just

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.899 
and the first time I did this I just
folded<00:04:59.719> it<00:04:59.949> like<00:05:00.949> here<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.400> I<00:05:01.490> was<00:05:01.669> like<00:05:01.759> why

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909
