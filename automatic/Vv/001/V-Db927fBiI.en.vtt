00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.110
 hello friends how are they are they are 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.060
 of the best and welcome to a new and 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.830
 from minecraft in which I bring you one 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.050
 we have called ay bng 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.360
 good friends in what this mmo consists 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.029
 want to add two new items the aib 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.430
 in chile there are 20 blogs practically in 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.310
 The similarity to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.650
 plus then I do not know until the aib in plus 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.020
 it's bigger and what they want then 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.060
 well the poster the way he wanted it 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.489
 do and well they respect each other here we have the 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.730
 live bench that its character then is 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.530
 simple we need 4 ingot of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.130
 iron not in every corner then gold 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.320
 then in the center a glass panel and 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.180
 up we have a casting cut here 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.600
 a little red ball that is created with a 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.250
 chest a kraft eo table and an apple 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.110
 up we have finally the last ones 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.850
 blueprint that these these planes of 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.590
 cristian with what would be a book in the 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.659
 center and around lapis lazuli 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.060
 it's like a little blue book, this is not going to 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.070
 give our bench if we want the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.080
 throw it away there are 20 blogs that is bigger 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.899
 as has been said and with more 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.860
 technology is therefore assumed in place in the 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.230
 pellet 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.910
 red we put the golden ball that has 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.760
 red apple cloud we are an apple 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.740
 golden then the only difference but 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.230
 I do not see much difference then in the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.510
 two items then we open our 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.760
 event we already have it open as they can 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.470
 see is a table of character this alone 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.300
 that is portable you can not go running and 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.940
 addons open it and bndg in the air so 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.100
 while they are going to give to see this there are 20 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.200
 while you're drowning and then since 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.120
 you have it open nothing more then you put on 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.440
 to character normally let's say you put on 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.180
 to distribute as many times what 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.820
 we do when we change that we're going to 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.710
 distribute many minerals and we want 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.690
 create many at the same time but but not 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.660
 we can distribute well it is difficult for us 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.840
 how we do it or rays we sting in 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.570
 this scale or if vascular itch and 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.270
 now that balance is distributed 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 automatically everything alone which is 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.850
 a very beautiful thing, and here we have 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.830
 seven in each slot only in ones what 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.810
 we have eight because then because it is 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.910
 a 64 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.680
 it will always be left over then one goes 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.890
 to have eight in a box and if 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.860
 we want to rotate everything and everyone 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.140
 ordered as the disorder ism and what 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.940
 wants to rotate nothing else for now 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.530
 for for then character of a better 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.230
 so you can rotate it with this 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.959
 button second button that appears here in 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.970
 the center and then we rotate it 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.500
 simply then if I already did in chinga 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.959
 I do not think I throw anything away because I do 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.120
 is I have to take things out for things to what 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.920
 laziness then instead of doing all that 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.900
 nothing else you apply the little arrow is and 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.760
 everything is automatically downloaded only 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.370
 then it is very epic 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.430
 you can also apply the shift's 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.650
 to picarle shift and to create everything you 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.630
 they chirp shift and climb alone as well as 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.120
 when they do it in the chests that the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.220
 most of us use shift this 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.490
 so to pass them item faster not 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.740
 we have to say it for saturn 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.590
 instead of going one by one then 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.050
 It's a new feature that always 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.870
 I've wished when kraft picarle shift and 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.730
 that and then in this way we can already 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.500
 recreate it 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.380
 So if you want a shorter path 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.820
 in locating these buttons for 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.060
 rebalance and do this kind of thing 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.700
 so we can chop it to the w key and 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.560
 will balance air chop it w then what 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.470
 we can press the d key 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.270
 and we started to rotate the key and also 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.180
 we rotate but for the other side for the 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.599
 opposite direction and with the s key 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.300
 we went down then with a double vsd 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:53.150
 we can maneuver and manipulate this 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.890
 event then well it is very epic not 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.440
 here we have again creation for 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.090
 to see the difference that really 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.760
 It could be that the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.130
 another achilles and chopping shift and the only thing 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.920
 what it does is come back to the 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.030
 fast bar below then why not 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.920
 nothing else happens 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.530
 it really is very frustrating not being able to 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.880
 do it on the kraft table then 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.160
 Well, if we want to grow, we have 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.370
 to do one for one of the water home 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.840
 and if we want to balance, guess what 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.479
 what can not we balance we have to 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.510
 do it manually then then we 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.040
 It helped a lot because everyone I'm sure 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.169
 that this mode will serve you well 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.840
 Gentlemen, because it's good for me 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.580
 pretty and well if you say ado 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.139
 plus event should be as 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.080
 practically the same nothing else that is 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.150
 more iris masses than technological the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.520
 not roll but how could it rain 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.020
 the same and in the forum 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.690
 the big difference nothing else you can 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.450
 to make it civic there are 20 la la la 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.880
 most technological thing in the universe at 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.150
 better there may be a small or something 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.580
 light that exists out there from different 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.410
 no but really then I was 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.840
 checking and I do not see anything different I 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.990
 totally the same then if I'm wrong 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.580
 do not do not kill me I did not earn liens 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.980
 I the second if you can do something 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.870
 well epic then well then it's very 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.940
 well what is then something very epic but 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.340
 I understand that later on there 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.980
 nothing nothing else is 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.010
 well a little bit bigger this roll does not 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.500
 I sold and then sold not not know for sure 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.660
 yes that means that it doubles as the 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.840
 iphone 6 in the insurance and I sold 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.460
 mean that but I think it's good 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.040
 gentlemen this has been the mod of today 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.389
 I hope you have loved them already 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.550
 it is but at night that means that 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.070
 I have to go to shelter before 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.350
 I die for these areas so 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.639
 dangerous lords then I'm going to 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.250
 the Galaxy 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.770
 see you gentlemen I do not go to my house that 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.450
 is in that star they see that 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.300
 square star there is where I live already 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.620
 good signs mud until the next if 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.110
