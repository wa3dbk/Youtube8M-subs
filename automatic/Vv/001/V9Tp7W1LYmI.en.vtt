00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
white and everything so but you can see

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
white and everything so but you can see
that<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.970> actually<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> round<00:01:09.930> pattern<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that it actually is a round pattern that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.679 
that it actually is a round pattern that
it<00:01:10.860> throws<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> square<00:01:12.450> pattern

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
it throws it is in the square pattern

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.030 
it throws it is in the square pattern
even<00:01:12.900> though<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> palette<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.530> square<00:01:13.830> it's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
even though the palette is square it's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.969 
even though the palette is square it's
kind<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> odd<00:01:14.400> but<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.600> here's<00:01:15.840> red<00:01:16.140> let's<00:01:16.799> see

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
kind of odd but so here's red let's see

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.230 
kind of odd but so here's red let's see
