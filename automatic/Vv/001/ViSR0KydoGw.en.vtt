00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 this 40th anniversary represents for me 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 a very big party it's absolutely 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.340
 extraordinary that was done that's 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.010
 really a very big pride when we 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.870
 sees hub position at cardiff occupies 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.179
 today 40 years 36 countries 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.789
 ten thousand employees 90 million 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.779
 customers the happiness cardiff was all 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.510
 my professional life 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.140
 it was an adventure that I 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.140
 wish everyone 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.800
 I am very confident about the future of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.559
 our business because the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.300
 fundamental essentials they are human 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.230
 the whole film unfolds in my head I 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.220
 measure the distance traveled since the half 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.320
 floor rented in 1973 in neuilly up 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.629
 the huge building of the headquarters of nanterre 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.970
 to which are added the numerous 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.839
 implantations in France and in 36 countries 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.390
 in the world 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.839
 at startup it was a very small 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.480
 team 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.010
 when I arrived in 87 we were 280 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.080
 today we are ten thousand in the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.190
 mans where there has been a progression 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.770
 fantastic on a generation 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.020
 one of the reasons that make the success of 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.630
 bnp paribas cardif it was 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.500
 undeniably the vision that kills 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.360
 its promoters that we could develop 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.159
 an insurance activity in France in 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.890
 the framework of a very large banking group 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.680
 from the beginning I had the feeling of 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.479
 participate in a real upheaval 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.399
 useful for the market the method of 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.110
 distribution was to use 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.909
 infrastructures that belong to 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.799
 others for somehow there 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.180
 to nest and sell a product 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.740
 the great idea is to go do a 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.330
 job that is not the job of the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.840
 bank in the bank for customers 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.310
 from the bank 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.899
 when we want to make the partnership this 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.890
 which is the key to cardiff's success 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.319
 also by the way 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.100
 the key to the success of cetelem it takes this 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.869
 openness 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.490
 this notion of opening the opening 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.770
 to the other to always go find a 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.960
 new partner to recover 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.560
 cause this mindset characterizes well 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.450
 cardiff 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.640
 we were convinced that this 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.210
 approach was the right one when with the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.399
 cetelem 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.659
 it was well understood that together we 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.060
 could work very very 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.110
 effectively to the interest of customers to 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.909
 from there there was no reason 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.410
 we can not renew the same 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.149
 schema with other partners 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.980
 everything being in the confidence in the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.690
 transparency and research so 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.410
 mutual synergies the quality of the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.510
 partnership 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.640
 it is the object of a permanent dialogue 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.650
 with cardiff teams 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.360
 cardiff has preserved while being 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.160
 now a good boat this envy of 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.900
 move this desire to innovate this 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.010
 want to conquer shares 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.980
 of market so it's a spirit 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.040
 interesting bnp paribas cardif and rci 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.140
 founds two trades that end up 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.030
 around the motorist this is the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.000
 meeting of two actors in motion 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.580
 perpetual to say in syria facing cardiff 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.650
 and the only insurer that has its 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.269
 own innovation innovation department 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.239
 and who develop innovations with 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.430
 his clients I think that having 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.280
 relations of equals with his 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.410
 partner 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.440
 does that best describe the 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.150
 cardiff philosophy the development 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.800
 of insurance during these forty 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.360
 recent years has been spectacular 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.190
 besides in all areas for 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.630
 an insurer 10 is extremely important 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.490
 to know and follow the evolution 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.350
 demographic and social and at each 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.540
 time it will have to discern the 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.819
 trends to position themselves and find 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.170
 the right answer to these evolutions which 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.470
 will manifest themselves in all 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.770
 statutory tax areas 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.770
 social demographics 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.780
 early on the cardiff teams were 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.880
 interested in international 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.080
 expand abroad cardiff has 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.910
 first did a real job 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.310
 of exploration ie from a 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.430
 some way left a little to 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.720
 the adventurer is so very modestly 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.670
 but what already seemed to us 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.100
 audacious we told ourselves why 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.670
 do not go anywhere where there is 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.500
 development 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.990
 because everywhere there is development 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.910
 credit is everywhere there is 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.590
 credit there is need for insurance and in 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.510
 Point and predict our business 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.340
 model is very simple and our business 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.610
 model it replicable in all of 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.530
 country 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.060
 and that's a major asset in the 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.520
 national development all our countries 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.620
 are led by the true leaders 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.900
 from companies that originated 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.790
 country where we operate who know 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.860
 their markets that know their 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.150
 partners and who have a broad 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.190
 autonomy in their development 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.990
 taking into account the results obtained with 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.250
 our partners in our initiatives in 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.600
 retail banking and our 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.489
 recent investments aimed at 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.380
 increase our capabilities in digital 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.150
 I am confident in the potential of 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.660
 growth of our distribution channels 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.610
 in this area the secret of the successful 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.890
 it's finally the mobilization of 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.820
 each at his level in his relationship 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.680
 with the customer 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.300
 the tough manners n-trig program is 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.130
 this idea of ​​organizing the business 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.380
 around the customers and throughout the 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.090
 customer's life cycle we accompany him 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.510
 gradually as the live products 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.520
 with him what counts in the company 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.780
 it's the team and those who count in 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.640
 the team is the spirit 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.380
 we tried to draw inspiration from that 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.790
 precept throughout the course of life 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.240
 we consider it our 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.030
 business 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.740
 this appropriation makes everyone 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.650
 works in the general interest 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.570
 it's a very collegiate culture very 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.910
 respectful of the other very friendly 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.500
 where everyone is aware that success 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.830
 can only be collective 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.689
 we will work on that 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.179
 the set of 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.939
 our approaches to our products and our 

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:16.769
 process be adapted to this world 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.269
 digital who is smiling 

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:21.179
 the challenge of digital is 

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:23.729
 undoubtedly the next challenge of the 

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:25.469
 bancassurance and as usual it's 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.189
 an area in which bnp paribas 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:31.679
 cardif will race in the lead 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:34.229
 this dynamics of will innovation 

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:35.789
 to always adapt to 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.829
 new realities that arise 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.899
 all these elements that are part of 

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:42.029
 the cardiff dna will allow this 

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:42.869

 carriers of products of which we have more 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.579
 in addition need 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:02.219
 the most important asset is the state 

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:04.409
