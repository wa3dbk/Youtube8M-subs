hello and welcome to how to kill this is
a<00:00:11.250> series<00:00:11.580> would<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.700> taking<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.090> look<00:00:12.179> at<00:00:12.330> how

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
a series would be taking a look at how

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.680 
a series would be taking a look at how
to<00:00:13.080> kill<00:00:13.530> tanks<00:00:14.160> that's<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.700> first<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.660> have

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
to kill tanks that's it first up we have

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.050 
to kill tanks that's it first up we have
the<00:00:15.780> kv-5<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.100> our<00:00:17.160> pilot<00:00:17.460> episode<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:17.970> it

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the kv-5 this is our pilot episode so it

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.849 
the kv-5 this is our pilot episode so it
might<00:00:18.180> be<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> little<00:00:18.510> here<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.560> there<00:00:19.680> and

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
might be a little here and there and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.570 
might be a little here and there and
everywhere<00:00:20.570> first<00:00:21.570> off<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.900> kv-5<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.250> tier

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
everywhere first off the kv-5 is a tier

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.790 
everywhere first off the kv-5 is a tier
8<00:00:23.760> heavy<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> Russians<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.320> also<00:00:25.439> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
8 heavy for the Russians it's also a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.120 
8 heavy for the Russians it's also a
premium<00:00:26.340> tank<00:00:26.640> now<00:00:27.390> I've<00:00:28.109> chosen<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.590> kb<00:00:28.920> 5

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
premium tank now I've chosen this kb 5

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.560 
premium tank now I've chosen this kb 5
is<00:00:29.340> our<00:00:29.460> first<00:00:29.670> time<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.359> well

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
is our first time because it's well

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.080 
is our first time because it's well
known<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> kill<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.529> kv-5<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.880> just

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
known how to kill the kv-5 and we just

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.510 
known how to kill the kv-5 and we just
want<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> go<00:00:33.780> over<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> little<00:00:35.370> bit

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
want to go over it and see a little bit

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.729 
want to go over it and see a little bit
on<00:00:35.760> where<00:00:36.660> its<00:00:37.160> weaknesses<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.340> armor<00:00:38.790> wise

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
on where its weaknesses are armor wise

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.000 
on where its weaknesses are armor wise
first<00:00:40.739> off<00:00:40.920> armor<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> 5<00:00:43.010> when

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
first off armor I have it as a 5 when

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.779 
first off armor I have it as a 5 when
you<00:00:44.070> compared<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.430> some<00:00:44.610> other<00:00:46.250> tanks<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
you compared to some other tanks in the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.229 
you compared to some other tanks in the
tier<00:00:48.120> 8<00:00:48.390> heavy<00:00:48.780> line<00:00:49.100> it's<00:00:50.100> basically<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
tier 8 heavy line it's basically the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.910 
tier 8 heavy line it's basically the
best<00:00:51.329> comparison<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> kv<00:00:52.610> kv4<00:00:53.870> with<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
best comparison is a kv kv4 with a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.130 
best comparison is a kv kv4 with a
blaring<00:00:55.920> lee<00:00:56.219> obvious<00:00:56.840> weakness<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
blaring lee obvious weakness in the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.619 
blaring lee obvious weakness in the
frontal<00:00:58.469> armor<00:00:58.739> which<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.760> kv-4<00:01:00.270> i'd<00:01:00.480> say

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
frontal armor which the kv-4 i'd say

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.349 
frontal armor which the kv-4 i'd say
it's<00:01:00.750> probably<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:01.140> pretty<00:01:01.680> good<00:01:02.059> heavy<00:01:03.059> tank

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it's probably a pretty good heavy tank

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.810 
it's probably a pretty good heavy tank
it<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.629> all<00:01:03.989> around<00:01:04.439> good<00:01:04.710> armor<00:01:05.070> about<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> 180

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it is all around good armor about a 180

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.350 
it is all around good armor about a 180
or<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:07.380> has<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.280> see<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.490> some

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
or so this has as we can see here some

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.390 
or so this has as we can see here some
places<00:01:09.600> are<00:01:09.840> 230<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.799> their<00:01:10.950> places<00:01:11.159> you're

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
places are 230 but their places you're

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.980 
places are 230 but their places you're
not<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.760> shoot<00:01:11.850> nobody<00:01:12.119> shoots<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
not going to shoot nobody shoots the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
not going to shoot nobody shoots the
mantle<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.650> bad<00:01:13.860> idea<00:01:14.070> there's<00:01:15.000> only<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
mantle it's a bad idea there's only a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.920 
mantle it's a bad idea there's only a
few<00:01:15.479> tanks<00:01:15.780> whether<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.710> big<00:01:17.009> weakness

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
few tanks whether that's a big weakness

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.120 
few tanks whether that's a big weakness
everywhere<00:01:18.930> else<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.229> about<00:01:19.350> 180<00:01:19.830> down

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
everywhere else you get about 180 down

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.300 
everywhere else you get about 180 down
in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> main<00:01:20.820> areas<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.600> even<00:01:21.869> high<00:01:22.189> 150s<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
in the main areas and even high 150s I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.999 
in the main areas and even high 150s I
believe<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.790> sides<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:25.140> some<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
believe on the sides and on some of the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.380 
believe on the sides and on some of the
turrets<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.360> five<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:33.150> other

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
turrets now so I'm five on the other

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.170 
turrets now so I'm five on the other
aspects<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.040> armor<00:01:35.369> area<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.880> have

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
aspects of it in the armor area we have

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.130 
aspects of it in the armor area we have
the<00:01:36.540> r2d2<00:01:37.500> turret<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.450> left<00:01:39.780> turret

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the r2d2 turret it's the the left turret

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.600 
the r2d2 turret it's the the left turret
when<00:01:40.439> you're<00:01:40.560> looking<00:01:40.799> at<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> front

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610

when you're looking at it in the front
and<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.360> has<00:01:43.040> in<00:01:44.040> certain<00:01:44.549> sections<00:01:44.899> on<00:01:45.899> the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
unless you're coming down on it so

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.480 
unless you're coming down on it so
usually<00:02:30.350> avoid<00:02:30.620> that<00:02:30.830> one<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.190> if<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.370> have<00:02:31.460> a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
usually avoid that one so if you have a

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.520 
usually avoid that one so if you have a
choice<00:02:31.700> go<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.150> bottom<00:02:32.360> left<00:02:32.660> or<00:02:32.870> top<00:02:33.080> right<00:02:33.320> on

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
choice go to bottom left or top right on

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.190

often<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.860> mistake<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.400> shoot<00:02:37.580> back<00:02:37.760> here<00:02:38.000> this

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
often a mistake to shoot back here this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.610 
often a mistake to shoot back here this
is<00:02:38.210> usually<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.510> super<00:02:38.990> weak<00:02:39.140> point<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.530> the

tank now the top is good I mean you can

tank now the top is good I mean you can
shoot<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.440> there<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.770> you'll<00:02:42.860> get<00:02:43.070> through<00:02:43.310> it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
shoot in there and you'll get through it

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.330 
shoot in there and you'll get through it
it<00:02:44.930> also<00:02:45.050> has<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.260> very<00:02:45.440> big<00:02:45.560> dirt<00:02:45.860> ring<00:02:46.100> that

shots<00:03:01.030> take<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.150> shot<00:03:02.330> especially<00:03:03.110> from

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
shots take the shot especially from

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.520 
shots take the shot especially from
these<00:03:03.500> angles<00:03:04.010> like<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:05.170> shoot<00:03:06.170> in<00:03:06.290> through

these angles like this shoot in through

these angles like this shoot in through
the<00:03:06.620> gear<00:03:06.890> you'll<00:03:07.100> be<00:03:07.220> able<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.430> penetrate

to<00:03:15.020> 20<00:03:15.970> bounce<00:03:16.970> chance<00:03:17.390> but<00:03:18.290> you'll<00:03:18.380> be<00:03:18.440> able

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
to 20 bounce chance but you'll be able

there now the back obviously is a very
easy<00:03:23.959> target<00:03:24.860> if<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.040> get<00:03:25.130> around<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.400> back

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
easy target if you get around the back

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.810 
when you consider angling another thing
you<00:03:54.800> want<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.100> do<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:56.950> try<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:57.980> get<00:03:58.220> around<00:03:58.370> it

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
you want to do is try to get around it

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.750 
you want to do is try to get around it
it<00:03:58.940> has<00:03:59.090> very<00:03:59.510> very<00:03:59.630> poor<00:04:00.470> Traverse<00:04:01.220> which<00:04:01.640> I

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
it has very very poor Traverse which I

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.280 
it has very very poor Traverse which I
got<00:04:01.940> is<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.120> three<00:04:02.770> only<00:04:03.770> because<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:05.020> t-34<00:04:06.020> is

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
got is a three only because the t-34 is

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.710 
got is a three only because the t-34 is
a<00:04:06.740> little<00:04:07.100> bit<00:04:07.220> worse<00:04:07.430> in<00:04:07.700> that<00:04:07.970> category<00:04:08.540> i

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
a little bit worse in that category i

believe and turret reverse which is

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.140 
believe and turret reverse which is
pretty<00:04:11.300> much<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:12.080> just<00:04:12.290> as<00:04:12.470> bad<00:04:12.500> as<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:13.150> kv-4

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
pretty much it just as bad as the kv-4

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.349 
pretty much it just as bad as the kv-4
which<00:04:14.660> is<00:04:14.840> appalling<00:04:15.590> it's<00:04:15.980> so<00:04:16.250> slow<00:04:16.580> so<00:04:16.910> get

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
which is appalling it's so slow so get

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.849 
which is appalling it's so slow so get
those<00:04:17.419> combined<00:04:17.840> together<00:04:18.049> this<00:04:18.680> is

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
those combined together this is

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.159 
those combined together this is
definitely<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.220> tank<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.549> can<00:04:19.580> circle<00:04:20.419> around

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
definitely a tank you can circle around

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.020 
definitely a tank you can circle around
with<00:04:22.169> no<00:04:22.380> real<00:04:22.919> problems<00:04:23.250> but<00:04:23.669> because<00:04:23.880> it's

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
with no real problems but because it's

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.150 
with no real problems but because it's
fairly<00:04:24.389> armored<00:04:24.900> on<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.139> sides<00:04:25.380> up<00:04:25.650> here<00:04:25.919> it's

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
fairly armored on the sides up here it's

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.500 
fairly armored on the sides up here it's
not<00:04:26.370> really<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:26.790> big<00:04:26.880> issue<00:04:27.210> for<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:29.010> kv-5<00:04:29.510> next

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
not really a big issue for the kv-5 next

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.379 
not really a big issue for the kv-5 next
we<00:04:30.600> have<00:04:30.750> speed<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.800> is<00:04:31.979> quite<00:04:32.520> speedy<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.180> gave

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
we have speed it is quite speedy I gave

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.930 
we have speed it is quite speedy I gave
it<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.540> 7<00:04:34.020> because<00:04:34.470> coming<00:04:35.070> down<00:04:35.280> hills<00:04:35.610> and

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
it a 7 because coming down hills and

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.330 
it a 7 because coming down hills and
even<00:04:36.210> on<00:04:36.300> flat<00:04:36.570> ground<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:37.020> can<00:04:37.139> hold<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.650> speed

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
even on flat ground it can hold a speed

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.600 
even on flat ground it can hold a speed
that<00:04:38.610> is<00:04:38.850> above<00:04:39.419> average<00:04:39.690> for<00:04:39.960> its<00:04:40.320> tier<00:04:40.610> but

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
that is above average for its tier but

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.110 
that is above average for its tier but
it<00:04:41.760> is<00:04:41.880> very<00:04:42.030> happy<00:04:42.510> at<00:04:42.720> 100<00:04:43.050> tons<00:04:43.290> so<00:04:43.910> going<00:04:44.910> up

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
it is very happy at 100 tons so going up

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.460 
it is very happy at 100 tons so going up
hills<00:04:45.330> it's<00:04:45.540> going<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.720> be<00:04:45.840> slow<00:04:46.110> so<00:04:46.320> that's

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
hills it's going to be slow so that's

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.920 
hills it's going to be slow so that's
why<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.590> only<00:04:46.680> gave<00:04:46.860> it<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.070> seven<00:04:47.690> silhouette<00:04:48.690> is

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
why I only gave it a seven silhouette is

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.409 
why I only gave it a seven silhouette is
I<00:04:49.470> give<00:04:49.620> it<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.800> 2<00:04:50.070> which<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.669> terrible<00:04:51.030> because

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
I give it a 2 which is terrible because

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.770 
I give it a 2 which is terrible because
it's<00:04:51.690> huge<00:04:52.440> ginormous<00:04:53.100> now<00:04:53.700> a<00:04:53.970> lot<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.570> is

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
it's huge ginormous now a lot of that is

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.330 
it's huge ginormous now a lot of that is
stuff<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:55.229> don't<00:04:55.380> want<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.680> shoot<00:04:55.860> but

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
stuff that you don't want to shoot but

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.219 
stuff that you don't want to shoot but
because<00:04:56.639> this<00:04:56.910> thing<00:04:57.210> in<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.360> front<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:57.840> so

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
because this thing in the front is so

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.560 
because this thing in the front is so
big<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.800> kind<00:04:59.610> of<00:04:59.669> balances<00:05:00.060> out<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.450> it's

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
big that kind of balances out and it's

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.780 
big that kind of balances out and it's
still<00:05:00.780> it's<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.139> huge<00:05:01.919> tank<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.490> definite

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
still it's a huge tank a definite

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.879 
still it's a huge tank a definite

any angle from any distance and it's
pretty<00:05:10.620> much<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.860> no-go<00:05:11.310> you're<00:05:11.669> just<00:05:11.910> going<00:05:12.030> to

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
pretty much a no-go you're just going to

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.900 
pretty much a no-go you're just going to
hit<00:05:12.210> it<00:05:12.240> no<00:05:12.600> problem<00:05:13.229> fear<00:05:14.039> factor<00:05:14.430> I<00:05:14.580> put<00:05:14.789> is<00:05:14.880> a

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
hit it no problem fear factor I put is a

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.140 
hit it no problem fear factor I put is a
3<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:16.050> gun<00:05:16.440> does<00:05:16.770> 300<00:05:17.310> damage<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.700> the<00:05:17.729> DPM<00:05:18.120> is

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
3 the gun does 300 damage and the DPM is

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.680 
3 the gun does 300 damage and the DPM is
very<00:05:18.660> high<00:05:19.190> but<00:05:20.190> it<00:05:20.550> has<00:05:21.120> very<00:05:21.449> low

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
very high but it has very low

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.689 
very high but it has very low
penetration<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.380> think<00:05:22.560> it's<00:05:22.650> only<00:05:22.770> like<00:05:23.010> 180

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
penetration I think it's only like 180

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.860 
penetration I think it's only like 180
or<00:05:23.970> so<00:05:24.240> much<00:05:24.960> lower<00:05:25.200> than<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.560> kV<00:05:25.800> fours<00:05:26.870> top

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
or so much lower than the kV fours top

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.469 
or so much lower than the kV fours top
gun<00:05:28.400> and<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:30.410> 85<00:05:31.410> millimeter<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.460> believe<00:05:32.850> no

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
gun and the 85 millimeter I believe no

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.080 
gun and the 85 millimeter I believe no
105<00:05:33.810> now<00:05:34.650> whatever<00:05:34.860> it<00:05:35.070> is<00:05:35.190> it<00:05:35.610> doesn't<00:05:35.669> matter

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
105 now whatever it is it doesn't matter

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.140 
105 now whatever it is it doesn't matter
it's<00:05:36.630> it's<00:05:37.470> below<00:05:37.979> average<00:05:38.220> in<00:05:38.639> penetration

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
it's it's below average in penetration

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.600 
it's it's below average in penetration
so<00:05:39.450> it's<00:05:39.570> not<00:05:39.870> that<00:05:40.200> dangerous<00:05:40.650> I<00:05:41.130> would<00:05:41.430> say

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
so it's not that dangerous I would say

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.980 
so it's not that dangerous I would say
this<00:05:41.789> is<00:05:41.849> probably<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.300> tank<00:05:42.570> that<00:05:42.690> you<00:05:42.810> can

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
this is probably a tank that you can

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.659 
this is probably a tank that you can
play<00:05:43.139> peek-a-boo<00:05:43.440> with<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:44.010> win<00:05:44.250> especially

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
play peek-a-boo with and win especially

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.180 
play peek-a-boo with and win especially
if<00:05:44.970> you<00:05:45.060> have<00:05:45.090> a<00:05:45.240> high<00:05:45.389> alpha<00:05:45.660> damage<00:05:45.960> tank<00:05:46.380> it

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
if you have a high alpha damage tank it

thing<00:05:57.210> is<00:05:57.330> amazing<00:05:57.419> you<00:05:58.320> need<00:05:58.530> to<00:05:58.620> be<00:05:58.710> able<00:05:58.830> to

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
thing is amazing you need to be able to

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.640 
thing is amazing you need to be able to
hit<00:05:59.130> this<00:05:59.310> or<00:05:59.900> this<00:06:00.900> turret<00:06:01.320> up<00:06:01.410> top<00:06:01.620> here

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
hit this or this turret up top here

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.339 
hit this or this turret up top here
that's<00:06:02.639> what<00:06:02.789> I<00:06:02.820> would<00:06:02.940> suggest<00:06:03.150> you<00:06:03.539> do<00:06:03.960> so

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
that's what I would suggest you do so

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.550 
that's what I would suggest you do so
overall<00:06:05.310> I'd<00:06:05.639> say<00:06:05.669> it's<00:06:06.150> for<00:06:06.780> a<00:06:06.840> premium<00:06:07.050> not

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
overall I'd say it's for a premium not

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.620 
overall I'd say it's for a premium not
that<00:06:07.740> bad<00:06:08.010> but<00:06:08.280> i<00:06:08.520> think<00:06:08.910> we<00:06:09.060> averaged<00:06:09.450> out

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
that bad but i think we averaged out

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.170 
that bad but i think we averaged out
somewhere<00:06:10.050> between<00:06:10.200> a<00:06:10.320> five<00:06:10.590> and<00:06:10.740> a<00:06:10.830> six<00:06:11.180> so

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
somewhere between a five and a six so

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.150 
somewhere between a five and a six so

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
fear factor of three overall a good

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.490 
fear factor of three overall a good
premium<00:06:20.310> but<00:06:20.940> not<00:06:21.180> necessarily<00:06:21.810> the<00:06:22.110> best<00:06:22.260> in

premium but not necessarily the best in
its<00:06:22.650> tier<00:06:23.630> so<00:06:24.630> that's<00:06:24.990> pretty<00:06:25.410> simple<00:06:25.710> good

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
its tier so that's pretty simple good

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.290 
pilot that's how it's going to run we
might<00:06:28.229> add<00:06:28.440> things<00:06:28.770> later<00:06:29.099> if<00:06:29.400> there's<00:06:30.150> that

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
might add things later if there's that

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.880 
might add things later if there's that
much<00:06:30.510> requests<00:06:30.870> for<00:06:31.080> gameplay<00:06:31.260> I'll<00:06:31.680> add<00:06:31.860> it

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
much requests for gameplay I'll add it

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.410 
much requests for gameplay I'll add it
in<00:06:32.130> but<00:06:32.550> really<00:06:32.760> this<00:06:32.880> is

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.420 
in but really this is

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.260 
in but really this is
a<00:06:33.450> long<00:06:33.990> series<00:06:34.470> and<00:06:35.280> this<00:06:35.430> will<00:06:35.610> be<00:06:35.700> cut<00:06:36.030> even

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
a long series and this will be cut even

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.000 
a long series and this will be cut even
shorter<00:06:36.300> by<00:06:37.110> the<00:06:37.170> fact<00:06:37.440> that<00:06:37.530> i'll<00:06:37.710> be<00:06:37.740> talking

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
shorter by the fact that i'll be talking

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.090 
shorter by the fact that i'll be talking
less<00:06:38.910> about<00:06:39.180> how<00:06:39.420> this<00:06:39.630> is<00:06:39.810> a<00:06:39.840> pilot<00:06:40.140> and<00:06:40.410> such

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
less about how this is a pilot and such

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.770 
less about how this is a pilot and such
in<00:06:41.370> the<00:06:41.400> future<00:06:41.730> so<00:06:42.420> we're<00:06:42.540> looking<00:06:42.600> for

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
in the future so we're looking for

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.160 
in the future so we're looking for
probably<00:06:43.500> about<00:06:44.600> between<00:06:45.600> five<00:06:45.840> and<00:06:45.870> ten

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
probably about between five and ten

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.960 
probably about between five and ten
minutes<00:06:46.500> depending<00:06:46.950> on<00:06:46.980> the<00:06:47.190> actual<00:06:47.340> tank<00:06:47.700> and

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
minutes depending on the actual tank and

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.730 
minutes depending on the actual tank and
the<00:06:48.060> importance<00:06:48.390> of<00:06:48.480> the<00:06:48.570> tank<00:06:48.780> we're<00:06:49.620> going

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
the importance of the tank we're going

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.410 
the importance of the tank we're going
to<00:06:49.800> go<00:06:49.890> up<00:06:50.010> trees<00:06:50.280> as<00:06:50.490> per<00:06:50.700> usual<00:06:50.850> but<00:06:51.210> i'll<00:06:51.300> be

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
to go up trees as per usual but i'll be

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.730 
to go up trees as per usual but i'll be
able<00:06:51.510> to<00:06:51.630> bang<00:06:51.780> them<00:06:51.960> off<00:06:52.050> nice<00:06:52.350> and<00:06:52.410> fast

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
able to bang them off nice and fast

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.320 
able to bang them off nice and fast
because<00:06:53.130> i<00:06:53.160> don't<00:06:53.430> actually<00:06:53.640> have<00:06:53.970> to<00:06:54.000> play

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
because i don't actually have to play

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.540 
because i don't actually have to play
the<00:06:54.450> tank<00:06:54.690> so<00:06:55.350> as<00:06:55.500> you<00:06:55.680> can<00:06:55.770> see<00:06:55.920> here<00:06:56.190> i<00:06:56.220> can<00:06:56.460> go

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
the tank so as you can see here i can go

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.820 
the tank so as you can see here i can go
to<00:06:56.610> all<00:06:56.820> kinds<00:06:57.030> of<00:06:57.210> different<00:06:57.300> tanks<00:07:00.710> we<00:07:01.710> can

to all kinds of different tanks we can

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.600 
to all kinds of different tanks we can
go<00:07:02.040> and<00:07:02.250> see<00:07:02.490> this<00:07:03.240> one<00:07:04.010> there<00:07:05.010> you<00:07:05.070> go<00:07:05.220> there's
