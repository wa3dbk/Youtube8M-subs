00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:13.980
 here I have 750 ml of milk, my people 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.850
 I'm going to put 250 ml of water 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.570
 Then I'll tell them where they are from. 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.380
 blender with 750 of milk 250 of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.600
 Water 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.400
 I'm going to hurt this from here. 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.570
 few people follow our 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.619
 recipe like milk in water already almost 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.149
 boiling 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.670
 I'll put a spoon full of to 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.379
 Butter butter even if we go to the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.620
 margarine if you want but butter goes 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.819
 stay another thing ours is the butter 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.769
 divine 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:49.229
 I'm going to put here what I have to 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.579
 are putting their one red right 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.819
 It should not be but it's what I have. 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.620
 here I put the sound to meat you go 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:58.289
 buy a chicken broth for 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.519
 here preferably not in red 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.430
 because it's good for you to leave in the case of 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.880
 episode a whiter mass not so 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.909
 how about the coxinha 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.119
 I'm going to put on the side of the hall a 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.159
 Little amount of bouncing can get a 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.009
 bit saltier because when you 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.570
 put the flour the flour will do 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.329
 with which it raises slightly the flavor 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.060
 so you need to be a bit salty to 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:30.659
 you may not be without your eyes without 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539
 flavor 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.130
 right but we will put Diplock 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:39.869
 try green tail is good 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 invest mine is good on my back 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.130
 of salt 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:55.310
 I now believe you're mouth like 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:58.439
 My sister and milk has almost seeing 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.409
 I'll put the flour are 500 flour 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:09.209
 flour grams puts 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:11.069
 little and will put remainder now 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.500
 mix an important legal detail 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.310
 because I put a thick pan 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.819
 I put this image I had more 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.360
 I'm looking for a thicker bag. 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.640
 because sometimes it fooles you a little and you 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.370
 thinking she's cooked and attacked 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.590
 even then a thick, it will 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.060
 Burning, burning and you're thinking. 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.420
 that 's good 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.410
 when something in my mass or more 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.220
 less then we'll see 156 minutes later 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.420
 I show to you 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.470
 take a look at my dough is already 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.190
 cooked 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.989
 which I do not like to put sometimes 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.760
 reddish some seasoning ready 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.060
 reddish because the dough is 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.920
 dark in case for episode but also 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.470
 It does not get bad, it does not get that white. 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.269
 type thing there that tastes like it is 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.549
 well cooked pasta in the pan will have 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.680
 started yet to burn it starts that 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.260
 Same is normal understood if not you 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.450
 will put an end to its mass opinion 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.130
 woman thing softens only need 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.650
 do the following you can not leave 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.989
 Here it is cool in the pan 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.090
 You'll get out of here. 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.709
 if you have an appropriate place 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.849
 clean tree that is difficult for you 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.560
 sinks and clean 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.940
 but if you had a little one 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.349
 way of cake and open it and 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.180
 stirring with the spoon and not letting 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.370
 to cool alone or it will have a crust 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.989
 of this crust she will get involved in the middle 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.510
 of the pasta will not be cool 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.340
 So this is the basic mass for you. 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.930
 do rizzoli from here you can create 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.269
 others are always based. 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.280
 for mass and for excellent signal after 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.840
 fried people is a delight it seems 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.609
 put potato inside you saw that I 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.560
 I will not put it if you want to put the note 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.600
 also places a small potato that 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.730
 cook her 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.680
 you put together but not so big 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.150
 not to lose the point but basically 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.150
 That's ridiculous.
