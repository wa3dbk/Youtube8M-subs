00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.660
 the soybean harvest is already in progress 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.730
 in ubiratã and as we all know 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.309
 agriculture is very important for 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.660
 our region the basis of the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.059
 municipality of ubiratã 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.859
 it comes from agriculture and unfortunately 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.500
 This year we are not going to have a year 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.750
 exceptional in productivity but 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.630
 will not be the year of the drastic also with 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.939
 relation to productivity in the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.640
 Preliminary surveys today 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.830
 Our prediction is that we are there with 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.170
 average productivity around 110 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.899
 the importance of the use of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.250
 technology has been seen since the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.320
 planting until the harvest is needed today 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.989
 Finally, if you have a map, 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.890
 you make an area call and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.500
 all for one gps with a gps aid 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 will read will send the satellite anyway you 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.120
 will see the images show weaker the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.250
 only to make the correction to that is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.050
 generate a chip requires to enter the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.760
 the driver of the truck and a 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.049
 truck will make the correction in that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.350
 country you need 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.900
 usually I only did 1 to 1 an analyst 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.360
 solo and gives an example parish symptoms 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.430
 and limestone to correct it feel nothing 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.799
 similar to those today. 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 You can only do it in where you really 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.020
 precise agriculture makes with 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.060
 that the farmer kasting - at the planting and 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 less damage at harvest time 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.549
 technology does not stop there because it comes 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.829
 there the drones the soybean harvest 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.450
 corn planting in Ubiratã has a 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.220
 great variety is at full steam 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.530
 including in ubiratã 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.229
 has a difference from the other places in the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.520
 variety of soybean that diversity that 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.189
 has in the field right? 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.439
 I said only ripe soy ready for 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.470
 welcome soy that is coming soy 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.119
 green soybean that was fenced in and what the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.040
 staff already planted for the second harvest 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.840
 is that the safrinha planted now in 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.320
 January to see if it reaps more or less 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.060
 mid May and April May and should be 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.250
 reaping and the corn that is planted 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.469
 also looks at the diversity that has the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 municipality of ubiratã and at the same 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.640
 what is happening to the soybean harvest 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.520
 Corn planting is happening 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.170
 second crop then what the producer has 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.950
 attention should be paid to the material 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.720
 he is facing 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.610
 he has to sing the material with the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.739
 adequate population of such material and 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.200
 immaterial which is appropriate at the time of 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.209
 planting speed our productive 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.920
 producers, they have to understand that the 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.480
 planting operation is an operation that the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.250
 producer has to take it easy and 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.050
 then patience will not run the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.000
 planter so that you really have a 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.030
 good distribution of seed also has 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.620
 good germination of these plants and a 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.049
 mistake that our 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.540
 producers who sometimes commit 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.549
 choice of disc each corn hybrid 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.799
 it has its own disk for 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.810
 perform this operation as there is no 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.940
 duplicity of plant or plant failure 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.950
 plant is important when it is left 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.690
 with regard to this choice of 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.650
 also this year the plant of the 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.180
 winter and what are maize 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.720
 word of the second crop né 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.569
 but it's always been such a drag 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.030
 is as important as the planting of 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.310
 seeds to harvest the work itself is the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.319
 not only the machine 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.200
 when I was in the harvest but also the 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.940
 maintenance is very important but 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.130
 usually the main maintenance 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.900
 of harvesters they are made in the 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.450
 months of October November and December 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.220
 months preceding the harvest in the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.889
 moment of our harvest that begins 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.720
 from January 10 and is now 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.850
 course but always maintaining that 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.000
 are emergency maintenance of 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.430
 equipment that gives problem in the crop 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.380
 and we are our biggest flow today. 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.660
 work is in the field and not in the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.630
 the workshop is not going well 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.420
 is assisting and collaborating soy is 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.340
 producing reasonable having a good area has 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.290
 a little weaker air is not good 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.450
 so we can not enter but not in the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.720
 average of eight years and the work of the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.130
 man from the countryside always showing 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.380
 important while the Brazilian 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.870
 need the food on the table while the 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.910
 economy revolve around agriculture 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.760
 our region the farmers 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.000
 cooperatives will always be making their 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.000
 job
