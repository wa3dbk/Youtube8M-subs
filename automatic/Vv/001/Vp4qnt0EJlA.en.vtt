hey<00:00:00.690> good<00:00:00.900> first<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.439> is<00:00:01.860> my<00:00:02.370> tutorial<00:00:03.030> for<00:00:03.330> a

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
hey good first this is my tutorial for a

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.039 
hey good first this is my tutorial for a
vortex<00:00:04.170> jump<00:00:04.500> through<00:00:04.850> which<00:00:05.899> will<00:00:06.899> look

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
vortex jump through which will look

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.290 
vortex jump through which will look
either<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.799> jumping<00:00:08.099> out<00:00:08.309> like<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.849> we're

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
either and jumping out like this we're

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.900 
either and jumping out like this we're
jumping<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.780> like<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.550> be<00:00:11.670> done

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
jumping in like this and I can be done

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.580 
jumping in like this and I can be done
um<00:00:12.690> with<00:00:13.500> your<00:00:13.740> hand<00:00:15.230> you're<00:00:16.230> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.440> want

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
um with your hand you're going to want

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.179 
um with your hand you're going to want
to<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.740> comfortable<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:18.380> the<00:00:19.380> dingo<00:00:19.710> cortex

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
to be comfortable with the dingo cortex

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.810 
to be comfortable with the dingo cortex
and<00:00:20.460> also<00:00:21.420> wouldn't<00:00:22.350> hurt<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.310> comfortable

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
and also wouldn't hurt to be comfortable

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.420 
and also wouldn't hurt to be comfortable
with<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.060> one-handed<00:00:24.539> vortex<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.279> that

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
with a one-handed vortex just in that

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.540 
with a one-handed vortex just in that
year<00:00:27.349> you're<00:00:28.349> more<00:00:28.500> set<00:00:28.800> with<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.099> strength

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
year you're more set with like strength

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.150 
year you're more set with like strength
going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.119> hold<00:00:30.300> their<00:00:30.420> booze<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.160> you're

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
going to hold their booze and you're

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.830 
going to hold their booze and you're
more<00:00:32.309> comfortable<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:32.730> both<00:00:33.000> hands<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.340> um

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
more comfortable with both hands so um

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.610 
more comfortable with both hands so um
anyway<00:00:36.840> well<00:00:37.140> you're<00:00:37.260> jumping<00:00:37.620> into<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.950> vortex

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
anyway well you're jumping into a vortex

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.910 
anyway well you're jumping into a vortex
basically<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.890> two<00:00:41.219> options<00:00:41.250> um

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
basically you have two options um

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.139 
basically you have two options um
depending<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.070> which<00:00:44.309> way<00:00:44.460> your<00:00:44.640> grip<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.030> is

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
depending on which way your grip it is

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.680 
depending on which way your grip it is
so<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.660> think<00:00:46.140> ideally<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:47.480> easiest<00:00:48.480> solution

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
so I think ideally your easiest solution

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
so I think ideally your easiest solution
is<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.410> me<00:00:49.530> we'll<00:00:50.190> start<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.910> right

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
is to me we'll start with just the right

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.810 
is to me we'll start with just the right
hands<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.539> worse<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.989> either<00:00:52.170> hand<00:00:52.289> up

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
hands this worse on either hand up

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.340 
hands this worse on either hand up
coming<00:00:53.820> around<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> back<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:55.079> our

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
coming around from the back with our

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.930 
coming around from the back with our
palm<00:00:56.160> facing<00:00:56.730> up<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:58.489> I'm<00:00:59.489> pulling<00:00:59.850> up

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
palm facing up and I'm pulling up

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490 
palm facing up and I'm pulling up
underneath<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.989> I'm<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> come<00:01:01.350> around

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
underneath so I'm going to come around

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.299 
underneath so I'm going to come around
and<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.180> lean<00:01:03.480> over<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.470> if

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and I'm going to do is lean over as if

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.600 
and I'm going to do is lean over as if
you're<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.240> um<00:01:07.610> so

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
you're going to do one of these um so

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.500 
you're going to do one of these um so
bring<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> up<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:11.180> your<00:01:12.180> grip

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
bring it up so that your your grip

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.310 
bring it up so that your your grip
switches<00:01:13.080> from<00:01:13.170> being<00:01:14.360> before<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:15.720> facing<00:01:15.990> up

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
switches from being before I'm facing up

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.039 
switches from being before I'm facing up
comes<00:01:17.159> around<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> outside<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.720> poop

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
comes around to the outside to the poop

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.040 
comes around to the outside to the poop
there's<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.130> you're<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.090> hoop<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.479> between

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
there's you you're the hoop is between

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.230 
there's you you're the hoop is between
hand<00:01:22.230> in<00:01:22.440> yourself<00:01:22.800> and<00:01:23.010> now<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> top<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.180> my

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
hand in yourself and now the top of my

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.810 
hand in yourself and now the top of my
forearm<00:01:24.660> is<00:01:24.900> facing<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:25.980> mount<00:01:26.220> overhand<00:01:26.730> grip

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
forearm is facing up mount overhand grip

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.690 
forearm is facing up mount overhand grip
and<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.720> at<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.350> coming<00:01:29.010> end<00:01:29.220> point<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and it's at this coming end point that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.000 
and it's at this coming end point that
i'm<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.940> to<00:01:30.000> jump<00:01:30.330> in<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.830> from<00:01:31.980> here

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
i'm going to jump in and then from here

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.160 
i'm going to jump in and then from here
this<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.670> kind<00:01:32.910> of<00:01:33.000> where<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.360> end<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this is kind of where you end up in a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.340 
this is kind of where you end up in a
one-handed<00:01:34.740> vortex<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.970> hoots<00:01:36.240> down<00:01:36.480> here<00:01:36.780> so

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
one-handed vortex and hoots down here so

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.430 
one-handed vortex and hoots down here so
you<00:01:37.440> just<00:01:37.880> work<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.030> way<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.410> switch<00:01:40.410> your

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
you just work your way up switch your

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.240 
you just work your way up switch your
grip<00:01:40.650> at<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:40.860> top<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.420> go<00:01:43.250> just

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
grip at the top and there you go just

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.720 
grip at the top and there you go just
like<00:01:44.370> that<00:01:44.810> um<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:47.010> other<00:01:47.070> way<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.460> doing<00:01:47.700> this

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
like that um the other way of doing this

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.270 
like that um the other way of doing this
is<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.150> start<00:01:48.390> over<00:01:48.600> hand<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.070> same

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
is to start over hand and it's the same

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.270 
is to start over hand and it's the same
motion<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.800> it's<00:01:52.800> slightly

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
motion you just have to it's slightly

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.120 
motion you just have to it's slightly
more<00:01:53.580> awkward<00:01:54.000> only<00:01:54.330> because<00:01:55.040> where<00:01:56.040> you

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
more awkward only because where you

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.350 
more awkward only because where you
don't<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.550> switch<00:01:56.790> your<00:01:56.970> grip<00:01:57.120> or

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
don't have to switch your grip or

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.080 
don't have to switch your grip or
anything<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.260> end<00:01:58.440> up<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.800> weird<00:01:59.190> it<00:02:00.060> just

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
anything you end up with a weird it just

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.760 
anything you end up with a weird it just
kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> feels<00:02:00.600> differently<00:02:01.080> but<00:02:01.230> anyway<00:02:01.470> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
kind of feels differently but anyway you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.320 
kind of feels differently but anyway you
can<00:02:01.920> go<00:02:02.070> into<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.460> with<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.730> hand<00:02:02.970> over<00:02:03.150> the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
can go into this with your hand over the

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.670 
can go into this with your hand over the
top<00:02:03.710> like<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:05.660> bring<00:02:06.660> it<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:06.930> so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
top like that and then bring it up so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.620 
top like that and then bring it up so

hand like this or to come in grab and go

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.290 
hand like this or to come in grab and go
up<00:02:16.760> spinning<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.380> right<00:02:19.700> these<00:02:20.700> are<00:02:20.880> left

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
up spinning to the right these are left

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.570 
up spinning to the right these are left
hand<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:24.170> underneath<00:02:25.170> same<00:02:25.680> gonna<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.130> just

hand and underneath same gonna do just

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.729 
hand and underneath same gonna do just
like<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.970> that's<00:02:27.959> actually<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.380> lot<00:02:28.470> easier

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
every up on this you just have to switch

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.290 
every up on this you just have to switch
your<00:02:31.470> grip<00:02:31.590> um<00:02:32.370> ok<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.480> now<00:02:34.200> jump<00:02:34.739> out<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
your grip um ok so now jump out of it

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.360 
your grip um ok so now jump out of it
I'm<00:02:36.300> going<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.600> start<00:02:36.870> my<00:02:37.560> left<00:02:37.800> hand<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.220> mean

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
I'm going to start my left hand I mean

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.640 
I'm going to start my left hand I mean
my<00:02:38.489> right<00:02:38.670> hand<00:02:38.970> both<00:02:39.959> my<00:02:40.140> head<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.530> I'm

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
my right hand both my head like I'm

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.340 
my right hand both my head like I'm
going<00:02:40.830> to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
going to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.970 
going to
protects<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.750> take<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.900> down<00:02:44.110> guess<00:02:44.830> those

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
protects and take it down guess those

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.420 
protects and take it down guess those
left<00:02:45.460> hand<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:47.680> doesn't<00:02:47.950> matter<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.160> can<00:02:48.310> do

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
left hand it doesn't matter you can do

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.920 
left hand it doesn't matter you can do
either<00:02:48.580> way<00:02:48.820> also<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.480> can<00:02:49.540> do<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.810> however

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
either way also you can do it however

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.160 
either way also you can do it however
you<00:02:50.200> want<00:02:50.460> this<00:02:51.460> is<00:02:51.610> just<00:02:51.820> kind<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.210> horizontal

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
you want this is just kind of horizontal

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.980 
you want this is just kind of horizontal
transition<00:02:53.650> outward<00:02:54.010> basically<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.300> you<00:02:55.810> can

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
transition outward basically so you can

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.560 
transition outward basically so you can
do<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.350> as<00:02:56.730> whatever<00:02:57.730> hand<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.390> whatever

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
do it as whatever hand in whatever

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.570 
do it as whatever hand in whatever
direction<00:02:58.960> you<00:02:59.260> want<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.800> vortex<00:03:00.280> but

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
direction you want the vortex but

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.640 
direction you want the vortex but
essentially<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.210> same<00:03:01.420> thing<00:03:01.450> we're<00:03:01.930> like

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
essentially is the same thing we're like

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.370 
essentially is the same thing we're like
right<00:03:02.830> now<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.100> have<00:03:03.310> my<00:03:03.460> right<00:03:03.670> hand<00:03:04.200> I'm<00:03:05.200> going

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
right now I have my right hand I'm going

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.400 
right now I have my right hand I'm going
to<00:03:05.470> grab<00:03:05.590> comes<00:03:06.220> down<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:07.150> then<00:03:08.110> when<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
to grab comes down and then when the

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.840 
to grab comes down and then when the
hoop<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.800> about<00:03:09.070> at<00:03:09.370> my<00:03:09.610> knees<00:03:11.370> I'm<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.730> going

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
hoop is about at my knees I'm just going

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.720 
hoop is about at my knees I'm just going
to<00:03:12.880> step<00:03:13.150> out<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.420> continue<00:03:13.920> around<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:18.100> then

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
to step out and continue around and then

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.640 
to step out and continue around and then
the<00:03:18.910> left<00:03:19.060> hand<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:20.440> comes<00:03:20.770> down<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:22.090> my<00:03:22.240> side

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
the left hand it comes down to my side

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.100 
the left hand it comes down to my side
just<00:03:23.650> like<00:03:23.740> it<00:03:23.950> on<00:03:23.980> one<00:03:24.220> hand<00:03:24.460> in<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.480> vortex<00:03:25.690> or

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
just like it on one hand in a vortex or

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.860 
just like it on one hand in a vortex or
the<00:03:26.320> one-handed<00:03:26.860> vortex<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:28.150> then<00:03:28.510> I'm<00:03:28.750> just

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
the one-handed vortex and then I'm just

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.810 
the one-handed vortex and then I'm just
going<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.110> push<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:29.470> out<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.860> jump<00:03:30.070> out<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.730> the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
going to push it out and jump out so the

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.730 
going to push it out and jump out so the
trick<00:03:31.090> with<00:03:31.270> um<00:03:31.540> sink<00:03:32.410> smooth<00:03:32.940> with<00:03:33.940> these

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
trick with um sink smooth with these

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.620 
trick with um sink smooth with these
vortex<00:03:35.740> will<00:03:36.280> then<00:03:36.520> you<00:03:36.610> jump<00:03:36.850> through<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:37.350> to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
vortex will then you jump through is to

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.450 
vortex will then you jump through is to
is<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.900> be<00:03:41.230> delicate<00:03:41.500> when<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.010> land<00:03:42.280> you

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
is to be delicate when you land you

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.830 
is to be delicate when you land you
don't<00:03:42.640> want<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.910> like<00:03:43.060> slam<00:03:43.540> down<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.290> like

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
don't want to like slam down and like

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.300 
don't want to like slam down and like
you<00:03:46.840> know<00:03:46.870> it's<00:03:47.080> going<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.320> cost<00:03:47.650> your<00:03:48.040> body

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
you know it's going to cost your body

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.070 
you know it's going to cost your body
stress<00:03:48.790> as<00:03:49.000> well<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.360> really<00:03:49.480> want<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.780> absorb

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
stress as well you really want to absorb

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.370 
stress as well you really want to absorb
that<00:03:50.380> so<00:03:51.070> I<00:03:51.430> find<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.120> easier<00:03:52.270> to<00:03:52.510> go<00:03:53.140> really

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
that so I find it easier to go really

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.930 
that so I find it easier to go really
slowly<00:03:54.150> with<00:03:55.150> um<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:55.860> Junkers<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:59.550> then<00:04:00.550> try

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
slowly with um with Junkers and then try

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.140 
slowly with um with Junkers and then try
to<00:04:00.970> land<00:04:01.330> I<00:04:01.600> usually<00:04:01.900> will<00:04:02.290> jump<00:04:02.560> out<00:04:02.910> one<00:04:03.910> leg

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
to land I usually will jump out one leg

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.120 
to land I usually will jump out one leg
and<00:04:04.420> then<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.810> other<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:05.560> it's<00:04:05.710> more<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:06.100> like

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
and then the other so it's more of like

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.070 
and then the other so it's more of like
it's<00:04:06.670> not<00:04:06.850> just<00:04:07.090> clothes<00:04:07.300> and<00:04:07.330> slamming<00:04:07.900> down

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
it's not just clothes and slamming down

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.760 
it's not just clothes and slamming down
it's<00:04:08.380> like<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.770> little<00:04:09.460> like<00:04:09.610> step<00:04:10.030> into<00:04:10.390> thing

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
it's like a little like step into thing

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.370 
it's like a little like step into thing
so<00:04:11.770> absorb<00:04:12.220> that<00:04:12.400> shop<00:04:12.760> with<00:04:13.030> your<00:04:13.240> um<00:04:13.540> your

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
so absorb that shop with your um your

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.200 
so absorb that shop with your um your
feet<00:04:14.680> ankles<00:04:14.920> legs<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:17.520> Bend<00:04:18.520> with<00:04:18.790> it<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.090> go

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
feet ankles legs and Bend with it and go

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:25.130 
feet ankles legs and Bend with it and go
with<00:04:19.390> it<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:20.440> just<00:04:21.250> an<00:04:21.400> overview<00:04:21.670> really<00:04:22.060> quick

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.500 

jumping<00:04:26.140> out<00:04:26.380> like<00:04:27.100> this<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.610> then<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.270> can

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
jumping out like this and then you can

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.590
