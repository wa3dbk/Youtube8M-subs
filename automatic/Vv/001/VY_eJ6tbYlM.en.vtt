00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.800
 hey i 'm nice and no read aloud 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.599
 this is the coupon mini 1 52 e book 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.459
 reader two years ago this was 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.379
 device class times relatively popular there was 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.999
 there was the sony reader pocket edition there 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.100
 it the pocketbook 360 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.720
 meanwhile, the device class is 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.850
 almost extinct it almost becomes 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.050
 six more cylinders produced in this respect 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.790
 it was quite surprising as 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.220
 Coco this back here in september 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.800
 has come in these days in 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.750
 the trade costs around 80 euros and is 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.239
 according to coppo, especially a young mobile 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.750
 directed people manifests itself evenly also 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.970
 the fact that is very light again 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.480
 135 grams weighs there and around 50 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.790
 grams less than 6 inches e book reader 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.989
 we have the ball if we have the 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.190
 put both areas on top of each other 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.410
 we already see that the coupon 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.560
 mini much smaller clearly packaged 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.720
 fails and is even more transportable 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.700
 in the jacket pocket for example as it 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.710
 the polo is already relative 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.110
 small footprint as you can see 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.049
 relatively little space around the screen 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.969
 As I said, young mobile target group 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.430
 should buy the device for 80 euros 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:11.190
 insofar cuba willing to become so hip 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.370
 that we have the back exchangeable 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.500
 designed so relatively quiet 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.909
 one drove casually relaxed but the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.920
 back one can remove here and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.990
 buy various color covers the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.330
 Grass included for more cover needs 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.229
 money to be paid 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.100
 So the device can be so a bit 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.890
 optically adapt 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.600
 next to it we see that we at the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.580
 do not see pages so we do not have one 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 headphones connection no speakers 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.040
 do not have mp3 playback too 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.890
 unfortunately no micro SD card slot the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.330
 brings the cuckoo loya with this means 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.430
 the two gigabytes of internal memory space 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.420
 is not expandable 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.430
 otherwise give the two devices 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.500
 technically relatively little we have here 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.840
 in both devices another module 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.090
 Here we can already see the lot 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.060
 got book store have identical 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.560
 Main menus according to reading life 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.560
 social reading app by 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.590
 Kobo these are canadian relatively far 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.770
 in front and have but we can see here 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.160
 already on the homepage on the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.410
 main page in kuko mini an older one 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.880
 display so this is via link like 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.010
 It also bring the new kindles 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.019
 the new sony tenant brings that 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.569
 visbeks ink display was in chur mini 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.030
 is installed is an older generation 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.319
 sprung and not quite so 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.040
 Contrastingly not quite like that 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.450
 high contrast the current in panels of 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.120
 obligatory look in the book I have 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.549
 Here are six readers with six 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.200
 inch and five inch the same page 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.510
 View opened the same buchs 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.130
 here in direct comparison font size 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.810
 is about the same with both 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.150
 Readers that the khomeini after two 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.549
 thirds of a page disco pogo envelopes 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.590
 so we see here he believes he believes 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.000
 at this point here breaks the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.190
 Chromium in the end 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.709
 I look right times zoom 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.660
 friedrich to the front and I do not know 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.350
 how well you see this in the video here 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.530
 Khomeini has the darker the 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.049
 something darker background so font 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.609
 color is a little less black cromm 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.010
 coupe mini and the background is something 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.109
 the contrasts are more big 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.540
 a little better at the polo 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.030
 through the newer technology through the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.950
 newer generation, however 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.290
 You can also get a convertible on the coupon 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.010
 mini definitely has to read well 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.680
 you do not say yes 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.760
 of course, the mini dress has that 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.819
 I turn here once it is 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.130
 I should turn off the device already 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.620
 not fix together said 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.450
 latif dark here I am the device 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.019
 then turn on, of course, speaks 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.870
 finished dark for the qubo mini but 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:55.840
 under fair and equal conditions, the 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.139
 I can make a clear distinction 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.769
 would have seen a little here that the 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:05.360
 rubber has slightly larger refresh effect 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.300
 So the screen 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.270
 Visibly renewed came there often 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.380
 long set in the menu otherwise 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.870
 petals speed is with him 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.850
 These two devices nothing at epub 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.430
 Files with larger pdf files is 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.070
 so the kogelo already have some 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.170
 is more powerful because he is stronger 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.310
 has integrated hardware and the 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.310
 However, loading times are shorter 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.330
 otherwise put your head aside 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.100
 we have exactly the same firmware 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.860
 exactly the same menus, the 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.450
 Writing yes, yes, largely stepless 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.210
 Customize have different fonts 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.710
 but you can also choose to lay down 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.720
 spacing change the line spacing 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.950
 and here too blogs set the minis 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.680
 of course I have German 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.669
 changed 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.280
 if i have a longer time on a word 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.790
 presses a context menu I open 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.290
 try trams 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.970
 I 'll come up with a definition of that 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.740
 Word is displayed there too 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.970
 different lexica can choose 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.800
 can also make notes 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.840
 text marks mark it will be everything 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.470
 is not deposited in the book, however 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.970
 exportable as well as the coupe 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.590
 and with both devices, I would 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.780
 so that a stylus wish for 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.130
 with such great writing it is if then 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.720
 Everything is well marked but as soon as the 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.290
 font is a bit smaller a 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.360
 hard the lines the words I like 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.690
 her or to whom I declare 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.729
 would like to make an accurate fit 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.290
 my conclusion to the coupe mini is a very 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.330
 interesting form factor I think 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.880
 as before the advantages in mobility 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.020
 are proverbially obvious that 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.640
 device is much easier in 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.660
 to stow jackets and everywhere 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.419
 end to take than that at 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.070
 full blown 6 inch readers 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.830
 case, however, you have one 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.690
 a lot of compromises make acony there 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.550
 is on the one hand the clearer display 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.650
 The form factor he brings now place 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.300
 with you and is definitely a thing 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.370
 with which you have to arrange or 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.100
 maybe not so that you simply 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.200
 I have to turn over it more often 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.790
 It is a pity that the e ink 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.380
 display an older generation 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.390
 is associated 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.730
 that here is no current technology 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.900
 was built but yes the contrasts 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.880
 just not as sharp as at 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.950
 current kindles at the current sony 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.670
 reader at current pocket books or 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.860
 even even with the sister model + 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.230
 I think the price of 80 € also 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.130
 quite happily I have to say honestly 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.440
 certainly results too liszt too 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.640
 a good part of that 15 panels 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.490
 but not so produced anymore 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.650
 and therefore are more expensive in the ratio 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.890
 certainly the sixth in comparison 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:45.740
 panels still 80 euros for the qubo 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.890
 mini 100 euro for the kobo touch so de 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:54.140
 facto again here without hd display and 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:55.210
 without the eponymous glow sorry 20 euros 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.230
 difference 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.180
 I would rather become one 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.010
 fully grown again when I grab 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.740
 not really explicitly a back in 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.080
 would like to have my bag anytime 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.510
 or attacks even 480 euro so exactly 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.920
 the price of the rover mini zum kindle 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.490
 Kindle got a better one 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.690
 display has room on the display 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:18.160
 but the better overall 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.300
 reading experience so pro mini a device for 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.780
 young mobile people with the 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.950
 to be able to live up to the compromises 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.380
 and maybe a little something 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.670
 unusual in the subway from the 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.420
 want to pull bag on the way to 

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.420
 work or school
