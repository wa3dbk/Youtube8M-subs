00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.750
 very good people here I am lying 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.860
 listening to the rain fall and I think 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.020
 if it is thrown during the mobile to me we 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.889
 let's find accurate mobile and how 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.120
 fix it 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.820
 go for it 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.720
 to start what you have to do is 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.330
 try to defend the mobile let's see 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.500
 if it works and you understand it, not the first 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.540
 what you have to do is dismantle the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.310
 mobile and remove the battery is worth 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.780
 electricity is what is going to make it 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.760
 crossing the mobile is over 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.079
 being forever wrapped 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.920
 then what we have to do what 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.199
 first how to remove the battery 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.000
 we want to remove the battery of time and 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.050
 Now what we have to do is the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.210
 mobile to get the phone out 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.120
 we remove for the remains of liquid that 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.989
 they want outside but we know that maybe 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.549
 inside has remained liquid 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:08.280
 That's where another topic comes in 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:11.140
 integrated we can 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.110
 we also have holes that is more 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.590
 difficult to have entered by luck water 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.140
 in any case 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.290
 continuing with what we said once 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.410
 once we have removed the battery 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.570
 the ideal would be to separate all 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.890
 components that can be removed cards 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.220
 no battery cap etc. card 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.160
 memory of course and that we had everything 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.200
 in a boat with rice seems like a legend 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.790
 urban or something like that but rice absorbs 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 moisture and moisture is absorbed 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.830
 means 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.210
 You can remove moisture inside the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.140
 phone and it's been freshwater the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.189
 accident 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.270
 surely we will recover the mode and without 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.250
 problem if it has been in salt water 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.140
 perhaps salt has remained inside the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.860
 phone and the salt already crosses the circuits 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.979
 for this ideally knowing this and without 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.560
 lose nothing really the ideal would be the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.330
 bar in fresh water is to say after 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.890
 having wet the mobile remove the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.799
 battery as I said we said to the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.799
 principle but let it be 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.520
 a tap and dip the phone soak by 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.220
 inside the phone so that the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.260
 save and then follow the steps that 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.420
 We have commented to dry on the outside stays 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.300
 losing with rice no longer has to 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.550
 be about 24 hours to make sure 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.010
 they have removed all the moisture 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.130
 and well surely the mobile is 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.810
 working without taking into account that the 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.530
 mobile phones and mobiles 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.209
 one that comes in contact with moisture 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.190
 they have the sneaks for example inside 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.140
 can create rust is not going to hang 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.190
 take it because it means that it is a 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.150
 phone defect 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.830
 novak now have oxide inside is 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.410
 rust is left or if it works well 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.050
 if you do not guarantee it because you can not 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.570
 in addition also the batteries have a 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.900
 sneak this white dot is a sneak 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.940
 of the battery this white dot is 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.920
 puts the value that it deserves 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.980
 as if it's raining in the water 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.600
 but keep it in mind no longer 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.670
 is so good because of this that we are all 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.420
 the battery and in our guarantee 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.420
 well, good 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.860
 remember that from the mobile directly 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:55.370
 well and on a good day watches over a greeting 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.700
 everyone and see you in the following 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.700
 videos
