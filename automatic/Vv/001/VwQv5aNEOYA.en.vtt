00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
okay how to draw a power drill real easy

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.990 
okay how to draw a power drill real easy
well<00:00:03.449> what<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.840> want<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.290> kind<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:05.000> cube

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
well what you want is a kind of a cube

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.620 
well what you want is a kind of a cube
to<00:00:06.509> start<00:00:06.810> off<00:00:06.960> with<00:00:07.200> something<00:00:07.470> like<00:00:07.649> that

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
to start off with something like that

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.450 
to start off with something like that
and<00:00:09.630> then<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.110> will<00:00:10.349> then<00:00:10.559> kind<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.250> come

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
and then that will then kind of come

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.299 
and then that will then kind of come
down<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:12.300> meet<00:00:12.480> another<00:00:12.900> two<00:00:13.259> kind<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.559> two<00:00:13.889> bit

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
down to meet another two kind of two bit

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.900 
down to meet another two kind of two bit
and<00:00:14.639> then<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.330> even<00:00:15.680> and<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.130> even<00:00:17.369> smaller

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
and then and even and it is even smaller

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.269 
and then and even and it is even smaller
to<00:00:18.330> another<00:00:18.570> two<00:00:18.869> bit<00:00:19.170> like<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.980> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
to another two bit like that and that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.000 
to another two bit like that and that
will<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.730> all<00:00:21.150> kind<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.630> fuzzy<00:00:21.990> drive<00:00:22.320> drill

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
will be all kind of fuzzy drive drill

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.779 
will be all kind of fuzzy drive drill
bit<00:00:23.279> thing<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:24.060> there<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:25.410> think<00:00:26.220> you'll<00:00:26.550> find

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
bit thing in there I think you'll find

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.189 
bit thing in there I think you'll find
that<00:00:26.970> yeah<00:00:27.390> something<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
that yeah something like that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.939 
that yeah something like that
and<00:00:29.000> you've<00:00:30.000> got<00:00:30.449> bits<00:00:30.689> around<00:00:30.869> there<00:00:31.320> then

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949

and there's the pistols shooting bit
then<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> kind<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.910> box<00:00:42.239> down<00:00:42.660> at

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
then you have a kind of a box down at

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.760 
then you have a kind of a box down at
the<00:00:42.899> bottom<00:00:44.360> something<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.780> okay

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the bottom something like that okay

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.549 
the bottom something like that okay
oh<00:00:46.800> let's<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> middle<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:49.410> then

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
oh let's get that in the middle and then

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.869 
oh let's get that in the middle and then
we<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.829> go<00:00:50.010> kind<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> round<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> edges

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
we just go kind of round the edges

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.950 
we just go kind of round the edges
reason<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.930> go<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:53.120> around<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.629> edge

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
reason there we go all around the edge

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.189 
reason there we go all around the edge
there<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:57.180> goes<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:58.109> want

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
there and it goes there you don't want

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.709 
there and it goes there you don't want
that<00:00:58.500> fitting<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.359> that's<00:01:00.359> probably

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that fitting in there that's probably

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.399 
that fitting in there that's probably
gonna<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.020> strike<00:01:02.010> ish<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> thing<00:01:03.120> there

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
gonna be strike ish kind of thing there

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.679 
gonna be strike ish kind of thing there
and<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:05.189> will<00:01:05.400> come<00:01:05.670> down<00:01:06.740> too<00:01:08.330> yeah<00:01:09.360> that's

mate is a kind of a pistol kind of grip
like<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:31.740> curve<00:01:32.070> around<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
like that and then curve around the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
like that and then curve around the
edges<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:33.619> for<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> battery<00:01:35.130> box<00:01:36.170> like<00:01:37.170> that

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
edges here for the battery box like that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.640 
edges here for the battery box like that
and<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.810> draw<00:01:39.810> nice<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.530> they

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and then draw nice like that so they

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.899 
and then draw nice like that so they
don't<00:01:40.680> meet<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.369> middle<00:01:41.640> you're<00:01:41.820> gonna

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
don't meet in the middle you're gonna

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.880 
don't meet in the middle you're gonna
want<00:01:42.150> some<00:01:42.299> kind<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.540> logo<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:43.290> some<00:01:43.710> kind
