the enemy away from the objective and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.700 
the enemy away from the objective and
then<00:02:15.880> capture<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.420> for<00:02:16.540> your<00:02:16.660> own<00:02:16.900> team<00:02:17.140> now

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
then capture it for your own team now

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.320 
then capture it for your own team now
here<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:17.950> can<00:02:18.160> see<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> started<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.940> capture<00:02:19.300> it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
here you can see I started to capture it

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.210 
here you can see I started to capture it
I<00:02:19.480> shock<00:02:19.780> charge<00:02:20.080> all<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.590> doors<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.980> make

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
I shock charge all the doors to make

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.010 
I shock charge all the doors to make
sure<00:02:21.490> that<00:02:22.000> we<00:02:22.090> can<00:02:22.240> capture<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:22.720> without

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
sure that we can capture this without

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.810 
sure that we can capture this without
the<00:02:23.080> enemies<00:02:23.410> infiltrating<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.370> objective

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
the enemies infiltrating the objective

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.880 
the enemies infiltrating the objective
area<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.110> second<00:02:26.380> we<00:02:26.440> end<00:02:26.560> up<00:02:26.650> capturing

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
area so in a second we end up capturing

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.770 
area so in a second we end up capturing
this<00:02:27.220> with<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.610> help<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.910> my<00:02:28.060> shock<00:02:28.330> charges

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
this with the help of my shock charges

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.600 
this with the help of my shock charges
and<00:02:28.930> us<00:02:29.530> cleaning<00:02:29.950> out<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.220> rooms<00:02:30.430> and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
and us cleaning out the rooms and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.150 
and us cleaning out the rooms and
entrances<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.740> most<00:02:32.890> crucial

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
entrances so this is the most crucial

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.100 
entrances so this is the most crucial
part<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.970> blocking<00:02:34.450> out<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.600> enemies<00:02:34.960> and

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
part is blocking out the enemies and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.810 
part is blocking out the enemies and
suppressing<00:02:35.650> them<00:02:35.770> back<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.160> their<00:02:36.250> own<00:02:36.430> spawn

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
suppressing them back to their own spawn

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.120 
suppressing them back to their own spawn
without<00:02:37.180> them<00:02:37.360> flipping<00:02:37.720> around<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
without them flipping around so the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.010 
without them flipping around so the
spawns<00:02:39.460> in<00:02:39.640> nuketown<00:02:39.940> are<00:02:40.300> incredibly<00:02:40.750> hard

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
spawns in nuketown are incredibly hard

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.260 
spawns in nuketown are incredibly hard
to<00:02:41.230> predict<00:02:41.710> because<00:02:42.490> they<00:02:42.610> flip<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.000> often

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
to predict because they flip so often

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.880 
to predict because they flip so often
they<00:02:43.360> can<00:02:43.480> often<00:02:43.750> spawn<00:02:44.080> right<00:02:44.440> behind<00:02:44.680> you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
they can often spawn right behind you

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.340 
they can often spawn right behind you
even<00:02:45.130> if<00:02:45.220> you've<00:02:45.370> only<00:02:45.460> just<00:02:45.670> been<00:02:46.540> inside<00:02:47.230> of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
even if you've only just been inside of

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.020 
even if you've only just been inside of
the<00:02:47.440> spawn<00:02:47.680> change<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.700> now<00:02:48.790> we're<00:02:48.880> going<00:02:48.970> to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
the spawn change so now we're going to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.670 
the spawn change so now we're going to
move<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.420> playing<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.020> sides<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
move on to playing the sides and the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.680 
move on to playing the sides and the
rooms<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.220> before<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.180> go<00:02:52.420> any<00:02:52.450> further

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
rooms and before I go any further

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.050 
rooms and before I go any further
forward<00:02:53.410> there<00:02:53.740> are<00:02:53.890> some<00:02:54.100> perfect<00:02:54.730> score

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
forward there are some perfect score

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.000 
forward there are some perfect score
streaks<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.510> use<00:02:55.660> for<00:02:55.840> nuketown<00:02:56.080> now<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:56.920> this

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010

incredibly easy to build up you want to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.979 
incredibly easy to build up you want to
