00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.340
 and 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.550
 and is a guy from youtube greeted him with 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.950
 a new video and the video and I want 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.750
 show them a fabulous that is the nickname 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.840
 redstone so in that moral see things 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.320
 new because it will not be like before 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.950
 before it was 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 that it was like a carpet type that had 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.600
 the texture of the rest is now a little 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.180
 more complex and better because it's already with 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.170
 iron blocks but that's not what 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.890
 better but you can use more 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.210
 mechanisms like the farms and that thing 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.210
 so good guys let's start with 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.770
 this video and I'm going to show you what it is 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.570
 the mole then the least in our sea 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.380
 and you can forgive because he wrote 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:19.299
 complete then that in a case and limit and 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.179
 boats then we go with the humor then 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.899
 how can we see this that is the slab 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.899
 effort 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.080
 is 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.990
 why 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.890
 we can know what 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:47.750
 that is to say that the step is that the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.440
 step is the pressure 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.090
 as you can see if activated as the 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.210
 block the blue track is the button 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.090
 and then this is the min the button but 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.340
 it's two nights that I have but the one 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.579
 It takes very wants to serve as why we 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.330
 serve I do it I'll have to leave 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.330
 magnetic 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.510
 and re-enter 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.980
 ya good guys 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.110
 this is the price plate as you can see 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.110
 floor 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.220
 in the mineral of her martin 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.040
 is the lever if we touch is activated if 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.000
 we're going to play it off 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.940
 the coal mineral 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.050
 it's a button if we touch it active and 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.050
 deactivate again 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.770
 and it 's the gold block 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.820
 it's the repeater 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:57.150
 more guys then what else 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.420
 this is the piston cited with the block 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.710
 in the diamond mineral between these 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.650
 two that is the block 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.940
 this is the piston is the one that will push what 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.910
 what it does is create a block of land 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.440
 between the two but what happens I do not want it 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.230
 activate why it does not work for me 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.900
 I know if it works for you but I know 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.910
 I created the game or whatever asset 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.180
 So it's good then, here 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.180

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.600
