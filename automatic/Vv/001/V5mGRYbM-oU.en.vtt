00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
into the net no snags in the swim so

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.580 
into the net no snags in the swim so
everything<00:01:10.939> was<00:01:11.030> in<00:01:11.180> my<00:01:11.299> favor<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.930> then<00:01:12.470> I

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
everything was in my favor and then I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.880 
everything was in my favor and then I
had<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.979> hook<00:01:13.939> pull<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:14.899> I<00:01:15.170> lost<00:01:15.409> that<00:01:15.590> fish

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
had the hook pull so I lost that fish

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.770 
had the hook pull so I lost that fish
that<00:01:16.549> would<00:01:16.759> have<00:01:16.880> been<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.299> difference

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
that would have been the difference

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.170 
that would have been the difference
between<00:01:18.079> success<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.009> failure<00:01:19.189> although<00:01:20.150> I

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
between success and failure although I

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.500 
between success and failure although I
use<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.659> words<00:01:20.840> in<00:01:21.830> inverted<00:01:22.820> commas<00:01:22.820> really

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
use the words in inverted commas really

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.600 
use the words in inverted commas really
because<00:01:24.290> there's<00:01:24.440> no<00:01:24.560> such<00:01:24.800> thing<00:01:24.830> as<00:01:25.190> failure

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
because there's no such thing as failure

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.200 
because there's no such thing as failure
in<00:01:26.150> angling<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:27.320> about<00:01:27.440> enjoyment<00:01:27.970> but<00:01:28.970> I'm

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
molding a small amount of it there just

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.490

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
small amount of it so that it's actually

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.959 
small amount of it so that it's actually
wrapped<00:02:22.189> around<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.750> lead<00:02:23.959> there<00:02:24.919> you<00:02:24.980> go<00:02:25.159> see

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
wrapped around the lead there you go see

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:26.930 
wrapped around the lead there you go see
there

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
there

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.370 
there
and<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.540> serves<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.840> couple<00:02:27.960> of<00:02:28.170> purposes

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
and that serves a couple of purposes

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.980 
and that serves a couple of purposes
really<00:02:28.980> first<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.940> all<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.180> enables<00:02:30.570> me<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.720> get

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
really first of all it enables me to get

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.290 
really first of all it enables me to get
the<00:02:31.110> bait<00:02:31.320> exactly<00:02:32.190> where<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.580> wanted<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.210> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
the bait exactly where I wanted on the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.810 
the bait exactly where I wanted on the
riverbed<00:02:34.140> although<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:35.130> isn't<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.550> much

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
riverbed although there isn't that much

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.450 
riverbed although there isn't that much
flow<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.810> peg<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.200> I'm<00:02:37.320> fishing<00:02:37.560> that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
flow in the peg that I'm fishing that

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.640 
flow in the peg that I'm fishing that
there's<00:02:38.700> enough<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.030> if<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.480> was<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.110> throw

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
there's enough that if I was to throw

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.100 
there's enough that if I was to throw
loose<00:02:41.160> maggots<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.790> then<00:02:42.330> they<00:02:42.480> would<00:02:42.630> soon<00:02:42.840> be

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
loose maggots in then they would soon be

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.480 
loose maggots in then they would soon be
washed<00:02:44.070> downstream<00:02:44.490> somewhere<00:02:45.210> so<00:02:45.930> this

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
washed downstream somewhere so this

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.330 
washed downstream somewhere so this
enables<00:02:47.490> me<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.640> get<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.780> bait<00:02:49.190> exactly<00:02:50.190> what

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
enables me to get the bait exactly what

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.690 
enables me to get the bait exactly what
I<00:02:50.370> wanted<00:02:50.850> on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.690> riverbed<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:52.920> secondly<00:02:53.370> if

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
I wanted on the riverbed but secondly if

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.700 
I wanted on the riverbed but secondly if
I<00:02:53.880> was<00:02:54.000> using<00:02:54.210> a<00:02:54.420> cage<00:02:54.720> feeder<00:02:55.050> or<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.320> feeder

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
I was using a cage feeder or a feeder

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.450 
I was using a cage feeder or a feeder
which<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.100> do<00:02:56.160> sometimes<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:57.090> here<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.900> must<00:02:58.230> say

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
which I do sometimes on here I must say

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.390 
which I do sometimes on here I must say
but<00:02:59.460> if<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.640> was<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.090> use<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:00.480> then<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:02.010> cage

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
but if I was to use that then the cage

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.010 
but if I was to use that then the cage
feeder<00:03:02.670> would<00:03:02.880> be<00:03:03.060> greater<00:03:03.390> getting<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> bait

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
feeder would be greater getting the bait

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.020 
feeder would be greater getting the bait
down<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:04.920> then<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.040> course<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.490> still<00:03:05.790> got

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
down but then of course you still got

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.380 
down but then of course you still got
the<00:03:06.180> cage<00:03:06.390> feeder<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:07.130> your<00:03:08.130> rig<00:03:08.400> while<00:03:09.150> you're

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
the cage feeder on your rig while you're

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.620 
the cage feeder on your rig while you're
fishing<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.620> enables<00:03:11.430> me<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.610> shed<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
fishing so this enables me to shed the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.660 
fishing so this enables me to shed the
bait<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:13.500> share<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.860> groundbait<00:03:14.220> shed<00:03:14.580> the

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
bait to share the groundbait shed the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.390 
bait to share the groundbait shed the
crime<00:03:14.940> but<00:03:15.570> then<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.930> fish<00:03:16.140> sensitively<00:03:17.070> I

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
crime but then to fish sensitively I

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.160 
crime but then to fish sensitively I
have<00:03:17.910> fished<00:03:18.210> with<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.450> cage<00:03:18.870> feeder

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
have fished with a cage feeder

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.470 
have fished with a cage feeder
particularly<00:03:19.830> when<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.250> river<00:03:20.790> has<00:03:21.120> add<00:03:21.420> a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
particularly when the river has add a

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.010 
particularly when the river has add a
lot<00:03:22.440> more<00:03:22.850> increased<00:03:23.850> flow<00:03:24.120> when<00:03:24.660> it's<00:03:24.810> been

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
lot more increased flow when it's been

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.280 
lot more increased flow when it's been
up<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.440> rising<00:03:26.040> but<00:03:26.970> certainly<00:03:27.390> as<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:28.050> is<00:03:28.200> at

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
up and rising but certainly as it is at

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.370 
up and rising but certainly as it is at
the<00:03:28.380> moment<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:29.160> really<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.240> just<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:31.320> just

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
the moment this really is just is just

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.430 
the moment this really is just is just
perfect<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.780> hopefully<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:34.170> will<00:03:34.290> all<00:03:34.410> come

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
perfect so hopefully it will all come

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.970 
perfect so hopefully it will all come
together<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.190> i'll<00:03:36.150> catch<00:03:36.510> some<00:03:37.110> fish<00:03:37.350> with

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
together and i'll catch some fish with

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
together and i'll catch some fish with
it

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.610

but<00:06:32.770> worthwhile<00:06:33.520> correcting<00:06:34.330> these<00:06:35.260> little

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710

attempts<00:06:42.160> I<00:06:42.250> just<00:06:42.490> film<00:06:42.940> and<00:06:44.010> record<00:06:45.010> so<00:06:45.700> you

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
attempts I just film and record so you

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.630 
attempts I just film and record so you
get<00:06:46.090> warts<00:06:46.390> and<00:06:46.630> all<00:06:46.750> on<00:06:47.020> here<00:06:47.680> but

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
get warts and all on here but

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.540 
get warts and all on here but
occasionally<00:06:49.210> just<00:06:49.380> worthwhile<00:06:50.380> to<00:06:50.650> maybe

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
occasionally just worthwhile to maybe

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.260 
occasionally just worthwhile to maybe
correct<00:06:51.940> something<00:06:52.180> and<00:06:52.570> so<00:06:53.730> stand-in<00:06:54.730> with<00:06:54.910> a

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
correct something and so stand-in with a

correct something and so stand-in with a
fish<00:06:55.600> is<00:06:55.810> it's<00:06:56.500> worthwhile<00:06:56.680> pointing<00:06:57.340> out

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
fish is it's worthwhile pointing out

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.390 
fish is it's worthwhile pointing out
that<00:06:57.610> we<00:06:57.730> don't<00:06:57.910> actually<00:06:58.810> do<00:06:59.350> that<00:06:59.400> literally

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
that we don't actually do that literally
