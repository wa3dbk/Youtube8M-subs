that matter because I have no idea like
what<00:00:50.070> direction<00:00:50.780> 180<00:00:51.780> vs<00:00:52.350> 0<00:00:52.680> degrees<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.399> on

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
what direction 180 vs 0 degrees is on

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.869 
what direction 180 vs 0 degrees is on
these<00:00:53.820> motors<00:00:54.270> yet<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> need<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.710> uh<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.190> don't

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
these motors yet so I need to uh I don't

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.540 
these motors yet so I need to uh I don't
know<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.840> my<00:00:58.020> bearings<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.710> let's<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.430> what

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
know get my bearings but let's see what

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:29.899 
know get my bearings but let's see what
happens

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.560 

so<00:01:30.909> noodle<00:01:31.270> feet<00:01:31.479> is<00:01:31.600> stomping<00:01:33.299> he<00:01:34.299> is<00:01:34.420> an

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
so noodle feet is stomping he is an

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
noodle walk I'm making him lift in spin

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.620 
noodle walk I'm making him lift in spin
and<00:02:23.260> set<00:02:23.530> down<00:02:23.709> his<00:02:23.769> feet<00:02:24.400> but<00:02:24.910> he<00:02:25.269> needs<00:02:25.480> to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
and set down his feet but he needs to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.509 
and set down his feet but he needs to
like<00:02:26.070> lean<00:02:27.070> in<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:28.239> direction<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:29.410> correct<00:02:30.280> so

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
like lean in a direction in correct so

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.100 
like lean in a direction in correct so
that<00:02:30.670> he<00:02:30.790> actually<00:02:30.940> moves<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.780> doesn't<00:02:32.079> just

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
that he actually moves and doesn't just

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.940 
that he actually moves and doesn't just
I<00:02:32.530> don't<00:02:33.160> know<00:02:33.400> do<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.269> whatever<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.170> was

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:03:30.640 

yeah<00:02:39.720> that's<00:02:40.720> why<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:40.840> have<00:02:41.079> a<00:02:41.109> harness

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.340 

so<00:03:31.880> marks<00:03:32.880> on<00:03:33.030> all<00:03:33.210> fours<00:03:33.570> because<00:03:33.960> he's<00:03:34.140> going

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
so marks on all fours because he's going

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.310 
so marks on all fours because he's going
to<00:03:34.440> demonstrate<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:35.490> us<00:03:35.580> how<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.320> quadruped

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
to demonstrate for us how a quadruped

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.030 
to demonstrate for us how a quadruped
head<00:03:37.560> would<00:03:37.830> move<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.810> we<00:03:39.930> can<00:03:40.140> figure<00:03:40.350> out<00:03:40.470> no

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
head would move so we can figure out no

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.310 
head would move so we can figure out no
don't<00:03:41.250> ending<00:03:41.610> I'm<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.090> noodle<00:03:42.450> feet<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.170> I'm

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
don't ending I'm the noodle feet so I'm

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.200 
don't ending I'm the noodle feet so I'm
putting<00:03:44.330> my<00:03:45.330> body<00:03:45.660> above<00:03:46.230> my<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:46.830> peg<00:03:47.640> joints

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
gonna move forward so this is number one

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.870 
gonna move forward so this is number one
right<00:03:57.270> yeah<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.410> for<00:03:59.070> me<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.310> move<00:03:59.459> forward

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
right yeah so for me to move forward

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.430 
right yeah so for me to move forward
right<00:04:00.390> all<00:04:01.320> my<00:04:01.800> weight<00:04:02.930> shifts<00:04:03.930> over<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.260> can

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
right all my weight shifts over I can

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.870 
right all my weight shifts over I can
feel<00:04:04.590> all<00:04:04.650> my<00:04:04.920> weight<00:04:05.100> moving<00:04:05.550> over<00:04:05.820> here

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
feel all my weight moving over here

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.050 
feel all my weight moving over here
because<00:04:06.209> all<00:04:07.310> otherwise<00:04:08.310> I'm<00:04:08.520> gonna<00:04:08.610> fall

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
because all otherwise I'm gonna fall

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.580 
because all otherwise I'm gonna fall
over<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:10.440> kind<00:04:10.770> of<00:04:10.800> have<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:10.980> move<00:04:11.340> backwards

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
over so I kind of have to move backwards

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.500 
over so I kind of have to move backwards
my<00:04:13.590> weight<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:13.920> then<00:04:14.370> this<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:15.000> hold<00:04:15.180> for

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
my weight and then this to hold for

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.770 
my weight and then this to hold for
