00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
it's got a high mid frequency and then

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.340 
it's got a high mid frequency and then
the<00:01:16.950> other<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.310> based<00:01:17.840> bass<00:01:18.840> boost<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the other one is based bass boost and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.300 
the other one is based bass boost and
cut<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> low<00:01:20.729> mid<00:01:21.030> high<00:01:21.360> free<00:01:21.990> low<00:01:22.619> mid

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.580 
cut with a low mid high free low mid
frequency<00:01:23.909> boosting<00:01:24.509> cut<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> also

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
frequency boosting cut and then you also

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.120 
frequency boosting cut and then you also
have<00:01:25.979> your<00:01:26.100> 3-way<00:01:26.610> z<00:01:27.060> mode<00:01:27.330> switch<00:01:27.890> which<00:01:28.890> I'll

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
have your 3-way z mode switch which I'll

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.910 
have your 3-way z mode switch which I'll
put<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> link<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> audio<00:01:30.750> website<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.860> you

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
put a link to the audio website so you

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.010 
put a link to the audio website so you
can<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:32.880> more<00:01:33.119> in-depth<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.780> what

can go in a little more in-depth on what
the<00:01:34.229> three<00:01:34.890> presets<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> switch<00:01:35.939> are<00:01:36.270> all

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the three presets on the switch are all

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.480 
the three presets on the switch are all
about<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> go<00:01:38.460> through

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
about so I'm just going to go through

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.580 
about so I'm just going to go through
some<00:01:38.850> different<00:01:39.299> bass<00:01:39.570> grooves<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> settings

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
some different bass grooves and settings

some different bass grooves and settings
on<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> EQ<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> better<00:01:41.790> sense

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
on the EQ so you can get a better sense

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.810 
on the EQ so you can get a better sense
of<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.570> bass<00:01:42.869> sounds<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.380> I'll<00:01:44.280> start

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
going to give it a little bit of bass

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.300 
going to give it a little bit of bass
boost<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.509> little<00:01:51.899> bit<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.530> trouble<00:01:52.950> boost

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
boost and a little bit of trouble boost

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.120 
boost and a little bit of trouble boost
and<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:54.570> Z<00:01:54.810> mode<00:01:55.079> switch<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.649> set<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.040> the
