my name is swagga 35 today I want to put
out<00:01:17.250> my<00:01:17.400> theories<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.120> this<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.830> have

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
out my theories on this I think I have

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.350 
out my theories on this I think I have
figured<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.400> i<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:20.880> i<00:01:20.940> have<00:01:20.970> actually

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
figured out i think i have actually

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.680 
figured out i think i have actually
cracked<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> code<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:23.280> Treyarch<00:01:24.210> i<00:01:24.390> mean<00:01:24.570> this

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
cracked the code on Treyarch i mean this

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.650 
cracked the code on Treyarch i mean this
is<00:01:24.900> obviously<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.620> theory<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.910> it<00:01:27.630> i

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
is obviously just a theory but it i

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.120 
is obviously just a theory but it i
think<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.320> my<00:01:28.410> opinion<00:01:28.440> is<00:01:28.830> pretty<00:01:29.040> good

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
think in my opinion is pretty good

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.750 
think in my opinion is pretty good
theory<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.730> let's<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.330> started<00:01:31.340> now<00:01:32.340> when<00:01:32.550> he

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
theory so let's get started now when he

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.810 
theory so let's get started now when he
says<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:33.450> max's<00:01:33.990> tell<00:01:34.440> Samantha<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:35.370> Eddie

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
says when max's tell Samantha and Eddie

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.350 
says when max's tell Samantha and Eddie
to<00:01:36.450> lock<00:01:36.900> their<00:01:37.290> windows<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.190> come<00:01:39.030> down<00:01:39.210> to

Richthofen is going to be coming to
their<00:01:52.650> house<00:01:52.830> and<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.850> want<00:01:54.090> him<00:01:54.270> to

zombies are in wrecked Hoffman obviously

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
zombies are in wrecked Hoffman obviously
will<00:02:14.010> not<00:02:14.130> be<00:02:14.250> able<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:15.030> come<00:02:15.360> through<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
will not be able to come through the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.160 
will not be able to come through the
window<00:02:16.820> um<00:02:18.560> as<00:02:19.940> we<00:02:20.940> know<00:02:21.120> Richthofen<00:02:21.989> was

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
window um as we know Richthofen was

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.510 
window um as we know Richthofen was
killing<00:02:22.590> max's<00:02:23.070> in<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.850> origins<00:02:24.360> cutscene<00:02:25.520> um

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
killing max's in the origins cutscene um

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.610 
killing max's in the origins cutscene um
which<00:02:27.300> leads<00:02:27.600> me<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.840> believe<00:02:28.050> that

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
which leads me to believe that

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.540 
which leads me to believe that
Richthofen<00:02:29.580> was<00:02:29.790> coming<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.510> kill<00:02:30.810> max's<00:02:31.550> but

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
Richthofen was coming to kill max's but

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.030 
Richthofen was coming to kill max's but

as Samantha said she said my dad has a
plan<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.600> figured<00:02:36.810> out<00:02:37.020> what<00:02:37.200> his

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
plan and I have figured out what his

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.880

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
around your mind if you can we thought

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.770 
around your mind if you can we thought
oh<00:04:24.840> i<00:04:25.410> thought<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.520> heck<00:04:26.699> is<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:26.940> kid<00:04:27.150> but<00:04:27.510> it

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
oh i thought the heck is this kid but it

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.700 
oh i thought the heck is this kid but it
is<00:04:28.020> Richthofen<00:04:28.590> son<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:30.229> Richthofen<00:04:31.229> did<00:04:31.410> not

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
is Richthofen son so Richthofen did not

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.969 
is Richthofen son so Richthofen did not
kill<00:04:32.220> Eddie<00:04:32.930> he<00:04:33.930> took<00:04:34.289> his<00:04:34.560> son<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.010> group<00:04:35.310> 912

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
kill Eddie he took his son to group 912

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.120 
kill Eddie he took his son to group 912
so<00:04:37.979> I<00:04:38.010> I'm<00:04:38.490> later<00:04:39.270> investigating<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.260> but

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
so I I'm later investigating that but

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.860 
so I I'm later investigating that but
Eddie<00:04:41.460> somehow<00:04:42.060> got<00:04:42.330> away<00:04:42.470> from<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.620> because

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
Eddie somehow got away from that because

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.890 
Eddie somehow got away from that because
he<00:04:45.870> must<00:04:46.110> have<00:04:46.229> gotten<00:04:46.440> out<00:04:46.729> or<00:04:47.900> another

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
he must have gotten out or another

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.430 
he must have gotten out or another
theory<00:04:49.410> is<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:49.620> Eddie<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:50.310> either<00:04:51.440> Dempsey

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
theory is that Eddie is either Dempsey

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.610 
theory is that Eddie is either Dempsey
or<00:04:52.740> Nikolai<00:04:53.220> or<00:04:53.430> something<00:04:53.930> he's<00:04:54.930> obviously

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
or Nikolai or something he's obviously

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.580 
or Nikolai or something he's obviously
not<00:04:55.919> Takeo<00:04:56.840> arte<00:04:57.840> kyo<00:04:58.110> but<00:04:58.590> he<00:04:58.860> is<00:04:59.099> one<00:04:59.550> of<00:04:59.729> the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
not Takeo arte kyo but he is one of the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.430 
not Takeo arte kyo but he is one of the
the<00:05:01.590> origins<00:05:02.070> characters<00:05:02.820> or<00:05:03.210> he<00:05:03.690> got<00:05:03.870> away<00:05:04.729> so

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
the origins characters or he got away so

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.159 
the origins characters or he got away so
yeah<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:08.010> my<00:05:08.220> theory<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:09.180> Richthofen

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
yeah that is my theory that Richthofen

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.250 
yeah that is my theory that Richthofen
was<00:05:10.380> coming<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:11.880> kill<00:05:12.720> Maxis<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:13.729> Samantha<00:05:14.729> as

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
was coming to kill Maxis and Samantha as

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:22.010 
was coming to kill Maxis and Samantha as
we<00:05:16.260> saw<00:05:16.500> are<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:19.620> max<00:05:20.460> has<00:05:20.669> had<00:05:20.849> a<00:05:20.880> plan<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.570> kill

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
we saw are so max has had a plan to kill

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.080 
we saw are so max has had a plan to kill
Richthofen<00:05:22.770> but<00:05:22.949> that<00:05:23.099> plan<00:05:23.370> didn't<00:05:23.729> work<00:05:23.760> out

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
Richthofen but that plan didn't work out

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.850 
Richthofen but that plan didn't work out
and<00:05:24.620> that<00:05:25.620> is<00:05:25.860> when<00:05:27.440> Richthofen<00:05:28.440> was<00:05:28.620> going<00:05:28.800> to

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
and that is when Richthofen was going to

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.880 
and that is when Richthofen was going to
kill<00:05:29.070> Samantha<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.940> Maxis<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:30.890> fluffy

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
kill Samantha and Maxis and fluffy

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.300 
kill Samantha and Maxis and fluffy
turned<00:05:32.130> into<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:32.580> first<00:05:32.849> hellhound<00:05:34.010> now<00:05:35.010> as

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
turned into the first hellhound now as

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.460 
turned into the first hellhound now as
we<00:05:35.520> know<00:05:35.700> I<00:05:36.030> know<00:05:36.539> this<00:05:36.990> theory

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
we know I know this theory

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.990 
we know I know this theory
basically<00:05:38.430> because<00:05:38.730> the<00:05:39.000> trailer<00:05:39.930> of<00:05:40.170> origins

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
basically because the trailer of origins

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.770 
basically because the trailer of origins
showed<00:05:42.000> Richthofen<00:05:42.960> killing<00:05:44.300> dissecting<00:05:45.300> max

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
showed Richthofen killing dissecting max

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.760 
showed Richthofen killing dissecting max
is<00:05:46.050> his<00:05:46.260> brain<00:05:47.240> so<00:05:48.240> basically<00:05:49.050> what<00:05:49.350> i<00:05:49.380> think

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
is his brain so basically what i think

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.710 
is his brain so basically what i think
is<00:05:49.950> that<00:05:49.980> he<00:05:50.340> was<00:05:50.460> trying<00:05:50.700> to<00:05:50.940> stop<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.690> stop

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
is that he was trying to stop to stop

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.200 
is that he was trying to stop to stop
him<00:05:52.260> from<00:05:52.290> being<00:05:52.740> a<00:05:52.920> zombie<00:05:53.130> because<00:05:53.970> he<00:05:54.090> did

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
him from being a zombie because he did

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.370 
him from being a zombie because he did
not<00:05:54.270> want<00:05:54.480> him<00:05:54.840> on<00:05:54.870> his<00:05:55.170> side<00:05:56.510> so<00:05:57.510> yeah<00:05:57.750> thanks

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
not want him on his side so yeah thanks

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.640 
not want him on his side so yeah thanks
for<00:05:58.800> listening<00:05:59.220> to<00:05:59.760> my<00:06:00.660> theory<00:06:01.310> um<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:04.080> end<00:06:04.320> is

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
for listening to my theory um the end is

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.700 
for listening to my theory um the end is
literally<00:06:05.250> just<00:06:05.730> the<00:06:06.030> beginning<00:06:06.320> so<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:07.440> past

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
literally just the beginning so the past

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.790 
literally just the beginning so the past
three<00:06:08.130> games<00:06:08.160> we<00:06:08.610> have<00:06:08.640> played<00:06:09.150> of<00:06:10.140> zombies

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
three games we have played of zombies

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.460 
three games we have played of zombies
has<00:06:11.100> led<00:06:11.430> to<00:06:11.610> this<00:06:11.640> moment<00:06:11.790> and<00:06:12.510> I<00:06:13.050> think<00:06:13.110> that

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
has led to this moment and I think that

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.430 
has led to this moment and I think that
we<00:06:13.590> can<00:06:13.770> be<00:06:13.920> expecting<00:06:14.790> at<00:06:15.000> least<00:06:15.170> three<00:06:16.170> more

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
we can be expecting at least three more

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.430 
we can be expecting at least three more
games<00:06:16.680> before<00:06:17.640> the<00:06:17.940> zombies<00:06:18.510> theory<00:06:18.840> ends<00:06:19.320> I

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
games before the zombies theory ends I

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.730 
games before the zombies theory ends I
think<00:06:20.250> personally<00:06:20.850> we<00:06:21.210> will<00:06:21.360> be<00:06:21.740> expecting

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
think personally we will be expecting

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.310 
think personally we will be expecting
six<00:06:23.310> more<00:06:23.640> games<00:06:23.850> three<00:06:24.630> for<00:06:24.870> the<00:06:24.960> middle<00:06:25.230> and

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
six more games three for the middle and

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.410 
six more games three for the middle and
three<00:06:25.560> for<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:25.860> end<00:06:26.010> so<00:06:26.670> yeah<00:06:26.850> thanks<00:06:27.270> for

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420
