00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.020
 I feel that all those who have 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.730

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.850
 also of you have done it 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.899
 heart appreciating the work that August 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.899
 providing them with tools for 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.730
 modify your operating system good already 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.489
 so as not to bore you, let's start with 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.739
 good tutorial you downloaded the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.600
 files of each download link as well 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.100
 same here I only have three but they 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.900
 I will leave the others also in the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.700
 description of the video 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.680
 what we will do is click 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.440
 secondary on the point file 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.420
 rare we will choose the option to extract 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.670
 here and so will leave the folders with 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.470
 the files to now occupy the first 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.450
 will be the skins alien theme that at 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.460
 open it we will notice that there are two files 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.260
 both the installer and the application 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.050
 full class to make the windows 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.030
 transparent but before I will pass them a 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.280
 analysis with the antivirus so that then 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.990
 Do not tell me you have a virus or something if you 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.180
 he comes to recognize them as a file 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.520
 harmful is because this program changes the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.950
 windows interface is because this one 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.740
 windows completely changed the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.110
 colors the taskbar the clock the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.580
 pop-ups as well as the interface 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.770
 of shines programs that we are 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.450
 occupying finally several things like 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.220
 We'll see later and if you 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.140
 recognizes so only disable their 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.090
 antivirus for a short time in what 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.770
 that we install the theme as you will see there is no 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.300
 threat so there's no problem in 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.760
 install it 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.860
 well now about the installer we will give 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.780
 double click on the installer or if 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.310
 they like to run as administrator and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.310
 will open the installation wizard 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.690
 as you know we will give in next 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:17.180
 we will accept the license agreement 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.980
 we will give in next we leave marked the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.000
 options that show us we give in 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.040
 next and we will start the installation here 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.590
 pause the video as it takes a bit 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.450
 about 4 minutes or 5 depending 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.370
 how quickly the installation goes to 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.910
 term of the same we will give in network 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.129
 boudou 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.170
 or restart now and end 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.150
 to have their system restarted and the 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.890
 start again and appear to them the 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.930
 modifications with the new theme 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.810
 applied and 100% in your system 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.790
 operative it should be noted that not yet 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.530
 will remain with the windows in blas but 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.530
 we'll do that in a few more moments 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.040
 good since it has rebooted us 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.020
 system with the new theme already put 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.060
 let's put the transparency and the 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.220
 windows for this we go to the folder 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.800
 again and double click the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.600
 application of jungles so that already 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.700
 stay in our system which as 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.610
 we'll see is already active in the bar 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.840
 tasks and although the effect is not visible 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.640
 We will instantly open other folders 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.430
 where we will see that the effect has already 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.020
 stayed in the system now we will go to 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.850
 put three of the images that they 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.709
 I'll leave in the description of the video and 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.959
 that this background that has the theme does not 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.090
 It beats in addition that it is the only one that brings and 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.100
 I will show you both the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.230
 icons like rocker dog skin 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.850
 likewise the rail meter skin and the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.530
 player in van der that is from the 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.519
 line of alien war that also gives them 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.519
 I'll leave in the video 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.010
 good not to do so long the 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.600
 video as you will notice the bar is set 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.760
 of rocker dock with the theme the invaders 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.340
 next to the icons of it and 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.380
 modified likewise two terrain skins 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.860
 put which I put an image to 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.110
 the two 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.760
 also the player and vander that 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.350
 gives more view to our desk 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.570
 also the subject that is easy 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.220
 installation since unlike others 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.380
 it only installs and there's no need 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.360
 get so much into the system to change 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.660
 some values ​​which allow us 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.400
 make the effect in glass in the windows 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.530
 It should be noted that if they do not know how to put 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.110
 rocker bar 2 next to how to modify 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.060
