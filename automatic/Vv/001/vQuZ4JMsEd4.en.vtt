to the horse or the Lunger as you can
see<00:01:05.440> I've<00:01:05.530> also<00:01:05.740> fitted<00:01:06.310> boots<00:01:06.759> onto<00:01:07.119> Westies

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
see I've also fitted boots onto Westies

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.590 
see I've also fitted boots onto Westies
legs<00:01:08.170> always<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.280> good<00:01:09.399> idea<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.820> fit<00:01:10.270> boots

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
legs always a good idea to fit boots

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.690 
legs always a good idea to fit boots
when<00:01:10.899> lunging<00:01:11.560> because<00:01:12.039> the<00:01:12.160> horse<00:01:12.399> is<00:01:12.460> on<00:01:12.670> a

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
when lunging because the horse is on a

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.330 
when lunging because the horse is on a
constant<00:01:13.300> circle<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.170> legs<00:01:14.410> are<00:01:14.680> crossing

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
constant circle the legs are crossing

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.380 
constant circle the legs are crossing
and<00:01:15.789> it'll<00:01:16.060> fall<00:01:16.240> into<00:01:16.509> any<00:01:16.690> kind<00:01:16.959> of<00:01:17.110> injury

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and it'll fall into any kind of injury

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.359 
and it'll fall into any kind of injury
but<00:01:19.390> my<00:01:19.569> lunch<00:01:19.840> line<00:01:20.170> attached<00:01:20.649> to<00:01:20.830> my<00:01:21.039> calves

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
but my lunch line attached to my calves

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.520 
but my lunch line attached to my calves
then<00:01:21.700> there<00:01:22.420> are<00:01:22.569> other<00:01:22.810> methods<00:01:23.020> of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
then there are other methods of

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.100 
then there are other methods of
attaching<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.399> lunge<00:01:24.789> line<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.479> bit<00:01:25.720> of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
attaching the lunge line to the bit of

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.160 
attaching the lunge line to the bit of
algebra<00:01:27.099> and<00:01:27.550> I<00:01:27.880> think<00:01:28.479> if<00:01:28.569> you<00:01:28.660> had<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.810> strong

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
algebra and I think if you had a strong

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.050 
algebra and I think if you had a strong
horse<00:01:29.500> but<00:01:30.160> that's<00:01:30.340> something<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:30.849> you<00:01:30.910> can

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
horse but that's something that you can

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.779 
horse but that's something that you can
speak<00:01:31.300> to<00:01:31.450> your<00:01:31.539> instructor<00:01:32.080> about<00:01:32.789> making

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
speak to your instructor about making

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.830 
speak to your instructor about making
