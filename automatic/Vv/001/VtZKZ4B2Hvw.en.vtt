00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 Tell me guys youtube marshal rambo 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.880
 bringing news of destiny and the news 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.700
 The saddest here will not be raid on. 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.089
 next to them and ok, but let's talk 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.050
 a bit about this in note the band is 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:22.830
 that there will not be a network in this 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.740
 Expansion of the House of Wolves 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 that she did the networks did not go very well 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.130
 accepted by destiny players we 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.559
 I try to explain it clear 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.940
 I really like doing and I would like to 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.840
 a new network 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.010
 let's try to understand a little bit is the part 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.210
 band 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.670
 the staff left a long way back 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.879
 It's on the band 's website that I can not 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.050
 find all of destiny's players 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:59.160
 which had less than 30% of players 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.449
 concluded the hotel raid this in the way 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.409
 normal and much less in difficult mode if 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.320
 I tell you that less than 10% of 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.290
 destiny players have completed the radio 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.439
 of the Croatian you will believe yes it is 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.680
 less than 10% of all 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:24.420
 destiny's players completed raid 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.320
 because this may be due to the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.790
 difficulty and complexity of the game is not 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.159
 easy for more casual players 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.939
 assemble a team of six that 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.070
 players on the squad to make me 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.840
 take me long to make the first radio 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.259
 even one because I had no one to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.500
 playing the drug was more was a bit more 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.009
 the faster I do because I already had 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.439
 A crowd to play, so I'd stay. 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.469
 much easier you bring these 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.380
 players back to the game with a 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.409
 Three-player activity you join 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.149
 with your three-player friends 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.640
 go think that it will only be missions that will 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.470
 complement that will be this next 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.840
 them and we will have the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.050
 using the elders it will be an arena 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.020
 still do not know how to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.890
 It will be this battle arena but it will 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.680
 having a video is May 6th will have a 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.530
 Old man prison gameplay 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.660
 keep an eye on this game play to 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.690
 people see how it's going to work 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.600
 go thinking that it will be easy for you 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.030
 making a network of six people in one 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.440
 radio six people is difficult is 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.020
 complicated 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.900
 someone dies someone has to be 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.300
 unfold in order to complete the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.490
 mission mainly in hardy mode 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.350
 both on land and in Croatian 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.770
 mainly in Croatian because 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.920
 Someone dying is very difficult, you 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.990
 continue the squad of three persons 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.690
 in a more compact group much more 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.590
 Little do I believe you go I believe 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.380
 it will be harder for you to complete this 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.320
 Arena I do not know how it works 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.190
 but I'm looking forward to getting the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.340
 equipment and personal weapons will 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.590
 Continue 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.690
 I just do not know how you're going to win 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.600
 Perhaps this imprisonment of the two elders 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.400
 whether it be some order of enemies or some 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.760
 boston you kill then go to the other 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.100
 You do not regain life, when you 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.489
 lost with this bofe goes to another and 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.860
 so on and so on I 'm just 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:45.060
 Assuming personal nothing concrete 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.000
 I believe it to be so, and one thing. 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.239
 I'm curious also s 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.980
 as it is not a radio it is an arena if 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:04:01.070
 we will have at the normal level and at the raid level 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:04.380
 This, I really want to know more 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.700
 unfortunately raid raid raid not 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.730
 let's have 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.570
 they are programming a network for the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.140
 not for the final end of the year 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.290
 probably comes in the expansion comet that 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.810
 will throw its name cheating in September 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.130
 this year that the next expansion is 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.980
 biggest expansion of the destiny game 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.790
 likely to have 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.340
 wax subclass of guardians maybe 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.640
 we will have the guardian with damage or is a 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.810
 Arcane with arc damage and a hunter with 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:43.990
 Waco's damage will take that and that 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.330
 do not go hunting and start 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.680
 I'm going to leave the trailer or I'll go 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.200
 post a video here personal 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.090
 analyzing the trailer for the house of wolves and 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.600
 I'm really looking forward to tomorrow. 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.220
 I really wanted a radio but I like 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.520
 I said people, it's very difficult for you. 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.740
 join a squad of six people all over 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.200
 maybe it would be better if they 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.310
 put an arena and the radio to the 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.330
 People who like to join the crowd to 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.510
 raid 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:17.560
 Let's see what's going to happen but it does not have 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:21.430
 these folks do not think it's going to be easy 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.880
 they will not be under history alone 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.970
 thinks so denied the bug will get the 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.180
 business will go crazy then what comes and 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.980
 May 19 marshal will bring everything here 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.600

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.190
