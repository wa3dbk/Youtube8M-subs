starches<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.880> rice<00:01:54.210> corn<00:01:54.570> potatoes<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
starches like rice corn potatoes and

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
starches like rice corn potatoes and
fruits<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.070> well<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:56.729> they<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> food

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
fruits as well because they are the food

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.789 
fruits as well because they are the food
groups<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.869> are<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.259> going<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.530> give<00:01:58.680> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
groups that are really going to give you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.490 
groups that are really going to give you
the<00:01:59.009> energy<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.460> sustain<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.659> vegan<00:02:01.020> diet

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the energy to sustain this vegan diet

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.740 
the energy to sustain this vegan diet
long<00:02:01.829> term<00:02:02.219> alright<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> second<00:02:03.540> reason

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
long term alright so the second reason

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.319 
long term alright so the second reason
is<00:02:04.079> about<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.070> environment<00:02:05.700> lots<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.180> people

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
is about the environment lots of people

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.089 
is about the environment lots of people
who<00:02:06.540> care<00:02:06.750> about<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.079> environment<00:02:07.200> go<00:02:07.860> vegan

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
who care about the environment go vegan

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.510 
who care about the environment go vegan
and<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.970> reason<00:02:09.360> being<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.289> at<00:02:10.770> least<00:02:11.039> 51

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and the reason being is that at least 51

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.830 
and the reason being is that at least 51
percent<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
percent of

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.770 
percent of
greenhouse<00:02:13.379> gas<00:02:13.769> emissions<00:02:14.580> are<00:02:14.970> caused<00:02:15.450> by

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
greenhouse gas emissions are caused by

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.839 
greenhouse gas emissions are caused by
animal<00:02:16.200> agriculture<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
animal agriculture and this is the

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.150 
animal agriculture and this is the
worldwatch<00:02:18.269> institute<00:02:18.330> saying<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.500> I'm<00:02:19.739> not

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
worldwatch institute saying this I'm not

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.250 
worldwatch institute saying this I'm not
coming<00:02:20.489> out<00:02:20.640> saying<00:02:20.879> that's<00:02:21.209> eating<00:02:21.690> meat<00:02:22.019> or

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
coming out saying that's eating meat or

coming out saying that's eating meat or
any<00:02:22.739> part<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.910> animal<00:02:24.090> agriculture<00:02:25.050> world

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
any part of the animal agriculture world

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.380 
any part of the animal agriculture world
is<00:02:25.560> destroying<00:02:26.129> our<00:02:26.370> planet<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.209> it's<00:02:27.330> not

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
is destroying our planet so it's not

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.449 
is destroying our planet so it's not
just<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.810> problem<00:02:27.989> for<00:02:28.170> global<00:02:28.620> warming<00:02:28.650> but

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
just a problem for global warming but

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.550 
just a problem for global warming but
it's<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.790> huge<00:02:30.120> contaminant<00:02:30.840> per<00:02:31.379> our

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
it's a huge contaminant per our

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.440 
it's a huge contaminant per our
environment<00:02:32.280> as<00:02:32.400> well<00:02:32.610> with<00:02:32.760> all<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.940> runoffs

coming from the farms and also a huge

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.330 
coming from the farms and also a huge
waste<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:36.000> water<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.569> takes<00:02:36.900> 25<00:02:37.379> gallons<00:02:37.950> just

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
waste of water it takes 25 gallons just

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.059 
waste of water it takes 25 gallons just
to<00:02:38.459> grow<00:02:38.670> one<00:02:39.090> pound<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.599> wheat<00:02:39.870> as<00:02:40.110> opposed<00:02:40.950> to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
more than fifty percent of our grains go

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
have to die because they don't have

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.289 
have to die because they don't have
access<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.690> food<00:03:06.959> or<00:03:07.170> water<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:08.129> is<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.549> huge

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
access to food or water this is a huge

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.479 
access to food or water this is a huge
problem<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:09.930> any<00:03:10.230> human<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.829> realizes<00:03:11.190> this

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
problem in any human that realizes this

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.190 
problem in any human that realizes this
should<00:03:11.970> avoid<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.450> whole<00:03:12.690> animal

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
should avoid the whole animal

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.869 
should avoid the whole animal
agriculture<00:03:13.860> industry<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.670> third

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
agriculture industry and the third

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.759 
agriculture industry and the third
reason<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.510> animal<00:03:15.870> cruelty<00:03:16.110> part<00:03:16.560> which

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
reason is the animal cruelty part which

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.129 
reason is the animal cruelty part which
I<00:03:17.010> think<00:03:17.340> most<00:03:17.579> people<00:03:17.910> understand<00:03:18.630> how<00:03:18.840> meat

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
I think most people understand how meat

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.840 
I think most people understand how meat
is<00:03:19.380> made<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.829> gotta<00:03:20.040> kill<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.430> animal<00:03:20.819> to

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
is made you gotta kill the animal to

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.690 
is made you gotta kill the animal to
produce<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.510> meat<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:22.350> what<00:03:22.980> about<00:03:23.190> eggs<00:03:23.459> and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
produce the meat but what about eggs and

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.849 
produce the meat but what about eggs and
dairy<00:03:23.730> most<00:03:24.630> people<00:03:24.930> think<00:03:25.109> those<00:03:25.410> are<00:03:25.440> quite

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
dairy most people think those are quite

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.160 
dairy most people think those are quite
innocent<00:03:26.400> foods<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.940> practices<00:03:27.540> but<00:03:27.989> they're

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
innocent foods and practices but they're

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.559 
innocent foods and practices but they're
actually<00:03:28.560> quite<00:03:28.799> as<00:03:29.069> cool<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.579> producing<00:03:30.269> meat

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
actually quite as cool as producing meat

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.319 
actually quite as cool as producing meat
with<00:03:31.230> dairy<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:32.160> have<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.430> inseminate<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:33.030> cow

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
with dairy you have to inseminate a cow

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.020 
with dairy you have to inseminate a cow
it<00:03:33.720> gets<00:03:33.930> baby<00:03:34.200> calf<00:03:34.530> away<00:03:34.859> suck<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.579> milk<00:03:35.760> out

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
it gets baby calf away suck the milk out

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.660 
it gets baby calf away suck the milk out
of<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.420> cow<00:03:36.599> feed<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.319> baby<00:03:37.530> calf<00:03:37.920> formula

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
of the cow feed the baby calf formula

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.250 
of the cow feed the baby calf formula
and<00:03:38.910> then<00:03:39.060> those<00:03:39.299> baby<00:03:39.540> calves<00:03:39.900> will<00:03:40.139> either

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
and then those baby calves will either

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.470 
and then those baby calves will either
go<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.620> become<00:03:41.220> veal<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.910> cycle<00:03:42.269> will<00:03:42.450> repeat

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
go to become veal the cycle will repeat

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.960 
go to become veal the cycle will repeat
so<00:03:43.109> they<00:03:43.230> will<00:03:43.380> one<00:03:43.590> day<00:03:43.799> produce<00:03:44.340> milk<00:03:44.700> and

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
so they will one day produce milk and

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.080 
so they will one day produce milk and
most<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.930> those<00:03:46.049> cows<00:03:46.769> actually<00:03:47.519> do<00:03:47.730> end<00:03:47.940> up

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
most of those cows actually do end up

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.879 
most of those cows actually do end up
getting<00:03:48.419> slaughtered<00:03:48.690> for<00:03:49.109> hamburger<00:03:49.650> meat
