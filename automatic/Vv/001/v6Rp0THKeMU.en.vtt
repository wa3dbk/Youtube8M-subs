the<00:00:12.059> accomplished<00:00:12.599> Rhine<00:00:12.809> now<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> do<00:00:13.950> that

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the accomplished Rhine now to do that

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.609 
the accomplished Rhine now to do that
you<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:14.790> start<00:00:15.299> off<00:00:15.480> by<00:00:15.509> building<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.170> science

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
you just start off by building a science

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.580 
you just start off by building a science
machine<00:00:17.220> that's<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> require<00:00:18.510> one<00:00:18.900> gold

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
machine that's going to require one gold

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.700 
machine that's going to require one gold
four<00:00:20.160> log<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.730> four<00:00:21.330> rock<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.080> fairly<00:00:22.439> easy<00:00:22.590> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
four log and four rock so fairly easy to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.160 
four log and four rock so fairly easy to
obtain<00:00:23.460> those<00:00:23.640> items<00:00:24.119> early<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> game

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
obtain those items early in the game

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.089 
obtain those items early in the game
and<00:00:26.039> once<00:00:26.250> you've<00:00:26.630> accomplished<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:28.099> build

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and once you've accomplished that build

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.269 
and once you've accomplished that build
the<00:00:29.720> science<00:00:30.720> machine<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> l2<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> get

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
there and then once you've built that

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.709 
there and then once you've built that
you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.430> build<00:00:38.670> other<00:00:38.910> items<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.600> you're

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
you can build other items when you're

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.160

boards by using the refine option in the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.670 
boards by using the refine option in the
crafting<00:00:52.920> menu<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.329> logs<00:00:54.930> will<00:00:55.350> create

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
crafting menu it's for logs will create

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.180 
crafting menu it's for logs will create
one<00:00:56.070> board<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.350> cut<00:00:58.739> stone<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
one board and then to a cut stone to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.580 
one board and then to a cut stone to
require<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.969> need<00:01:00.120> three<00:01:00.390> rocks<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
require and you need three rocks to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.969 
require and you need three rocks to
build<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.100> single<00:01:02.489> cut<00:01:02.910> stone<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.559> built<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
build a single cut stone so I built the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.429 
build a single cut stone so I built the
boards<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.510> little<00:01:06.750> short<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.140> rock

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
boards there I'm a little short on rock

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.350 
boards there I'm a little short on rock
so<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.070> go<00:01:08.189> out<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> try<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
so I'm going to go out and and try to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.090 
so I'm going to go out and and try to
find<00:01:09.630> some<00:01:09.810> rocks<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.380> actually<00:01:10.740> try<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> find

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
find some rocks and actually try to find

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.560 
find some rocks and actually try to find
some<00:01:11.310> gold<00:01:11.520> too<00:01:11.850> because<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> need

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
some gold too because I'm going to need

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.990 
some gold too because I'm going to need
six<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:13.680> ten<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> next

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
six for this and then ten for the next

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.770 
six for this and then ten for the next
step<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:16.590> gold<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.330> boulders

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
step and the gold is in these boulders

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.749 
step and the gold is in these boulders
here<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> gold<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.189> streaks<00:01:20.520> in

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
here you can see the gold the streaks in

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.270 
here you can see the gold the streaks in
the<00:01:20.880> boulder<00:01:21.210> itself<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.869> open<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.799> those<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the boulder itself so open up those and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.840 
the boulder itself so open up those and
you'll<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.610> gold<00:01:24.060> inside<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:26.610> once

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you'll have gold inside of there so once

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.670 
you'll have gold inside of there so once
we've<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.090> enough<00:01:27.600> rocks<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> turn

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
we've got enough rocks I'm going to turn

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770 
we've got enough rocks I'm going to turn
those<00:01:28.950> into<00:01:29.130> cut<00:01:29.460> stone<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.210> then<00:01:30.570> I'm<00:01:30.630> going

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
those into cut stone and then I'm going

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.830 
those into cut stone and then I'm going
to<00:01:30.840> head<00:01:31.020> back<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.090> we<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> stand<00:01:33.600> near

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
to head back and we have to stand near

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
to head back and we have to stand near
the<00:01:33.960> science<00:01:34.350> machine<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.950> order<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.400> build

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the science machine in order to build

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.410 
the science machine in order to build
the<00:01:35.970> alchemy<00:01:36.450> engine<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> make<00:01:39.119> sure<00:01:39.150> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the alchemy engine so make sure you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.120 
the alchemy engine so make sure you
remember<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.259> actually<00:01:40.439> see<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
remember you can actually see it on the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.969 
remember you can actually see it on the
map<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.490> well<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.229> ahead<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.619> build<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
map as well so go ahead and build the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.270 
map as well so go ahead and build the
alchemy<00:01:44.579> engine<00:01:45.500> this<00:01:46.500> under<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> science

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
alchemy engine this under the science

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.090 
alchemy engine this under the science
menu<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.790> crafting<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> we're<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
menu and the crafting so we're going to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.950 
menu and the crafting so we're going to
go<00:01:50.159> ahead<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.520> build<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
go ahead and build that and then the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.090 
go ahead and build that and then the
last<00:01:52.140> thing<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.439> need<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> build<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.070> the

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
a couple gears and we got ourselves a

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.259 
a couple gears and we got ourselves a
big<00:02:30.420> gigantic<00:02:30.930> mechanical<00:02:31.319> looking<00:02:32.189> Pig

I<00:02:33.299> guess<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:34.969> so<00:02:35.969> I'm<00:02:36.180> not<00:02:36.510> exactly<00:02:37.019> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
I guess that is so I'm not exactly the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.559 
I guess that is so I'm not exactly the
best<00:02:37.739> prepared<00:02:38.280> but<00:02:38.549> with<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.909> log<00:02:39.060> suit<00:02:39.389> and

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
best prepared but with the log suit and

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.119 
best prepared but with the log suit and
the<00:02:39.629> spear<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:39.989> should<00:02:40.379> still<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.680> able<00:02:40.829> to

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
the spear you should still be able to

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.309 
the spear you should still be able to
take<00:02:41.849> these<00:02:42.030> down<00:02:42.269> easily<00:02:42.599> enough

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319

got<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.709> log<00:03:01.919> suit<00:03:02.250> allows<00:03:02.909> us<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.299> withstand

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
got the log suit allows us to withstand

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.990 
got the log suit allows us to withstand
a<00:03:03.930> few<00:03:04.079> more<00:03:04.290> hits<00:03:04.469> from<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.769> enemy<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.189> he'll

a few more hits from the enemy and he'll

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.879 
a few more hits from the enemy and he'll
drop<00:03:06.239> two<00:03:06.449> gears<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.989> I'm<00:03:07.049> going<00:03:07.199> to<00:03:07.230> go<00:03:07.349> back

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
drop two gears and I'm going to go back

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.309 
drop two gears and I'm going to go back
to<00:03:08.099> where<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.310> killed<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.699> first<00:03:08.849> guy<00:03:09.260> cuz<00:03:10.260> I
