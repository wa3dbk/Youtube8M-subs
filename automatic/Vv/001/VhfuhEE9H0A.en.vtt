this<00:02:11.860> also<00:02:12.250> runs<00:02:12.490> left<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.090> right<00:02:13.300> as<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.170> can

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
this also runs left to right as you can

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.960 
this also runs left to right as you can
see<00:02:14.470> I'm<00:02:14.590> removing<00:02:15.130> their<00:02:15.400> left<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.820> right

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
see I'm removing their left and right

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.150 
see I'm removing their left and right
it's<00:02:16.210> not<00:02:16.360> moving<00:02:16.660> because<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.500> got<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.860> feed

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
it's not moving because you got to feed

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.390 
it's not moving because you got to feed
it<00:02:18.190> into<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:18.970> let<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.680> push<00:02:20.680> into<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.100> little

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
it into it and let it push into a little

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.610 
it into it and let it push into a little
hard<00:02:21.610> for<00:02:21.850> it<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:21.970> really<00:02:22.210> get<00:02:22.450> going<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.440> then

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
hard for it to really get going so then

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.230 
hard for it to really get going so then
the<00:02:24.040> guy<00:02:24.190> in<00:02:24.250> there<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.550> host<00:02:24.730> didn't<00:02:25.090> even

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
the guy in there the host didn't even

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.760 
the guy in there the host didn't even
know<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.420> moved<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.990> yet

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
know I moved it yet

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.480 
know I moved it yet
so<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> proportional<00:02:29.490> promote

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
so this this is a proportional promote

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
so this this is a proportional promote
we're<00:02:30.850> pushing<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:32.230> goes<00:02:32.710> faster<00:02:33.400> push<00:02:34.180> light

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
we're pushing it goes faster push light

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.000 
we're pushing it goes faster push light
little<00:02:35.110> slow

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
little slow

00:02:36.010 --> 00:03:09.000 
little slow
makes<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.790> no

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.970 

the<00:03:09.400> old<00:03:09.580> method<00:03:10.060> was<00:03:10.270> a<00:03:10.300> called<00:03:11.140> backlight<00:03:11.770> we

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
the old method was a called backlight we

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:38.380 
the old method was a called backlight we
had<00:03:12.190> better<00:03:12.599> now

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.140 

about<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.960> few<00:03:39.380> sections<00:03:39.620> my<00:03:40.010> fourth<00:03:40.850> section

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
about a few sections my fourth section

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.040 
about a few sections my fourth section
on<00:03:41.450> my<00:03:41.480> third

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.530 

and<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:44.890> would<00:03:45.069> be<00:03:45.100> my<00:03:45.370> second<00:03:45.850> section

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.750 

worried<00:03:49.930> about<00:03:50.140> second<00:03:50.560> second<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.099> lesson

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.340 

the<00:03:54.540> way

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
the way

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.250 
the way
this<00:03:55.740> low<00:03:55.950> rpm

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.059 

and<00:03:59.530> then<00:03:59.709> I<00:03:59.830> got<00:04:00.099> a

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.190 

volume<00:04:04.069> push<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.180> in<00:04:05.390> it's<00:04:05.870> going<00:04:06.020> to<00:04:06.110> go

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
volume push it in it's going to go

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.270 
volume push it in it's going to go
faster<00:04:06.970> speed<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.090> flow<00:04:08.360> of<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.600> concrete

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
faster speed it flow of the concrete

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.979 
faster speed it flow of the concrete
now<00:04:10.640> bring<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:10.940> back<00:04:11.030> it'll<00:04:11.480> slow<00:04:11.750> it<00:04:11.930> down

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.430 

can<00:04:14.440> really<00:04:14.860> go<00:04:15.010> fast<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.489> think<00:04:16.049> pumps<00:04:17.049> rated

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
can really go fast I think pumps rated

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.180

if you didn't have the reducer you could

00:04:49.819 --> 00:05:00.989 
if you didn't have the reducer you could
turn<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.150> up<00:04:50.270> further

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089 
run a pump it looks like a good trade

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.909 
run a pump it looks like a good trade
that<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.389> would<00:05:37.509> like<00:05:37.659> to<00:05:37.689> get<00:05:37.929> into<00:05:38.319> and
