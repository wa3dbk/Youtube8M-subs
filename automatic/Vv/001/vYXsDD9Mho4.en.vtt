that I use with both gel eyeliners is

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.440 
that I use with both gel eyeliners is
the<00:00:32.070> Sigma<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.850> don't<00:00:33.059> know<00:00:33.149> what<00:00:33.300> the

the Sigma I don't know what the
numbering<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.050> because<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.710> old

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
really dry and I'm not sure how long

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.440 
really dry and I'm not sure how long
I've<00:01:44.399> had<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.600> would<00:01:46.140> say<00:01:46.439> maybe<00:01:47.220> under<00:01:48.119> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
I've had this I would say maybe under a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.399 
I've had this I would say maybe under a
year<00:01:48.869> not<00:01:49.259> quite<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> year<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.689> this<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
year not quite a year and this is the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.310 
year not quite a year and this is the
Mac<00:01:52.649> blacktrack<00:01:53.369> fluid<00:01:53.820> line<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:55.049> comes

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
Mac blacktrack fluid line and it comes

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.039 
Mac blacktrack fluid line and it comes
in<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.649> glass<00:01:55.979> container<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.570> know<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
in this glass container as you know the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.069 
in this glass container as you know the
Mac<00:01:58.610> packaging<00:01:59.610> does<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.630> kind<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
Mac packaging does it's kind of like a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.959 
Mac packaging does it's kind of like a
smaller<00:02:01.469> mini<00:02:01.829> version<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.310> their<00:02:02.460> Paint<00:02:02.729> Pots

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
smaller mini version of their Paint Pots

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.510 
smaller mini version of their Paint Pots
and<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.990> comes<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.560> three<00:02:05.009> grams<00:02:05.310> of

and this comes with three grams of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.180 
and this comes with three grams of
product<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:07.020> believe<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.530> retails<00:02:08.099> for

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
product and I believe this retails for

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.010 
product and I believe this retails for
fifteen<00:02:08.879> dollars

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
fifteen dollars

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.760 
fifteen dollars
and<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.490> what<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.760> looks<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.770> I

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
and this is what it looks like and I

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.870 
and this is what it looks like and I
haven't<00:02:14.010> had<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.700> long<00:02:15.240> as<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.930> Inglot

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
haven't had this as long as the Inglot

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.420 
haven't had this as long as the Inglot
but<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.690> already<00:02:18.870> tell<00:02:19.260> some<00:02:19.890> differences

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
but I can already tell some differences

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.610 
but I can already tell some differences
between<00:02:20.610> them<00:02:21.260> first<00:02:22.260> off<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:23.400> packaging

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
between them first off is the packaging

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.620 
between them first off is the packaging
the<00:02:25.620> mat<00:02:25.800> comes<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.280> glass<00:02:26.430> jar<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:27.420> comes

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
the mat comes in a glass jar this comes

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.350 
the mat comes in a glass jar this comes
in<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> plastic<00:02:28.830> container<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.610> I

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
in just like a plastic container and I

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.830 
in just like a plastic container and I
can<00:02:30.630> already<00:02:31.020> tell<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:32.100> Mac<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.840> closes

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
can already tell that the Mac it closes

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.770 
can already tell that the Mac it closes
more<00:02:34.350> tightly<00:02:34.680> than<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.550> engli<00:02:35.940> gel<00:02:36.360> eyeliner

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
more tightly than the engli gel eyeliner

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.560 
more tightly than the engli gel eyeliner
I<00:02:37.080> found<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.830> found<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.490> dried<00:02:39.030> out<00:02:39.210> very

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
I found I found that this dried out very

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.290 
I found I found that this dried out very
quickly<00:02:40.460> so<00:02:41.460> I<00:02:42.500> have<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> gripe<00:02:43.860> with<00:02:44.100> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
quickly so I have a gripe with the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.490 
quickly so I have a gripe with the
packaging<00:02:45.300> because<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.630> feel<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:45.990> if<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.380> was

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
packaging because I feel like if it was

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.620 
packaging because I feel like if it was
in<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.950> packaging<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.730> wouldn't<00:02:48.060> dry<00:02:48.210> out<00:02:48.450> as

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
in this packaging it wouldn't dry out as

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.400 
in this packaging it wouldn't dry out as
easily<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.790> also<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:51.360> terms<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> color

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
easily and also in terms of the color

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.350 
easily and also in terms of the color
payoff<00:02:52.770> but<00:02:53.370> from<00:02:53.550> what<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:53.850> tell<00:02:54.000> them<00:02:54.270> at

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
payoff but from what I can tell them at

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.770 
payoff but from what I can tell them at
eyes<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:55.110> Inglot<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.680> much<00:02:56.400> more<00:02:56.780> pigmented

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
eyes the Inglot is much more pigmented

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.750 
eyes the Inglot is much more pigmented

pigmented you need one swipe and that's

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.000 
pigmented you need one swipe and that's
it<00:03:20.700> even<00:03:21.090> on<00:03:21.209> your<00:03:21.360> waterline<00:03:21.810> it's<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:22.709> so

black I'm just going to wipe off my

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.400 
black I'm just going to wipe off my
brush<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.720> little<00:03:27.900> bit<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.320> swatch<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.160> Mac

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
brush a little bit and swatch the Mac

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.530 
brush a little bit and swatch the Mac
fluidline<00:03:31.410> right<00:03:32.160> next<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.700> just<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:33.450> you

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
fluidline right next to it just so you

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.580 
fluidline right next to it just so you
can<00:03:33.720> compare<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:35.720> color<00:03:36.720> payoff<00:03:37.020> and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
can compare the color payoff and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.780 
can compare the color payoff and
darkness<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.520> all<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:38.820> that

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.009 

so<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.290> Mack<00:03:46.590> blackjack<00:03:47.370> fluidline

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
so this is the Mack blackjack fluidline

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.170 
so this is the Mack blackjack fluidline
I<00:03:49.019> don't<00:03:49.829> know<00:03:49.920> if<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.099> can<00:03:50.220> really<00:03:50.459> tell<00:03:50.579> a

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
I don't know if you can really tell a

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.280 
I don't know if you can really tell a
difference<00:03:51.659> kind<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.110> on<00:03:52.409> camera<00:03:53.099> but<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:54.290> would

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
difference kind of on camera but I would

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.500 
difference kind of on camera but I would
say<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.980> would<00:03:56.549> definitely<00:03:57.060> say<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.239> the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
say I would definitely say that the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.039 
say I would definitely say that the
Inglot<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.170> much<00:03:59.040> much<00:03:59.400> more<00:03:59.849> pigmented<00:04:00.780> and

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
Inglot is much much more pigmented and

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.460 
Inglot is much much more pigmented and
much<00:04:01.530> more<00:04:01.829> black<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:05.579> Mack<00:04:05.909> is<00:04:06.440> kind<00:04:07.440> of

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
much more black the the Mack is kind of

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.580 
much more black the the Mack is kind of
more<00:04:07.799> of<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.790> softer<00:04:09.390> black<00:04:09.599> whereas<00:04:10.110> the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
more of a softer black whereas the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.550 
more of a softer black whereas the
Inglot<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.220> very<00:04:11.970> very<00:04:12.329> kind<00:04:12.659> of<00:04:12.780> deep<00:04:13.290> deep

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
Inglot is very very kind of deep deep

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.469 
Inglot is very very kind of deep deep
dark<00:04:13.980> black<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.609> don't<00:04:18.060> know<00:04:18.120> if<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.359> can

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
dark black so I don't know if you can

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.599 
dark black so I don't know if you can
tell<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:19.109> difference<00:04:19.440> but<00:04:19.620> this<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> Mac

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
tell the difference but this is the Mac

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.080 
tell the difference but this is the Mac
and<00:04:20.880> this<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.630> Inglot<00:04:22.109> gel<00:04:22.410> eyeliner<00:04:22.830> and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
and this is the Inglot gel eyeliner and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.390 
and this is the Inglot gel eyeliner and
definitely<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:24.120> can<00:04:24.150> tell<00:04:24.449> that<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:25.160> ink<00:04:26.160> lot

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
definitely I can tell that the ink lot

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.700 
definitely I can tell that the ink lot
is<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.850> lot<00:04:26.880> more<00:04:27.240> black<00:04:27.570> which<00:04:28.169> is<00:04:28.199> what<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.500> look

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
is a lot more black which is what I look

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.770 
is a lot more black which is what I look
for<00:04:28.949> in<00:04:29.039> an<00:04:29.130> eyeliner<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:29.970> think<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.330> formula

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
for in an eyeliner I think the formula

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.560 
for in an eyeliner I think the formula
for<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.830> fluid<00:04:32.639> line<00:04:32.820> is<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.180> little<00:04:33.449> bit

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
for the fluid line is a little bit

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.469 
for the fluid line is a little bit
thinner<00:04:33.900> it's<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.380> little<00:04:34.590> bit<00:04:34.710> more<00:04:35.479> not

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
thinner it's a little bit more not

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.469 
thinner it's a little bit more not
liquidy<00:04:37.050> but<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.979> seems<00:04:38.669> that<00:04:38.820> way<00:04:38.970> look<00:04:39.240> a

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
liquidy but it seems that way look a

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.980 
liquidy but it seems that way look a
little<00:04:39.900> bit<00:04:40.020> more<00:04:40.560> on<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.760> liquid<00:04:42.210> side<00:04:42.449> you

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
little bit more on the liquid side you

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.080 
little bit more on the liquid side you
know<00:04:43.229> it's<00:04:43.380> not<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.800> liquid<00:04:44.100> it's<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.340> gel<00:04:44.639> but

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
know it's not a liquid it's a gel but

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.020 
know it's not a liquid it's a gel but
it's<00:04:45.330> more<00:04:45.600> on<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.840> gel<00:04:46.080> side<00:04:46.320> where<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:47.610> would

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
it's more on the gel side where I would

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.360 
it's more on the gel side where I would
say<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.810> Inglot<00:04:49.169> is<00:04:49.380> kind<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.800> more<00:04:50.130> like<00:04:50.160> a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
say the Inglot is kind of more like a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.390 
say the Inglot is kind of more like a
cream<00:04:51.260> so<00:04:52.260> it's<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.470> little<00:04:52.650> bit<00:04:52.830> of<00:04:52.979> a<00:04:53.070> thicker

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
cream so it's a little bit of a thicker

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.060 
cream so it's a little bit of a thicker
formula<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.599> wear<00:04:54.870> for<00:04:55.169> them<00:04:55.349> I<00:04:55.590> would<00:04:55.800> say

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
formula the wear for them I would say

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.360 
formula the wear for them I would say
the<00:04:56.250> Inglot<00:04:56.699> wears<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:58.020> little<00:04:58.349> bit<00:04:58.560> longer<00:04:58.889> in

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
the Inglot wears a little bit longer in

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.150 
the Inglot wears a little bit longer in
terms<00:04:59.699> of<00:04:59.970> on<00:05:00.210> my<00:05:00.419> waterline<00:05:00.780> on<00:05:01.289> my<00:05:01.560> top<00:05:01.830> lash

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
terms of on my waterline on my top lash

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.870 
terms of on my waterline on my top lash
line<00:05:02.660> they're<00:05:03.660> pretty<00:05:03.870> much<00:05:04.020> equal<00:05:04.500> but<00:05:05.250> for

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
line they're pretty much equal but for

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.930 
line they're pretty much equal but for
the<00:05:06.270> waterline<00:05:06.840> because<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:08.220> engli<00:05:08.580> already

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
the waterline because the engli already

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.990 
the waterline because the engli already
comes<00:05:09.270> on<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:10.139> opaque<00:05:10.590> on<00:05:10.860> my<00:05:11.160> waterline<00:05:11.550> it

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
comes on so opaque on my waterline it

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.450 
comes on so opaque on my waterline it
stays<00:05:12.810> throughout<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.560> day<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:14.010> doesn't<00:05:14.190> stay

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
stays throughout the day it doesn't stay

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.700 
stays throughout the day it doesn't stay
the<00:05:14.669> entire<00:05:14.789> day<00:05:15.270> but<00:05:15.330> stays<00:05:15.930> on<00:05:16.050> my<00:05:16.139> waterline

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
the entire day but stays on my waterline

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.689 
the entire day but stays on my waterline
for<00:05:16.860> longer<00:05:17.430> than<00:05:17.789> the<00:05:18.270> Mac<00:05:19.130> so<00:05:20.130> in<00:05:20.340> terms<00:05:20.550> of

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
for longer than the Mac so in terms of

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.240 
for longer than the Mac so in terms of
recommendations<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:21.690> think<00:05:21.720> that<00:05:22.139> Mac<00:05:22.470> has<00:05:22.800> the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
recommendations I think that Mac has the

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.850 
recommendations I think that Mac has the
better<00:05:23.460> packaging<00:05:24.240> in<00:05:24.449> terms<00:05:25.080> of<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.590> glass

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
better packaging in terms of the glass

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.629 
better packaging in terms of the glass
jar<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:27.030> glass<00:05:27.210> container<00:05:27.770> it<00:05:28.770> seals<00:05:29.220> tight

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
jar the glass container it seals tight

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.240 
jar the glass container it seals tight
it<00:05:30.150> doesn't<00:05:30.510> let<00:05:30.659> Aaron<00:05:31.139> it<00:05:31.320> won't<00:05:31.590> dry<00:05:31.830> out<00:05:31.860> as

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
it doesn't let Aaron it won't dry out as

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.500 
it doesn't let Aaron it won't dry out as
fast<00:05:32.639> as<00:05:32.849> the<00:05:33.090> Inglot<00:05:33.570> did<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.610> in<00:05:35.610> terms<00:05:36.270> of

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
fast as the Inglot did and in terms of

fast as the Inglot did and in terms of
the<00:05:36.840> color<00:05:37.110> payoff<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.919> use<00:05:38.250> definitely<00:05:38.940> the

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
the color payoff and use definitely the

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.050 
the color payoff and use definitely the
Inglot<00:05:39.389> gel<00:05:39.659> eyeliner<00:05:40.159> it's<00:05:41.159> a<00:05:41.460> deeper<00:05:41.849> black

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
Inglot gel eyeliner it's a deeper black

Inglot gel eyeliner it's a deeper black
you<00:05:42.690> don't<00:05:42.810> have<00:05:42.990> to<00:05:43.139> keep<00:05:43.320> going<00:05:43.380> over<00:05:44.099> it<00:05:44.280> on

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
you don't have to keep going over it on

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.570 
you don't have to keep going over it on
especially<00:05:45.840> on<00:05:45.930> your<00:05:46.020> waterline<00:05:46.440> so<00:05:46.889> I

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
especially on your waterline so I

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.909 
especially on your waterline so I
definitely<00:05:48.000> prefer<00:05:48.150> this<00:05:48.510> in<00:05:48.690> terms<00:05:48.900> of<00:05:49.139> just

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
definitely prefer this in terms of just

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.100 
definitely prefer this in terms of just
using<00:05:50.280> it<00:05:50.430> and<00:05:50.669> having<00:05:51.389> that<00:05:51.539> color<00:05:51.810> payoff

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
using it and having that color payoff

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.320 
using it and having that color payoff
right<00:05:52.620> away<00:05:54.050> so

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
right away so

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.740 
right away so
i<00:05:55.360> if<00:05:56.080> i<00:05:56.410> didn't<00:05:56.770> use<00:05:57.069> the<00:05:57.430> Inglot<00:05:57.940> before<00:05:58.479> i

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
i if i didn't use the Inglot before i

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.510 
i if i didn't use the Inglot before i
would<00:05:58.960> think<00:05:59.110> that<00:05:59.199> the<00:05:59.410> black<00:05:59.710> track<00:06:00.009> is<00:06:00.250> a

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
would think that the black track is a

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.050 
would think that the black track is a
great<00:06:01.000> great<00:06:01.240> eyeliner<00:06:01.690> but<00:06:02.139> to<00:06:02.470> me<00:06:02.740> it's<00:06:03.069> okay

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
great great eyeliner but to me it's okay

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.850 
great great eyeliner but to me it's okay
just<00:06:04.870> because<00:06:04.990> I've<00:06:05.229> already<00:06:05.500> used<00:06:05.530> the

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
just because I've already used the

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.600 
just because I've already used the
Inglot<00:06:06.340> liner<00:06:06.729> and<00:06:07.120> it's<00:06:07.539> so<00:06:08.500> deep<00:06:09.009> dark<00:06:09.310> and

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
Inglot liner and it's so deep dark and

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.930 
Inglot liner and it's so deep dark and
it<00:06:10.240> has<00:06:10.509> more<00:06:11.199> lasting<00:06:11.650> power<00:06:11.830> that<00:06:12.220> I<00:06:12.460> love<00:06:12.759> it

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
it has more lasting power that I love it

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.180 
it has more lasting power that I love it
and<00:06:13.180> I<00:06:13.509> really<00:06:13.870> really<00:06:13.900> wish<00:06:14.319> that<00:06:14.530> it<00:06:14.680> was<00:06:14.889> in

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
and I really really wish that it was in

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.589 
and I really really wish that it was in
the<00:06:15.639> glass<00:06:15.849> container

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
the glass container

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.170 
the glass container
just<00:06:17.410> because<00:06:17.650> this<00:06:17.800> is<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:18.160> more<00:06:18.370> superior

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
just because this is the more superior

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.290 
just because this is the more superior
packaging<00:06:19.900> so<00:06:20.500> hopefully<00:06:21.069> England<00:06:21.819> were

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
packaging so hopefully England were

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.559 
packaging so hopefully England were
the<00:06:22.690> packaging<00:06:23.199> for<00:06:23.410> this<00:06:23.590> yes<00:06:24.550> so<00:06:24.880> thank<00:06:25.419> you
