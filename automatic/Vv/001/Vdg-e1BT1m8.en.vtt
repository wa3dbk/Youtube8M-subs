00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
not really being in touch with what you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.410 
not really being in touch with what you
care<00:01:12.330> about<00:01:12.360> what<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.080> feel<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:14.150> true<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
care about what you feel to be true and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.950 
care about what you feel to be true and
because<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.380> Reverse<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:16.920> almost<00:01:17.220> like

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
because it's in Reverse it's almost like

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.390 
because it's in Reverse it's almost like
what<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.140> getting<00:01:19.409> intuitively<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.220> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
what I'm getting intuitively is that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.899 
what I'm getting intuitively is that
this<00:01:20.580> big<00:01:21.170> fireball<00:01:22.170> within<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.610> just

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
this big fireball within you is just

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.359 
this big fireball within you is just
kind<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.650> emerging<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.770> becomes<00:01:26.130> much

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
kind of emerging and becomes much

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.030 
kind of emerging and becomes much
clearer<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.360> something<00:01:28.170> gets<00:01:28.470> clearer<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:30.420> I

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
clearer so something gets clearer it I

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.100 
clearer so something gets clearer it I
mean<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.220> an<00:01:32.400> example<00:01:32.880> ok<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.810> around

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
mean like an example ok I'm going around

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.780 
mean like an example ok I'm going around

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.500 
out where is that like the yellow is
that<00:02:24.359> supposed<00:02:24.689> to<00:02:24.719> be<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.870> trumpet<00:02:25.379> maybe<00:02:26.510> and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
that supposed to be a trumpet maybe and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.380 
that supposed to be a trumpet maybe and
it's<00:02:27.689> calling<00:02:28.049> a<00:02:28.140> bunch<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.470> teenagers<00:02:28.950> with

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
it's calling a bunch of teenagers with

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.229 
it's calling a bunch of teenagers with
pebbles<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.569> their<00:02:30.750> heads<00:02:31.670> okay<00:02:32.670> different

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
pebbles in their heads okay different

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.750 
pebbles in their heads okay different
take<00:02:33.390> on<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.900> that's<00:02:34.829> in<00:02:35.010> Reverse<00:02:35.340> as<00:02:35.579> well

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
take on it and that's in Reverse as well

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.750 
take on it and that's in Reverse as well
so<00:02:36.599> what<00:02:36.959> this<00:02:37.139> means<00:02:37.470> via<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:38.069> judgment<00:02:38.519> card

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
so what this means via the judgment card

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.399 
so what this means via the judgment card
basically<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.689> this<00:02:39.840> isn't<00:02:40.109> a<00:02:40.200> new<00:02:40.379> thing

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
basically is that this isn't a new thing

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.440 
basically is that this isn't a new thing
you've<00:02:41.159> always<00:02:41.310> had<00:02:41.579> this<00:02:41.790> passion<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.329> you
