00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.670 

the<00:00:35.730> new<00:00:35.910> overall<00:00:36.360> package<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.290> bike<00:00:37.500> is

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the new overall package on the bike is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.860 
the new overall package on the bike is
really<00:00:37.890> cool<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.580> suspension<00:00:39.210> works<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.630> good

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
really cool the suspension works so good

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.730 
really cool the suspension works so good
with<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.080> new<00:00:40.320> chassis<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:41.840> new<00:00:42.840> design<00:00:43.170> that

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
with the new chassis a new design that

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.620 
with the new chassis a new design that
creates<00:00:44.070> some<00:00:44.220> more<00:00:44.400> mass<00:00:44.610> centralization<00:00:45.090> of

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
creates some more mass centralization of

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.630 
creates some more mass centralization of
the<00:00:45.720> bike<00:00:45.900> this<00:00:46.470> seemed<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:47.400> body

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the bike this seemed like your body

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.920 
the bike this seemed like your body
position<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.210> everything<00:00:48.600> was<00:00:48.750> more

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
position and everything was more

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.260 
position and everything was more
centrally<00:00:49.410> located<00:00:52.310> it<00:00:53.310> allows<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.880> bike<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
centrally located it allows the bike to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.730 
centrally located it allows the bike to
get<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> wait<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.720> little<00:00:54.990> bit<00:00:55.140> lower<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.500> little

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
get the wait a little bit lower a little

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.130 
get the wait a little bit lower a little
bit<00:00:55.920> more<00:00:56.070> forward<00:00:56.400> which<00:00:57.060> in<00:00:57.390> handling<00:00:57.900> terms

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
bit more forward which in handling terms

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.860 
bit more forward which in handling terms
means<00:00:58.740> everything

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
means everything

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.490 
means everything
I<00:01:00.940> think<00:01:01.940> that<00:01:02.180> this<00:01:02.449> bike<00:01:02.719> is<00:01:02.750> definitely<00:01:03.350> one

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
I think that this bike is definitely one

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.719 
I think that this bike is definitely one
of<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.649> best<00:01:03.800> handling<00:01:04.129> bikes<00:01:04.369> I've<00:01:04.549> ever

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
of the best handling bikes I've ever

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.350 
of the best handling bikes I've ever
written<00:01:04.940> in<00:01:05.150> my<00:01:05.180> life<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:07.490> be<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:07.940> nimble

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
written in my life to be so nimble

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.899 
written in my life to be so nimble
that's<00:01:08.659> a<00:01:08.900> that's<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:09.320> huge<00:01:09.650> huge<00:01:10.490> part<00:01:10.850> of

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
that's a that's a huge huge part of

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.610 
that's a that's a huge huge part of
going<00:01:11.150> fast

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
going fast

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.280 
going fast
officially<00:01:13.520> jumps<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.420> date<00:01:14.600> corner<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.140> have

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
officially jumps and date corner to have

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
officially jumps and date corner to have
a<00:01:15.320> much<00:01:15.650> better<00:01:16.250> control<00:01:17.210> on<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.660> bike<00:01:21.310> do

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
a much better control on the bike do

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.330 
a much better control on the bike do
they<00:01:22.520> see<00:01:22.580> that<00:01:23.030> day<00:01:23.270> be<00:01:23.330> like<00:01:23.450> all<00:01:24.940> right<00:01:25.940> now

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.320 

naive<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.920> feels<00:01:34.160> really<00:01:34.460> light<00:01:34.580> its<00:01:35.030> agile

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
naive it feels really light its agile

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.790 
naive it feels really light its agile
things<00:01:36.320> quick<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.980> turn

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
things quick to turn

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.830 
things quick to turn
with<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.520> air<00:01:39.670> fork<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.180> feel<00:01:40.390> like<00:01:40.510> it<00:01:40.660> does

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
with the air fork I feel like it does

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.180 
with the air fork I feel like it does
give<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.110> more<00:01:41.290> traction<00:01:41.590> on<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:41.860> bike<00:01:42.010> it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
give you more traction on the bike it

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.310 
give you more traction on the bike it
kind<00:01:42.370> of<00:01:42.460> for<00:01:43.150> some<00:01:43.390> reason<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.900> just<00:01:43.930> wants

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
kind of for some reason it just wants

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.570 
kind of for some reason it just wants
the<00:01:44.380> hook<00:01:44.590> up<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:44.950> those<00:01:45.040> corners<00:01:45.430> really

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
the hook up and those corners really

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.220 
the hook up and those corners really
good<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.000> stay<00:01:46.210> on<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.480> ground

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.410 

and<00:01:50.830> my<00:01:50.950> first<00:01:51.250> initial<00:01:51.520> impression<00:01:52.120> was<00:01:52.150> how

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
and my first initial impression was how

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.700 
and my first initial impression was how
light<00:01:52.660> it<00:01:52.810> was<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.200> whole<00:01:53.350> front<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.620> the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
light it was the whole front of the

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.730 
light it was the whole front of the
bikes<00:01:53.920> feels<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.400> lot<00:01:54.550> lighter<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.470> fast

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
bikes feels a lot lighter on the fast

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.950 
bikes feels a lot lighter on the fast
corners<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.400> suspension<00:01:57.910> feels<00:01:58.060> like<00:01:58.330> much

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
corners the suspension feels like much

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.870 
corners the suspension feels like much
more<00:01:58.990> grip<00:01:59.470> especially<00:02:00.070> on<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.220> front<00:02:00.520> end<00:02:00.730> of

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
more grip especially on the front end of

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.280 
more grip especially on the front end of
the<00:02:00.910> bike<00:02:03.300> with<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.420> new<00:02:04.540> swing<00:02:04.870> arm<00:02:05.050> it<00:02:05.200> was

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
the bike with the new swing arm it was

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.630 
the bike with the new swing arm it was
actually<00:02:05.620> really<00:02:05.770> cool<00:02:06.040> when<00:02:06.190> I<00:02:06.250> first<00:02:06.280> hopped

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
actually really cool when I first hopped

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.280 
actually really cool when I first hopped
on<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.940> bike<00:02:07.120> I<00:02:07.300> could<00:02:07.450> feel<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:07.750> already<00:02:08.020> just

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
on the bike I could feel it already just

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.960 
on the bike I could feel it already just
right<00:02:08.680> off<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.950> bat<00:02:09.130> through<00:02:09.400> the<00:02:09.430> bumps<00:02:09.820> and

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
right off the bat through the bumps and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
really nice and straight and also for me

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.090 
really nice and straight and also for me
you<00:02:13.630> know<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.750> like<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.020> whip<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.440> lot<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:14.860> huh
