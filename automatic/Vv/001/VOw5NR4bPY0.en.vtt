00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
days I'll be able to get it two to three

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.760 
days I'll be able to get it two to three
thousand<00:05:40.009> to<00:05:40.490> make<00:05:40.669> it<00:05:40.819> level<00:05:40.999> four<00:05:41.509> and<00:05:41.839> then

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
thousand to make it level four and then

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.320 
thousand to make it level four and then
hope<00:05:43.129> hopefully<00:05:43.789> it'll<00:05:43.939> be<00:05:44.149> more<00:05:44.809> than<00:05:45.020> 500

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
hope hopefully it'll be more than 500

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.129 
hope hopefully it'll be more than 500
magic<00:05:47.330> attack<00:05:48.909> so<00:05:49.909> there<00:05:50.180> are<00:05:50.210> another<00:05:50.479> sixty

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
magic attack so there are another sixty

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.399 
magic attack so there are another sixty
one<00:05:51.469> and<00:05:51.649> a<00:05:51.740> half<00:05:51.789> so<00:05:52.789> i<00:05:52.819> went<00:05:53.059> from<00:05:53.360> 800<00:05:54.319> i

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
one and a half so i went from 800 i

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.860 
one and a half so i went from 800 i
think<00:05:54.649> it<00:05:54.740> was<00:05:54.919> 21<00:05:55.550> and<00:05:55.669> a<00:05:55.759> half<00:05:55.789> side<00:05:56.300> almost

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
think it was 21 and a half side almost

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.920 
think it was 21 and a half side almost
doubled<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:57.830> if<00:05:58.729> I<00:05:58.999> could<00:05:59.330> do<00:05:59.509> it<00:05:59.629> every<00:05:59.899> day

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
doubled it if I could do it every day

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.170 
doubled it if I could do it every day
but<00:06:00.289> I<00:06:00.349> think<00:06:00.709> that's<00:06:00.889> not<00:06:01.129> possible<00:06:01.459> because

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
but I think that's not possible because

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.209 
but I think that's not possible because
I<00:06:02.419> did<00:06:02.779> some<00:06:03.080> quests<00:06:03.559> and<00:06:03.680> I<00:06:03.770> got<00:06:03.949> a<00:06:03.979> lot<00:06:04.189> of

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:04.219 
I did some quests and I got a lot of

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.159 
I did some quests and I got a lot of
money<00:06:04.339> and<00:06:05.270> I<00:06:05.479> don't<00:06:05.749> know<00:06:05.899> if<00:06:05.990> that's

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
money and I don't know if that's

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.269 
money and I don't know if that's
possible<00:06:06.379> every<00:06:07.009> day<00:06:07.809> and<00:06:08.809> so<00:06:09.379> you<00:06:09.860> saw<00:06:10.099> i

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:10.279 
possible every day and so you saw i

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:14.820 
possible every day and so you saw i
started<00:06:10.759> with<00:06:11.469> 355,000<00:06:12.469> I'm<00:06:12.649> finished<00:06:13.309> at
