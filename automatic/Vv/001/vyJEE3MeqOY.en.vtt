00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.370
 and it's up to him everyone knows 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.560
 rapido and neptune so how does not 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.510
 usually that's hi that's fine 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.060
 thank you how were you wearing it ah 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.880
 Well, it's going very very very very well 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.360
 we end up after a little break if 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.560
 I can say 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.629
 finally it's been a while since we 've 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.790
 no little videos like that because 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.800
 we have a little busy between actually 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.580
 more holidays and in fact we are more 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.600
 game-oriented with our team for 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.559
 the moment 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.660
 you mean that you went back to school 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.030
 no, but you know I'm still a student 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 I am still 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.559
 finally we can say that it is 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.820
 holiday anyway I see the kind 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.150
 finally we find ourselves in a small 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.489
 giant b put in a build them that I 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.280
 plays that I advise parents because 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.780
 that I did something to mister bastard 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.330
 these hot spots that play rangers I 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.490
 do something quick I would put in when 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.440
 even the bild but hey it's done for 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.049
 that I give you an idea you 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.970
 can you miss man and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.190
 adapt it to your sauce we will say that 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.659
 the wild is viable in bg 8 driving 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.850
 since anyway everything is viable there 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.010
 down but when tournament he came to add 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.950
 a little bit of survival like stone 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.730
 was signing all or other yeah yeah that's 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.320
 so clear so in the city but I 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.170
 still tell you I'm at the bow 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.430
 course with a switch and pedagogue so 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.070
 the epeda switch that I like 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.250
 especially that allows escape 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.230
 quite easily via the 2 to the sword and 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.270
 me that allows to devein not bad 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.240
 attacked with the 3 4 et cetera I 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.110
 find it not bad otherwise the whey the bg 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.550
 is rather calm 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.570
 in the beginning they will try to attack 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.730
 chlorine level that we will make a 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.500
 little defense we will save it 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.630
 miraculous reason that me other 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.170
 level net news and well at the level 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.820
 news not much but 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.200
 still something interesting 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.090
 ie you are definitely seen 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.370
 that paid tournaments are going to be 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.619
 child established in 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.080
 guild wars 2 so if not say of 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.700
 bullshit it's at the moment of the deÃ»le 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.110
 halloween events so I do not know 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.450
 the slab time I do not celebrate halloween 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.430
 but in any case we will have this 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.020
 novelty it's not much but 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.050
 it's a little extra especially for 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.670
 teams who are already saying how 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.380
 structured because in fact the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.030
 currently to play between them tim and 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.000
 so to train and win a high 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.710
 level we are obliged to tags 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.090
 synchronize tags between team that's at 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.580
 to say that everyone meets on ts 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.760
 so currently there is a team 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.710
 which brings together 1 8 and brings together 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.690
 some teams on their speak team and 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.770
 synchronizes the tag into a tournament to have 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.680
 more chances of falling against each other 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.940
 the others which is why we 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.080
 did a lot fewer games than before 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.550
 because it's at the request of time and 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.500
 the preparation and also bine to come 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.460
 it's also a little random side there 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.570
 a little less right now because there is 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.850
 still fewer players than less than 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.200
 players only at the exit but that 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.840
 still takes time to organize 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.190
 to do a maximum to provide you 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.190
 matches from elsewhere we have a few 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.500
 which will be posted in the week and 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.540
 next week 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.160
 and here for the novelties I would say to 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.110
 just about everything you can find yourself 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.330
 our bild that we use on our site 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.650
 so pollute pg for a game.com chrono 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.630
 for them not to know and a 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.390
 section bild I recommend it to you and 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.250
 that's it for the novelties binde you 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.980
 not find on the site I think otherwise 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.660
 transport here for the little girl 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.640
 history so 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.870
 well, here you have everything said then you say to yourself 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.030
 their only course which remains one of 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.710
 better weapons in rangers I think of 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.350
 planned mount to tidy that I do not have 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.280
 played for a long time one they have 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.260
 broke the strike ford 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.850
 I think that's actually one of them 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.160
 of the only 1000 viable perhaps with the 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.930
 store tank 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.980
 good it's a mile to base on 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.900
 conditions I think you have it 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.150
 noticed rapido does a lot a lot 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.500
 bled people and it's a little bit there 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.120
 above that it plays so we can play in 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.660
 rapid or bus to Lyon to level 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.430
 amulets 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.610
 I think that's fine but that the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.110
 tidy lack of arms there is too much 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.910
 weak still survives once these 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.490
 cds went through that his cd went 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.750
 I think that aboriginal sign is it 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.030
 has more thing so that's why 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.040
 that we send do not see either very 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.110
 often in tournament in big team 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.420
 still some interesting tools 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.850
 as the swift is often not the 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.080
 quick bar with every 40 seconds 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:33.140
 is the second of the switch can 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.740
 to be done with the talents she is very 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.900
 adequate 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.970
 when you switch to pet you have 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.470
 two seconds of quick nes that you 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.660
 so allow oneself to make a 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.170
 very fast finish is a burst a dream 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.850
 all these beautiful things stop 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.160
 which still has a few 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.010
 interesting support and even after 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.010
 integrate it into an adequate compo 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.350
 you want the day in tournament maybe 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.070
 couple and a nut anyway it will be 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.480
 a clique conditions in any case there 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.860
 are some classes that are a bit in 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.230
 below the others 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.370
 currently but that varies according to the 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.810
 doctor actually it's like on every 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.860
 games at the beginning we saw a lot 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.650
 hellemmes we see a lot less 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.180
 since now he is melting and his 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.260
 gossip by simply giving you remain 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.450
 bar pendants 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.590
 Finally, the visits are the same 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.910
 supports what he has a solid ray but 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.030
 the good news in all of this is that 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.050
 we will be able to see you in video warriors 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.750
 we had a lot of requests since 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.120
 start and of course it's great yahia 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.969
 you have more than that so there we see 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.699
 that you are on a target you stack me 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:40.459
 the bleeds the bleed bah yeah ben 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.959
 is also a pretty good thing when we 

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:43.879
 cumulates the two traps so there I play 

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:44.360
 with the trap that puts them a little 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:48.769
 road 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.899
 this nerve and therefore the trap that byrne 

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:54.979
 simply that we will superimpose them 

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:55.669
 in the queue will take a lot of 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.949
 burn 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.649
 so if the conditions padrime okay 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.659
 very badly in addition bleeding 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:05.539
 more since you put it next 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.979
 not do five months that readers this 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.119
 that you re announcing in the name I am a 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:13.069
 little sick also I have trouble 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:14.539
 speak neither the bg you already won the psg 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:14.959
 it's a very interesting budget and very 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.159
 quick 

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:18.159
 yeah that was perfect 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.459
 So we are left very soon his 

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:24.919
 products we will try to provide you 

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:26.499
 a little bit of content comment and 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.529
 not only matches 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:34.729
 my live matches with the speak team 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:40.389
 so we say ah very quickly and I know 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:40.389
 not actually hi 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.909
 an anti sd movie to back up a little bit more 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:50.479
 our dream that I can pull I can 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.560
 not too slow 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.819
 we made waves yesterday on the 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.300
 background is true but why am I redoing 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:58.539
 the point since I was on the other side 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.539
 support clock
