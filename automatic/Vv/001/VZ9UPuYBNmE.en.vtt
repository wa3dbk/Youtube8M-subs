00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello welcome to a new video of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.150
 engadget in Spanish I am elena enrÃ­quez and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.090
 today we have come to the center of madrid 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.679
 to try the new xbox one we are 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.299
 here right now with lidia pitzalis that 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.250
 is going to tell us a little bit so good 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.840
 what are the main attractions of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.970
 the new generation when you want 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.160
 welcome everyone to the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.550
 script xbox one and above all welcome 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.220
 to the new generation that is xbox one is 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.309
 an integrated system that allows us 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.739
 enjoy the best games and 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.560
 all the time that we are interested in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.750
 in terms of making music sports and 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.670
 movies or sicily 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.340
 xbox one as you see is not absolutely 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.380
 heavy as you would imagine and has the 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.570
 aspect of this integrated device 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.210
 multimedia all-in-one that we commented 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.910
 as you can see we have a reader 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.300
 blu-ray four times more powerful than 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:05.410
 bluray jaafar we have a usb port 3.0 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.590
 and here the connection to synchronize the 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.500
 wireless controls we go to the part 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.240
 back where we have the connection to the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.450
 electricity through hdmi to the TV 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.100
 the digital sound input 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.649
 that is a novelty because it allows us 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.400
 insert through the width of e-mail and 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.680
 connect what is 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.960
 and pay television to enjoy it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.350
 an integral form of the console others 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.170
 Two USB 2.0 ports the connector 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 kinect here is going is drawn a 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.000
 input and r and the network input you see the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.670
 ventilation slits that make 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.860
 that the console really breathes 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.020
 all sides here we have it 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.039
 now 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.039
 they are called do 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.670
 the command of xbox one that is a the command 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.579
 special for events but as you know 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.100
 the command is wireless changes a lot 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.140
 and the design evolves including 40 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.930
 improvements let's start with ergonomics 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.129
 It really is much more comfortable has 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.470
 changed a little what is the 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.750
 inclination of the same independently 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.510
 of the size of the hands around the world 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.780
 tells us that it is as if it had been done 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.360
 for you, you see that the triggers 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.599
 also especially in games like 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.459
 Forza will enjoy a great 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.130
 improvement that is the force feedback and that 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.160
 they will make us feel different sensations 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.470
 when we leave the road that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.849
 often happens and we have the feeling of 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.209
 be driving on the ground or in the 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.790
 mud you see that the tics are a little more 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.340
 small and they have a kind of 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.769
 roughness that makes the finger 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.290
 adhere in a much more comfortable way is 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.980
 as almost if we had glue the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.750
 crosshead has also evolved and I repeat 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.660
 tail point 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.940
 instead in the back that does 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.640
 that the battery is much better 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.070
 integrated summarizes what is a 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.290
 new generation experience and that 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.570
 is frankly surprising and 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.300
 looking even more than the command of 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.340
 xbox 360 that our 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.030
 consumers that was already pretty good 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.220
 as you see here kinect 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.220
 I can not even lift a moment 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.670
 has changed the design briefly here 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.569
 we have a bit its format has changed 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:42.140
 in the design to fit the design of 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:45.280
 xbox one and is a kinect 10 times more 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.080
 powerful that means how low already 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.269
 you see the microphone the microphone by 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.000
 example now it has been greatly improved for 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.299
 that can distinguish the voices 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.209
 with 6 people noise simultaneously 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.280
 has changed in terms of resolution 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.519
 1080p and above all allows them to play 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.280
 from much closer and much further 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.560
 and also recognizes us in any 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.120
 light condition because it is thought 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.310
 also to be able to use when 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.220
 we are in a movie for example in 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.669
 the Chinese plane manuel compote 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.889
 lighting we went on to describe 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.350
 briefly what does it mean that xbox is worth 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.350
 its integrated device that allows us 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.280
 enjoy all the entertainment 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.350
 imagine for example that this is 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.060
 to the console and as you can see at the moment 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.860
 I connected a console but imagine 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.430
 that we are watching a football match 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.860
 maybe we're bored 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.020
 same as windows 8 minimize in a 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.360
 part of the screen and meanwhile in 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.970
 the rest play with our friends a 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.550
 fifa match but we will always have 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.639
 here the match in case something happens 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.130
 Quickly see it full screen 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:01.180
 we can play and establish connections 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:04.360
 with skype in 1080p with our friends 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.330
 up to 8 we can simultaneously have 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.810
 our music integrated in short 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.190
 all the entertainment has tele of 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.200
 payment music television series 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:21.280
 applications and of course many 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.700
 many many games a large percentage 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.340
 of them exclusive to enjoy the 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.340
 new generation in an integrated manner 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.810
 Well, so far we can tell you 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.570
 now it only remains that they arrive 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.699
 November to be able to throw the tie 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.410
 that's good from the generation one 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.410
 I send you a greeting until next time 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.310
 Y 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:12.689
 Y
