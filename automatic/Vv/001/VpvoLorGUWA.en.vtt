while<00:00:09.389> browsing<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.870> internet<00:00:10.320> basically

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
while browsing the internet basically

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.110 
while browsing the internet basically
what<00:00:11.309> we're<00:00:11.429> going<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.639> do<00:00:11.790> we're<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.059> to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
what we're going to do we're going to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.509 
what we're going to do we're going to
change<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.780> log<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.349> background<00:00:14.190> so

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
change the log in background so

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.490 
change the log in background so
basically<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.000> boot<00:00:15.480> up<00:00:15.540> your<00:00:15.599> Mac<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.109> you

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
basically you boot up your Mac and you

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.590 
basically you boot up your Mac and you
login<00:00:16.740> there's<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.220> default<00:00:17.730> gray<00:00:18.060> background

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
login there's a default gray background

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.570 
login there's a default gray background
we're<00:00:19.439> going<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.650> customize<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.400> and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
we're going to customize that and

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.970 
we're going to customize that and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
basically done in a quick easy steps and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.150 
basically done in a quick easy steps and
if<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.170> done<00:00:25.350> within<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> matter<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.010> like

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
if we done within the matter of like

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.279 
if we done within the matter of like
three<00:00:26.519> minutes<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.330> let's<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.960> go<00:00:28.080> ahead<00:00:28.170> and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
three minutes so let's just go ahead and

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.620 
three minutes so let's just go ahead and
figure<00:00:28.800> out<00:00:28.920> how<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.250> done<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.150> first<00:00:30.449> thing

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
figure out how it's done so first thing

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.720 
figure out how it's done so first thing
you<00:00:30.720> want<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> do<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.349> figure<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.219> your<00:00:32.399> screen

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
you want to do is figure out your screen

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.000 
you want to do is figure out your screen
resolution<00:00:32.880> size<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.140> easily<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.890> can

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
resolution size so easily what you can

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.569 
resolution size so easily what you can
do<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.309> type<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> what<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.420> my<00:00:36.989> screen

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
do is just type in what is my screen

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.889 
do is just type in what is my screen
resolution<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:39.420> if<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.570> go<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
resolution and then if you go get to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.049 
resolution and then if you go get to
this<00:00:39.989> first<00:00:40.410> link<00:00:40.800> it'll<00:00:41.160> actually<00:00:41.430> tell<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
this first link it'll actually tell you

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.720 
this first link it'll actually tell you
so<00:00:43.050> 15-inch<00:00:43.800> MacBook<00:00:44.219> Pro<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:45.090> 1440<00:00:46.050> x<00:00:46.200> 900

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
so 15-inch MacBook Pro is a 1440 x 900

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.799 
so 15-inch MacBook Pro is a 1440 x 900
so<00:00:47.730> then<00:00:47.879> from<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> find<00:00:48.719> an

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
so then from there you have to find an

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.220 
so then from there you have to find an
image<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.649> close<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.760> size

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
image that is close to that size

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.569 
image that is close to that size
basically<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.289> want<00:00:52.350> something<00:00:52.649> that's<00:00:52.739> 1440

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
basically you want something that's 1440

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.790 
basically you want something that's 1440
x<00:00:53.699> 900<00:00:53.850> or<00:00:54.239> bigger<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:55.379> don't<00:00:55.500> want<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.739> too

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
x 900 or bigger you don't want to go too

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950 
x 900 or bigger you don't want to go too
big<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> won't<00:00:56.940> look<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.149> but

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
big because then it won't look right but

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.479 
big because then it won't look right but
somewhere<00:00:58.469> around<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.859> range<00:00:59.100> but

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
somewhere around that range but

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
somewhere around that range but
definitely<00:00:59.850> not<00:00:59.969> less<00:01:00.329> um<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.739> basically<00:01:01.770> for

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
definitely not less um so basically for

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.189
