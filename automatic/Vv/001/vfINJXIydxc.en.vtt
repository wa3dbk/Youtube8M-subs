00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
really really really really cheap one

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.070 
really really really really cheap one
I'm<00:02:20.799> really<00:02:21.069> impatient<00:02:21.549> and<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.510> wanted<00:02:22.930> it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
I'm really impatient and so I wanted it

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.240 
I'm really impatient and so I wanted it
done<00:02:23.170> right<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:23.650> there

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
done right in there

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.699 
done right in there
just<00:02:24.730> sanded<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.239> so<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.660> didn't<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.049> give<00:02:26.590> us

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
just sanded it so it didn't like give us

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.890 
just sanded it so it didn't like give us
splinters<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.549> give<00:02:27.970> my<00:02:28.150> daughter<00:02:28.360> splinters

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
them to go I guess like we moved them

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.089 
them to go I guess like we moved them
around<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.930> figure<00:02:35.079> out<00:02:35.349> I<00:02:35.380> love<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:35.739> one

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
here and that one here and when I found

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.500 
here and that one here and when I found
the<00:02:38.410> way<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.560> liked<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.640> literally<00:02:40.060> just<00:02:40.209> got

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
the way I liked it we literally just got

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.140 
the way I liked it we literally just got
these<00:02:40.870> long<00:02:41.200> screws<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.010> used<00:02:42.760> an<00:02:42.970> actual

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
these long screws and used an actual

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.870 
these long screws and used an actual
like<00:02:43.569> power<00:02:43.810> drill<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.410> would<00:02:45.099> suggest<00:02:45.310> using<00:02:45.670> a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
like power drill I would suggest using a

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.140 
like power drill I would suggest using a
power<00:02:46.060> drill<00:02:46.420> if<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.660> have<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:47.019> any<00:02:48.150> screwed

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
power drill if you have one any screwed

power drill if you have one any screwed
them<00:02:49.660> all<00:02:50.049> in<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.319> line<00:02:50.500> so<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.069> know<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
them all in a line so you know the

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.000 
them all in a line so you know the
screws<00:02:51.910> kind<00:02:52.299> of<00:02:52.450> looked<00:02:52.739> somewhat<00:02:53.739> put

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
screws kind of looked somewhat put

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.860 
screws kind of looked somewhat put
together<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.640> lot<00:02:54.819> of<00:02:54.880> people<00:02:55.000> don't<00:02:55.390> like<00:02:55.630> the

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
together a lot of people don't like the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.979 
together a lot of people don't like the
ends<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.319> this<00:02:56.440> table<00:02:56.650> because<00:02:57.010> it's<00:02:57.160> uneven<00:02:57.370> I

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
ends of this table because it's uneven I

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.289 
ends of this table because it's uneven I
personally<00:02:58.989> like<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.440> so<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.739> kept<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.430> uneven

personally like this so I kept it uneven

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.410 
personally like this so I kept it uneven
so<00:03:02.170> maybe<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.920> don't<00:03:03.129> like<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.730> even<00:03:04.000> though

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
all you have to do is that but I feel

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.660 
all you have to do is that but I feel
like<00:03:08.470> that's<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.739> lot<00:03:08.859> of<00:03:08.920> work<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.340> don't<00:03:09.579> know

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
like that's a lot of work I don't know

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.069 
like that's a lot of work I don't know
the<00:03:09.819> reason<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.180> did<00:03:10.389> it<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.690> first<00:03:10.720> place

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
the reason I did it in the first place

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.530 
the reason I did it in the first place
was<00:03:11.380> because<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:12.340> top<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.760> coffee<00:03:12.970> table

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
was because the top of the coffee table

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.620 
was because the top of the coffee table
I<00:03:13.930> don't<00:03:14.350> know<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.709> was<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.760> get<00:03:16.120> bored<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.450> things

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
I don't know I was I get bored of things

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.280 
I don't know I was I get bored of things
really<00:03:16.840> easily<00:03:17.109> so<00:03:17.290> when<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:17.980> was<00:03:18.190> born<00:03:18.489> to

the table it's super cheap it's easy to
put<00:04:15.660> together<00:04:15.780> once<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.440> do<00:04:16.590> get<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.090> it

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
put together once you do get it and it

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.120 
put together once you do get it and it
has<00:04:18.299> extra<00:04:18.750> storage<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.470> can<00:04:19.620> also<00:04:19.799> put

has extra storage and you can also put
baskets<00:04:20.639> not<00:04:20.820> only<00:04:21.090> on<00:04:21.389> top<00:04:21.810> of<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.079> shelf

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
baskets not only on top of that shelf

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.930 
baskets not only on top of that shelf
but<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.770> can<00:04:22.889> also<00:04:23.040> slide<00:04:23.220> baskets

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
but you can also slide baskets

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.390 
but you can also slide baskets
underneath<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:25.080> shelf<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:25.919> it's<00:04:26.100> kind<00:04:26.340> of

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
underneath that shelf so it's kind of

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.040 
underneath that shelf so it's kind of
like<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.580> double<00:04:26.820> thing<00:04:27.240> going<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:27.990> know

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
like a double thing going and I know

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.020 
like a double thing going and I know
there's<00:04:28.380> lots<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.830> lots<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.160> packs<00:04:29.460> out<00:04:29.700> there

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
there's lots and lots of packs out there

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.659 
there's lots and lots of packs out there
for<00:04:30.450> IKEA<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.350> lots<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.889> do-it-yourself<00:04:32.070> I

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
for IKEA and lots of do-it-yourself I

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.370 
for IKEA and lots of do-it-yourself I
know<00:04:32.760> this<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.210> probably<00:04:33.360> not<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.870> best<00:04:33.900> one

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
know this is probably not the best one

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.530 
know this is probably not the best one
and<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:35.160> haven't<00:04:35.400> really<00:04:35.639> shown<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.120> how<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.300> did

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
and I haven't really shown you how I did

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.940 
and I haven't really shown you how I did
I<00:04:36.570> just<00:04:36.840> kind<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.110> showed<00:04:37.320> you<00:04:37.440> what<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.680> looked

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
I just kind of showed you what it looked

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.560 
I just kind of showed you what it looked
like<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.370> how<00:04:38.580> we<00:04:38.639> did<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.030> think<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.389> most

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
like and how we did I think the most

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.320 
like and how we did I think the most
challenging<00:04:40.010> things<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.160> make<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.820> would<00:04:42.120> be

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
challenging things to make this would be

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.530 
challenging things to make this would be
to<00:04:43.020> put<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:44.340> know<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:44.490> take<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.090> pieces<00:04:45.270> off

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
to put you know I take the pieces off

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.250 
to put you know I take the pieces off
but<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.840> put<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.320> pieces<00:04:47.510> so<00:04:48.510> they<00:04:48.690> fit<00:04:49.020> really

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
but to put the pieces so they fit really

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.650 
but to put the pieces so they fit really
nicely<00:04:49.650> together<00:04:50.400> because<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:51.030> know<00:04:51.060> wood<00:04:51.419> is

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
nicely together because you know wood is

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.480 
nicely together because you know wood is
gonna<00:04:51.810> be<00:04:52.020> shaped<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:52.830> differently<00:04:53.310> when

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
gonna be shaped so differently when

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.730 
gonna be shaped so differently when
you're<00:04:53.610> going<00:04:53.820> for<00:04:54.120> pallets<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:55.410> know<00:04:55.500> cuz

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
you're going for pallets you know cuz

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.140 
you're going for pallets you know cuz
they're<00:04:55.860> all<00:04:55.979> different<00:04:56.190> carrying<00:04:56.820> them<00:04:56.970> and

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
they're all different carrying them and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.670 
they're all different carrying them and
getting<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.479> right<00:04:57.660> pieces<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.229> wood<00:04:58.440> with

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
getting the right pieces of wood with

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.320 
getting the right pieces of wood with
the<00:04:58.800> right<00:04:58.979> colors<00:04:59.430> and<00:04:59.460> stuff<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.180> think

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
the right colors and stuff I think

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.640 
the right colors and stuff I think
that's<00:05:00.660> your<00:05:00.780> biggest<00:05:00.960> challenge<00:05:01.500> and

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
that's your biggest challenge and

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.290 
that's your biggest challenge and
honestly<00:05:02.040> if<00:05:02.250> pallets<00:05:02.610> are<00:05:02.729> free<00:05:02.970> or<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.210> dollar

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
honestly if pallets are free or a dollar

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.540 
honestly if pallets are free or a dollar
you<00:05:03.720> can<00:05:03.870> pick<00:05:04.020> up<00:05:04.110> a<00:05:04.290> few<00:05:04.530> take<00:05:05.190> them<00:05:05.370> off<00:05:05.520> and

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
you can pick up a few take them off and

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.219 
you can pick up a few take them off and
rearrange<00:05:06.330> them<00:05:06.570> how<00:05:06.690> you<00:05:06.750> want<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:07.139> would

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
rearrange them how you want I would

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.250 
rearrange them how you want I would
definitely<00:05:07.710> suggest<00:05:07.860> feeling<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.639> or<00:05:09.110> I<00:05:10.110> don't

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
definitely suggest feeling it or I don't

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.510 
definitely suggest feeling it or I don't
know<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.710> don't<00:05:10.919> know<00:05:11.010> what<00:05:11.190> that's<00:05:11.340> called

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
know I don't know what that's called

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.240

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
keeping it a coffee table for too much

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.800 
keeping it a coffee table for too much
longer<00:05:26.340> which<00:05:26.970> is<00:05:27.120> why<00:05:27.210> I<00:05:27.240> didn't<00:05:27.570> care<00:05:27.780> to

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
longer which is why I didn't care to

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.659 
longer which is why I didn't care to
I'll<00:05:28.229> probably<00:05:28.440> stick<00:05:28.919> it<00:05:29.010> out<00:05:29.130> on<00:05:29.250> our<00:05:29.400> porch

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
I'll probably stick it out on our porch

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.379 
I'll probably stick it out on our porch
but<00:05:30.450> if<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.650> were<00:05:31.860> to<00:05:32.010> keep<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.610> coffee<00:05:32.820> table

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
but if I were to keep the coffee table

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.270 
but if I were to keep the coffee table
for<00:05:33.930> quite<00:05:34.229> some<00:05:34.440> time<00:05:34.470> I<00:05:34.800> would<00:05:34.889> definitely

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
for quite some time I would definitely

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.610 
for quite some time I would definitely
suggest<00:05:35.490> sealing<00:05:36.479> the<00:05:36.600> wood<00:05:37.039> with<00:05:38.039> a<00:05:38.960> seal<00:05:39.960> you

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
suggest sealing the wood with a seal you

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.230 
suggest sealing the wood with a seal you
know<00:05:40.830> that<00:05:41.100> you<00:05:41.250> get<00:05:41.520> at<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:41.729> store<00:05:41.940> I<00:05:42.180> don't

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.240 
know that you get at the store I don't
even<00:05:42.510> know<00:05:42.780> what<00:05:43.200> it's<00:05:43.320> called<00:05:43.410> definitely

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
even know what it's called definitely

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.029 
even know what it's called definitely
suggest<00:05:44.550> doing<00:05:44.669> that<00:05:44.789> before<00:05:45.300> you<00:05:45.479> were<00:05:45.630> to

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
suggest doing that before you were to

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.540 
suggest doing that before you were to
screw<00:05:47.039> in<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:47.850> wood<00:05:48.090> on<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:49.070> on<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.220> table
