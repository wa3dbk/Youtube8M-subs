tire<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.100> used<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.430> run<00:01:32.579> would<00:01:32.909> wear<00:01:33.119> into

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
tire that we used to run would wear into

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.810 
tire that we used to run would wear into
the<00:01:33.420> courts<00:01:33.860> but<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.979> could<00:01:35.100> still<00:01:35.340> run<00:01:35.549> hard

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
on it it wasn't deign it what you would

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.999 
run into the courts and run like that
for<00:01:39.659> ten<00:01:39.780> laps<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.320> was<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> pretty<00:01:40.650> good<00:01:40.799> tire

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
for ten laps that was a pretty good tire

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.710 
for ten laps that was a pretty good tire
even<00:01:41.340> though<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.970> was<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> cord<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.689> can

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
even though it was on a cord you can

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.719 
even though it was on a cord you can
still<00:01:42.990> run<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.409> while<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.189> get<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.610> the

still run it for a while and get to the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.719 
still run it for a while and get to the
next<00:01:45.030> pit<00:01:45.210> stop<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.770> I'll<00:01:46.770> tell<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.130> if<00:01:47.250> I'm<00:01:47.430> I

still seen the centerline in my tires
the<00:01:51.000> mould<00:01:51.329> line<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.840> my<00:01:51.869> tire<00:01:52.229> after<00:01:52.439> 30<00:01:52.799> laps

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
the mould line in my tire after 30 laps

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.460 
the mould line in my tire after 30 laps
and<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> went<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:54.720> running<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.229> tire<00:01:55.439> that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and so I went from running a tire that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.139 
and so I went from running a tire that
would<00:01:55.680> wear<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> court<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.549> attire<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
would wear to the court to attire that I

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.819 
would wear to the court to attire that I
still<00:01:57.390> see<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> center<00:01:57.930> court<00:01:58.140> after<00:01:58.320> 30<00:01:58.619> laps

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
still see the center court after 30 laps

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.399 
still see the center court after 30 laps
there's<00:01:59.070> got<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.490> be<00:02:00.200> several<00:02:01.200> combinations

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
there's got to be several combinations

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.380 
there's got to be several combinations
in<00:02:01.920> between<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:03.320> mean<00:02:04.320> Lord<00:02:05.149> that<00:02:06.149> can't

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
in between that I mean Lord that can't

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.010 
in between that I mean Lord that can't
be<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> next<00:02:06.869> step<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.450> great<00:02:09.450> race<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.690> tire
