00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:03.799
 aracruz cellulose guaíba unit 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.209
 the law project 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.689
 the creation of bleached pulp production 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:13.059
 the increase of production to one million and eight hundred thousand tons per 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:13.490
 year 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.259
 of bleached cellulose 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.220
 through the installation of a new production line 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.759
 with a capacity of 1 million and three hundred thousand tons per year 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.020
 the new project will be implemented has an area of ​​approximately 300 thousand meters 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.199
 with the concept of 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.229
 cause the least possible impact on the existing plant 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.870
 from woods 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.130
 the wood patio will be built occupying part of the ixtoc area 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.890
 chest exists yes 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.500
 chest storage will be used to better meet the new 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.460
 woods 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.470
 the godmother will be received 100% stripped, with about 40% of the 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.920
 total flag will be received through barges 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.920
 and transported internally by trucks 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.110
 the patio of woods will have three lines of picardie and reserved space 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.460
 for a fourth future line an existing factory line 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.330
 there are two lines will meet a new factory 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 of the nozzle lines ii the chips will follow to have circulated with 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330
 capacity for two days of storage 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.760
 after the daughter was dressed 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.909
 the chips will continue to the sieves 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.080
 and of these followed through belt conveyors 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.780
 to feed the cooking fiber line 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.880
 the fiber line is allocated in the area where the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.950
 Dead 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.560
 after the stage has a little bit will be stored in pain and storage and 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.740
 subsequently pumped into low and consistency through power is that 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.040
 for drying 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.560
 drying 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.280
 the new way will be installed next to the existing drying allowing 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.280
 thus sharing pulp storage 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.080
 the storage of pulp that will have capacity for 60 thousand tons of 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:07.980
 cellulose 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.540
 the corresponding to three days of production for the new lines 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.369
 and there are 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:18.969
 the shipment will be carried out by barges together with the production 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.799
 existing factory 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.080
 for this it will be necessary to adapt the current area of ​​the expedition 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.920
 installing a new bale transport system up to the barge 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.219
 in a covered area 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.709
 recovery rg 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.390
 the energy recovery area will be installed in buri is a team 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.119
 with the purpose of making the father's journey pr 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:45.950
 the following units 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.950
 according to the recovery process and energy 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:51.969
 I have power of attorney 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.959
 responsible for concentrating the black liquor that was generated in the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.219
 cooking 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.409
 the black liquor will be concentrated from 15 to 80% in a system of these effects 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.839
 recovery boiler 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:10.190
 the person responsible for burning concentrated black liquor 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.769
 and the non-compensable 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.370
 the burn in black leather generates the enamel which in turn will 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.370
 transformed into a green icon noting that it dissolves pain 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.199
 What's the difference? 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.910
 responsible for transforming the white liqueur green liqueur 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.419
 through last year's radical and caustic dollars 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.670
 the only one on the resulting bench returns to the baking 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.629
 initiating the process again 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.569
 all generator 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.920
 will be able to generate 180 megawatts 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.229
 using with a culture and tourism 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.480
 that will work with the high pressure package 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.849
 from the recovery boiler 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.820
 a new window will be built 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.190
 to integrate emissions control of recovery boiler areas 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.479
 in lime kilns 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:02.559
 the water used in the campaigns will be produced by a new 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:05.559
 boiler water treatment 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:13.099
 required cooling water will be collected is cooled in a new tower 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.280
 and then return the process to the 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:21.139
 water and effluent treatment plant 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.369
 the water used in the process of being adhered to in Guaíba Lake 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.629
 and pumped into the 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:28.499
 water treatment 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:32.619
 new production line will be installed to meet the new production line. 

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:35.969
 water treatment plant and a new effluent treatment plant 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.949
 parker 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.319
 the new park will be built on the modular concept 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.069
 which expedites the assembly 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.069
 which reduces the number of people on site during assembly 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:00.520
 the new installation 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.349
 will have full capacity 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.759
 of one million and eight hundred thousand tons per year 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.129
 of bleached cellulose 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:12.939
 confirming the cross street as the largest world producer of bleached pulp 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:14.210
 of eucalyptus
