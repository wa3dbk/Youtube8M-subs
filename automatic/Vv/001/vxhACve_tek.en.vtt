00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.460
 good your fears to a new good video 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.590
 We are usually used to 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.280
 hear bad and horrible things from 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.589
 video game 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.099
 Many times, we have news of 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:14.629
 quite the opposite and yes it is true that 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.370
 in a certain sense many times 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.500
 those we see we wanted to feet 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.080
 absolutely everything not for 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.550
 example this kid has killed I do not know 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.140
 who because of my eyes or what we 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.290
 we create on foot or there are people who 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.450
 he believes in it blindly and I do not 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.340
 I want this kind of news 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.260
 I can not believe one hundred percent 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.630
 this other kind of news not that the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.700
 video games then help the matter 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.980
 gray and all this but yes that's true 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.530
 that more and more more study then 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.750
 they affirm they affirm that I yes that believe it in 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.570
 part certainly but always with a 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.090
 little skepticism no skepticism 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.210
 but rather caution, let's not put ourselves 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.559
 now to play like fucking fucking macaques 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.660
 thinking that we are going to go back super 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.120
 smart overnight 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.219
 for that requires requires the human being 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.410
 you can study and learn a little how 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.570
 it works in certain things of life not 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.190
 you learn by playing a video game 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.720
 simply by doing it 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.790
 play the call of duty multiplayer no 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.320
 you're going to be smarter but yes you 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.840
 will help in certain to some extent 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.050
 not a new study I did it this way 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.120
 study we call is not the same but yes 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.090
 yes it is true that there have been several 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.480
 in the channel that we've been seeing that 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.030
 they are quite so affirmative with the 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.980
 idea that you see this because it helps no 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.800
 basically, it's saying that 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.330
 good that at the level of interconnection of 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.810
 of the ceres of the brains and others 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.810
 well, good 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.370
 when video games have a higher level 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.410
 of interconnection in the brain not 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.270
 we could say and then later the 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.340
 action games that require our 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.979
 attention and coordination between sight and 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.710
 then hands, it also helps us 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.120
 that this happens not because we turn to 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.060
 a little more reflections increase the 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.400
 gray matter and really because I know 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.160
 so let's be more attentive to certain things 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.570
 but not the game itself not 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.649
 they are going to tomorrow so let's be 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.270
 let's have a race or anything for the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.319
 with which, then, is to obtain a 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.900
 little bit 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.819
 Be careful with that with that same sense 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.409
 that we do not create certain news 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.959
 Not that you at face value 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.719
 the good things but yes that is true 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.879
 that in this I believe in a large part and 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.069
 I think so I've always thought I do not think 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.409
 that games can be a good 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.969
 way of learning also from that by 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.769
 example the teacher may be 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.900
 I played games with the kids when I was 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.299
 they are tiny and other games 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.099
 computer is that they are didactic and 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.709
 they also teach you I think it's a way 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.950
 that things go much better and 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.319
 that so 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.400
 it's easier for you to really learn 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.290
 one of the most common topics of 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.000
 school failure is that the school in 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.790
 many times it can be boring to the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.739
 people bored him the way he 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.690
 they teach you or the way you learn 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.970
 action the way they teach you and that 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.800
 in many occasions because it passes bill and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.450
 the boys finish the boys and 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.709
 the girls are with the guys I meant 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.760
 to the whole group 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.560
 they end up leaving the school aside 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.910
 high school and other good is one 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.040
 of the problems then there are others more 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.920
 disgusting bullying and 13 kind of 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.049
 things that you already know my position on 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.110
 theme but not good basically because the 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.519
 lice help more than destroy or so 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.709
 less in my opinion and that they are 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.299
 revealing several several studies I do not 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.640
 I do not think so, how am I going to repeat 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.220
 whole feet but I think so 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.620
 that do more good than bad do not do so 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.319
 bad as they say to you of destroys the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.959
 Eyes destroys your penis destroys the 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.019
 social life and it destroys everything to you 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.770
 nothing all its fair measure ends up being 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.480
 good and beneficial and what are not 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.780
 they do not help us entertain them 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.700
 forget a little about the problems and 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.580
 have fun in the way 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.110
 cool and good to meet people and all kinds 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.430
 of things I think are good for me 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.410
 they are good they have always always been 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.380
 good logically and always the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.840
 I will defend because they are one thing that I believe 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.340
 that contributes a lot to society weigh 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.770
 a lot of people well look otherwise 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.910
 so good to me they have done it to me 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.760
 they have brought me many things when 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.950
 they were in depression and really, well, I 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.750
 I appreciate them well so good nothing 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.340
 more guys I do not know what you think in the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.960
 description you will have a little more the subject 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.020
 more explained because I did not want to bore 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.450
 with this kind of stuff and so on but 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.860
 well, basically, that's what in the 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.720
 typical study that those who played 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.490
 I could not stand what and in that how much and 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.830
 well then another one more for the 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.850
 collection nothing more guys we see in the 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.850
 next video until next time
