00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.199 
I change that what they had previous was
quite<00:02:06.869> nice<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.920> coming<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> screen<00:02:08.550> from

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
quite nice so coming to the screen from

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.660 
quite nice so coming to the screen from
the<00:02:09.270> q800<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.500> has<00:02:10.619> increased<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.430> size

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the q800 this has increased the size

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.640 
the q800 this has increased the size
from<00:02:12.209> 4.5<00:02:12.900> 24<00:02:13.290> points

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
from 4.5 24 points

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.440 
from 4.5 24 points
of<00:02:13.680> an<00:02:13.769> inch<00:02:13.920> with<00:02:14.280> an<00:02:14.400> HD<00:02:14.790> display<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.269> time

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
of an inch with an HD display this time

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.160 
of an inch with an HD display this time
so<00:02:15.900> now<00:02:16.049> we<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:16.519> this<00:02:17.519> screen<00:02:17.849> at<00:02:18.030> 312<00:02:19.019> PPI

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
so now we have this screen at 312 PPI

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.610 
so now we have this screen at 312 PPI
which<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.680> quite<00:02:19.860> good<00:02:20.150> also<00:02:21.150> as<00:02:22.019> usual<00:02:22.470> you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
which is quite good also as usual you

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.330 
which is quite good also as usual you
have<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:23.099> quad-core<00:02:23.610> processor<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:25.340> which

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
have a quad-core processor in this which

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.699 
have a quad-core processor in this which
is<00:02:26.519> 1.2<00:02:27.390> lizard<00:02:27.750> squad<00:02:27.930> coke<00:02:28.230> pretty<00:02:28.409> much<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
is 1.2 lizard squad coke pretty much the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.679 
is 1.2 lizard squad coke pretty much the
same<00:02:28.920> chipset<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.519> was<00:02:29.670> back<00:02:30.329> in<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:30.510> queue

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
same chipset that was back in the queue

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.330 
same chipset that was back in the queue
800<00:02:31.109> so<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.620> performance<00:02:32.040> should<00:02:32.129> be<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
800 so the performance should be the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.009 
800 so the performance should be the
same<00:02:32.489> which<00:02:32.700> we<00:02:32.730> need<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.090> see<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.329> course<00:02:33.510> you

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
same which we need to see of course you

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.960 
same which we need to see of course you
got<00:02:34.170> an<00:02:34.290> 8<00:02:34.439> megapixel<00:02:34.859> camera<00:02:35.549> in<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.790> one

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
got an 8 megapixel camera in this one

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.470 
got an 8 megapixel camera in this one
and<00:02:36.829> front<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.489> 2<00:02:38.670> megapixel<00:02:38.790> camera

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
and front you have a 2 megapixel camera

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.559 
and front you have a 2 megapixel camera
here<00:02:39.829> so<00:02:40.829> let's<00:02:41.069> see<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.459> runs<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.150> latest

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
here so let's see this runs the latest

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.680 
here so let's see this runs the latest
Android<00:02:43.170> OS<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:44.010> should<00:02:44.189> be<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.400> 4.2<00:02:45.180> I

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
Android OS it should be the 4.2 I

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.690 
Android OS it should be the 4.2 I
suspect<00:02:46.650> yes<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.069> four<00:02:47.220> point<00:02:47.430> two<00:02:47.549> point

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
suspect yes is the four point two point

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.099 
suspect yes is the four point two point
two<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.269> don't<00:02:48.359> know<00:02:48.480> about<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:48.720> updates

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
two you don't know about the updates

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.869 
two you don't know about the updates
most<00:02:49.799> probably<00:02:49.950> they<00:02:50.129> release<00:02:50.400> we<00:02:50.609> don't<00:02:50.790> know

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
most probably they release we don't know

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.710 
most probably they release we don't know
joel<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.450> not<00:02:51.720> well<00:02:51.930> known<00:02:52.079> for<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:53.629> so<00:02:54.629> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
joel is not well known for that so the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.449 
joel is not well known for that so the
cool<00:02:54.870> thing<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.139> this<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.440> from<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.650> q800<00:02:56.220> to

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
cool thing in this is from the q800 to

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.800 
cool thing in this is from the q800 to
the<00:02:56.549> q<00:02:56.730> 9<00:02:56.849> other<00:02:57.030> they<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.359> also<00:02:57.480> increased

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the q 9 other they have also increased

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.720 
the q 9 other they have also increased
the<00:02:57.989> RAM<00:02:58.200> which<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.470> double<00:02:58.739> now<00:02:58.889> it's<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.370> 1gb

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
the RAM which is double now it's a 1gb

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.000 
the RAM which is double now it's a 1gb
of<00:02:59.849> RAM<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.329> still<00:03:00.810> has<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.019> same<00:03:01.290> 4gb

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
of RAM it still has the same 4gb

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.160 
of RAM it still has the same 4gb
internal<00:03:02.159> memory<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.909> of<00:03:03.689> course<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.079> have

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
internal memory and of course you have

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.140

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.539 
an expandable micro SD card support
which<00:03:06.629> is<00:03:06.810> another<00:03:07.139> battery<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.620> time<00:03:07.859> so

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549
