 right on the pole they burn negrin 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.400
 here you replay perhaps stretched a bit 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.129
 prematurely roberto vecchione 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.049
 but you know that with the ifs and with the but not you 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.349

 so we are therefore directing the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.890
 victory of valsenio 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.490
 with roberto andreghetti who comes 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:45.040
 precisely to conclude on the final 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.040
 we are reviewing the images on the monitor 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.549
 with grace sm leaning towards victory

 battery but just at the edge of the pole 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.620
 irony of fate arrives just 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:58.540

 the exhilarating victory and the final 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:08.730
 just put the snout in front of it is 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:13.030
 really of a trifle that comes to 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.389
 then conclude number 3 for vansen al 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.539
 first place limits that already the voice of the great ones
