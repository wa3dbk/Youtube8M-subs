an airline pilot I'm going to say it's
going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> depend<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.990> Avenue<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.529> take

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
going to depend on what Avenue you take

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.850 
going to depend on what Avenue you take
any<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.750> go<00:00:33.870> through<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.200> military<00:00:34.649> that's

any can go through the military that's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.389 
any can go through the military that's
what<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> did<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.140> course<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.890> didn't

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
what I did and then of course it didn't

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.040 
what I did and then of course it didn't
cost<00:00:38.550> anything<00:00:39.530> then<00:00:40.530> maybe<00:00:41.660> you<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.840> make

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
cost anything then maybe you can make

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.770 
cost anything then maybe you can make
some<00:00:43.260> jokes<00:00:43.559> about<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.610> how<00:00:45.420> much<00:00:45.629> it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
some jokes about that of how much it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.680 
some jokes about that of how much it
does<00:00:45.960> cost<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.800> as<00:00:47.520> far<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.090> out<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.510> your

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
does cost but as far as out of your

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
does cost but as far as out of your
pocket<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:50.070> no<00:00:50.250> money<00:00:51.530> also<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:53.730> can

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
pocket really no money also you can

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.450 
pocket really no money also you can
enter<00:00:54.390> via<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> guard<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.620> that's<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.309> good

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
enter via the guard and that's a good

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.000 
enter via the guard and that's a good
way<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.670> go<00:00:56.989> there's<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.260> less<00:00:58.469> commitment

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
way to go there's a lot less commitment

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.619 
way to go there's a lot less commitment
than<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.489> into<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> airlines

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
how to fly like that so you can go to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.260 
how to fly like that so you can go to
the<00:01:05.700> guard<00:01:06.049> and<00:01:07.310> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> contact<00:01:09.090> me

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.460 
the guard and if you want to contact me
on<00:01:09.470> how<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.540> maybe<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> little

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
on how to do that maybe get a little

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.899 
on how to do that maybe get a little
more<00:01:13.590> information<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> little<00:01:14.790> more

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
more information I can be a little more

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.960 
more information I can be a little more
specific<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.740> kind<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:17.670> tricks

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
specific on on that kind of some tricks

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.399 
specific on on that kind of some tricks
into<00:01:18.770> getting<00:01:19.770> into<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> guard<00:01:21.020> then<00:01:22.020> also

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
into getting into the guard then also

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.570 
into getting into the guard then also
there's<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.270> school<00:01:24.270> around<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.830> u.s.<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.400> is

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
there's a school around the u.s. now is

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.789 
there's a school around the u.s. now is
like<00:01:26.729> 34<00:01:27.210> branches<00:01:27.750> called<00:01:28.020> ATP<00:01:28.380> flight

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
like 34 branches called ATP flight

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.190 
like 34 branches called ATP flight
schools<00:01:29.130> they'll<00:01:29.850> take<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.210> from<00:01:30.479> zero<00:01:30.810> hours

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
schools they'll take it from zero hours

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.020 
schools they'll take it from zero hours
to<00:01:32.119> being<00:01:33.119> an<00:01:33.240> airline<00:01:33.420> pilot<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.110> two<00:01:34.320> years

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
to being an airline pilot in two years

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.420 
to being an airline pilot in two years
that<00:01:36.030> cost<00:01:36.270> about<00:01:36.540> seventy<00:01:37.259> thousand<00:01:37.979> dollars

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that cost about seventy thousand dollars

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.999 
that cost about seventy thousand dollars
and<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.810> pretty<00:01:40.290> much<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> same

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
and you can pretty much do the same

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.510 
and you can pretty much do the same
thing<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:42.119> your<00:01:42.450> own<00:01:43.130> I'm<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> guess

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
thing on your own I'm going to guess

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.620 
thing on your own I'm going to guess
it's<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.970> take<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> little<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:45.570> than

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
it's going to take a little more than

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.270 
it's going to take a little more than
two<00:01:45.930> years<00:01:45.960> though<00:01:46.500> probably<00:01:47.189> three<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.390> least

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
two years though probably three at least

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.179 
two years though probably three at least
to<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.640> CF<00:01:51.060> WI<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:51.979> instruct<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to get your CF WI and then instruct and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.990 
to get your CF WI and then instruct and
build<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.549> hours<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.710> probably<00:01:56.000> get

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
build up your hours and you probably get

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.719 
build up your hours and you probably get
all<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.299> time<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:58.790> your<00:01:59.790> CF<00:02:00.119> WI<00:02:00.570> rating

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
all that time for your CF WI rating

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.770 
all that time for your CF WI rating
which<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.939> certified<00:02:03.450> flight<00:02:03.659> instructor

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
which is a certified flight instructor

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.100 
which is a certified flight instructor
with<00:02:04.649> an<00:02:04.740> issue

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
with an issue

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.950 
with an issue
rating<00:02:06.000> I'm<00:02:07.000> guessing<00:02:07.420> that's<00:02:07.480> going<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.750> cost

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
rating I'm guessing that's going to cost

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.320 
rating I'm guessing that's going to cost
you<00:02:08.110> about<00:02:09.360> 40<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.509> 50<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:11.760> ATP<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.150> little

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
you about 40 to 50 so ATP is a little

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.620 
you about 40 to 50 so ATP is a little
more<00:02:13.450> streamlined<00:02:14.110> than<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:16.450> might

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
more streamlined than that and you might

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.680 
more streamlined than that and you might
