 written each with its subject and with its 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.940
 likes that some do have more

 some people believed that they were not 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.259
 extraterrestrials but personification of 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.229

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.959
 of a pokémon 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.360

 merchandising is also provided 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.329
 important in this type of events more 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.120
 what characterizes the attendees is 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.370
 precisely the fanaticism that we are 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.900
 offering here are the originals of 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.670
 stars from japan pokemon

 as you will see they have many stories 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.720
 then this would be like one of the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.250
 first pokemon before following the 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.580
 series that was really broadcast in the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.680
 Program 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.010
 but for photographs only my weights 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.340
 many necklaces 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.930

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.160
 it's a framed and you can also 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.490
 take a poster if you do not want 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:31.530
 Take it in clear light paper box in 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:33.660
 anime and videogames although our 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.330
 mission in any case was to find the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.430
 main character the rockstar of the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.430
 animated series the most famous of all 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.950
 you have to find it 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.870
 the coquettish pikachu that is a picasso in 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.870
 special with a wide dress 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:04.549
 woman our mission was not easy between 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.549
 so much because riding back to Navarre 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.060
 that leaves me the same 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.060
 has not seen assets to the past 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.280
 but such a search always has its 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.920
 reward 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.330
 hi i am pikachu i am the most popular of 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.270
 the pokemon was here having a good time 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.280
 in the pacman day but it is what I would do 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.200
 with özil pikachu the truth is that the 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.600
 lovers of this series have their space 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.600
 in a true addiction that despite the 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.600
 time in them seems not to diminish
