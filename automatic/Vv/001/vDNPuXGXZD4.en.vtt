00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.060 

now<00:02:33.720> here's<00:02:33.990> what<00:02:34.170> gets<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.410> little<00:02:34.530> bit<00:02:34.710> harder

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
now here's what gets a little bit harder

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.550 
now here's what gets a little bit harder
I<00:02:35.280> rolled<00:02:35.610> two<00:02:35.820> balls<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.780> green<00:02:37.020> clay<00:02:37.290> and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
I rolled two balls of the green clay and

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.310 
I rolled two balls of the green clay and
then<00:02:37.740> I<00:02:37.770> flatten<00:02:38.250> them<00:02:38.490> together<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:40.110> make

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
then I flatten them together to make

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.030 
then I flatten them together to make
this<00:02:40.590> line<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.370> I'm<00:02:41.760> lost<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.900> clip<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:43.950> it

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
this line and I'm lost the clip for it

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.160 
this line and I'm lost the clip for it
sorry<00:02:44.250> guys<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.390> then<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.720> do<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.110> just

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
sorry guys so then what I do is I just

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.250 
sorry guys so then what I do is I just
take<00:02:46.320> my<00:02:46.470> straightedge<00:02:46.950> razor<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.910> I'm<00:02:48.900> going

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
take my straightedge razor and I'm going

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.460 
take my straightedge razor and I'm going
to<00:02:49.380> cut<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.710> shape<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:52.110> kind<00:02:52.410> of

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
to cut the shape and it's kind of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.980 
to cut the shape and it's kind of
difficult<00:02:52.710> but<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.490> mean<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.330> get<00:02:54.480> better<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.930> I

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
difficult but I mean you get better so I

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.050 
difficult but I mean you get better so I
just<00:02:55.200> cut<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.590> top<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:56.190> know<00:02:56.310> how<00:02:56.520> long<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.850> want

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
just cut the top to know how long I want

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.990 
just cut the top to know how long I want
it<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.720> do<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.710> bottom<00:02:59.190> part<00:02:59.370> of

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
it and then I do the bottom part of

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.670 
it and then I do the bottom part of
course<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.480> stem<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.960> little<00:03:01.170> too<00:03:01.260> long<00:03:01.470> so

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
course the stem is a little too long so

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.310 
course the stem is a little too long so
I<00:03:01.710> fix<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:03.270> do<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.780> leaves<00:03:04.020> on<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
I fix that and then do the leaves on the

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.930 
I fix that and then do the leaves on the
side<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.680> there's<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.190> little<00:03:05.370> bit<00:03:05.550> of<00:03:05.610> space

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
side and there's a little bit of space

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.220 
side and there's a little bit of space
between<00:03:06.000> each<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:07.110> them<00:03:08.270> decide<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.510> get<00:03:09.780> that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
between each of them decide to get that

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.340 
between each of them decide to get that
a<00:03:10.770> little<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.550> play<00:03:11.760> out<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.300> at<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.020> top

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
a little bit of play out and at the top

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.990 
a little bit of play out and at the top
it's<00:03:14.160> more<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.910> diamond<00:03:15.750> shape<00:03:16.670> for<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> top

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
it's more of a diamond shape for the top

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.100 
it's more of a diamond shape for the top
of<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.510> leaf<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.390> do<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.750> little

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
of the leaf and so I do the little

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.930 
of the leaf and so I do the little
diamond<00:03:25.500> shape<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:26.040> fix<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.520> up<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:28.730> then<00:03:29.730> do

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
diamond shape and fix it up and then do

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.650 
diamond shape and fix it up and then do
the<00:03:30.090> other<00:03:30.120> side<00:03:30.770> and<00:03:31.820> what<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:32.850> realized<00:03:33.120> when

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
the other side and what I realized when

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.140 
the other side and what I realized when
I<00:03:33.720> finish<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:35.040> leaves<00:03:35.370> kind<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:35.970> go

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
I finish is that the leaves kind of go

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.330 
I finish is that the leaves kind of go
inward<00:03:36.600> towards<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.019> top<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.620> do<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:38.070> and

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
inward towards the top so I do that and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.960 
inward towards the top so I do that and
I<00:03:38.790> bake<00:03:39.030> everything<00:03:39.660> at<00:03:40.080> 275<00:03:40.769> for<00:03:41.280> 15<00:03:41.790> minutes

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
I bake everything at 275 for 15 minutes

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.690 
I bake everything at 275 for 15 minutes
and<00:03:42.269> once<00:03:42.540> it's<00:03:42.720> out<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:43.220> put<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> little<00:03:44.370> sloppy

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
and once it's out I put a little sloppy

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.880 
and once it's out I put a little sloppy
glass<00:03:45.060> glaze<00:03:45.420> on<00:03:45.780> each<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.350> pieces<00:03:46.500> i

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
glass glaze on each of the pieces i

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.009 
glass glaze on each of the pieces i
think<00:03:47.070> i<00:03:47.160> did<00:03:47.310> two<00:03:47.489> layers<00:03:47.760> front<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.570> back<00:03:48.660> on

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
think i did two layers front and back on

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.910 
think i did two layers front and back on
each<00:03:49.170> of<00:03:49.320> them<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.680> they're<00:03:49.830> nice<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.160> shiny

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
each of them so they're nice and shiny

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.960 
each of them so they're nice and shiny
and<00:03:53.690> once<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.840> was<00:03:54.959> dry<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:55.620> put<00:03:56.220> pinbacks<00:03:56.730> on

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
and once it was dry I put pinbacks on

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.000 
and once it was dry I put pinbacks on
all<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.300> them<00:03:58.610> because<00:03:59.810> if<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:01.320> ever<00:04:01.440> want<00:04:01.799> to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
all of them because if I ever want to

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.180 
all of them because if I ever want to
cosplay<00:04:02.700> or<00:04:03.060> something<00:04:03.780> then<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.530> can<00:04:04.920> wear
