all right so I got a 2000 Ford Focus 2.0
liter<00:00:06.509> with<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.259> double<00:00:07.620> overhead<00:00:08.099> whatever

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
liter with a double overhead whatever

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.030 
liter with a double overhead whatever
and<00:00:09.769> since<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.860> day<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.010> got<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.780> about<00:00:12.889> I'm<00:00:13.889> at

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
and since the day I got it about I'm at

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.340 
and since the day I got it about I'm at
160<00:00:14.700> 2,000<00:00:15.360> miles<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.690> like<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.929> with<00:00:16.080> ninety

160 2,000 miles I like that with ninety

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.560 
160 2,000 miles I like that with ninety
two<00:00:16.470> thousand<00:00:16.830> miles<00:00:16.980> two<00:00:17.369> years<00:00:17.550> ago<00:00:17.760> they

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
two thousand miles two years ago they

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.650 
two thousand miles two years ago they
got<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.260> engine<00:00:19.500> randomly<00:00:20.070> died<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.660> heard

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
got it the engine randomly died I heard

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.050 
got it the engine randomly died I heard
a<00:00:21.689> lot<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.990> ways<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.350> fix<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.980> did<00:00:23.850> everything

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
a lot of ways to fix it I did everything

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.740 
a lot of ways to fix it I did everything
I<00:00:24.300> replaced<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.199> spark<00:00:25.320> plugs<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.070> wires

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
I replaced the spark plugs the wires

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.720 
I replaced the spark plugs the wires
didn't<00:00:27.750> use<00:00:27.900> AC<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.740> replace<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.609> air<00:00:29.699> filter

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
didn't use AC I replace the air filter

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.030 
didn't use AC I replace the air filter
since<00:00:30.660> then<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.990> even<00:00:31.230> got<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.529> trying<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> fix

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
since then I even got this trying to fix

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.450 
since then I even got this trying to fix
it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.310 
it
everything<00:00:33.149> seemed<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> help<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
everything seemed to help but the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.319 
everything seemed to help but the
problem<00:00:34.590> would<00:00:34.680> randomly<00:00:35.040> come<00:00:35.340> back<00:00:35.520> um<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
problem would randomly come back um I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.660 
problem would randomly come back um I
saw<00:00:37.140> there's<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.469> extended<00:00:37.829> warranty<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
saw there's an extended warranty on the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.470 
saw there's an extended warranty on the
field<00:00:38.910> pump<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:41.030> checked<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.450> my

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
field pump I checked that out with my

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.600 
field pump I checked that out with my
VIN<00:00:42.780> number<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> was<00:00:43.469> eligible<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.340> never

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
VIN number I was eligible for I never

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.350 
VIN number I was eligible for I never
had<00:00:44.820> mine<00:00:45.000> replaced<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:47.059> thought<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> was<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
had mine replaced I thought it was that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.569 
had mine replaced I thought it was that
when<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.719> go<00:00:48.870> fix<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.530> apparently<00:00:50.309> someone

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
when to go fix it and apparently someone

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.490 
when to go fix it and apparently someone
actually<00:00:50.940> replace<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.480> whole<00:00:51.690> fuel<00:00:52.199> tank

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
actually replace the whole fuel tank

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.560 
actually replace the whole fuel tank
housing<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.820> housing<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> fill

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
housing the the housing for the fill

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
housing the the housing for the fill
pump<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.930> actually<00:00:55.260> different<00:00:55.440> from<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
pump is actually different from when I

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.420 
pump is actually different from when I
got<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.219> autozone<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.949> ended<00:00:58.949> up<00:00:59.070> being<00:00:59.309> I

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
got from autozone so ended up being I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.979

diamond<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.850> place<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> feel<00:01:00.359> pumped<00:01:00.600> there

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
diamond your place to feel pumped there

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.189 
diamond your place to feel pumped there
was<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.530> much<00:01:01.710> gunk<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.879> little<00:01:03.180> there's<00:01:04.110> a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
was so much gunk on the little there's a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.710 
was so much gunk on the little there's a
little<00:01:04.409> filter<00:01:04.710> rate<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.119> into<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> field

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
little filter rate to get into the field

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.780 
little filter rate to get into the field
how's<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.049> feel<00:01:07.229> pump<00:01:07.470> housing<00:01:07.920> about<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
how's that feel pump housing about this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.899 
how's that feel pump housing about this
big<00:01:09.000> around<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:11.220> can't<00:01:11.520> even<00:01:11.580> really

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
big around and is you can't even really

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
big around and is you can't even really
pass<00:01:12.180> water<00:01:12.540> through<00:01:12.689> gas<00:01:13.170> barely<00:01:13.590> gets

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
pass water through gas barely gets

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.560 
pass water through gas barely gets
through<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:14.820> had<00:01:15.210> sludge

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
through so it was actually had sludge

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.760 
through so it was actually had sludge
about<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.990> thick<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
about that thick on it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.760 
about that thick on it
I<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.670> pictures<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.439> MySpace<00:01:19.439> which<00:01:19.590> I'll

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
I do have pictures on MySpace which I'll

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.450 
I do have pictures on MySpace which I'll
post<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.369> link<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.020> clean<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.189> far

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
post the link to I clean that up so far

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.609 
post the link to I clean that up so far
no<00:01:23.820> problems<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.450> starting<00:01:24.900> hopefully<00:01:25.439> this

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
no problems with starting hopefully this

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.649 
no problems with starting hopefully this
is<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.670> optimally<00:01:27.119> fixes<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.600> problem

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
is a what optimally fixes that problem

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.230 
is a what optimally fixes that problem
so<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:28.740> any<00:01:28.920> boats<00:01:29.070> has<00:01:29.369> therefore<00:01:29.820> focused

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
so if any boats has therefore focused

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
so if any boats has therefore focused
randomly<00:01:30.630> dying<00:01:30.840> check<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.439> fill<00:01:31.920> filter

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
randomly dying check the the fill filter

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.340 
randomly dying check the the fill filter
ELISA<00:01:32.579> pain<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.750> off<00:01:34.640> total<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:35.880> was

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
ELISA pain to get it off total there was

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.020 
ELISA pain to get it off total there was
three<00:01:37.350> electrical<00:01:37.860> connections<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.549> four

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
three electrical connections and four

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.270 
three electrical connections and four
hoses<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.020> get<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.189> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
hoses you have to get you have to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.520 
hoses you have to get you have to
disconnect<00:01:41.759> took<00:01:42.479> about<00:01:42.659> two<00:01:42.960> hours<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.350> me

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
disconnect took about two hours with me

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.929 
disconnect took about two hours with me
and<00:01:43.649> my<00:01:43.710> dad<00:01:43.920> you've<00:01:44.220> done<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.549> before<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and my dad you've done it before the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.639 
and my dad you've done it before the
other<00:01:45.060> vehicles<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.600> he<00:01:45.750> pretty<00:01:45.960> much<00:01:46.049> guided

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
other vehicles so he pretty much guided

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.740 
other vehicles so he pretty much guided
me<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.240> fixed<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
me through it but that's what fixed it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.859 
me through it but that's what fixed it
so<00:01:48.930> far<00:01:49.860> hopefully<00:01:50.130> that's<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> ultimate<00:01:51.360> fix

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
so far hopefully that's the ultimate fix

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.569 
so far hopefully that's the ultimate fix
since<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.590> did<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> actually<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.340> way<00:01:53.549> more

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
since we did it actually have way more

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.240 
since we did it actually have way more
power<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:55.079> reason<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.829> believe<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.189> was

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
power the reason that I believe it was

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.300 
power the reason that I believe it was
happening<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:58.020> feel<00:01:58.310> comes

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
happening is because the feel comes

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.010 
happening is because the feel comes
always<00:01:59.820> back<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> car<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.840> right

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
always back of the car to this right

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
always back of the car to this right
here<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.619> pressurizes<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.700> 25

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
putting the car neutral that would lose

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.420 
putting the car neutral that would lose
the<00:02:21.900> suction<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.590> all<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> dirt<00:02:22.950> would<00:02:23.100> kind

of drift away from the filter and when
you<00:02:24.990> restart<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.500> would<00:02:25.650> work<00:02:25.800> until<00:02:26.310> it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
you restart it would work until it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.310 
you restart it would work until it
respects<00:02:26.850> it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
respects it

I<00:02:28.350> did<00:02:28.770> put<00:02:28.980> fill<00:02:29.190> injector<00:02:29.610> cleaner<00:02:29.850> into<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
I did put fill injector cleaner into the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.510 
I did put fill injector cleaner into the
the<00:02:31.050> gas<00:02:31.230> tank<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.530> few<00:02:31.560> times<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.130> actually

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
the gas tank a few times then actually

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.820 
the gas tank a few times then actually
that<00:02:32.550> did<00:02:33.090> make<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.630> lasts<00:02:33.990> longest<00:02:34.470> when

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
that did make it lasts longest when

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.140 
that did make it lasts longest when
about<00:02:35.010> three<00:02:35.070> more<00:02:35.430> months<00:02:35.670> before<00:02:35.760> died

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
about three more months before died

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.970 
about three more months before died
again<00:02:36.390> when<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.050> did<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.500> also<00:02:37.830> when<00:02:37.950> I

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
again when I did that is also when I

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.190 
again when I did that is also when I
placed<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.850> air<00:02:39.240> intake<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.170> I

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
placed the air intake like this so I

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.600 
placed the air intake like this so I
kind<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.590> thought<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:40.800> was<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.190> hose<00:02:41.400> that

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
kind of thought it was this hose that

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.370 
kind of thought it was this hose that
was<00:02:41.730> messed<00:02:41.940> up<00:02:42.120> because<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.570> hose<00:02:42.810> was<00:02:43.050> even

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
was messed up because this hose was even

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.470 
was messed up because this hose was even
here<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:44.190> was<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.370> totally<00:02:44.970> missing<00:02:45.300> from

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
here it was just totally missing from

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.750 
here it was just totally missing from
the<00:02:45.600> airbox<00:02:45.870> before<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.370> thought<00:02:47.580> that

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
the airbox before so I thought that

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.630 
the airbox before so I thought that
actually<00:02:48.090> ultimately<00:02:48.480> fixed<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.110> then

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
actually ultimately fixed it but it then

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.100 
actually ultimately fixed it but it then
then<00:02:50.640> replaced<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.060> PCV<00:02:51.480> valve<00:02:51.810> because

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
then replaced the PCV valve because

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.800 
then replaced the PCV valve because
people<00:02:52.410> said<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.710> cause<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.310> die<00:02:53.810> that

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
people said that cause it to die that

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.510 
people said that cause it to die that
still<00:02:55.050> then<00:02:55.200> fix<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.590> literally<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.130> same<00:02:56.400> day

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
still then fix it literally the same day

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.460 
still then fix it literally the same day
I<00:02:56.550> replaced<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:56.970> died<00:02:57.240> again<00:02:57.390> then<00:02:58.320> they

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
I replaced it died again then they

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.020 
I replaced it died again then they
replaced<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.890> spark<00:02:59.010> plugs<00:02:59.460> spark<00:02:59.670> plug

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
replaced the spark plugs spark plug

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.480 
replaced the spark plugs spark plug
wires<00:03:00.240> have<00:03:00.450> died<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.530> we'll<00:03:02.100> see<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.340> that

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
wires have died so we'll see if that

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.970 
wires have died so we'll see if that
fixes<00:03:02.730> it
