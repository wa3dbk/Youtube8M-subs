it's<00:01:57.479> possible<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.350> well<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
it's possible to do well with the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.620 
it's possible to do well with the
assault<00:01:59.159> rifles<00:01:59.549> i<00:01:59.640> guess<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.119> you'd<00:02:00.329> want<00:02:00.540> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
assault rifles i guess but you'd want to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.020 
assault rifles i guess but you'd want to
stay<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.960> their<00:02:01.409> kind<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.860> more<00:02:02.189> open<00:02:02.640> areas

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
stay to their kind of more open areas

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.530 
stay to their kind of more open areas
which<00:02:04.130> yeah<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> way<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> map<00:02:05.729> flows<00:02:06.060> there's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
which yeah the way the map flows there's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.839 
which yeah the way the map flows there's
domination<00:02:07.350> flags<00:02:07.710> at<00:02:08.039> either<00:02:08.310> end<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
domination flags at either end of the

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.210 
domination flags at either end of the
matter

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
matter

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.820

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
and then there's a little kind of arena

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.420 
and then there's a little kind of arena
if<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.850> want<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.090> call<00:02:13.270> it<00:02:13.830> which<00:02:14.830> holds<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.250> bee

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
if you want to call it which holds a bee

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
flag and yeah there's a lot of

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.640 
flag and yeah there's a lot of
overlooked<00:02:18.190> points<00:02:18.610> but<00:02:19.230> there's<00:02:20.230> also<00:02:20.380> quite

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
overlooked points but there's also quite

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.770 
overlooked points but there's also quite
a<00:02:20.740> bit<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.040> cover<00:02:21.220> on<00:02:21.430> be<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:21.910> even<00:02:22.360> though<00:02:22.510> it

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
a bit of cover on be so even though it

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.350 
a bit of cover on be so even though it
can<00:02:23.050> be<00:02:23.230> challenging<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:24.610> capture<00:02:25.210> by

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
can be challenging to capture by

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.240 
can be challenging to capture by
yourself<00:02:25.870> if<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.500> got<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> couple<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.070> players

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
yourself if you got a couple of players

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.280 
yourself if you got a couple of players
on<00:02:27.550> there<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.390> watch<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.660> different

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
on there and you watch the different

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.330 
on there and you watch the different
kind<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.560> sight<00:02:29.800> lines<00:02:30.130> um<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:32.080> it's<00:02:32.410> pretty

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
kind of sight lines um it's it's pretty

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.120 
kind of sight lines um it's it's pretty
it's<00:02:33.520> manageable<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.330> cat<00:02:34.510> be<00:02:34.720> so<00:02:35.080> it's<00:02:35.950> not

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
it's manageable to cat be so it's not

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.100 
it's manageable to cat be so it's not
like<00:02:36.430> what's<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.360> map<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:38.730> black<00:02:39.730> ops<00:02:40.000> one<00:02:40.960> of

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
like what's that map in black ops one of

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.960 
like what's that map in black ops one of
the<00:02:41.200> new<00:02:41.320> maps<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.950> forget<00:02:42.550> what<00:02:42.730> it's<00:02:42.910> called

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
the new maps I forget what it's called

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
flag was on a bridge and that was just

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.080 
flag was on a bridge and that was just
360<00:02:48.790> degrees<00:02:49.920> kind<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.070> lines<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.520> sight<00:02:51.730> which

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
360 degrees kind of lines of sight which

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.640 
360 degrees kind of lines of sight which
people<00:02:52.420> could<00:02:52.480> shoot<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.750> from<00:02:52.959> but<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.440> is

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
a little more sheltered so yeah the bee

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.699 
a little more sheltered so yeah the bee
flags<00:02:56.260> are<00:02:56.500> manageable<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.459> get<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:58.440> only<00:02:59.440> play

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
flags are manageable to get I only play

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.100 
flags are manageable to get I only play
domination<00:03:00.160> tonight<00:03:00.810> part<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:01.990> was

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
domination tonight part of that was

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.199 
domination tonight part of that was
because<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.560> really<00:03:02.980> wanted<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.280> smell<00:03:03.520> Evan<00:03:03.970> I

because I really wanted to smell Evan I

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.240 
because I really wanted to smell Evan I
thought<00:03:04.870> domination<00:03:05.590> give<00:03:05.800> me<00:03:05.890> my<00:03:06.040> best

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
thought domination give me my best

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.170 
thought domination give me my best
chance<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.750> get<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.080> but<00:03:08.320> yeah<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.150> said

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
the spawns for domination seem pretty

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.740 
the spawns for domination seem pretty
predictable<00:03:13.030> which<00:03:13.750> which<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.410> really<00:03:14.860> like<00:03:15.160> um

to kind of make sure you check your

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.900 
to kind of make sure you check your
corners<00:03:35.320> when<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:35.800> enter<00:03:36.160> that<00:03:36.190> area<00:03:36.610> because

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
corners when you enter that area because

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.550 
corners when you enter that area because
there's<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.180> lot<00:03:37.390> of<00:03:37.420> boxes<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:38.080> people<00:03:38.410> can

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
there's a lot of boxes that people can

hide hide behind for cover and yeah I

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.870 
hide hide behind for cover and yeah I
think<00:03:42.730> on<00:03:43.269> either<00:03:43.600> side<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:45.130> enemy<00:03:45.489> also

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
think on either side the enemy also

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.820 
think on either side the enemy also
that's<00:03:46.150> also<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.510> major<00:03:46.750> spawn<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.440> also

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
that's also a major spawn and also

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.680 
that's also a major spawn and also
another<00:03:48.040> thing<00:03:48.160> see<00:03:48.670> these<00:03:48.850> ledges<00:03:49.360> on<00:03:49.570> the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
another thing see these ledges on the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.930 
another thing see these ledges on the
side<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.709> can<00:03:50.860> actually<00:03:51.040> jump<00:03:51.459> over<00:03:51.790> then

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
side you can actually jump over then
