00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.120
 iguana the whole world of anzerw 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.820
 Welcome to a trick in the mode 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.099
 multiplayer of black ops 2 and this trick 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.440
 is to finalize games of 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.209
 multiplayer online game mode 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.130
 deprived of what you want when 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.200
 you want, you can see that it will come out 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.239
 this ruling will let us tell you that 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.419
 we can do it with different streaks myself 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.829
 I do it with the sentry and the missile 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.200
 hairston tell you that you can also 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.790
 taking the sentry do you see big 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.770
 of the triangle and take out the block is it 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.220
 will catch the play to the guy who plays 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.410
 host and we can also do it from other 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.530
 ways it's worth but the most common one is the most 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.780
 easy is this one from the sentry of the missile 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.460
 heston is worth it because it's the easiest of 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.800
 do since in public games is what 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.660
 easier to take out that voucher then what 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.640
 What we have to do is accumulate 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.829
 points of these say you will have in 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.540
 the description as always the trick of 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.860
 how to make infinite points these 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.280
 It's worth it because there are many people who are 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.480
 asking and then when you do 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.220
 we put the sentinel in a corner 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.210
 we do the slap that you will have on the 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.850
 description of how to do it 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.619
 and we take out the missile you see that we 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.200
 we want here and we hope that we are 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.820
 destroy the missile and if you take away the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.180
 heading as you are seeing now you are going to 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.920
 see here I was the host worth what happens 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.450
 that if you are not the host it will cost you 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.460
 more to do the slap, you have to 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.310
 do it very fast and it's going to cost you 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.930
 a little better and here you do not get the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.979
 play and just give us this 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.630
 mistake to everyone will throw the 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.490
 departure but if you do it with him what 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.940
 be going to freeze the matches to 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.649
 the screen to the guy who plays host 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.910
 have worried us because he has 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.289
 gone a lot of times and it has not 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.360
 past nothing to the play is simply the 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.640
 game that to see is not doing very well 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.950
 that to the play but say that I doing 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.820
 these tricks I know makeup many times 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.990
 so tell you not to worry 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.090
 me play is half burst and has not 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.500
 past nothing but tell you that there 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.820
 you what are you going to do with this 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.610
 trick since it does not make me very funny 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.740
 upload it but a lot of people have been 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.909
 asking how is it made worth and more than 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.369
 nothing I bring you because the truth 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.770
 quite curious and the truth is that no 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.290
 This function is operated knew not 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.180
 what I think is adequate but good is 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.769
 another trick that can be done 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.299
 the truth that for me it was not a trick of 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.189
 this because it leads by another was 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.370
 trying and this happened to me and I said this 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.290
 it's not a trick this is that we go that in 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.840
 truth what makes you annoying in the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.700
 good game but there you what 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.989
 do not do this trick and so good 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.400
