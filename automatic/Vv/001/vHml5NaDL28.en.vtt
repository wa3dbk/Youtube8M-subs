00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
has one really really nice lens so let's

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.460 
has one really really nice lens so let's
take<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.279> little<00:00:30.119> tour<00:00:30.390> around<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.929> very<00:00:31.289> nice

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
take a little tour around this very nice

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.840 
take a little tour around this very nice
camera<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.830> very<00:00:32.070> affordable<00:00:32.279> camera<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.820> well

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
camera a very affordable camera as well

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.910 
camera a very affordable camera as well
and<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.840> actually<00:00:33.930> quite<00:00:34.170> versatile<00:00:34.649> and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and it's actually quite versatile and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.500 
and it's actually quite versatile and
that's<00:00:35.070> mostly<00:00:35.430> due<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.030> lens<00:00:36.300> now

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
that's mostly due to the lens now

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.850 
that's mostly due to the lens now
looking<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.380> land<00:00:37.590> right<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:37.710> it's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
looking at this land right here it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.610 
looking at this land right here it's
actually<00:00:37.950> nikon<00:00:38.760> ed<00:00:39.270> glass<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.350> four

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
actually nikon ed glass it's a four

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889 
actually nikon ed glass it's a four
times<00:00:40.860> optical<00:00:41.100> zoom<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.670> actually<00:00:42.000> 27<00:00:42.719> 2

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.750 
108 millimetres 35 millimeter equivalent
that<00:00:46.170> means<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.620> from<00:00:46.829> extremely

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that means you can go from extremely

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.709 
that means you can go from extremely
wide<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.840> extremely<00:00:49.559> zoomed<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:51.210> i'll

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
wide to extremely zoomed in and i'll

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.229 
wide to extremely zoomed in and i'll
have<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.559> little<00:00:52.860> lens<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.760> has<00:00:53.910> four

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
have that on one little lens it has four

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.510 
have that on one little lens it has four
way<00:00:54.449> image<00:00:54.780> stabilization<00:00:55.140> i'll<00:00:55.710> turn<00:00:56.399> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
way image stabilization i'll turn it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.920 
way image stabilization i'll turn it
around<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.059> see<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.360> pointing<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.750> me

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
around here you see it's pointing at me

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.330 
around here you see it's pointing at me
i'm<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.559> put<00:00:58.680> my<00:00:58.710> head<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.070> frame

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
i'm going to put my head in the frame

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.349 
i'm going to put my head in the frame
i'm<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.640> shake<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> camera<00:01:00.030> you're

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
i'm going to shake the camera you're

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.520 
i'm going to shake the camera you're
going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> image<00:01:01.050> doesn't<00:01:01.289> really

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
going to see the image doesn't really

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.049 
going to see the image doesn't really
move<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> screen<00:01:02.340> even<00:01:02.940> though<00:01:03.000> i'm

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
move on the screen even though i'm

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.880 
move on the screen even though i'm
shaking<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> camera<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:04.320> stays<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.739> nice

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
shaking the camera it stays there nice

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.020 
shaking the camera it stays there nice
because<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.100> does<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.339> face<00:01:05.580> detection<00:01:05.610> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
because it does have face detection it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.020 
because it does have face detection it
has<00:01:06.150> four<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:06.990> image<00:01:07.770> stabilization<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
has four way image stabilization now the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.210 
has four way image stabilization now the
first<00:01:09.360> way<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.780> stabilizes<00:01:10.740> your<00:01:10.770> images

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
first way that stabilizes your images

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.770 
first way that stabilizes your images
let's<00:01:11.430> say<00:01:11.490> you're<00:01:11.640> looking<00:01:11.729> inside<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
let's say you're looking inside and the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.990 
let's say you're looking inside and the
sensor<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> right<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.920> well<00:01:14.640> there<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.909> an

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
sensor is right here well there is an

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880 
sensor is right here well there is an
electronic<00:01:15.360> VR<00:01:15.840> stabilization<00:01:16.500> basically

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
electronic VR stabilization basically

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.679 
electronic VR stabilization basically
the<00:01:17.009> camera<00:01:17.310> knows<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.880> shaking<00:01:18.299> it's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the camera knows that it's shaking it's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630 
the camera knows that it's shaking it's
going<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> automatically<00:01:19.500> shift<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> image

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
going to automatically shift the image

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.850 
going to automatically shift the image
inside<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> viewfinder<00:01:21.570> n<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.409> sensor<00:01:22.740> so

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
inside the viewfinder n on the sensor so

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800 
inside the viewfinder n on the sensor so
that<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> does<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.220> shake<00:01:23.700> also<00:01:24.299> has<00:01:24.450> motion

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that it does not shake also has motion

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
that it does not shake also has motion
detection<00:01:25.229> which<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.560> pretty<00:01:25.710> cool<00:01:25.950> let's<00:01:26.700> say

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
detection which is pretty cool let's say

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.550 
detection which is pretty cool let's say
that<00:01:26.909> you're<00:01:27.030> following<00:01:27.409> something<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that you're following something on the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.960 
that you're following something on the
screen<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.100> let's<00:01:29.430> say<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.670> actually

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
screen and let's say it's actually

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030 
screen and let's say it's actually
moving<00:01:30.180> from<00:01:30.420> here<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.770> actually

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
moving from here to here it's actually

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
moving from here to here it's actually
going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> realize<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.579> yes<00:01:32.729> there<00:01:32.939> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
going to realize that yes there is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.819 
going to realize that yes there is
motion<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> screen<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.650> what's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
motion on the screen and it's what's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:35.929 
motion on the screen and it's what's
going<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> increase<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
going to do is going to increase the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.490 
going to do is going to increase the
shutter<00:01:36.090> speed<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.780> going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> crank<00:01:37.350> up

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
shutter speed and it's going to crank up

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.380 
shutter speed and it's going to crank up
the<00:01:37.619> ISO<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.790> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> give<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the ISO and that's going to give you a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.109 
the ISO and that's going to give you a
sharper<00:01:39.930> clearer<00:01:40.259> image<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:41.220> also<00:01:41.369> has<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> very

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
sharper clearer image it also has a very

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.260 
sharper clearer image it also has a very
high<00:01:42.329> ISO<00:01:42.720> 3200<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.130> want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.430> take

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
high ISO 3200 so if you do want to take

really cool setting it's actually in the
menu<00:01:55.920> let's<00:01:56.040> see<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.340> bring<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.700> here

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
menu let's see if I can bring it up here

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.630 
menu let's see if I can bring it up here
it's<00:01:57.719> called<00:01:57.869> BSS<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> best<00:01:59.189> shot

it's called BSS or the best shot
selector<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.509> basically<00:02:00.960> what<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.170> does<00:02:01.500> is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
selector and basically what that does is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
selector and basically what that does is
