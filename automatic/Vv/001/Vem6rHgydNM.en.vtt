 the village heartfields usual of countries 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.920
 This house is a collage of tradition 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.920
 and modern with colorful poppy elements 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 this is where the british architect lives 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.820
 Michael J Purple is his favorite color 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.080
 after all, there is something in the songs as well 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 Great Britain to do 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.609
 Mix the blue white and red 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.500
 national flag only with over 60 he has 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.669
 his own house was designed and built 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.050
 i think for an architect it is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.600
 not only satisfying but also 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 necessary to design your own house 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.500
 because this is my architect and 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.540
 builder at the same time if you so 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.980
 mistake makes you realize that from the beginning 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.629
 on 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.800
 So it's a good teaching architect 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.800
 and to be the builder in one 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.770
 Michael Wilford is one of 100 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.940
 Architects in the book like 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.940
 are portrayed living architects 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.780

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.799

 or john jenks interpretation of the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.660
 concept of the home machine 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.980
 right in the houses they are for themselves 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.520
 designed themselves they realized theirs 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.520
 visions 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.920
 Michael Wilford wanted to get away from London in 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.440
 he built heartfield east sussex in the year 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.750
 2000 for himself and his wife this house 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.840
 Many ideas were made during the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.650
 first designs are now in 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.720
 living area 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.040
 It is the center of the house and 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.980
 at the same time the highest part of the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.619
 building two levels a theme space 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.540
 cozy and cozy in front of the fireplace 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.240
 We used the raised room around this one 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.640
 to insert for an office we call 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.930
 the control room is the bridge from where 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.930
 Everything is controlled in the house 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.000
 Michael Wilford was for decades 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.030
 partner of the british james stirling the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.830
 Died in 1992 as architects of 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.710
 postmodern, they have become international 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.930
 a name made 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.080

 welfare here the stone facade with 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.110
 many colored building objects may not

 manchester a mix of styles inside and out 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.660
 Postmodern was already one of his first

 pioneering wait the new 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.260
 State Gallery in Stuttgart opened in 1984 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.310
 I think the character of the architect 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.890
 the way he builds the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.170
 materials he uses the colors 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.180
 so his house if it planned properly 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.110
 is reflects the personality of 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.110
 architects again 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.900
 You can call it a biography 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.900
 consider 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.099
 Michael Wilford spent a lot of time in 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.110
 the usa and asia the simple 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.480
 The architectural style of his house is the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.489
 Japanese tea houses and the buildings 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.860
 of the american architect frank 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.150
 lloyd wright borrowed in contrast to it 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.830
 colorful elements of the brite has humor 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.959
 The surfaces twisted up 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.440
 Cube have an interesting 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.810
 sculptural forms 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.350
 but because the walls are inclined 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.450
 Can you confuse it one day? 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.400
 So did not drink too much and 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.100
 then walk around here late in the evening 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.180
 otherwise you might think that 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.180
 building collapses 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.480
 For Michael, the whole house is one 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.579
 sculpture, he has consequently 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.579
 all furniture designed by yourself 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.090
 sculptural elements also characterize the 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.890
 outside facade in the entrance area in 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.840
 heartfield has had michael Wohlfarth 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.300
 For over 40 years now 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.300
 finally crowned with his own house 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.960
 a postmodern think for him 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.080
 alone because you can see it from the outside 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.080
 Not
