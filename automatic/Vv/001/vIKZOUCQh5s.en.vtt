00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello this chicken to the page is a chicken 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.189
 Pakistani but an Andalusian chicken and there 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.110
 you have the chicken we will put salt and 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.110
 also a little bit of ground pepper 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.710
 and then we will take it to a casserole 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.869
 with a very hot oil background and 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.910
 there we will refer to it first by 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.189
 one side while cooling down for a 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.980
 Then we will peel a couple of tomatoes 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.250
 that are well mature of good size 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.620
 like that in medium size and what 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.989
 we will remove the skin and once we 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.040
 we have peeled well because we are going to cut it 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:44.260
 sliced neither too thick nor too 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.030
 fine as you are seeing in the picture 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:52.329
 when the chicken is worshiped 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.260
 Well, the moment to give it a spin and 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.260
 brown them on the other 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.340
 once it is golden brown on both sides 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.450
 we will put the tomato slices 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.970
 completely covering 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.320
 and all the chicken as we are seeing in 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.830
 the picture 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.470
 and we will leave it like this completely 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.470
 covered and covered for a few moments 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.100
 while we are frying some 4 teeth of 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.380
 garlic that can be cut here 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.509
 the mine or crush them with this crushes 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.740
 something that I have that is a little 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.780
 complicated but when they are all 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.390
 we will refer them until they are put 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.460
 doraditos that do not burn because 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.250
 then it is a bit bitter but 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.580
 just to brown and when they're 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.840
 golden ones, we throw them in head 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.539
 to the chicken pot 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.490
 and we are distributing them for all 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.340
 parts so that they take a flavor 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.210
 we will add salt and ajÃ­ used 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.729
 like a level teaspoon and we'll put 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.060
 also a little chamomile too 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.789
 you can use white wine for cooking and 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.310
 about 150 grams of water depending on 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.099
 the amount of wine that we add as 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.340
 about 200 grams of liquid will be left 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.879
 cook about 45 minutes and at 45 minutes 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.879
 It is done
