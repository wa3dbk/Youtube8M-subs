00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
and I don't like washing as much because

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.899 
and I don't like washing as much because
it<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.629> washing<00:01:05.140> process<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:08.380> annoying

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it the washing process is just annoying

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.499 
it the washing process is just annoying
because<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.710> very<00:01:11.740> hard<00:01:12.670> floss<00:01:13.119> it<00:01:13.330> now

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
because it's a very hard floss it now

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.740 
because it's a very hard floss it now
and<00:01:14.460> stuff<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.759> you<00:01:15.970> see<00:01:16.180> easier<00:01:16.539> when<00:01:16.720> I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
and stuff and you see easier when I

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.399 
and stuff and you see easier when I
shorter<00:01:17.200> so<00:01:18.960> um<00:01:20.190> well<00:01:21.190> my<00:01:21.340> transfer<00:01:22.020> it'd<00:01:23.020> be

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
shorter so um well my transfer it'd be

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.960 
shorter so um well my transfer it'd be
easier<00:01:23.890> now<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:26.020> way<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:26.170> wash<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.619> now<00:01:26.940> so<00:01:27.940> I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
easier now the way I wash it now so I

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.040 
easier now the way I wash it now so I
don't<00:01:28.270> lose<00:01:28.539> my<00:01:28.600> mind<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:30.490> braid<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.270> into

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
don't lose my mind is I braid it into

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.010 
don't lose my mind is I braid it into
one<00:01:32.530> two<00:01:32.860> three<00:01:33.310> four<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:34.060> then<00:01:34.569> just<00:01:34.780> wash<00:01:34.990> it

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
one two three four and then just wash it

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.499 
one two three four and then just wash it
that<00:01:35.319> way<00:01:35.819> it's<00:01:36.819> easier<00:01:37.810> but<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.299> way<00:01:40.479> to

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
that way it's easier but it's a way to

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.570 
that way it's easier but it's a way to
get<00:01:40.929> there<00:01:41.229> since<00:01:41.679> you<00:01:41.830> have<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:42.130> clear<00:01:42.460> your

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
get there since you have to clear your

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.080 
get there since you have to clear your
hair<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.090> then<00:01:43.149> braid<00:01:44.049> it<00:01:44.259> which<00:01:44.710> is<00:01:44.920> time<00:01:45.759> in

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
hair and then braid it which is time in

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.919 
hair and then braid it which is time in
itself<00:01:46.509> so<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:48.520> people<00:01:48.759> that's<00:01:49.179> been<00:01:49.330> natural

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
itself so for people that's been natural

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.999 
itself so for people that's been natural
for<00:01:49.959> quite<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.830> while<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.780> their<00:01:52.780> hair<00:01:53.079> is
