 multifunction tool 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.350
 so and dml three thousand 4000 but without on 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.130
 power cord 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.910
 lithium-ion battery is used here 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.689
 the battery everything comes here 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.719
 the box 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:41.629
 fairly standard for the company 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.629
 napping down description

 comparative label 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:55.879
 on different models so let's open 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.879
 box see what's inside 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.410
 shipped in such a case 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.860
 case of thick fabric has 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.860
 additional pocket 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:29.979
 made double on double zipper what 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.979
 included in the kit 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.650
 firstly the machine itself 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.100
 as you can see speed control 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.720
 it works from five to thirty thousand 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.250
 turnovers turn on separate 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.170
 switch that is not as napping 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.020
 3000 when 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.950
 switch and speed control together 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.950
 everything is wonderful here 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:12.670
 even there is a battery charge indicator 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.610
 the button of the shaft block we need to change 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.170
 nozzle 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.170
 Well, the literal battery itself 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:33.270
 10 and 8 volt battery one and a half 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.270
 amp hour so here's a small battery 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:46.170
 also included charger 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.170
 for him a very light compact 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.710
 good enough ventilation 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.990
 ie does not have a problem with 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.760
 overheating as it happens often in 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.760
 lithium-ion batteries we all know 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:07.300
 that with powerful enough charging 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:10.510
 It produces a lot of heat for more 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:15.090
 visibility, I laid out the whole set here 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.450
 on the table so it means we have the machine itself 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.620
 battery charger 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.930
 in addition there is such a pen 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.450
 for better hold 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:33.880
 you all saw i show application 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:35.709
 very convenient disk for work projects 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.610
 some that can be done with 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.300
 dremel 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.080
 more detailed instruction in Russian 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.920
 language 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:49.810
 there is also a booklet item description 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:53.380
 Russian is also present and here 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:58.380
 such is the box this equipment 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:01.690
 called andrew 8230 5 items 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:06.350
 Look at the box here. 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:11.040
 everyone already knows 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.400
 two laps of the system will click sleep 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.400
 lay out 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.820
 such a small polishing wheel 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:30.090
 diameter polishing wheels 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:32.280
 large diameter three pieces felted 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:37.800
 polishing rollers large and 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.700
 small diameter goes to them the same paste 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.390
 polishing 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:48.270
 and this holder and sandpaper 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:52.640
 big big diameter is also here 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:56.850
 two types of chicken 120 and 240 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.550
 alumina carbide nozzles 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:04.080
 silicon 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:07.860
 the system clip itself sleeps click so 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.430
 brush to remove any water 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.790
 dust particles 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.810
 no sufficient materials after 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:18.660
 All rough processing is such 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:24.600
 holder for felt circles in the form of 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.400
 self-tapping screw naturally holder for 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:32.960
 laps 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.960
 420 409 here is such a universal drill 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:45.030
 the key for changing nozzles here and here 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.970
 emery circles and here's your grandmother like 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.580
 I'm not talking about round 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:54.660
 emery that's the principle that comes in here 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.240
 such a set than is generally convenient 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.520
 system so that you have no right yes then 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.680
 have you not depend on some 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.180
 electrical network open electrical 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.540
 networks, that is, you can work somewhere on 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.700
 there is no dacha out of light or something else is quite 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.000
 convenient that is, you don't need a flexible shaft from 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.560
 just install this one from the pen and 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.009
 you will already have very good 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.409
 controllability 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.719
 let's say and hold you will not 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:20.559
 interfere with no battery cord missing 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:23.469
 for a long time 

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:24.520
 that is , although it is so small but with 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:26.559
 small power 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.110
 there is enough tool 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:39.110
 for a long time let's turn on listen as 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:41.110
 works 20 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.110
 but 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.819
 but how does the turbine have 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.409
 electric brake that medium and see 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:53.419
 when i turn off instant stop 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:59.240
 that is, well thought out and good enough 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:07:02.020
 done here there is a sign to whom 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.969
 you can look interesting 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.849
 305 this means what is done in the 13th year 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:11.330
 here here and above have it just write 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:15.229
 that in 2013 the tool was made on 5 5 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:17.449
 month made in mexico night is we 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:20.000
 accustomed to that time we shipped from 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:24.169
 mexico all major parts hit 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.710
 additional go from china but here in 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:31.690
 In general, all that I wanted to tell 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:37.039
 the model will remind once again dremel 8200 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:38.960
 grade 35 thanks to the store bektur 

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:42.319
 who gave me this 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.060
 opportunity to tell you this 

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:47.139
 tool 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:48.529
 the bottom of my video in the descriptions will be 

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:51.909
 reference 

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:54.800
