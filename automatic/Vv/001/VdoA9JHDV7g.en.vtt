have<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.649> use<00:01:23.860> sbsettings<00:01:24.700> for<00:01:25.360> this<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:26.469> let's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
have to use sbsettings for this so let's

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.300 
have to use sbsettings for this so let's
exit<00:01:27.729> out<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.880> this<00:01:28.030> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
exit out of this and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.399 
exit out of this and

there<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> bit<00:01:40.020> faster<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.979> open<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.340> this

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
there is a bit faster it's open up this

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.770 
there is a bit faster it's open up this
roster

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
a little too let's actually do maximum

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.010 
a little too let's actually do maximum
10<00:01:53.310> free<00:01:54.310> spring<00:01:57.479> okay<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:58.570> now<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:58.869> is

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
10 free spring okay so now this is

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.780 
10 free spring okay so now this is
maximum<00:01:59.500> so<00:01:59.770> let's<00:02:00.190> see<00:02:00.400> what<00:02:00.430> this<00:02:00.729> looks

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
maximum so let's see what this looks

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.570 
maximum so let's see what this looks
like<00:02:02.040> wow<00:02:03.040> those<00:02:03.310> real<00:02:03.520> fast<00:02:04.259> settings<00:02:05.580> so

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
like wow those real fast settings so

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.889 
like wow those real fast settings so
must<00:02:06.759> against<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.210> can<00:02:07.330> barely<00:02:07.540> see<00:02:07.810> the

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
must against it you can barely see the

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.729 
must against it you can barely see the
animations<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.530> this<00:02:10.620> especially<00:02:11.620> pretty

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
animations to this especially pretty

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.450 
animations to this especially pretty
cool

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
cool

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.550 
cool
okay<00:02:14.270> now<00:02:14.420> let's<00:02:14.450> try<00:02:14.930> let's<00:02:15.650> try<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:18.050> slowest

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
okay now let's try let's try the slowest

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.850 
okay now let's try let's try the slowest
you<00:02:18.710> can<00:02:18.800> get<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.790> quarter<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.770> should<00:02:21.770> be

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
you can get just a quarter and should be

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.000 
you can get just a quarter and should be
like<00:02:22.010> really<00:02:22.190> slow<00:02:23.020> okay<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:24.290> now<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
like really slow okay so now this is the
