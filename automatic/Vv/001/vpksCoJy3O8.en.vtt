00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.870
 hello people to the neighborhood where he 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:20.119
 I had a geek life, and this is the 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.260
 band a usb pad manufactured by the a with the 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.570
 Today 's video is for those who are 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.029
 looking for two things a table 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.619
 scanner and a trackpad is 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.800
 recommended for those who want to quit 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.820
 Use the mouse to work more 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.229
 avoiding the pain caused by 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.089
 by repetition of movements 

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:40.339
 asks the bamboo is compatible with windows and 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:41.449
 mac in my tests she does not need 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.190
 no installation 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.089
 you will not have to worry about 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.089
 download any dae 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.030
 she replaces the mouse can be used 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.030
 both with the pen and with the fingers 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.960
 the body is all plastic with the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.370
 smooth surface that you can notice 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.110
 accumulate a little bit of dust 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.940
 the design of dall'acqua products is 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.670
 always a compliment on the part nÃ© 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.590
 on the bottom you can see that 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.080
 fingerprints are easily 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.950
 marked throughout the darker area but 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.950
 This did not bother me much. 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.270
 with a thickness of 1.5 centimeters 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.180
 to be thinner than the planet is enough 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.830
 lightweight but only 145 grams 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.630
 the collection is necessary to review some 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.119
 things first I found a lot 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.979
 small which hurts a bit 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.470
 footprint during the work routine 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.600
 only one button that can be 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.600
 used as a right mouse button 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.940
 it is so small that it becomes smaller 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.940
 with common pen 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.369
 but thanks to the compact size it is 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.659
 easily transported within the 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.659
 own bamboo asks 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.090
 another positive point is the fact that the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.530
 usb be removable which makes you 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.530
 can change in the future 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.090
 the track pad works great and still 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.340
 recognizes multi-gestures such as the use of 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.030
 two fingers to simulate the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.250
 scrolling mouse 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.550
 here an example of scrolling with the two 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.550
 their 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.090
 and also the gesture of the afinsa to the zoom 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.090
 on the page 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.410
 the two buttons at the bottom help 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:51.190
 so much time to click to drag 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:54.610
 any tim the pen is much simpler 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.160
 and much more intuitive to use gestures with 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.770
 the fingers on the upper left 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.140
 bamboo ped shows a led indicating your 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:08.230
 use blue light to the fingers for 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:10.330
 oranges for pens on monitors 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.430
 using the pen 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.470
 This example is very small. 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.310
 trying to move a file from a monitor 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.040
 to the other without success and we will list 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.260
 the advantages that is what matters is 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.320
 Portable USB Cable Removable Price 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.260
 touchscreen plus buttons and 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.420
 ease of use and the disadvantages is that 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.450
 the candidate is too small a click 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.760
 a few times during use and the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.810
 good service malfunctions with 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.810
 larger monitors 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.080
 The verdict buys bamboo pet if you want 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.300
 an alternative to the apple track pad 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.080
 for designers who uses a counter 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.670
 in this I honestly does not recommend 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.400
 but that's thanks for watching until 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.870
 here and leave a couple is always help if 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.080
 subscribe to the channel if you have not subscribed 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.080
 still and until the next video to
