00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.630 
rather than playing to see what notes on
them<00:00:37.500> or<00:00:37.620> ignore<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> chords<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> right

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
over no it's really simple starts off

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.550
