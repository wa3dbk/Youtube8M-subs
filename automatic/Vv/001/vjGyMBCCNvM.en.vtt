 As such, also red bean paste 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.430
 But I will think whether bad to in that talk you you do not'm'm such a funny game 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.090

 Just a 3-minute Doi with further 15 minutes the first half of the 6 minutes from the runs 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.880
 Muto gets out and takes a goal 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.430
 Although good order and Hiragana is little response to the foul before this it was in chat in reverse 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.170
 But 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.170
 I was out a good path luck the Hiramaku 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.580
 It was good for Tosa timing so I could make a loop ball for a long time, but when I came out I painted it 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.600
 Or 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.600
 To 22 minutes 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.030

 If the card decides its own pk 23 it is 3 to 1 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:00.820
 A game that ended in expecting to end in the US versus this division 3 to 1 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:03.180
 However, in the first half of the 42 piles all stores are expanding the pedal that Mori Heavy defeated the location this time 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.710

 You may have been a bit extra, but it is a big one from the seminar you use 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.960

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.670
 Decide the subscription and pk and the first half ends with 3 to 3 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.670
 5 points for this person 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.980

 I hope it was not belong anymore that various 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.230
 I wrote a system and I made a sound 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.200
 I raised the goal and pushed it up 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.510
 I'm like my star, but this is two times of learning Rokko 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.939
 It will be distributed jointly between It's Aoyama sheet 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.939
 But fc Tokyo think needle lead remained's four times with Kobe device Muto 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.440
 If you come with a hot-water pot varnish planner I feel that belly is really good players loose likely to 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.090

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.680

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.270
 Well I have successfully'll like this so I early anymore 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.530
 I was in polyormana 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.650
 Because I looked at both sides 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.069
 Because 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.370
 33 minutes in the second half 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:18.260

 35 minutes in the second half 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:30.530
 There is a scene that the back of the goal has caught up 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:34.100
 In the end, I struggled with exhaustion and this feat ended in 4 to 4 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.940
 The feeling that I do not want to lose the cod came out heavily 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.080
 Like 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.080
