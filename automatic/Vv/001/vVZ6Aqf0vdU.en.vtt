00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.820 

by<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.600> way<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.050> pin<00:02:16.260> international

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
by the way this is a pin international

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.950 
by the way this is a pin international
30<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.400> one<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.820> first<00:02:18.030> models<00:02:18.450> keep

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
in mind that screws are going to be

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.470 
in mind that screws are going to be
different<00:02:20.490> lengths<00:02:20.760> make<00:02:21.060> sure<00:02:21.210> you<00:02:21.330> know

on<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.650> walls<00:04:52.890> clean<00:04:53.580> out<00:04:53.700> that<00:04:53.730> spring<00:04:54.300> where

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
on the walls clean out that spring where

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.230 
on the walls clean out that spring where
the<00:04:54.570> buttons<00:04:54.900> are<00:04:54.990> located<00:04:55.610> as<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.820> can<00:04:56.970> see

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
the buttons are located as you can see

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.360 
the buttons are located as you can see
this<00:04:57.720> one<00:04:57.930> is<00:04:58.050> pretty<00:04:58.350> good<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:58.950> I<00:04:59.010> just<00:04:59.160> I<00:04:59.340> just

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
this one is pretty good so I just I just

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.550 
this one is pretty good so I just I just
got<00:04:59.760> done<00:04:59.940> doing<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.360> but<00:05:01.140> one<00:05:01.290> of<00:05:01.320> them<00:05:01.470> was

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
got done doing it but one of them was

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.280 
got done doing it but one of them was
locked<00:05:01.800> up<00:05:01.950> when<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.130> started<00:05:03.110> there's<00:05:04.110> your

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
locked up when I started there's your

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.990 
locked up when I started there's your
main<00:05:04.410> bearing<00:05:04.890> don't<00:05:05.370> let<00:05:05.490> grease<00:05:05.700> get<00:05:05.880> in

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
main bearing don't let grease get in

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.670 
main bearing don't let grease get in
there<00:05:06.120> but<00:05:06.360> these<00:05:06.630> are<00:05:06.810> not<00:05:06.930> grease<00:05:07.260> these<00:05:07.560> are

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
there but these are not grease these are

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.700 
there but these are not grease these are
actually<00:05:08.100> they're<00:05:08.850> oil<00:05:09.150> coated<00:05:09.690> they're<00:05:10.500> not

actually they're oil coated they're not
grease<00:05:10.980> pack<00:05:11.250> bearings<00:05:11.780> so<00:05:12.780> they<00:05:12.870> just<00:05:13.050> work

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
grease pack bearings so they just work

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.400 
grease pack bearings so they just work
better<00:05:13.470> but<00:05:14.160> they're<00:05:14.310> very<00:05:14.520> smooth<00:05:14.910> made<00:05:15.810> us<00:05:16.200> a

better but they're very smooth made us a

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
big bearings that they'll probably last

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.680 
big bearings that they'll probably last
forever<00:05:19.800> for<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.280> length<00:05:20.460> of<00:05:20.580> this<00:05:20.640> reel<00:05:20.910> for

in<00:05:24.570> all<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.720> way<00:05:24.890> now<00:05:25.890> you<00:05:25.950> had<00:05:26.100> a<00:05:26.130> quick<00:05:26.370> plate

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
in all the way now you had a quick plate

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.570 
in all the way now you had a quick plate
I'm<00:05:28.260> not<00:05:28.470> going<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.680> go<00:05:28.800> into<00:05:29.010> anything<00:05:29.250> down

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
I'm not going to go into anything down

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.480 
I'm not going to go into anything down
here<00:05:29.640> real<00:05:30.290> complicated<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.980> plate<00:05:32.220> comes

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
here real complicated the plate comes

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.030 
here real complicated the plate comes
off<00:05:32.700> there's<00:05:32.940> nothing<00:05:33.360> under<00:05:33.720> it<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:34.590> just

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
off there's nothing under it you just

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.650 
off there's nothing under it you just
clean<00:05:35.280> up<00:05:35.400> underneath<00:05:35.669> it<00:05:35.880> that's<00:05:36.120> just<00:05:36.210> to

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
clean up underneath it that's just to

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.690 
clean up underneath it that's just to
hold<00:05:36.840> it<00:05:36.960> on<00:05:37.080> and<00:05:37.380> to<00:05:37.500> replace<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:38.040> but<00:05:38.520> your

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
hold it on and to replace it but your

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.680 
hold it on and to replace it but your
shaft<00:05:38.970> can<00:05:39.360> come<00:05:39.600> out<00:05:39.750> now

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
shaft can come out now

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.870 
shaft can come out now
there's<00:05:42.690> your<00:05:42.870> shaft<00:05:43.280> it's<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.370> main<00:05:44.580> shaft

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
there's your shaft it's the main shaft

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.970 
there's your shaft it's the main shaft
remember<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:45.750> longer<00:05:46.110> threads<00:05:46.530> go<00:05:46.710> down<00:05:46.830> to

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
remember the longer threads go down to

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.290 
remember the longer threads go down to
the<00:05:47.070> bottom<00:05:47.400> you<00:05:48.120> have<00:05:48.150> several<00:05:48.900> washers<00:05:49.380> here

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
the bottom you have several washers here

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.409 
the bottom you have several washers here
they<00:05:51.300> go<00:05:51.479> concave<00:05:52.050> to<00:05:52.200> concave<00:05:53.300> it's<00:05:54.300> not

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
they go concave to concave it's not

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.460 
they go concave to concave it's not
really<00:05:54.660> important<00:05:54.990> because<00:05:55.050> they're<00:05:55.260> just

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
really important because they're just

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.350 
really important because they're just
spacers<00:05:55.919> really<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.430> keep<00:05:56.610> keep<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.120> shaft

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
spacers really to keep keep the shaft

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.290 
spacers really to keep keep the shaft
off<00:05:57.690> that<00:05:57.930> bearing<00:05:58.370> and<00:05:59.370> we<00:05:59.400> zoom<00:05:59.820> in<00:06:00.000> here

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
off that bearing and we zoom in here

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.490 
off that bearing and we zoom in here
there's<00:06:03.300> another<00:06:03.630> bearing<00:06:04.020> in<00:06:04.110> there<00:06:04.200> you<00:06:04.380> can

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
there's another bearing in there you can

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.050 
there's another bearing in there you can
take<00:06:04.680> that<00:06:04.830> out<00:06:04.890> this<00:06:05.550> just<00:06:05.729> needs<00:06:05.910> to<00:06:05.970> be

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
take that out this just needs to be

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.090 
take that out this just needs to be
coated<00:06:06.390> with<00:06:06.479> grease<00:06:06.660> again<00:06:07.260> just<00:06:07.650> a<00:06:07.740> just<00:06:07.979> a

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
coated with grease again just a just a

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.500 
coated with grease again just a just a
light<00:06:08.280> coating<00:06:09.620> get<00:06:10.620> some<00:06:10.770> grease<00:06:11.010> and<00:06:11.310> just

light coating get some grease and just

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.680 
light coating get some grease and just
that's<00:06:12.510> all<00:06:12.810> that<00:06:13.050> needs<00:06:13.229> to<00:06:13.320> be<00:06:13.380> done<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.860> that

that's all that needs to be done to that

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.090 
that's all that needs to be done to that
