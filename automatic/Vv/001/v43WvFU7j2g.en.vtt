 sometimes even some criticism of the 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.580
 shoulders for expressing the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.810
 own thought 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.550
 not always one's thought 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.900
 corresponds to absolute truth and that 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.890
 which I try to explain whenever 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.030
 I'm on the air when there are thoughts 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.630
 discordant does not mean that or the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.660
 bad faith or an intent that is related to 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.970
 a wanting to affirm something against 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.360

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.270
 intellectual that I feel mine 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.820
 what is the meaning of the first 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.560
 hammers for a friend's name 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.360

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.730
 infuse that with his passion 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.400

 at a time when there is need here of 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.060
