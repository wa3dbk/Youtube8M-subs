00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
rock 4 has gone off no I I think you see

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.370 
rock 4 has gone off no I I think you see
I<00:01:42.250> think<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.789> risk<00:01:42.969> when<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.750> recession<00:01:44.020> it

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
I think the risk when the recession it

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.199 
I think the risk when the recession it
really<00:01:44.770> starts<00:01:45.069> a<00:01:45.130> hit<00:01:45.280> actually<00:01:45.670> what

00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:46.209 
really starts a hit actually what

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.480 
really starts a hit actually what
happened<00:01:46.479> is<00:01:46.569> that<00:01:46.750> social<00:01:47.619> niceties<00:01:47.770> will<00:01:48.369> go

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
happened is that social niceties will go

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.469 
happened is that social niceties will go
out<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.759> window<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.149> people<00:01:49.359> will

out the window and people will

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.699
