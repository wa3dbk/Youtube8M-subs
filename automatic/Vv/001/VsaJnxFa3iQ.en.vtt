it's<00:01:46.110> very<00:01:46.320> suitable<00:01:46.950> for<00:01:47.220> winter<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
it's very suitable for winter and the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.969 
it's very suitable for winter and the
thing<00:01:48.270> about<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.990> kind<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.320> color<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
thing about this kind of color is you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.280 
thing about this kind of color is you
know<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.759> not<00:01:51.119> prefer<00:01:51.600> blue<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.110> me<00:01:52.259> I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
know that I do not prefer blue on me I

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.540 
know that I do not prefer blue on me I
just<00:01:52.380> don't<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.130> suits<00:01:53.340> my<00:01:53.490> skin

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
just don't think that it suits my skin

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.749 
just don't think that it suits my skin
tone<00:01:53.940> at<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.440> teal<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
tone at all but I like teal because it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.160 
tone at all but I like teal because it
has<00:01:56.909> some<00:01:57.149> green<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.720> so<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.110> just

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
has some green in it so it's not just

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.710 
has some green in it so it's not just
straight<00:01:58.830> blue<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.250> it's<00:01:59.580> a<00:02:00.030> color<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.659> I

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
straight blue it's it's a color that I

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.850 
straight blue it's it's a color that I
can<00:02:00.930> definitely<00:02:01.049> work<00:02:01.320> with<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> think

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
can definitely work with and I think

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.380 
can definitely work with and I think
that<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> actually<00:02:02.250> does<00:02:02.640> flatter<00:02:02.970> my<00:02:03.149> skin

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
that it actually does flatter my skin

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480 
that it actually does flatter my skin
tone<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.990> I'm<00:02:04.080> wearing<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.920> nice

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
tone so I'm wearing it just this nice

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.160 
tone so I'm wearing it just this nice
what<00:02:05.729> information<00:02:06.180> em<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.539> then<00:02:06.869> underneath

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
what information em and then underneath

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.960 
what information em and then underneath
it<00:02:07.440> not<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.070> really<00:02:08.280> important<00:02:08.759> but<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
it not that it's really important but I

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.759 
it not that it's really important but I
am<00:02:09.209> wearing<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.840> kind<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.470> charcoal

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
am wearing a kind of like a charcoal

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.740 
am wearing a kind of like a charcoal
gray<00:02:11.009> cami<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.209> from<00:02:12.360> forever<00:02:12.480> 21

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
gray cami and this is from forever 21

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.720 
gray cami and this is from forever 21
just<00:02:13.290> for<00:02:13.470> some<00:02:13.590> extra<00:02:13.709> warmth<00:02:14.220> because<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:14.640> is

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
just for some extra warmth because it is

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.460 
just for some extra warmth because it is
very<00:02:14.910> cold<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.870> not<00:02:15.989> really<00:02:16.110> important

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
very cold but it's not really important

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.720 
very cold but it's not really important
like<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.680> said<00:02:16.830> because<00:02:17.070> I'm<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.310> covering<00:02:17.459> it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
like I said because I'm just covering it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.340 
like I said because I'm just covering it
the<00:02:18.360> reason<00:02:18.630> why<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> sweater<00:02:19.230> is

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
the reason why I like the sweater is

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.110 
the reason why I like the sweater is
because<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:19.800> very<00:02:19.920> long<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:20.970> wear

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
because it's very long and you can wear

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.180 
because it's very long and you can wear
it<00:02:21.150> with<00:02:21.209> leggings<00:02:21.330> like<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.989> am<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.100> can

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
it with leggings like I am and you can

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.040 
it with leggings like I am and you can
also<00:02:23.310> work<00:02:23.489> without<00:02:23.700> skinny<00:02:24.390> jeans<00:02:24.630> but<00:02:24.930> it

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
also work without skinny jeans but it

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.750 
also work without skinny jeans but it
works<00:02:25.260> with<00:02:25.470> leggings<00:02:25.830> which<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.250> nice<00:02:26.459> and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
works with leggings which is nice and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.490 
works with leggings which is nice and
then<00:02:26.880> on<00:02:27.090> top<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.810> am<00:02:27.989> just<00:02:28.200> wearing

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
then on top of that I am just wearing

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.759 
then on top of that I am just wearing
this<00:02:28.800> charcoal<00:02:29.340> gray<00:02:29.670> sweater<00:02:30.480> from<00:02:30.959> forever

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
this charcoal gray sweater from forever

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.800 
this charcoal gray sweater from forever
21<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.430> really<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.239> because<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.540> think<00:02:33.720> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
21 I really like it because I think it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.110 
21 I really like it because I think it
complements<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.410> teal<00:02:34.680> um<00:02:34.980> but<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.970> basically

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
complements the teal um but it basically

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.090 
complements the teal um but it basically
has<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.720> design<00:02:37.080> going<00:02:37.410> down<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.010> then

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
has this design going down here and then

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.740 
has this design going down here and then
what's<00:02:38.280> interesting<00:02:38.640> about<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.390> in

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
what's interesting about it is that in

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.560 
what's interesting about it is that in
the<00:02:39.930> back<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.500> kind<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.070> curves<00:02:41.489> so<00:02:42.329> it's<00:02:42.480> not

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
the back it kind of curves so it's not

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.690 
the back it kind of curves so it's not
like<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.810> straight<00:02:43.290> sweater<00:02:43.980> or<00:02:44.220> cardigan<00:02:44.370> or

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
like a straight sweater or cardigan or

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.640 
like a straight sweater or cardigan or
anything<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.030> does<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.600> like<00:02:45.720> half<00:02:46.140> circle

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
anything it does this like half circle

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.750 
anything it does this like half circle
things<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> thought<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.250> was<00:02:47.549> just<00:02:47.610> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
things so I thought that was just a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.539 
things so I thought that was just a
really<00:02:48.000> cool<00:02:48.209> thing<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.630> also<00:02:49.070> covers<00:02:50.070> your

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
really cool thing it also covers your

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.670 
really cool thing it also covers your
rear<00:02:51.390> area<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.110> don't<00:02:52.290> need<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.410> worry

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
rear area so you don't need to worry

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.500 
rear area so you don't need to worry
about<00:02:52.860> showing<00:02:53.459> anything<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:54.209> you're<00:02:54.360> wearing

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
about showing anything if you're wearing

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.990 
about showing anything if you're wearing
leggings<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.130> just<00:02:56.370> really<00:02:56.519> nice<00:02:56.730> it's

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
leggings and it's just really nice it's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.150 
leggings and it's just really nice it's
a<00:02:57.150> nice<00:02:57.450> casual<00:02:57.930> piece<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.350> has<00:02:58.530> some<00:02:58.860> slouchy

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
a nice casual piece it has some slouchy

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.640 
a nice casual piece it has some slouchy
pockets<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.940> again<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> just<00:03:01.200> think<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.410> the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
pockets and again I just think that the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.259 
pockets and again I just think that the
color<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.190> really<00:03:02.370> complements<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
color of it really complements the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.120 
color of it really complements the
sweater<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.750> then<00:03:03.989> working<00:03:04.380> our<00:03:04.650> way<00:03:04.680> down<00:03:04.859> I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
sweater and then working our way down I

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.759 
sweater and then working our way down I
actually<00:03:05.519> doubled<00:03:06.329> two<00:03:06.690> pairs<00:03:07.109> of<00:03:07.260> black

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
actually doubled two pairs of black

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.759 
actually doubled two pairs of black
cotton<00:03:08.519> leggings<00:03:09.000> from<00:03:09.209> forever<00:03:09.570> 21<00:03:09.769> reason

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
cotton leggings from forever 21 reason

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.920 
cotton leggings from forever 21 reason
being<00:03:10.799> again<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.700> very<00:03:12.000> cold<00:03:12.299> today<00:03:12.570> but

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
being again it's very cold today but

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.630 
being again it's very cold today but
also<00:03:13.079> just<00:03:13.260> because<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.739> like<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.310> opacity

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
also just because I like the opacity
