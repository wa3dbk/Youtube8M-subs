three<00:01:09.420> options<00:01:09.600> between<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:11.040> kickoff<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
three options between at kickoff and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.240 
three options between at kickoff and
position<00:01:12.630> at<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.900> position<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.979> turn<00:01:14.220> this

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
position at a position if I turn this

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.070 
position at a position if I turn this
off<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.820> disappears<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.479> will<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.780> stuck

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
off that disappears you will just stuck

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.710 
off that disappears you will just stuck
with<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.259> formation<00:01:17.119> even<00:01:18.119> though<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:18.689> I

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
with one formation even though they I

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.870 
with one formation even though they I
automatically<00:01:19.590> will<00:01:19.860> switch<00:01:20.220> between

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
automatically will switch between

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
automatically will switch between
kickoff<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:21.930> what<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.530> position<00:01:22.920> at<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
kickoff at what in position at a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.130 
kickoff at what in position at a
position<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.729> better<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.509> turn<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
position is better off to turn on so you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.590 
position is better off to turn on so you
can<00:01:25.229> customize<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.009> your<00:01:26.100> liking<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.970> let's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
can customize it to your liking so let's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.749 
can customize it to your liking so let's
say<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.350> start<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.710> game<00:01:28.920> at<00:01:29.130> kickoff<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
say when we start a game at kickoff the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.179 
say when we start a game at kickoff the
opponent<00:01:30.210> sees<00:01:30.930> my<00:01:31.140> formation<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.979> this

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
opponent sees my formation is like this

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.330 
opponent sees my formation is like this
but<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.060> want<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> customize<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> am<00:01:35.159> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
but I want to customize it when I am in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.039

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
under attack again we're going to change

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.670 
under attack again we're going to change
the<00:02:31.740> formation<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.820> something<00:02:33.420> very<00:02:33.690> very

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
the formation to something very very

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.370

make<00:03:18.990> tati<00:03:19.380> an<00:03:19.650> amf<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.820> something<00:03:21.180> like

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
make tati an amf this is something like

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.080 
make tati an amf this is something like
for<00:03:21.510> example<00:03:21.570> if<00:03:21.960> you<00:03:22.080> use<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.410> Real<00:03:22.560> Madrid

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
for example if you use on Real Madrid

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.370 
for example if you use on Real Madrid
when<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.240> are<00:03:24.420> on<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.720> ball<00:03:25.050> when<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.350> are

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
when you are on the ball when you are

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.620 
when you are on the ball when you are
start<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.070> match<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.700> can<00:03:26.880> have<00:03:27.030> Benzema

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
start to the match you can have Benzema

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.750 
start to the match you can have Benzema
here<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.110> middle<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.470> when<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.460> are<00:03:29.550> in

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
here in the middle and when you are in

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.820 
here in the middle and when you are in
position<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.330> can<00:03:30.450> pull<00:03:30.630> Ronaldo<00:03:31.050> there<00:03:31.230> so

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
position you can pull Ronaldo there so

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.130 
position you can pull Ronaldo there so
of<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.130> guys<00:03:32.370> man<00:03:32.760> mark<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.180> benzema<00:03:33.690> they

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
of the guys man mark and benzema they

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.930 
of the guys man mark and benzema they
will<00:03:34.350> mess<00:03:34.590> up<00:03:34.620> his<00:03:34.920> defensive<00:03:35.490> it<00:03:35.730> will

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
will mess up his defensive it will

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.270 
will mess up his defensive it will
myself<00:03:36.180> as<00:03:36.420> defense<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.050> most<00:03:37.620> likely<00:03:38.040> if<00:03:38.160> you

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
myself as defense and most likely if you

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.370 
myself as defense and most likely if you
have<00:03:38.430> Ronaldo<00:03:38.880> as<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.000> CF<00:03:39.510> at<00:03:39.750> your<00:03:39.930> kick<00:03:40.170> off

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
have Ronaldo as a CF at your kick off

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.440 
have Ronaldo as a CF at your kick off
the<00:03:40.860> opponent<00:03:41.310> will<00:03:41.460> definitely<00:03:42.030> man<00:03:42.180> mark

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
the opponent will definitely man mark

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.600 
the opponent will definitely man mark
them<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:43.050> this<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.290> something<00:03:43.620> good<00:03:43.980> when<00:03:44.460> you

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
them so this is something good when you

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.460 
them so this is something good when you
are<00:03:44.820> at<00:03:45.060> kickoff<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:46.050> is<00:03:46.200> where<00:03:46.350> your

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
opponent sees and you know at the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.550

formation that video will go through

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.670 
formation that video will go through
fluid<00:04:38.400> formation<00:04:38.940> in<00:04:39.150> more<00:04:39.510> advanced<00:04:39.960> setting

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
fluid formation in more advanced setting
