00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.450 
so here we have it's snowing here this
works<00:01:29.630> for<00:01:29.840> any<00:01:29.960> sign<00:01:30.289> kind<00:01:30.679> of<00:01:30.799> website<00:01:30.979> so

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
works for any sign kind of website so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.669 
works for any sign kind of website so
yeah<00:01:31.789> give<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:32.179> try<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:33.439> can<00:01:33.560> always

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
yeah give it a try and you can always

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.160 
yeah give it a try and you can always
edit<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.159> snowflakes<00:01:34.780> so<00:01:35.780> if<00:01:35.869> I<00:01:35.929> make<00:01:36.140> that

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
edit the snowflakes so if I make that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.739 
edit the snowflakes so if I make that
two<00:01:36.740> hundred<00:01:37.219> I<00:01:38.200> make<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.229> 100<00:01:40.450> more<00:01:41.450> snow

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
two hundred I make that 100 more snow

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:46.770 
two hundred I make that 100 more snow
will<00:01:41.929> fall<00:01:41.960> like<00:01:43.270> so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.950 

and<00:01:46.900> then<00:01:47.650> you<00:01:47.799> can<00:01:47.920> always<00:01:48.220> control<00:01:48.610> like<00:01:49.030> the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
and then you can always control like the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.240 
and then you can always control like the
color<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.830> snowflake<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:51.610> if<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:51.790> made<00:01:51.970> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
color of the snowflake so if I made that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.590 
color of the snowflake so if I made that
hang<00:01:54.250> on<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.820> would<00:02:00.940> see<00:02:01.150> that<00:02:01.180> it<00:02:01.570> changes

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
hang on you would see that it changes

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.460 
hang on you would see that it changes
the<00:02:02.170> color<00:02:02.380> too<00:02:02.680> powerful<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.630> yeah<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.380> can

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
the color too powerful and yeah you can

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.139 
the color too powerful and yeah you can
just<00:02:05.770> mess<00:02:06.100> around<00:02:06.130> with<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.610> features<00:02:07.000> it

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149
