00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:03.909
 I 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.880
 friends of the king welcome to the first of a series of ten tips that prepared 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.989
 to do this the process and make our own work grow and that we have 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:24.539
 called 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.369
 orange tree tips let's start at the beginning you know that it contains stalactite 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.689
 that bernini has been given 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.719
 while putting its seedbed that contains 13 miles of the variety including xix 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.430
 that is to say 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.490
 now we will see the cta 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.560
 inside against the instructions for use we are fine 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.630
 drafted lent his advice look therefore to the pocket 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.320
 our seedbed needs a small tender the bottom so that when 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.150
 what you're saying is the surplus of water falling through it in the 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.460
 lower we have a girl who retires very easily you see 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.950
 and good here we have our insisted 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.090
 you will see that there is a separate filter fair this center serves so that when 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.370
 let's talk about the substrate the building lawyers 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.700
 for more security we will cover the cta 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.090
 to look for the seeds it is important that the seeds are more or less 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.140
 6 a finger under the ground but is likely to open the can by the companies part 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.900
 lower 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.450
 to solve this we will empty it in a soup dish which was three at home 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.860
 It is also important that the seeds germinate inside a nursery 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.320
 like this one in this way they were sheltered from the direct sun as well as 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.960
 of inclement weather and also of weeds that 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.990
 compete with this amount for the nutrients provided by the substrate 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.490
 open to the cta 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.190
 we made 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.710
 we celebrate the filter 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.550
 and look for the seeds 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.610
 At least 25 tractor seeds miralles has found a 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.850
 and is to ask is because 13 miles 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.110
 Seeing all the seeds out by finishing planting at least three 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.230
 comment good chances that our bass grows 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.040
 the substrate that solid matter that inside a container a 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.870
 Seedbed supports the planted seed cultivated 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.220
 novais cobos night fingers like glitter well this species 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.570
 glitter is the berny band-aid 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.929
 but you can use 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.849
 for your affections 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.889
 Well, once the seeds are found, we will reintroduce the substrate 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.259
 in the sector 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.259
 we just arrived the nursery with the substrate 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.869
 we make a hole for each seed 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.749
 they have to be far enough away from each other so they do not 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:29.929
 they compete with each other 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.859
 I chose for example is first 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.089
 the frustration 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:35.779
 we make another 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.439
 peking hole 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.579
 in this 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.209
 and another laptop 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.209
 let's see for example of this 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.209
 the first irrigation has to be sufficiently abundant in water as 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.970
 so that the substrate that has remained completely dry so far 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.829
 optimal summer sewer 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.829
 it is important for the first watering g3 the lid of the bottom 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.129
 so that the voice interspersed here 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.129
 we take a glass of water of 201 thousand liters does not need to take monito 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.419
 like this guy 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.939
 we pour the water very carefully so that the seeds spoil them 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:17.959
 the surplus water 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.889
 face for bottom although it is possible that it depends on the secretariat 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.729
 from the substrate 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.729
 but more or less in this case he faced 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.809
 we let him give us a little more 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.169
 great 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.439
 we cover the tin 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.109
 and wait for it to end 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.329
 Once the first watering is done there are two key words that will accompany us 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.319
 during the first month 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.230
 and temperature 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.330
 It is convenient that during the first weeks of planting the substrate 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.569
 find well moist to facilitate germination 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.889
 for this we will have to water every day with a small coffee talk 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.889
 the optimum would be to put on place where we could see it every day 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.109
 when a month has passed we should have our little 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.579
 fracture of the arch 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:58.479
 and that's it 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.359
 until the next orange council
