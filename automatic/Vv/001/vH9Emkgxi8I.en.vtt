00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:37.340
 then wait forward Mr. 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.340
 Lieutenant arrives is good to let her in 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:54.020
 a day ago you leave us go even from the kitchen 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:06.400
 sorry to see a woman in a chain if 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.440
 were it for me it wouldn't have happened 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.440
 sit either pure 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.660
 this is his 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:31.550
 six hours in a cell never pass yes 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.930
 will ask how it ends 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.040
 she is not curious to know if Luciano 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.040
 inspires his faults 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.780
 balzac knows that without any of his own 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.000
 probably had this novel not 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.290
 would never have been written 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.930
 and you Sardinians gave him a beautiful one 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.140
 rip off the poor honor with the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.270
 concession of the mines and recovery 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.060
 from failure he began to write 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.060
 by the piece he knew 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.849
 certainly the news who knows when they arrive 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:16.140
 here if the smart girl arrives 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.120
 how she is wasted here not lieutenant 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.069
 we waste time on is stop 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.650
 recite acting what it says what 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.700
 I said and if they hadn't brought me in 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.630
 handcuffs don't be sure that ad 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.910
 listen to it if you listen I know that 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.849
 what do you think of me but this situation 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.569
 I didn't want two of them then 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.220
 I'm a soldier, not a cop 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.380
 methods used this night repel me 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.900
 because he comes to tell me he knows I have to 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:53.099
 understand why I really believe her 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:55.670
 you deserve better than this place if you do 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.670
 one finds absurd 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:15.760
 he talks as much about cowardice as he does 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:20.910
 is behaving do not get an idea 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.019
 wrong of me i respect it 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:30.760
 I hope we will have way in the future of 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:37.410
 see us out of here mr 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:40.410
 Lieutenant takes her back to the cell without needles 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.410
 You are welcome
