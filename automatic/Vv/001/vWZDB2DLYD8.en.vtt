00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.410
 well we are here again with 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.200
 today, we are going to make a first 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.500
 dish let's make an installed of 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.050
 white bean for this we need a 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.320
 white bean jar two cans of tuna 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.810
 onion tomato a pepper 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:26.060
 a carrot a piece of red pepper 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.849
 some black olives and oil and salt 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.539
 let's open the broth and we're going 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.539
 to record 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.010
 then we washed our well 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
 white beans have to be washed well 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.690
 because they have the liquid they have there 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.699
 it's like a preservative jelly 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.960
 then that does not interest us to be left 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:51.700
 in the salty and let's go 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.700
 using vegetables now 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.940
 the onion we are in bags always 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.220
 I say that the vegetables are to the taste of 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.050
 each one 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.990
 we do not chop it 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.990
 up to here all 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.590
 and if you do not like onions, I do not know 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590
 with night 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.380
 in its 500 years estaquitas 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.260
 this is a dish your first deal can 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.110
 be seen as a unique dish because as 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:34.290
 Carbohydrates from beans 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.200
 bring the tuna proteins and the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.420
 vitamin of the vegetable as it is very 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.150
 complete then a good plate of this 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.159
 and the one who does not feel like cooking 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.490
 bean 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.999
 until it is a flyer this has the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.999
 food 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.500
 ah 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.800
 plus 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.250
 ah 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.450
 I hold well also to forget a 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.890
 summer salad and also no longer 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.890
 It grows much hot 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:24.790
 of legumes of chickpeas 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.010
 lentils 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.870
 it's better if we have tomatoes that are 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.170
 medium average mature so neither 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.140
 too much products did not have and others 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.780
 now and but if we miss those that 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:11.130
 they are half mature, half is better 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.000
 Well, we miss nothing 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.000
 with their 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.140
 you need a little oil because it is 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:27.580
 how are you going to get out then cc de oliva 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.580
 which do not have much 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.130
 let's take a little salt 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.900
