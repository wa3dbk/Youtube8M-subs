00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770

those<00:03:54.840> messages<00:03:55.320> in<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.540> I've<00:03:57.540> been

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
those messages in it and I've been

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.390 
those messages in it and I've been
saying<00:03:57.990> that<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.140> think<00:03:58.200> people<00:03:58.710> are<00:03:58.860> bullied

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
saying that I think people are bullied

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.310 
saying that I think people are bullied
because<00:03:59.550> they're<00:03:59.880> different<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:01.020> think<00:04:01.050> we

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
because they're different and I think we

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.440 
because they're different and I think we
all<00:04:01.350> strive<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:02.040> be<00:04:02.160> very<00:04:02.370> different<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:03.240> it's

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
all strive to be very different so it's

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.240 
all strive to be very different so it's
probably<00:04:03.660> an<00:04:03.840> act<00:04:03.990> of<00:04:04.110> jealousy<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.160> think

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
probably an act of jealousy so I think

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.250 
probably an act of jealousy so I think

I<00:05:07.350> think<00:05:07.770> it<00:05:08.430> was<00:05:08.550> like<00:05:08.670> if<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.420> know<00:05:09.630> when<00:05:09.990> I

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
I think it was like if you know when I

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.450 
I think it was like if you know when I
started<00:05:10.320> writing<00:05:10.470> it<00:05:10.620> was<00:05:10.770> like<00:05:10.890> if<00:05:11.040> I<00:05:11.190> could

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
started writing it was like if I could

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.030 
started writing it was like if I could
go<00:05:11.610> back<00:05:11.640> and<00:05:12.240> watch<00:05:12.570> a<00:05:12.900> movie<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.500> had<00:05:13.680> every

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
go back and watch a movie that had every

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.010 
go back and watch a movie that had every
element<00:05:14.460> in<00:05:14.700> it<00:05:14.850> that<00:05:15.270> I<00:05:15.330> could<00:05:15.510> possibly<00:05:15.870> want

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
element in it that I could possibly want

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.890 
element in it that I could possibly want
to<00:05:16.170> see<00:05:16.290> I<00:05:16.440> think<00:05:16.680> this<00:05:16.800> would<00:05:16.980> be<00:05:17.010> a<00:05:17.130> let<00:05:17.820> it<00:05:18.240> go

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
to see I think this would be a let it go

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.480 
to see I think this would be a let it go
on<00:05:19.020> yeah<00:05:19.260> when<00:05:19.500> I<00:05:19.530> read<00:05:19.740> that<00:05:19.770> script<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.160> still
