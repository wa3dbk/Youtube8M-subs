00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.069
 yes by sources 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.820
 hello welcome to this section we're going 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.559
 to call a quickie with the chicken and they are 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.390
 quick topics that I want to discuss with 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.419
 you do not give me time to do 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.680
 a full tutorial but this will be the 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:25.539
 first in which I am I think that 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.910
 it's easy to learn to shoot any 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.230
 weapon but you have to have bases 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.670
 solid as you shoot it good you have 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.910
 what to do you have to know several 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.040
 number one things we're going to try to do 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.890
 something with one of the weapons that I just 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.280
 to unlock is the boom as you saw it 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.379
 I have no attachments and what I do 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.500
 every time I go to meet a new 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.440
 weapon is that I evaluate two things the shot 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.160
 from the hip and the compensation that 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.710
 I must do to correct the shot 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.590
 in this case we are going to select this 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.250
 window to pull from the hip 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.750
 a whole burst of the gun and let's see 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.300
 I'm seeing that it has a tendency 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.030
 up and in between, it's more or 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.240
 less favorable now using the sight of 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.750
 iron in the next window I'm going to 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.350
 calculate exactly how much it rises and 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.270
 where 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.830
 has a tendency to rise towards 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.650
 up and to the right that means 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.720
 that I have to correct with the mouse 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.900
 down either a little to the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.880
 left now I have to know how much 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.909
 is the maximum burst before the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.110
 bullets begin to disperse by all 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.600
 sides and this is how I calculate 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.060
 shot a few times until I see 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.399
 that the weapon starts to rise up there 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.100
 finished the next bursts is that is 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.869
 the maximum burst that I can make of 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.789
 shots I can make the belts more 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.080
 short and there's no problem but 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.210
 so that I do not deviate a lot 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.590
 shot has to be maximum like those 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.509
 four bursts that I just shot 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.060
 applying that knowledge and 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.640
 correction with the mouse I get a shot 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.210
 focused on a certain area that is 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.690
 make 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.140
 let's try it on some map to see 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.140
 how we will 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.340
 let's see who found us fucking not 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.340
 I saw it 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.220
 a little bit of discipline works 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.260
 fairly good 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.390
 they are suppressing us we have to recover 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.390
 those 75 points that we have less 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.550
 very well very well extend a little bit more 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.879
 well short bursts worked very 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:44.670
 well at that distance and around here 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:47.730
 if there is something interesting there is 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.819
 and I did not expect that but it worked very 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.819
 all right 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.790
 ok we are going to appear and this discipline the 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.070
 same the same burst we did in the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.740
 window is what worked for us there 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:08.230
 is another very well that 's how it works 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.200
 ok let's find another 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:17.240
 s already hit a few 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.460
 sometimes we try in 86 2 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.560
 I'm seeing that the shot to the hip is 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.820
 good is very good against the hip what 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.820
 that you have in the center will be fine 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.400
 let's climb a little bit above 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.900
 the right also the burst is short 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.670
 here he calculated it 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.640
 doing a measurement 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.530
 and I think it's good short distance and 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.220
 continue the short distance race 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.430
 let's see 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.740
 predictable very well it worked well for us 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.000
 this was quite comfortable 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.060
 to that wretch 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.489
 it worked 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.400
 and I with iron sights works 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.250
 pretty good are 2 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.650
 perfect the burst is correct and so is 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:10.540
 how it is handled is 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.660
 let's see what he threw the hip yes here 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:19.640
 is 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.640
 correct as we said 2003 north 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.460
 but something desperate like a little bit of 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:31.210
 trauma but we accomplished the task ok 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:35.080
 I'm going to ask you to 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.199
 in the next weapon that we are going to review 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.159
 what is this or not here against three not 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.319
 just impossible 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.139
 only to me it occurs to me but still 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.810
 look here I already knew this weapon I know 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.849
 where he threw and all that he listens to 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.740
 bursts hears the bursts right now with 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:53.340
 the iron look just ask you 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.139
 listen to these three deaths 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.210
 tac tac tac 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.210
 well let's go with the next wretch 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.480
 I 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.480
 that there was a little bit of 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.529
 the next 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.319
 miserable front dies 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:16.359
 very well what people do not know is that 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.579
 if you already control the burst with the look 

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:19.779
 iron these skills after 

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:22.540
 superimpose on the sights 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:24.310
 she is a point sight 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.970
 but I do not pay attention to you having a 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.730
 mine of 3.4 a look of 4 x you have to 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:34.450
 shoot exactly the same the only 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.950
 difference that you are going to have is that you 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.890
 will move the whole screen and you can 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.990
 out of control and that's what I eat 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.000
 confuse a little but if you already dominate 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.310
 the blast in your iron mine or in the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.580
 look at point in the larger sights 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.040
 is exactly the same look for example 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.700
 in this one that follows 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.160
 watch and listen 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.350
 it is exactly the same if it moves 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.810
 much the screen I do not have any 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.580
 extra attachment of climbing the sight of 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.220
 4x 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.610
 the alien prevented them but listens 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.289
 listen and it's exactly the same 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.439
 that's how you shoot any weapon 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:16.139
 can be very less those of king with is 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:18.689
 that's a bit more complicated but now 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.490
 I cover it in later but they observe 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.409
 check especially on this one that comes 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:27.199
 so you can see the right amount of 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.199
 shots that I gave him and how to call 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.130
 ready he died then that's how you know 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:38.400
 your weapon this is how to evaluate the bursts 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:40.979
 and that's how you get used to 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.169
 to shoot a new weapon that's how the 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:44.729
 you know this you have to do it in a 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.430
 separate map as it can be in the 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.530
 Same map only do not get frustrated ok 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.770
 remember you are going to use short bursts 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.960
 but shorter than what you get 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.410
 allows the weapon as you have calculated to 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.440
 the long ok I say goodbye to you I'm the 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.800
 chicken and see you in the next 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.800
 quick with me
