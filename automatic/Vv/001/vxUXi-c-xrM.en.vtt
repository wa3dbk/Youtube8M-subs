00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.139
 Greetings from the enjoyment zone we 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.710
 make a cauliflower ham today 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.570
 Degree 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.250
 We have the following things for you 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:27.210
 have his cauliflower festo 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:32.420
 chilli powder cheese circle circle ham 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:36.650
 saitsewa first brush the angle 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.650
 dashing and the beach a bit 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.340
 and then we cut that in one 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.340
 round off 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.210
 Let's solve the buns 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.079
 afterwards we cut the bottom 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.970
 strand 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:19.140
 just that was so small little pieces 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.490
 I have flowers after cleaning flowers 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.490
 here now a pot with boiling 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.840
 salt water and there I give the rhine 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.720
 because we made the boom so pretty small 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.720
 he is finished emily minute as well 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.970
 while the cauliflower comes we can 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.820
 get our cards ready 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.420
 I'll put the cream in a container for that 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.420
 add the eggs 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:32.459
 and that facebook and once vigorously too 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.420
 if that is ready we can 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.570
 the open airs ever to 180 degrees 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.570
 preheat 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:09.180
 cooked in the project it recognizes 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.180
 because it is relatively soft 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.800
 then we let it drain well 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.130
 a foam trowel and against in the 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.130
 selection 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.130
 alternatively, you can of course also be a 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.120
 take effect in the concordat 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.120
 expire 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.860
 Now we go our ham 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.860
 it 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.160
 the price 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.490
 and season the whole thing 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.400
 and the paprika powder 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.110
 now the whole thing once 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:55.150
 now only our rating mass comes 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.150
 distribute it nicely evenly over it 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:09.810
 This is the ideal and special 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.810
 Cheese things always over it 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.250
 in the infobox it says that we are about 150 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.260
 up to 200 grams of cheese 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.330
 it all depends on how tall or 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.070
 how wide our casserole is when 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.410
 is a bit higher and not quite so 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.250
 Of course we need a broad one 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.250
 correspondingly less cheese woman 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.689
 and now it's baked at 180 Â° 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.540
 st 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:59.590
 so after 25 are now like 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.050
 yesterday 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.909
 if you want, of course you can see the 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.360
 make cheese a bit darker 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:08.220
 to let 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.220
 but I want us to eat
