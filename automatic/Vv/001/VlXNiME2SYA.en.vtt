00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
plugged into the wall taking a look down

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.270 
plugged into the wall taking a look down
here<00:01:16.360> it's<00:01:16.720> just<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.930> standard<00:01:17.230> USB<00:01:17.380> right<00:01:18.100> here

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
here it's just a standard USB right here

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.210 
here it's just a standard USB right here
on<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:18.460> end<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:19.510> it's<00:01:19.960> kind<00:01:20.290> of<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.440> flexible<00:01:20.980> I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
on the end so it's kind of a flexible I

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.630 
on the end so it's kind of a flexible I
guess<00:01:21.820> this<00:01:22.000> part<00:01:22.270> pulls<00:01:22.510> out<00:01:22.720> like<00:01:23.020> that<00:01:23.230> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
guess this part pulls out like that and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.450 
guess this part pulls out like that and
to<00:01:24.640> only<00:01:24.790> two<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.180> half<00:01:25.360> millimeters<00:01:25.930> thick

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
to only two and a half millimeters thick

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.530 
to only two and a half millimeters thick
so<00:01:27.460> it's<00:01:27.610> going<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:27.820> be<00:01:27.880> about<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.180> size<00:01:28.330> of<00:01:28.450> a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
so it's going to be about the size of a

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.880 
so it's going to be about the size of a
credit<00:01:28.660> card<00:01:29.020> which<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.200> pretty<00:01:29.410> awesome<00:01:29.530> to

credit card which is pretty awesome to

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
into it here there we go pretty easy it

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.690 
into it here there we go pretty easy it
