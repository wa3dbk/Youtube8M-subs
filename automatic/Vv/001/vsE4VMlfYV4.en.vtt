00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.890
 side the people this time we are going to 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:15.700
 be today for the game day 5 610 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:18.960
 and this is version 4.2 10.24 light 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.850
 and it's the last and not the last 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.010
 They took out for 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.560
 this terminal 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.350
 this rice compared to other 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.920
 previous is very fluid 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.609
 and it changes a lot visually 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.609
 good 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.300
 This rum I liked very much its appearance 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.360
 and let's check the 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.300
 and then analyzable when it is more 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.900
 easy to be an option that brings to 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.980
 download the free themes 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.820
 we do not want 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.820
 and multitasking 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.460
 and good interesting things about this rom 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.600
 the first is 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.600
 already comes surrounded 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.820
 has root permissions as we can see 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.820
 here only any salary are not activated 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:28.220
 another thing brings the cleaner by default 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.240
 so that never clean master other 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.240
 cleaner also serves well 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.990
 good antivirus I do not know if I used 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.159
 this data at the beginning when there 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:51.619
 used was to say if you want 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:55.250
 manage how many data and the limit of 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.920
 data that does not want to exceed t and good 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.740
 another thing is that it's not right I do not know if 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.130
 they knew but the previous streams did not 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.329
 they could be installed expos to alter 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.329
 scale modules 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.980
 the modification of the system 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.720
 well this rom also brings default 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.720
 an application for this 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.560
 here is called w tools only what 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.260
 they install it activate and ready good here 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.930
 he would also teach us at once is a 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.520
 module of this application is called 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.810
 maitÃ©n 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.849
 they activate it already brings it by default 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.540
 with this module you will get to download 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.540
 free themes 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.980
 as for example here 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.980
 the first says 6 my credits 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.260
 and as we see here it tells us it gives us the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.260
 option to download without paying 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.690
 they download them and apply them 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.500
 many themes to be 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.500
 by the state 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.290
 camera application 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.290
 the application 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.579
 and if it's very good 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.579
 but there are different settings 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.450
 is very good 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.999
 application 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.430
 three applications of the rom very very 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:37.969
 pretty 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.969

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.439
