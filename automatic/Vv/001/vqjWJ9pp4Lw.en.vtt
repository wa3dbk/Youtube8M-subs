that seem to be able to do three or four

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.890 
that seem to be able to do three or four
things<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.820> once<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.360> doesn't<00:01:21.630> seem<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
things at once and it doesn't seem to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
things at once and it doesn't seem to
worry<00:01:22.259> me<00:01:22.439> too<00:01:22.619> much<00:01:26.299> relaxing<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.610> suppose

worry me too much relaxing is I suppose

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.460 
worry me too much relaxing is I suppose
it's<00:01:29.850> probably<00:01:30.240> more<00:01:30.450> difficult<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
it's probably more difficult if you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
it's probably more difficult if you
would<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.340> sort<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.820> lifestyle<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
would be with that sort of lifestyle I

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.730 
would be with that sort of lifestyle I
happen<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.689> would<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.049> normal<00:01:34.350> people<00:01:34.650> but

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
happen it would be for normal people but

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.560 
happen it would be for normal people but
what<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:34.979> consider<00:01:35.520> relaxation<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.420> other

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
what I consider relaxation to other

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.679 
what I consider relaxation to other
people<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.049> probably<00:01:37.409> not<00:01:37.619> relaxing<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:39.030> me

observed seen his workshops he's good
and<00:03:45.660> we've<00:03:46.660> made<00:03:46.930> an<00:03:47.110> extra<00:03:47.440> effort<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.770> try

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
and we've made an extra effort to try

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.220 
and we've made an extra effort to try
and<00:03:48.010> counteract<00:03:48.520> that<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:49.330> try<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:49.600> combat<00:03:50.050> it

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
and counteract that to try and combat it

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.370 
and counteract that to try and combat it
so<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.620> in<00:03:50.740> fact<00:03:51.810> we're<00:03:52.810> at<00:03:52.930> least<00:03:53.200> as

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
so that in fact we're at least as

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.340 
so that in fact we're at least as
competitive<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.550> think<00:03:54.910> as<00:03:55.720> well<00:03:56.020> set<00:03:56.320> up

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
competitive and I think as well set up

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.810 
competitive and I think as well set up
logistically<00:03:57.100> and<00:03:59.370> yeah<00:04:00.370> there's<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.610> lot<00:04:00.760> of

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
logistically and yeah there's a lot of

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.030 
logistically and yeah there's a lot of
effort<00:04:01.510> this<00:04:01.630> year<00:04:01.690> from<00:04:01.990> BMW<00:04:02.620> for<00:04:02.770> instance

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
effort this year from BMW for instance

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.620 
effort this year from BMW for instance
to<00:04:03.190> see<00:04:03.370> it's<00:04:03.520> not<00:04:03.700> from<00:04:03.880> their<00:04:04.000> perchon<00:04:04.420> but

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
to see it's not from their perchon but

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.690 
to see it's not from their perchon but
that's<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.290> chance<00:04:05.320> we're<00:04:05.770> responding<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.430> and

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
that's a chance we're responding to and

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.670 
that's a chance we're responding to and
I<00:04:07.600> can<00:04:07.960> be<00:04:08.110> political

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.620 

do<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.310> job<00:04:11.579> two-hitter<00:04:12.239> Brock<00:04:12.510> had<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.200> great
