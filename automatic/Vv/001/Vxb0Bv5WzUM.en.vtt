00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 there's everybody these will have 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.029
 yet judged for a new video 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.660
 so you saw it in the title it's going 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.980
 to be a little bit of a special technique 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.420
 since we 're going to go to the bank first 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.269
 first we find ourselves on sale 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
 so it's a little known technique for 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.100
 the moment has taken I think she's going to 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.560
 spill 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.029
 with the arrival of the 1.9 no province 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 louis xii la 2.29 yes that's it and that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.029
 walk with the flours so if you 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.990
 have old flour so the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.160
 flours of one for example fish 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.020
 empty is empty and we will take by 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.210
 example we take several since 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.050
 I already have to enter the stuff for 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 show you well 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.489
 and it works also with the boards is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.610
 I still have old ones 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.520
 planks boards of friends the boys 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.510
 boards of fresnes for example and the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.699
 meat is what I have obvious 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.620
 preserved against no I have rather well 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.910
 to keep unfortunately good it takes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.199
 know that people keep then 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.199
 it gives back directly 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.900
 the cooked meat actually 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 for example if you have square of 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.340
 pork for example that will make you a 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.240
 faycal downright want more but it's going 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.790
 to make you there the meat that is that already 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.740
 that we had already cooked we will say 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.030
 for others it's otherwise by 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.010
 example for the boards of fresnes 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.140
 know you give back the old kraft by 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.450
 example it makes for a board that you 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.250
 gives and vinvin ash wood for them 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.990
 bottom fish is the same except that it's okay 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.550
 give you back that normal re re blues 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.530
 and for flours it's something else 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.560
 flour milk flour when you click 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.110
 tasty gives twice the flax finally 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.080
 twice, it was she who had for 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.430
 kraft as for ash wood and 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.420
 for boards in general have 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.280
 loosely pop a little bit but that's 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.440
 no problem we do not care so here we go 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.970
 it was just to tell you that I 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.790
 did not know you're tweeting 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.200
 hebinger not there is not any case twitter from 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.630
 blow bah I can not warn you and 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.429
 you make a little video like that 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.020
 could it help you to 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.550
 to save money 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.740
 seen that sometimes the flours where the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.420
 boards cost less the ends the 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.920
 old boards cost that late damon 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.080
 surely know it starts at 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.000
 go up because because obviously 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.770
 people understand this trick but 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.090
 on your server if the person who to 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.440
 this tip and 20 the boards you 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.050
 cost that slab since people are you 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.060
 the sale but more useless and where 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.420
 tried to redeem the pawns the the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.120
 boards 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.530
 yes I do not know how to talk anymore guys 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.810
 the holidays I know more about it there 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.120
 well, finally, I'm going back to 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.930
 talk about all this all about staying in 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.400
 my corner to farm the kamas so that's it 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.860
 walk with all the fish every 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.620
 boards all the flours except the 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.190
 news obviously what is a 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.910
 new flavor 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.550
 yeah, we'll test 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.470
 trace the flours that I did so 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:59.140
 his survival flours is what it is 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.860
 Can we use it is what 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.700
 we can use them 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.860
 no it does not show us there we can 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.540
 we can use but there not by 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.640
 example of seeing the new flour on 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.930
 can not it is that the old ones since 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.670
 no use it's a little bit 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.760
 logical but hey that's all we have 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.640
 tested I hope the video will help you 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.640
 to you or to save kamau 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.620
 in any case and we find ourselves down under 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.689
 little since it is the no it on this 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.060
 video announces my return on videos 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:31.120
 show on lives less than 200 which 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.480
 will arrive soon since we are at 114% and 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.510
 this is so thank you little dedication to a 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.269
 warrior off ski to heal and drag queen 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.450
 and who helped me equipped up 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.120
 so far so big thanks to them in all 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.379
 case and we end up in two 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.560
 days as usual 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.730
