00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:09.979
 tel 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.050
 good afternoon 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.660
 to study with the correct posture the 'teacher' of physiotherapy created the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.870
 ergonomics portfolio than the country's experience is already being 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.170
 been successfully tested is it not that in Rio de Janeiro the portfolio will be 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.180
 both for students with disabilities and those who form a hundred 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.180
 wrong and end up with spinal problems 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.890
 afp 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.530
 without the economic portfolio and outside the country was created four years ago 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.060
 I did not know who I was also supposed to 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.660
 the idea arose because of his concern about the posture 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.130
 of the students during class 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.790
 in the whole public network of education in the silas river is a copy of the letter 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.829
 is carried out by the student 'sabrina vasconcellos 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.299
 much improved on the issue and yes 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.420
 impresses in the column the behavior 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.590
 still one of those and still bad 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.830
 the chair on the desk set the student's personal wallet in front of the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.150
 right way 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.600
 for francisco miguel the right attitude for this walk for learning 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.240
 of the student when I came here my concern was to identify 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.240
 adolescents with scoliosis 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.920
 this project aims at whether it was whether children reduce the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.900
 scoliosis due to poor posture 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.860
 that they stay in the chair that was already 4 to 5 hours sitting in the same position 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.840
 wrongly 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.900
 and with this here 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.210
 by having our stance in which they do wrong training 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.160
 putting pressure 60 days a year 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.920
 then you are called squatting explored sliding in the chair all 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.990
 and you can imagine that the price always stays in a 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.310
 corrects the posture but the chair does not help with the idea of ​​the pain of the project 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.439
 they now get sponsorship from companies that want to contribute to the 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.109
 more workers and hopes that in the long run 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.079
 all public school students 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.049
 with or without disabilities are benefited and use the 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.909
 the idea is to get in touch with 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:14.010
 and state-owned petrochemicals as a bank in Brazil, so that we 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.079
 possibilitem was a gift and hence the first step for those who know everything 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.639
 schools have the tables and chairs and shivers we will keep these tables and 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.049
 chairs and it's no use we just develop the project because in 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.639
 benefit of them 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.369
 why today you do not perceive evil, but tomorrow you will surely realize
