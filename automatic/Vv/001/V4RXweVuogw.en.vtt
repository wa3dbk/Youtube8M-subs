00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 but the final decision to speak to them 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 to see is not so clamorous is difficult to 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.639
 see the first pressure that this has on 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.760
 see which is macho I the first 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.260
 impression is that outside I leave 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.120
 I do not think the appetite looks pretty 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.580
 well yes it is true that the line that puts 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.440
 here the English is a little fat and that 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.440
 it seems like they are stones 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.570
 this line is a line it seems that 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.290
 we are giving journalism lessons 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.290
 all television 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.190
 just point one thing that to leave it 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.769
 of course if you can put the image through 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.050
 of the play but since there is one that is 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.549
 good but the same mind but that of the 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.350
 of the English and has left I think 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:58.850
 that they catch they take the I want to make clear 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.170
 that they take the foot of the player this that 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.180
 you see here that the image to the best 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.220
 can be seen to be misjudged but there is a 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.220
 standing here that sticks out I think it looks 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:23.780
 but I say it more than anything to leave it 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.400
 clear that the player before before 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.350
 receive already comes from the game stone that 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.270
 it is still more ostensible that is because 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.980
 it is no longer only when you receive that you can 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.510
 be offside but it is that it is 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.750
 coming out of the game you are 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.750
 coming 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.250
 the player and receive these people coming 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.070
 well once this is clear what 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.560
 we are going to do is what we always go to 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.210
 take the field lines let's take out 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.500
 the vanishing point and 30 by god who does not 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.770
 be out of the game because they're going to 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.020
 accuse you'll see how it goes day 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.790
 of silence the numbers are not understood 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.380
 8 nacho silence breathe let's go 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.730
 to catch we have here the vanishing point 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.989
 we take with the field lines what 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.850
 we always do the next thing we're going to 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.040
 do 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.080
 choose the references well on the one hand 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.170
 let's take this foot that we said 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.750
 before and then the month's foot and we have 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.740
 even this time we have even caught the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.770
 shoulder but we see that the shoulder falls 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.790
 much behind the foot whereby 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.770
 we remove the shoulder but then later 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.540
 we left because it's because I thought that 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.840
 It was a subway but is now as it says 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.680
 nacho one the 10 sentinel for is almost 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.680
 it's almost a thousand 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.880
 I have done the truth I have done all kinds 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.650
 of estimates I've already taken them even 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.720
 the three defenders left almost half a meter 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.630
 but it is true that the foot 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.610
 this is the key and then well if 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.640
 we join the foot with the vanishing point we 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.760
 give this line that we see that is this 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.500
 blue line fine and if we now take the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.080
 foot of month and that is the most 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.850
 delayed more advanced forgiveness and what 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.710
 unimos gives us this red line 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:11.920
 it is effectively out of play 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:14.830
 now let's know for how much good 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.710
 if we measure what Damian said 332 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.010
 meters 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.080
 I studied geometry let's not say 32 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.970
 centimeters seems more in the forum about 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.970
 the frozen shot seemed more like
