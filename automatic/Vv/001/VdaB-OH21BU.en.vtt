00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:09.190
 it comes out like making a cheap logo how 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.410
 make a good economic logo even 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.360
 if you do not have a great company even 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.950
 it's just a little blog or a 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.530
 small channel on youtube 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.720
 or a small project on the internet is 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.869
 important that you have a logo because 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.640
 the logo will give you identity and 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.430
 supposed to design a logo has 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.340
 two options to design yourself or 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.790
 hire someone to get me 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.560
 you decide to design the logo yourself 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.010
 you need at least two things one is 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.230
 one program to be able to design and the other 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.780
 is to have the talent to be able to do it 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.780
 the disadvantage is that the programs 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.489
 They are usually very expensive that costs you 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.320
 around $ 100 a program 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.629
 decent so you can do so that 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.940
 you can make a logo and also 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.040
 obviously not everyone has the talent 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.440
 to make prototypes is something that you have 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.130
 we learn to do and we will make people 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.080
 which we are not interested in learning 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.210
 and we do not have the talent to do it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.520
 so in this case you have to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.950
 resort to the second option that is 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.680
 hire someone to design your 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.540
 logo on the internet there are many 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.150
 companies that are dedicated to design 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.460
 logos if you put in google design 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.010
 logos you will see many pages 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.110
 of internet and many ads 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.810
 people or companies that are dedicated to 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.330
 to make logos the disadvantage is that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.360
 cheaper because there are a lot more 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.540
 faces for the cheapest ones that charge 50 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.820
 dollars for creating a logo 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.470
 I think 50 dollars is a fortune to 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.540
 those who only have a small 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.600
 blog or have a little burn to the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.130
 youtube and generally you are also 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.830
 companies ask you to pay for 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.660
 advance what they have what they have 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.440
 the distrust that that company has 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.170
 I was not going to take your money 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.390
 but if you want someone to design the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.400
 logo for you do not want to pay 50 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.260
 dollars and you also want it to be a 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.690
 sure form of payment is to say that you do not 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.450
 go to this part then what do you 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.060
 I recommend that you treat a zealand in 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.650
 the lancer tweet page for those who 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.720
 they do not know a freelance is a 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.430
 free professional is to say a 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.800
 professional who does not work in a large 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.380
 company but it works for supposed 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.180
 account many times they work from 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.970
 their houses which means that the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.430
 costs are very very very low 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.440
 for example I sent a few months ago 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.040
 makes a logo 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.080
 and it cost me only 10 dollars and also 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.300
 the logo was delivered to me in question 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.270
 of hours in two or three hours I was already 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.010
 ready my motive and also those ten 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.070
 dollars paid until after 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.130
 they gave me the job that is to say 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.230
 nobody asked me for an advance then if 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.360
 you want to tell even if the cndh either 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.400
 to design a logo design a 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.630
 cover of a book or for you to do 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.690
 an internet page 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.490
 to do whatever you need 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.440
 I recommend you watch this video this 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.840
 is a small tutorial in which he explained 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.850
 how can you do it to hire 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.130
 a freelance is a video where 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.160
 I explain step by step and with luxury 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.510
 detail so if you're interested do not tell 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.830
 lose that's all 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.830
 we are seeing goodbye
