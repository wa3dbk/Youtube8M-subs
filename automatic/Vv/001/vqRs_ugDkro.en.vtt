well<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.650> panel<00:00:25.950> is<00:00:26.039> basically<00:00:26.779> made<00:00:27.779> out<00:00:27.810> of

popkins<00:00:45.799> modified<00:00:46.799> in<00:00:46.920> such<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> way<00:00:47.339> it<00:00:47.400> is<00:00:47.549> to

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
popkins modified in such a way it is to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.430 
popkins modified in such a way it is to
cause<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> air<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> spin<00:00:48.839> through<00:00:49.080> them<00:00:49.290> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
cause the air to spin through them and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.649 
cause the air to spin through them and
so<00:00:50.159> centrifugal<00:00:50.580> force<00:00:50.940> comes<00:00:51.150> into<00:00:51.330> play<00:00:51.510> and

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
so centrifugal force comes into play and

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.030 
so centrifugal force comes into play and
it<00:00:51.750> sort<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.019> separates<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.710> relatively
