 bride to your wife I'm going to make a 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.600
 recipe that will open the door of 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.090
 Happiness, I 'll never say that again. 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.650
 You're a bastard, a hobo. 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.780

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.330
 This is a family here. 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.309
 let's get a piece of fillet 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.500
 mignon with mushrooms thorn 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.500
 Myth red wine to follow in here. 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.260
 is an entire piece of lion 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.180
 because it is cheaper to buy the part 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.190
 piece has between a pound and a half two 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.159
 Pounds we will only use one that is more 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.659
 or less to each other than 45 people and 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.310
 the rest you can use for another 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.290
 recipe but I know buying the piece 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.120
 it's cheaper than buying only you 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.990
 Are you going to use us? 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.210
 the head and tail of the filet mignon and go 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.799
 leaving out will only use this 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:26.509
 part of the middle 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:28.100
