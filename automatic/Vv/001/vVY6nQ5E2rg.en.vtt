00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
hello today I'd like to show you another

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.090 
hello today I'd like to show you another
idea<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.930> something<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.469> might<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:13.680> to<00:00:13.860> do

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
idea of something you might like to do

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.289 
idea of something you might like to do
with<00:00:14.250> some<00:00:14.400> five<00:00:14.610> inch<00:00:14.820> squares

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
with some five inch squares

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.780 
with some five inch squares
so<00:00:15.990> I've<00:00:16.139> done<00:00:16.290> a<00:00:16.350> pattern<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.189> I've

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
so I've done a pattern here that I've

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.330 
so I've done a pattern here that I've
called<00:00:18.090> two<00:00:18.270> colors<00:00:18.630> because<00:00:19.290> I<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:19.950> made<00:00:20.130> it

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
called two colors because I have made it

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.010 
called two colors because I have made it
in<00:00:20.520> two<00:00:20.730> colors<00:00:20.759> well<00:00:21.300> strictly<00:00:21.900> speaking

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
in two colors well strictly speaking

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.690 
in two colors well strictly speaking
black<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.680> white<00:00:22.770> aren't<00:00:22.950> colors<00:00:23.279> apparently

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
black and white aren't colors apparently

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.000 
black and white aren't colors apparently
but<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.750> pattern<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.259> shown<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.710> black

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
but on the pattern it's shown in black

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.070 
but on the pattern it's shown in black
and<00:00:26.160> white<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.910> I've<00:00:27.060> also<00:00:27.270> made<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.900> some

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
and white but I've also made it in some

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.109 
and white but I've also made it in some
other<00:00:28.230> colors<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.859> I'm<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.760> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.939> show

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
other colors and I'm just going to show

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.240 
other colors and I'm just going to show
you<00:00:30.180> today<00:00:30.359> not<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.810> much<00:00:30.990> two<00:00:31.199> colors<00:00:31.560> but

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
you today not so much two colors but

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.860 
you today not so much two colors but
I've<00:00:32.369> used<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:32.940> fabric<00:00:33.239> constantly

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
I've used one fabric constantly

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.170 
I've used one fabric constantly
throughout<00:00:34.230> which<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.220> this<00:00:35.550> dot<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.820> I've

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
throughout which is this dot that I've

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.170 
throughout which is this dot that I've
got<00:00:36.390> here<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.129> and<00:00:38.129> I've<00:00:38.610> picked<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
got here and and I've picked out the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.079 
got here and and I've picked out the
colors<00:00:39.510> within<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.710> dot<00:00:40.949> to<00:00:41.549> use<00:00:41.729> for<00:00:41.970> my

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
colors within that dot to use for my

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.180 
colors within that dot to use for my
other<00:00:42.720> squares<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.350> are<00:00:43.470> going<00:00:43.589> to<00:00:43.680> go<00:00:43.860> in

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
other squares that are going to go in

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.110 
other squares that are going to go in
with<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.600> we're<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.049> to<00:00:46.400> cut<00:00:47.400> so<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.909> do

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
with it so we're going to cut so to do

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.820 
with it so we're going to cut so to do
this<00:00:48.269> we<00:00:48.449> need<00:00:48.479> to<00:00:48.629> cut<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:49.049> squares<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.559> half

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
this we need to cut the squares in half

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.100 
this we need to cut the squares in half
so<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> strips<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.299> two<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> half<00:00:51.750> inches

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
so the strips of two and a half inches

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.649 
so the strips of two and a half inches
wide<00:00:52.170> by<00:00:53.100> five<00:00:53.370> inches<00:00:53.729> long<00:00:53.790> cut<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.479> if<00:00:54.570> you

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
wide by five inches long cut so if you

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.090 
wide by five inches long cut so if you
start<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.049> some<00:00:55.229> five<00:00:55.409> inch<00:00:55.619> squares<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
start with some five inch squares it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.229 
start with some five inch squares it
makes<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.489> pretty<00:00:57.119> easy<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> I'm<00:01:00.089> just

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
makes it pretty easy and so I'm just

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.759 
makes it pretty easy and so I'm just
going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.479> cut<00:01:00.629> these<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.019> half<00:01:01.049> I've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
going to cut these in half I've got a

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.840 
going to cut these in half I've got a
little<00:01:01.920> stack<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.430> them<00:01:02.519> here<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:03.510> lined<00:01:03.869> up

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
little stack of them here all lined up

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.190 
little stack of them here all lined up
using<00:01:05.850> some<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> colors<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.080> in

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
using some of the colors that are in

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.719 
using some of the colors that are in
that<00:01:07.229> fabric<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.189> thought<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.610> would

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that fabric there I thought that would

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.130 
that fabric there I thought that would
be<00:01:08.760> quite<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> nice<00:01:10.080> way<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.560> something<00:01:12.140> so

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
be quite a nice way to do something so

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380 
be quite a nice way to do something so
I've<00:01:13.229> cut<00:01:13.440> those<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.800> half<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> need<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
I've cut those in half and all I need to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
I've cut those in half and all I need to
do<00:01:15.540> now<00:01:15.690> is<00:01:16.640> sew<00:01:17.640> them<00:01:17.850> together<00:01:19.100> with<00:01:20.100> another

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
do now is sew them together with another

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
do now is sew them together with another
color<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:21.450> join<00:01:22.110> them<00:01:22.260> all<00:01:22.410> up<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.590> I'll

color and then join them all up so I'll

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800 
color and then join them all up so I'll
just<00:01:23.040> quickly<00:01:23.220> run<00:01:23.940> some<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> these<00:01:24.390> through

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
just quickly run some of these through

so<00:01:55.250> this<00:01:55.429> is<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.849> would<00:01:56.000> be<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.119> fairly

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
so this is that this would be a fairly

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.789 
so this is that this would be a fairly
quick<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:56.630> easy<00:01:58.599> don't<00:01:59.599> have<00:02:00.319> to<00:02:00.439> do<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.619> in

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
quick and easy don't have to do it in

quick and easy don't have to do it in
just<00:02:00.950> um<00:02:01.929> two<00:02:02.929> colors<00:02:03.459> or<00:02:04.459> anything<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.359> that

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
just um two colors or anything like that

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
you can do it in any number of colors

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.210 
you can do it in any number of colors
just<00:02:08.450> use<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.690> multiple<00:02:09.200> lot<00:02:09.799> of<00:02:09.920> different

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
just use a multiple lot of different

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.520 
just use a multiple lot of different
piping<00:02:10.940> squares<00:02:13.000> like<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.299> contrast<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:15.410> it

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
piping squares like for contrast that it

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.020 
piping squares like for contrast that it
was<00:02:15.680> hitting<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.190> particularly<00:02:16.640> with<00:02:16.879> these

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
was hitting and particularly with these

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.720 
was hitting and particularly with these
delicious<00:02:17.930> colors<00:02:18.319> so<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.250> thought<00:02:19.400> all<00:02:19.549> those

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
delicious colors so I thought all those

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.970 
delicious colors so I thought all those
joined<00:02:20.180> up<00:02:20.390> now<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.959> now<00:02:21.410> I'm<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.799> join

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
joined up now and now I'm going to join

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.360 
joined up now and now I'm going to join
them<00:02:22.250> together<00:02:22.430> into<00:02:22.790> pairs<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:26.000> rather<00:02:26.450> than

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
them together into pairs so rather than

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.710 
them together into pairs so rather than
messing<00:02:28.370> around<00:02:28.609> too<00:02:28.940> much<00:02:29.060> with<00:02:29.299> great<00:02:29.510> long

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
messing around too much with great long

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.949 
messing around too much with great long
bits<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.680> pieces<00:02:30.859> so<00:02:31.760> just<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:32.870> I'm

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
bits and pieces so just so I'm

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.110 
bits and pieces so just so I'm
alternating<00:02:33.319> my<00:02:33.799> dotty<00:02:34.310> fabric<00:02:34.790> with<00:02:34.970> my

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
alternating my dotty fabric with my

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.199 
alternating my dotty fabric with my
marbles<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.489> can<00:02:40.639> just<00:02:40.819> make<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.000> nice

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
marbles and you can just make a nice

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:54.259 
marbles and you can just make a nice
long<00:02:41.480> row<00:02:42.190> like<00:02:43.190> this

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.789 

if<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.390> keep<00:02:55.569> joining<00:02:55.870> pairs<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.650> they

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
if you keep joining pairs like this they

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:09.929 
if you keep joining pairs like this they
get<00:02:56.980> bigger<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.370> bigger<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.739> now<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.489> can<00:03:09.760> join

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
get bigger and bigger and now I can join

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.380 
get bigger and bigger and now I can join
my<00:03:10.150> next<00:03:11.069> join<00:03:12.069> so<00:03:12.340> that's<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.760> here<00:03:13.360> that

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
my next join so that's that here that

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.880 
my next join so that's that here that
I've<00:03:13.599> been<00:03:13.780> doing<00:03:14.019> there<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.680> go<00:03:14.829> to

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
I've been doing there that can go to

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.619 
I've been doing there that can go to
that<00:03:15.129> and<00:03:15.190> we've<00:03:15.670> just<00:03:15.879> about<00:03:16.090> got<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.299> strip

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
that and we've just about got a strip

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.990 
that and we've just about got a strip
done<00:03:16.810> already<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.340> can<00:03:18.489> see<00:03:18.700> it's<00:03:18.819> pretty

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
done already so you can see it's pretty

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.839 
done already so you can see it's pretty
quick<00:03:20.159> then<00:03:21.159> always<00:03:21.400> have<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.670> rush

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
quick then always have to rush

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.960 
quick then always have to rush
everything<00:03:22.329> though<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:27.400> was<00:03:27.579> just<00:03:27.730> an<00:03:27.849> idea

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
everything though this was just an idea

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.170 
everything though this was just an idea
I<00:03:28.239> just<00:03:29.019> saw<00:03:29.170> this<00:03:29.349> dotty<00:03:30.280> fabric<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:30.909> I<00:03:31.000> pad

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
I just saw this dotty fabric and I pad

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.699 
I just saw this dotty fabric and I pad
off<00:03:31.269> that<00:03:31.540> would<00:03:31.690> just<00:03:31.870> look<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:32.260> delicious

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
off that would just look so delicious

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.000 
off that would just look so delicious
but<00:03:33.810> alternating<00:03:34.810> with<00:03:34.959> those<00:03:35.139> colors<00:03:35.440> that

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
but alternating with those colors that

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.369 
but alternating with those colors that
are<00:03:36.129> in<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:36.639> I'll<00:03:37.389> just<00:03:37.420> grab<00:03:37.659> the<00:03:37.870> iron<00:03:38.079> and

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
are in it so I'll just grab the iron and

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.110 
are in it so I'll just grab the iron and
I'll<00:03:38.470> give<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.769> quick<00:03:39.010> press<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:42.220> if<00:03:42.849> you<00:03:42.940> if

you press if you make a strip this long

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.970 
you press if you make a strip this long
I've<00:03:46.750> already<00:03:47.170> made<00:03:47.319> a<00:03:47.349> couple<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.709> strips

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
I've already made a couple of strips

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.309 
I've already made a couple of strips

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
you always press them the same way

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.319 
you always press them the same way
starting<00:03:54.340> at<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.489> same<00:03:54.639> end<00:03:54.879> and<00:03:55.030> pressing

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
starting at the same end and pressing

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.180 
starting at the same end and pressing
the<00:03:55.420> seams<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:55.780> same<00:03:55.989> way<00:03:56.139> we're<00:03:56.920> going<00:03:57.099> to

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
the seams the same way we're going to

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.250 
the seams the same way we're going to
actually<00:03:57.549> turn<00:03:57.760> them<00:03:57.970> around<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.989> that<00:03:59.019> they

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
actually turn them around so that they

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.559 
actually turn them around so that they
alternate<00:03:59.799> the<00:04:00.549> seams<00:04:00.819> will<00:04:00.970> always<00:04:01.209> be<00:04:01.359> going

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
alternate the seams will always be going

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.420 
alternate the seams will always be going
the<00:04:01.690> right<00:04:01.840> way<00:04:01.900> for<00:04:02.859> when<00:04:02.949> you<00:04:03.069> want<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.310> sew

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
the right way for when you want to sew

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.860 
the right way for when you want to sew
them<00:04:03.609> together<00:04:03.699> because<00:04:04.180> you've<00:04:04.299> started<00:04:04.599> off

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
them together because you've started off

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.360 
them together because you've started off
the<00:04:05.379> same<00:04:05.590> way<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:05.889> you<00:04:05.949> turn<00:04:06.129> it<00:04:06.280> up<00:04:06.340> the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
the same way and you turn it up the

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.860 
the same way and you turn it up the
other<00:04:06.519> way<00:04:06.639> I<00:04:06.970> hope<00:04:07.750> that<00:04:07.900> made<00:04:08.079> sense<00:04:08.109> so<00:04:09.870> I'm

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
other way I hope that made sense so I'm

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.270 
other way I hope that made sense so I'm
going<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:11.079> start<00:04:11.349> here<00:04:11.739> because<00:04:11.859> that's<00:04:12.099> where

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
going to start here because that's where

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.400 
going to start here because that's where
I<00:04:12.310> started<00:04:13.060> on<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.299> colored<00:04:13.930> end<00:04:14.109> on<00:04:14.290> the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
I started on the colored end on the

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.279 
I started on the colored end on the
others<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:16.060> I'm<00:04:16.150> just<00:04:16.299> lifting<00:04:16.570> this<00:04:16.900> up<00:04:17.109> and

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
others and I'm just lifting this up and

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.670 
others and I'm just lifting this up and
letting<00:04:17.470> that<00:04:17.739> seam<00:04:18.239> flop<00:04:19.239> over<00:04:19.479> as<00:04:19.840> I<00:04:20.349> get<00:04:20.530> to

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
letting that seam flop over as I get to

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.580 
letting that seam flop over as I get to
it<00:04:20.799> with<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.070> iron<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:22.229> find<00:04:23.229> that<00:04:23.349> works

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
it with the iron I find that works

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.860 
it with the iron I find that works
really<00:04:23.889> well<00:04:24.810> yes<00:04:26.460> gently<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:28.419> don't<00:04:28.449> get<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
really well yes gently you don't get the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.050 
really well yes gently you don't get the
little<00:04:28.990> pleats<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.590> tucks<00:04:29.860> that<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.729> can<00:04:30.880> get

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
little pleats and tucks that you can get

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.310 
little pleats and tucks that you can get
if<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.270> iron<00:04:31.449> from<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.840> other<00:04:31.990> side

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
if you iron from the other side

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.629 
if you iron from the other side
sometimes

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.070 

it's<00:04:38.240> looking<00:04:38.599> pretty<00:04:38.629> good<00:04:38.960> already<00:04:40.990> so<00:04:41.990> this

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
it's looking pretty good already so this

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.570 
it's looking pretty good already so this
was<00:04:42.259> really<00:04:42.469> just<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.710> little<00:04:42.919> exercise<00:04:43.159> and

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
was really just a little exercise and

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.439 
was really just a little exercise and
showing<00:04:43.849> you<00:04:44.030> how<00:04:44.840> something<00:04:45.650> even<00:04:45.919> as<00:04:46.039> simple

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
showing you how something even as simple

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.540 
showing you how something even as simple
as<00:04:47.449> just<00:04:47.539> half<00:04:48.289> of<00:04:48.469> a<00:04:48.590> five<00:04:48.800> inch<00:04:49.009> square

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
as just half of a five inch square

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.899 
as just half of a five inch square
cannot<00:04:50.330> very<00:04:50.599> effective<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:52.250> I've<00:04:52.310> made<00:04:52.460> three

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
cannot very effective so I've made three

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.719 
cannot very effective so I've made three
rows<00:04:53.120> exactly<00:04:53.659> the<00:04:53.889> walls<00:04:54.889> that<00:04:55.099> when<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.460> say

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
rows exactly the walls that when I say

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.129 
rows exactly the walls that when I say
exactly<00:04:55.909> the<00:04:56.210> same<00:04:56.449> they're<00:04:56.599> the<00:04:56.629> same<00:04:56.900> in

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
exactly the same they're the same in

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.740 
exactly the same they're the same in
that<00:04:57.319> the<00:04:57.800> black<00:04:58.069> is<00:04:58.400> alternating<00:04:59.270> so<00:04:59.599> if<00:04:59.689> you

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
that the black is alternating so if you

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.899 
that the black is alternating so if you
put<00:04:59.930> them<00:05:00.080> like<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.259> you<00:05:00.710> could<00:05:01.219> still<00:05:01.759> you

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
put them like that you could still you

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.490 
put them like that you could still you
could<00:05:02.060> have<00:05:02.180> this<00:05:02.330> stripe<00:05:02.629> going<00:05:02.870> through<00:05:03.259> and

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
could have this stripe going through and

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.890 
could have this stripe going through and
you'd<00:05:03.949> have<00:05:04.069> all<00:05:04.219> these<00:05:04.340> colors<00:05:04.639> varying<00:05:05.210> but

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
you'd have all these colors varying but

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.379 
you'd have all these colors varying but
if<00:05:06.050> you<00:05:06.199> flip<00:05:06.650> every<00:05:07.039> other<00:05:07.250> one<00:05:07.460> around<00:05:07.789> you

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
if you flip every other one around you

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.580 
if you flip every other one around you
get<00:05:08.569> this<00:05:08.689> sort<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:08.960> checkerboard<00:05:09.319> thing

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
get this sort of checkerboard thing

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.959 
get this sort of checkerboard thing
going<00:05:10.039> which<00:05:10.159> I<00:05:10.310> think<00:05:10.490> is<00:05:10.580> really<00:05:10.759> quite

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
going which I think is really quite

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.510 
going which I think is really quite
effective<00:05:11.150> I<00:05:11.800> also<00:05:12.800> thought<00:05:13.129> it<00:05:13.189> would<00:05:13.400> be

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
effective I also thought it would be

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.350 
effective I also thought it would be
very<00:05:13.669> effective<00:05:14.919> just<00:05:15.919> in<00:05:16.129> a<00:05:16.189> quilt<00:05:16.460> as<00:05:16.699> just

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
very effective just in a quilt as just

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.230 
very effective just in a quilt as just
maybe<00:05:18.259> I<00:05:18.379> can<00:05:18.590> do<00:05:18.680> it<00:05:18.740> this<00:05:18.860> way<00:05:18.979> a<00:05:19.099> lot<00:05:19.969> better

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
maybe I can do it this way a lot better

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.129 
maybe I can do it this way a lot better
and<00:05:20.689> it's<00:05:21.590> just<00:05:21.830> a<00:05:21.919> long<00:05:22.129> strip<00:05:22.719> down<00:05:23.719> a<00:05:23.750> quilt

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
and it's just a long strip down a quilt

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.309 
and it's just a long strip down a quilt
rather<00:05:24.830> than<00:05:25.629> all-over<00:05:26.629> a<00:05:26.659> quilt<00:05:26.960> and<00:05:27.139> then

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
rather than all-over a quilt and then

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.409 
rather than all-over a quilt and then
something<00:05:27.800> either<00:05:27.949> side<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:29.000> make<00:05:29.150> it<00:05:29.270> more

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
something either side to make it more

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:30.670 
something either side to make it more
like<00:05:29.599> a<00:05:29.629> panel<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.199> thought<00:05:30.379> that<00:05:30.529> would<00:05:30.650> be

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
like a panel I thought that would be

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.040 
like a panel I thought that would be
very<00:05:31.219> effective<00:05:31.520> as<00:05:31.789> well<00:05:31.819> so<00:05:32.569> really<00:05:32.840> there's

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
very effective as well so really there's

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.529 
very effective as well so really there's
lots<00:05:33.229> of<00:05:33.460> little<00:05:34.460> possibilities<00:05:35.150> for<00:05:35.389> those

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
lots of little possibilities for those

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.899 
lots of little possibilities for those
wonderful<00:05:36.379> little<00:05:36.650> five<00:05:36.919> inch<00:05:37.159> squares<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:37.819> I

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
wonderful little five inch squares and I

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.969 
wonderful little five inch squares and I
have<00:05:38.120> made<00:05:38.270> a<00:05:38.330> quilt<00:05:38.629> I'll<00:05:39.379> quickly<00:05:39.620> show<00:05:39.949> you

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
have made a quilt I'll quickly show you

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.309 
have made a quilt I'll quickly show you
in<00:05:40.370> quite<00:05:40.610> different<00:05:40.759> colors<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:41.479> it<00:05:41.960> is<00:05:42.080> in

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 
in quite different colors and it is in

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.499 
in quite different colors and it is in
two<00:05:42.620> colors<00:05:42.949> I've<00:05:43.099> called<00:05:43.400> the<00:05:43.520> pattern<00:05:43.789> two

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
two colors I've called the pattern two

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.570 
two colors I've called the pattern two
colors<00:05:44.870> it<00:05:45.050> is<00:05:45.169> available<00:05:45.650> on<00:05:45.770> my<00:05:45.889> website<00:05:45.919> on

colors it is available on my website on

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.180 
colors it is available on my website on
gourmet<00:05:47.270> quilted<00:05:47.690> fun<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:48.770> here<00:05:49.039> I've<00:05:49.159> made

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
gourmet quilted fun and here I've made

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.879 
gourmet quilted fun and here I've made
it<00:05:49.550> in<00:05:49.729> some<00:05:49.969> really<00:05:50.719> nice<00:05:50.930> Japanese<00:05:51.440> fabrics

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
it in some really nice Japanese fabrics

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.510 
it in some really nice Japanese fabrics
in<00:05:52.069> the<00:05:52.219> Reds<00:05:52.430> and<00:05:52.669> blues<00:05:54.190> which<00:05:55.190> I<00:05:55.339> thought

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
in the Reds and blues which I thought

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.010 
in the Reds and blues which I thought
was<00:05:55.639> really<00:05:55.849> quite<00:05:56.839> scrumptious<00:05:57.199> and<00:05:59.020> that's

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
was really quite scrumptious and that's

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.659 
was really quite scrumptious and that's
all<00:06:00.199> it<00:06:00.349> is<00:06:00.440> is<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:00.710> five<00:06:00.889> inch<00:06:01.069> squares<00:06:01.430> cut

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
all it is is the five inch squares cut

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.279 
all it is is the five inch squares cut
in<00:06:01.789> half<00:06:02.000> and<00:06:02.210> drawn<00:06:02.449> together<00:06:02.810> alternating

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
in half and drawn together alternating

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:04.990 
in half and drawn together alternating
the<00:06:03.560> colors<00:06:03.589> and<00:06:04.069> the<00:06:04.159> fabrics<00:06:04.310> are<00:06:04.639> all<00:06:04.729> a<00:06:04.759> bit

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
the colors and the fabrics are all a bit

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.899 
the colors and the fabrics are all a bit
different<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:05.979> they're<00:06:06.979> basically<00:06:07.370> red<00:06:07.759> and

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
different and they're basically red and

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.510 
different and they're basically red and
blue<00:06:08.060> so<00:06:08.330> that's<00:06:08.449> the<00:06:08.689> two<00:06:08.839> color<00:06:09.080> so<00:06:09.800> that<00:06:10.370> was

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
blue so that's the two color so that was

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.429 
blue so that's the two color so that was
just<00:06:10.639> another<00:06:10.789> idea<00:06:11.330> for<00:06:11.930> the<00:06:12.020> five<00:06:12.229> inch

00:06:12.429 --> 00:06:12.439 
just another idea for the five inch

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.969 
just another idea for the five inch
squares<00:06:12.849> thank<00:06:13.849> you
