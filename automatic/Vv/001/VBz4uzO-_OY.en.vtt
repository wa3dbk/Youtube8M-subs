to<00:00:27.789> blow

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.090

place of the contrasting light and dark
colors<00:00:40.430> when<00:00:41.210> we<00:00:41.330> design<00:00:41.660> our<00:00:41.900> fleet<00:00:42.830> drawings

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
colors when we design our fleet drawings

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.460 
colors when we design our fleet drawings
we<00:00:43.820> work<00:00:44.030> with<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.300> best<00:00:44.450> we<00:00:44.690> can<00:00:44.870> do<00:00:45.050> on<00:00:45.410> a

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
we work with the best we can do on a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.610 
we work with the best we can do on a
flat<00:00:45.860> to<00:00:46.310> the<00:00:46.520> drawing<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:47.510> but<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.440> real

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
flat to the drawing and but the real

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.320 
flat to the drawing and but the real
challenge<00:00:49.190> comes<00:00:49.250> when<00:00:49.700> you<00:00:49.820> do<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.120> first

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
challenge comes when you do the first

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.720 
challenge comes when you do the first
prototype<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.380> when<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.100> put<00:00:52.310> the<00:00:52.430> letters

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
prototype and when you put the letters

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.640 
prototype and when you put the letters
up<00:00:52.880> there<00:00:52.990> you<00:00:53.990> have<00:00:54.170> wiggle

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.140 

it's<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.710> very<00:00:59.860> complicated<00:01:00.190> design<00:01:00.700> and<00:01:00.970> we

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
it's a very complicated design and we

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.130 
it's a very complicated design and we
want<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.330> make<00:01:01.420> sure<00:01:01.450> it<00:01:01.630> looks<00:01:01.810> the<00:01:01.870> best

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
want to make sure it looks the best

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.079 
want to make sure it looks the best
every<00:01:02.560> single<00:01:02.830> time<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.220> decals<00:01:03.820> are<00:01:04.059> a

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
every single time and decals are a

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.970 
every single time and decals are a
really<00:01:04.390> good<00:01:04.510> way<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.720> do<00:01:04.930> that<00:01:05.080> this<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.830> a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
really good way to do that this is a

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.860 
really good way to do that this is a
flight<00:01:06.520> symbol<00:01:06.880> that<00:01:07.000> takes<00:01:07.240> America<00:01:07.660> into<00:01:07.840> a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
flight symbol that takes America into a

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:14.110 
flight symbol that takes America into a
totally<00:01:08.290> new<00:01:08.320> place<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.130> future

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.520 

that<00:01:14.510> we<00:01:14.630> have<00:01:14.780> is<00:01:14.900> really<00:01:15.050> one<00:01:15.260> of<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.410> more

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
that we have is really one of the more

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.380 
that we have is really one of the more
complicated<00:01:15.860> signs<00:01:16.280> that's<00:01:16.940> been<00:01:17.210> on

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
complicated signs that's been on

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.050 
complicated signs that's been on
mainland<00:01:17.750> service<00:01:18.200> it<00:01:18.530> actually<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:19.160> set<00:01:19.940> up

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
mainland service it actually is set up

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.600 
mainland service it actually is set up
into<00:01:20.540> six<00:01:21.110> different<00:01:21.230> colors<00:01:21.710> along<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.460> tail

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
into six different colors along the tail

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.790 
into six different colors along the tail
and<00:01:22.820> then<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.690> two<00:01:23.840> different<00:01:24.080> blues<00:01:24.290> in<00:01:24.530> the

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
and then the two different blues in the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.380 
and then the two different blues in the
field<00:01:25.010> with<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.340> Stars<00:01:25.550> when<00:01:26.150> we<00:01:26.300> are

field with the Stars when we are

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.330 
field with the Stars when we are
developing<00:01:26.630> an<00:01:27.020> aircraft<00:01:27.110> is<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.800> livery

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
developing an aircraft is a livery

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.400 
developing an aircraft is a livery
design<00:01:28.760> we<00:01:29.450> are<00:01:29.570> looking<00:01:29.810> at<00:01:29.960> all<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.200> parts

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
design we are looking at all the parts

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.530 
design we are looking at all the parts
at<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.560> same<00:01:30.650> time<00:01:31.070> we<00:01:31.670> look<00:01:31.820> at<00:01:32.000> hundreds

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
at the same time we look at hundreds

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.960 
at the same time we look at hundreds
hundreds<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.530> possible<00:01:34.040> designs<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.730> then<00:01:34.850> we

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
hundreds of possible designs and then we

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.030 
hundreds of possible designs and then we
started<00:01:35.240> narrowing<00:01:35.480> down<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:36.230> what<00:01:36.710> we<00:01:36.860> have

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
started narrowing down to what we have

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.850 
started narrowing down to what we have
now<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.520> once<00:01:38.150> we<00:01:38.390> were<00:01:38.540> in<00:01:38.660> this<00:01:38.810> area<00:01:39.020> that

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
now and once we were in this area that

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.500 
now and once we were in this area that
has<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.280> last<00:01:40.460> version<00:01:40.820> of<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.180> American

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
has the last version of the American

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.840 
has the last version of the American
flag<00:01:41.660> and<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.230> back<00:01:42.410> then<00:01:43.010> we<00:01:43.190> did<00:01:43.340> tons<00:01:43.640> of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
flag and in the back then we did tons of

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.540 
flag and in the back then we did tons of
hours<00:01:44.150> of<00:01:44.270> design<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:45.320> get<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:45.800> a<00:01:45.830> place<00:01:45.980> for

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
hours of design to get it to a place for

hours of design to get it to a place for
