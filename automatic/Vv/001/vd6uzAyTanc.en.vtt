by the premise of XCOM 2 enemy Unknown

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.849 
by the premise of XCOM 2 enemy Unknown
was<00:00:23.400> built<00:00:23.670> off<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.210> idea<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.859> overcoming

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
was built off of the idea of overcoming

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.120 
was built off of the idea of overcoming
great<00:00:26.789> great<00:00:27.119> odds<00:00:27.529> there's<00:00:28.529> consequences<00:00:28.800> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
great great odds there's consequences to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.500 
great great odds there's consequences to
the<00:00:29.279> game<00:00:29.460> again<00:00:29.849> you're<00:00:30.000> losing<00:00:30.300> soldiers

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the game again you're losing soldiers

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.120 
the game again you're losing soldiers
you're<00:00:30.960> losing<00:00:31.289> countries<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.009> game

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
you're losing countries it's a game

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.400 
you're losing countries it's a game
about<00:00:32.160> loss<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:33.420> found<00:00:33.570> through<00:00:33.809> data<00:00:34.020> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
about loss and we found through data and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.470 
about loss and we found through data and
and<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.280> our<00:00:35.550> player<00:00:35.760> base<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.120> well<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> lot<00:00:36.450> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and and our player base as well a lot of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.910 
and and our player base as well a lot of
people<00:00:36.570> lost<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.290> first<00:00:37.469> time<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:37.739> played

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
people lost the first time they played

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.040 
people lost the first time they played
so<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.550> wanted<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> take<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.210> idea<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> run

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so we wanted to take that idea and run

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.740 
so we wanted to take that idea and run
with<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.550> enemy<00:00:42.300> Unknown<00:00:42.510> was

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
with it and because enemy Unknown was

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
with it and because enemy Unknown was
about<00:00:43.020> overcoming<00:00:43.440> odds<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:44.309> said<00:00:44.489> how<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.910> we

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
about overcoming odds we said how can we

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
about overcoming odds we said how can we
stack<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> odds<00:00:45.750> even<00:00:46.110> more<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.649> against<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
stack the odds even more so against the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.080 
stack the odds even more so against the
players<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.520> when<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.700> overcome<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
players so then when you overcome it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.760 
players so then when you overcome it
it's<00:00:48.600> even<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:48.989> exciting<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.590> said<00:00:49.739> okay

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
it's even more exciting so we said okay

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.979 
it's even more exciting so we said okay
let's<00:00:50.430> go<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> idea<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.270> XCOM<00:00:51.960> 2

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
let's go with the idea that XCOM 2

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.779 
let's go with the idea that XCOM 2
starts<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.590> world<00:00:52.800> where<00:00:53.100> XCOM<00:00:53.430> didn't

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
starts in a world where XCOM didn't

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.069 
starts in a world where XCOM didn't
succeed<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.390> thought<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.750> very<00:00:54.930> very

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
succeed we thought that was very very

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.950 
succeed we thought that was very very
compelling<00:00:55.910> so<00:00:56.910> 20<00:00:57.449> years<00:00:57.660> into<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> future

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
compelling so 20 years into the future

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.380 
compelling so 20 years into the future
the<00:00:58.710> aliens<00:00:59.100> did<00:00:59.219> not<00:00:59.460> annihilate<00:01:00.000> earth<00:01:00.120> but

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the aliens did not annihilate earth but

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.880 
the aliens did not annihilate earth but

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
they have occupied it and that's where

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.979 
they have occupied it and that's where

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
a lot of really really cool ideas and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.539 
a lot of really really cool ideas and
some<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> visual<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> visuals

some of the visual some of the visuals

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.890 
some of the visual some of the visuals
there<00:01:23.759> there<00:01:23.970> certainly<00:01:24.270> overlap<00:01:24.659> with<00:01:24.780> what

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
there there certainly overlap with what

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.600 
there there certainly overlap with what
we're<00:01:25.020> doing<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
we're doing but that was not the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.929 
we're doing but that was not the
inspiration<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.350> at<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:28.770> how<00:01:29.340> will<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
inspiration for it at all how will the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.580 
inspiration for it at all how will the
mobile<00:01:30.210> head<00:01:30.420> cool<00:01:30.630> effects<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.110> into<00:01:31.500> the

mobile head cool effects it into the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.770 
mobile head cool effects it into the
gameplay<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:33.119> mobile<00:01:33.360> headquarters<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
gameplay the mobile headquarters is

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.530 
gameplay the mobile headquarters is
going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.020> very<00:01:34.049> cool<00:01:34.640> obviously<00:01:35.640> you're

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
going to be very cool obviously you're

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.880 
going to be very cool obviously you're
on<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> run<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.320> you're<00:01:37.650> trying<00:01:37.799> to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
on the run now and you're trying to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.030 
on the run now and you're trying to
spark<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.310> resistance<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> base

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
spark a resistance so you have a base

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.679 
spark a resistance so you have a base
that<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.579> rooted<00:01:41.790> underground<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.540> can

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
that is not rooted underground you can

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.940 
that is not rooted underground you can
move<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> all<00:01:43.079> around<00:01:43.110> around<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> world

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950

have five classes in XCOM 2 we've talked

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.710 
have five classes in XCOM 2 we've talked
about<00:02:18.660> four<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:19.020> them<00:02:20.330> you've<00:02:21.330> seen<00:02:21.569> the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
about four of them you've seen the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.479 
about four of them you've seen the
Ranger<00:02:22.050> in<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.230> specialist<00:02:22.709> which<00:02:22.920> are<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
Ranger in the specialist which are the

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.010 
Ranger in the specialist which are the
most<00:02:23.640> exciting<00:02:24.180> because<00:02:24.390> those<00:02:24.810> are<00:02:24.989> the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
most exciting because those are the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.590 
most exciting because those are the
evolution<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:26.010> what<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.760> support<00:02:27.090> unit<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
evolution of what the support unit and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.910 
evolution of what the support unit and
the<00:02:27.660> assault<00:02:27.989> unit<00:02:28.290> from<00:02:28.410> enemy<00:02:28.680> Unknown

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
the assault unit from enemy Unknown

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.350 
the assault unit from enemy Unknown
would<00:02:29.100> have<00:02:29.190> turned<00:02:29.340> into<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.150> new<00:02:30.330> world

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
would have turned into in this new world

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.050 
would have turned into in this new world
so<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.290> Ranger<00:02:31.739> they<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.880> scrape

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
so the Ranger they have to scrape

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.850 
so the Ranger they have to scrape
together<00:02:33.239> resources<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.590> may

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
together resources that you may

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.710 
together resources that you may
otherwise<00:02:35.160> not<00:02:35.640> have<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.300> since<00:02:36.540> you're<00:02:36.690> a

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
otherwise not have to since you're a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.030 
otherwise not have to since you're a
resistance<00:02:37.170> group<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.500> don't<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.800> as<00:02:37.920> much

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
resistance group you don't have as much

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.190 
resistance group you don't have as much
of<00:02:38.220> an<00:02:38.310> infrastructure<00:02:38.850> for<00:02:39.200> building

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
of an infrastructure for building

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.050 
of an infrastructure for building
weapons<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.769> they<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> machete<00:02:41.519> sword<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
weapons so they have a machete sword and

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.880 
weapons so they have a machete sword and
they<00:02:42.209> can<00:02:42.360> bring<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.780> fight<00:02:42.959> right<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
they can bring the fight right to the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.440 
they can bring the fight right to the
alien<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:44.519> up<00:02:44.610> close<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.820> personal<00:02:45.000> I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
alien and get up close and personal I

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.690 
alien and get up close and personal I
like<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.750> machete<00:02:46.050> it's<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.040> lot<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.220> fun<00:02:47.340> so

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
like the machete it's a lot of fun so

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.670 
like the machete it's a lot of fun so
melee<00:02:48.180> has<00:02:48.390> much<00:02:48.810> more<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.140> role<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
melee has much more of a role and the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.199 
melee has much more of a role and the
Ranger<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:50.459> also<00:02:50.580> manipulate<00:02:50.820> the

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
Ranger can also manipulate the

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.360 
Ranger can also manipulate the
concealment<00:02:51.540> system<00:02:51.989> in<00:02:52.200> future<00:02:53.010> abilities

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
concealment system in future abilities

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.500 
concealment system in future abilities
that<00:02:53.489> we're<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:53.700> talking<00:02:54.060> about<00:02:54.150> right<00:02:54.450> now

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
that we're not talking about right now

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.570 
that we're not talking about right now
so<00:02:55.140> they<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.410> sort<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.220> gal

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
but in all seriousness my favorite part

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.220 
but in all seriousness my favorite part
is<00:03:44.370> probably<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:45.209> procedural<00:03:45.660> nature<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.140> the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
is probably the procedural nature of the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.979 
is probably the procedural nature of the
game<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.560> mean<00:03:46.739> that's<00:03:46.920> like<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.340> one<00:03:47.579> thing

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
game I mean that's like the one thing

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.979 
game I mean that's like the one thing
pillar<00:03:48.989> why's<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.590> we<00:03:50.510> didn't<00:03:51.510> ship<00:03:51.690> with<00:03:51.870> an

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
pillar why's that we didn't ship with an

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.660 
pillar why's that we didn't ship with an
enemy<00:03:52.290> Unknown<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.890> we<00:03:53.010> always<00:03:53.280> want<00:03:53.459> you

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
enemy Unknown that we always want you

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.190 
enemy Unknown that we always want you
want<00:03:53.820> procedural<00:03:54.329> maps<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.690> want<00:03:54.840> sort<00:03:55.109> of

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
want procedural maps you want sort of

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.380 
want procedural maps you want sort of
that<00:03:55.410> that<00:03:56.010> goal<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.549> procedural<00:03:56.970> maps<00:03:57.209> and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
that that goal of procedural maps and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.300 
that that goal of procedural maps and
the<00:03:57.450> team<00:03:57.630> did<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.079> with<00:03:58.320> XCOM<00:03:58.680> 2<00:03:58.799> so<00:03:59.160> you're

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
the team did that with XCOM 2 so you're

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.650 
the team did that with XCOM 2 so you're
never<00:03:59.459> going<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.700> see<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.000> same<00:04:00.030> map<00:04:00.359> twice

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
never going to see the same map twice

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.990 
never going to see the same map twice
and<00:04:01.140> it's<00:04:01.739> just<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.010> really<00:04:02.280> cool<00:04:02.519> feeling

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
and it's just this really cool feeling

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.849 
and it's just this really cool feeling
even<00:04:03.540> 20<00:04:03.780> years<00:04:03.900> into<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.230> future<00:04:04.260> with<00:04:04.709> these

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
very eerie this eerie feeling that

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.039 
very eerie this eerie feeling that
you're<00:04:08.790> like<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.120> think<00:04:09.449> I<00:04:09.540> might<00:04:09.750> have<00:04:09.870> seen

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
you're like I think I might have seen

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.270 
you're like I think I might have seen
this<00:04:10.139> building<00:04:10.440> before<00:04:10.560> but<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:10.980> wasn't

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
this building before but it wasn't

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.550 
this building before but it wasn't
exactly<00:04:11.459> in<00:04:11.910> this<00:04:12.060> way<00:04:12.389> and<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:13.199> you<00:04:13.260> can't

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
exactly in this way and so you can't

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.629 
exactly in this way and so you can't
predict<00:04:13.829> layouts<00:04:14.130> you<00:04:14.250> don't<00:04:14.430> know<00:04:14.489> what's

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
predict layouts you don't know what's

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.789 
predict layouts you don't know what's
going<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.790> happen<00:04:15.109> and<00:04:16.109> then<00:04:16.440> when<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.650> layer

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
going to happen and then when you layer

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.500 
going to happen and then when you layer
the<00:04:16.949> procedural<00:04:17.370> objectives<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:18.030> top<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.389> that

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
the procedural objectives on top of that

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.390 
the procedural objectives on top of that
every<00:04:19.440> mission<00:04:19.739> is<00:04:19.859> different<00:04:20.160> every<00:04:20.370> single

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
every mission is different every single

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.310 
every mission is different every single
time<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:20.850> I'm<00:04:21.329> probably<00:04:21.570> most<00:04:21.840> excited<00:04:22.260> about

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
time and I'm probably most excited about

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.350
