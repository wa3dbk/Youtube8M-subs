15 and a half hours I was two miles from

half hours to do the last two miles the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.889 
half hours to do the last two miles the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
currents were crazy all the way through

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.990 
currents were crazy all the way through
I<00:00:39.930> had<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.559> sprint<00:00:41.160> sets<00:00:41.430> which<00:00:41.730> I've<00:00:41.850> never

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
I had to do sprint sets which I've never

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790 
I had to do sprint sets which I've never
had<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.360> across<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> channel<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
had to do across the channel because the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.319 
had to do across the channel because the
currents<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.250> constantly<00:00:44.730> trying<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.090> push

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
currents is constantly trying to push

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.420 
currents is constantly trying to push
you<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.629> west<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:46.890> 22<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> half

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
you to the west so it was 22 and a half

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.310 
you to the west so it was 22 and a half
mile<00:00:47.760> an<00:00:47.940> hour<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.020> pace

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
mile an hour so I have to do that pace

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
mile an hour so I have to do that pace
and<00:00:49.559> beyond<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.700> imagine<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.180> you're

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and beyond and you imagine if you're

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.880 
and beyond and you imagine if you're
doing<00:00:51.510> half<00:00:51.690> an<00:00:51.840> hour<00:00:51.960> Springs<00:00:52.320> five<00:00:52.590> minutes

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
doing half an hour Springs five minutes

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.979 
doing half an hour Springs five minutes
off<00:00:53.039> another<00:00:53.250> half<00:00:53.489> hour<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.120> pilot<00:00:54.570> didn't

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
off another half hour the pilot didn't

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
off another half hour the pilot didn't
speak<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.320> English<00:00:55.680> kept<00:00:56.129> looking<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
speak in English kept looking at the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.930 
speak in English kept looking at the
monitor<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.059> he<00:00:57.270> said<00:00:57.480> go<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.820> all<00:00:59.910> in

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
monitor and he said go this is all in

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.610 
monitor and he said go this is all in
the<00:01:00.030> dark<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.510> well<00:01:00.660> isn't<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:00.989> yeah<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.469> yeah

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that's what I saw the shafts and the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.700 
that's what I saw the shafts and the
nice<00:01:09.030> elastic<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.689> say<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:09.960> shot<00:01:10.350> since<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
nice elastic I say so shot since that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.109
