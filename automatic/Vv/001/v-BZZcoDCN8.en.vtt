00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
he is there he is and the motion sensor

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.809 
he is there he is and the motion sensor
so<00:02:16.120> going<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.300> come<00:02:16.450> around<00:02:16.540> there<00:02:16.870> he<00:02:16.959> goes

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
here and I'm going to anticipate him

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.370 
here and I'm going to anticipate him
going<00:02:31.030> over<00:02:31.210> to<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.420> know<00:02:31.690> he<00:02:31.900> shows<00:02:32.110> up<00:02:32.290> the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
going over to a I know he shows up the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.930 
going over to a I know he shows up the
motion<00:02:32.710> sensor<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.370> there<00:02:33.730> he<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:33.880> again

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
motion sensor and there he is again

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.060 
motion sensor and there he is again
we've<00:02:34.420> been<00:02:34.570> now<00:02:35.020> he<00:02:35.080> destroyed<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.740> motion

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
we've been now he destroyed the motion

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.160 
we've been now he destroyed the motion
sensor<00:02:36.340> I'm<00:02:36.490> still<00:02:36.880> thinking<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.600> at<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:37.900> time

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
sensor I'm still thinking a at this time

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.449 
sensor I'm still thinking a at this time
because<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.560> lot<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.800> guys<00:02:38.980> will<00:02:39.130> do<00:02:39.280> that

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
because a lot of guys will do that

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.910 
because a lot of guys will do that
they'll<00:02:39.970> take<00:02:40.240> out<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.660> motion<00:02:41.440> sensor<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.800> don't

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
they'll take out a motion sensor I don't

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.020 
they'll take out a motion sensor I don't
think<00:02:41.980> yet<00:02:42.160> enough<00:02:42.340> time<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.700> go<00:02:42.790> over<00:02:42.850> today

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
think yet enough time to go over today

going to sort of take this rope I I
don't<00:03:14.320> know<00:03:14.410> what<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.650> think<00:03:14.680> about<00:03:14.890> these

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
don't know what to think about these

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.380 
don't know what to think about these
maps<00:03:17.160> there's<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.220> few<00:03:18.489> of<00:03:18.550> them<00:03:18.670> that<00:03:18.970> really

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
maps there's a few of them that really

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.630 
maps there's a few of them that really
have<00:03:19.750> long<00:03:20.260> lines<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.650> sight<00:03:20.890> whether<00:03:21.459> it's

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
have long lines of sight whether it's

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.210 
have long lines of sight whether it's
down<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.450> side<00:03:22.810> target<00:03:23.230> or<00:03:23.320> B<00:03:23.470> side<00:03:23.739> target

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
down the a side target or B side target

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.580 
down the a side target or B side target
but<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.720> know<00:03:25.840> I'm<00:03:25.900> not<00:03:26.019> too<00:03:26.200> keen<00:03:26.350> on<00:03:26.500> that

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
but you know I'm not too keen on that

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.130 
but you know I'm not too keen on that
obviously<00:03:27.130> with<00:03:27.400> my<00:03:27.580> rush<00:03:27.820> class<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.630> SMG

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
obviously with my rush class and the SMG

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.440 
obviously with my rush class and the SMG
I<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:30.760> can't<00:03:31.060> remember<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.330> one

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
I think that I can't remember the one

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.920 
I think that I can't remember the one
map<00:03:31.600> hotel<00:03:32.019> along<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.040> side<00:03:33.610> I<00:03:33.640> think<00:03:34.090> it's<00:03:34.660> just

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
map hotel along a side I think it's just

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.960 
map hotel along a side I think it's just
like<00:03:34.989> one<00:03:35.500> long<00:03:35.739> corridor<00:03:36.370> down<00:03:36.549> there<00:03:36.820> and

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
like one long corridor down there and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.150 
like one long corridor down there and
you<00:03:37.360> know<00:03:37.480> everybody<00:03:37.930> Snipes<00:03:38.380> down<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.860> that

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
you know everybody Snipes down that that

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.580 
you know everybody Snipes down that that
side<00:03:39.489> so<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.540> doesn't<00:03:40.810> make<00:03:40.900> sense<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.320> run<00:03:41.560> a
