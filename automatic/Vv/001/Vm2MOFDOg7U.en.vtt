00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.020 
hi there you probably can't see me that

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.720 
hi there you probably can't see me that
well<00:00:10.170> because<00:00:10.559> as<00:00:10.830> you<00:00:11.010> can<00:00:11.130> see<00:00:11.190> behind<00:00:11.490> me

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
well because as you can see behind me

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.540 
well because as you can see behind me
I've<00:00:12.270> set<00:00:12.510> up<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.840> scene<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.710> kind<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.220> really

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
I've set up a scene with kind of really

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.250 
I've set up a scene with kind of really
good<00:00:14.760> colors<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.300> good<00:00:15.420> ambient<00:00:15.870> light<00:00:16.049> but

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
good colors and good ambient light but

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.230 
good colors and good ambient light but
it's<00:00:16.380> all<00:00:16.470> very<00:00:16.680> low<00:00:16.950> light<00:00:17.189> now<00:00:17.880> what<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> want

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
it's all very low light now what I want

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.880 
it's all very low light now what I want
to<00:00:18.300> quickly<00:00:18.450> teach<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.200> how<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.439> capture

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
to quickly teach you is how to capture

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.580 
to quickly teach you is how to capture
that<00:00:20.130> ambient<00:00:20.640> light<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.080> also<00:00:22.080> make<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
that ambient light and also make the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.560 
that ambient light and also make the
rest<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.070> photo<00:00:23.250> look<00:00:23.520> quite<00:00:23.760> good<00:00:23.789> now

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
rest of the photo look quite good now

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.109 
rest of the photo look quite good now
there's<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.680> few<00:00:26.190> ways<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.490> actually<00:00:26.760> taking<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
there's a few ways of actually taking a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.550 
there's a few ways of actually taking a
shot<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.869> most<00:00:28.020> people<00:00:28.440> would

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
shot like this and most people would

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.680 
shot like this and most people would
just<00:00:28.640> straightaway<00:00:29.640> attack<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.270> with<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
just straightaway attack it with a

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.350 
just straightaway attack it with a
camera<00:00:31.350> on<00:00:31.500> automatic<00:00:31.680> settings<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.640> if<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
camera on automatic settings now if the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.520 
camera on automatic settings now if the
flash<00:00:33.570> doesn't<00:00:33.809> go<00:00:33.989> off<00:00:34.140> you're<00:00:34.290> going<00:00:34.470> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
flash doesn't go off you're going to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.720 
flash doesn't go off you're going to
capture<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.920> ambient<00:00:35.280> light<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:35.610> you're

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
capture the ambient light but you're

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.040 
capture the ambient light but you're
also<00:00:35.850> going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.269> very<00:00:36.510> slow<00:00:36.780> shutter

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
also going to get a very slow shutter

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.740 
also going to get a very slow shutter
speed<00:00:37.379> or<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.890> high<00:00:38.220> ISO<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:39.360> could<00:00:39.540> lead<00:00:39.720> to

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
speed or a high ISO that could lead to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.720 
speed or a high ISO that could lead to
either<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.440> blurry<00:00:40.710> shot<00:00:41.010> from<00:00:41.160> camera<00:00:41.520> shake

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
either a blurry shot from camera shake

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
either a blurry shot from camera shake
or<00:00:41.940> you're<00:00:42.210> going<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.420> get<00:00:42.510> grain<00:00:42.750> from<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> very

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
or you're going to get grain from a very

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.260 
or you're going to get grain from a very
high<00:00:43.380> ISO<00:00:43.770> shot<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.640> also<00:00:44.790> you're<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
high ISO shot but also you're going to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.600 
high ISO shot but also you're going to
have<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.450> deal<00:00:45.630> with<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> problem<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.610> color

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
have to deal with the problem of color

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.860 
have to deal with the problem of color
balance<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> things<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.719> white

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
balance and things like that and white

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.080 
balance and things like that and white
balance<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:50.130> as<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:50.969> this

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
balance because as you can see here this

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.049 
balance because as you can see here this
is<00:00:51.270> very<00:00:51.450> very<00:00:51.600> low-key<00:00:52.530> colors<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.129> this

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
is very very low-key colors and this

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
is very very low-key colors and this
keyboard<00:00:54.540> is<00:00:54.660> actually<00:00:54.750> grey<00:00:55.140> around<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
keyboard is actually grey around the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.630 
keyboard is actually grey around the
edges<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.040> would<00:00:56.129> probably<00:00:56.160> come<00:00:56.520> out

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
edges but that would probably come out

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.069 
edges but that would probably come out
quite<00:00:56.879> orange<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> were<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> take<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
quite orange if you were to take the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.440 
quite orange if you were to take the
shot<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.940> said<00:01:00.000> if<00:01:00.360> you're

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
shot as it is and like I said if you're

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.090 
shot as it is and like I said if you're
going<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.629> take<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.020> low-light<00:01:01.440> you're

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
going to take it in low-light you're

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.380 
going to take it in low-light you're
gonna<00:01:02.219> use<00:01:02.399> handheld<00:01:02.700> and<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> slow

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
gonna use handheld and get a slow

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.719 
gonna use handheld and get a slow
shutter<00:01:03.600> speed<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.440> we've<00:01:05.160> set<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.399> a<00:01:05.550> shot

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
shutter speed so we've set up a shot

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.310 
shutter speed so we've set up a shot
here<00:01:05.940> using<00:01:06.300> a<00:01:06.360> tripod<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.810> take<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> shot

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
here using a tripod to take the shot

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.389 
here using a tripod to take the shot
just<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> illustrate<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.039> point<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.310> I'm

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
just to illustrate the point but I'm

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.340 
just to illustrate the point but I'm
gonna<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.640> three<00:01:08.940> shots<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.810> first<00:01:10.080> shot<00:01:10.259> is

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
gonna take three shots the first shot is

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.040 
gonna take three shots the first shot is
going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.429> camera<00:01:11.819> set<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.330> auto

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
going to be just the camera set on auto

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.350 
going to be just the camera set on auto
ISO<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.069> the<00:01:14.190> is<00:01:14.399> he'll<00:01:14.580> probably<00:01:14.789> raise<00:01:15.060> quite

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
ISO so the is he'll probably raise quite

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.210 
ISO so the is he'll probably raise quite
a<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.660> i<00:01:15.840> want<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> shut<00:01:16.410> a<00:01:16.440> priority<00:01:17.039> on<00:01:17.190> a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
a bit i want to shut a priority on a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
a bit i want to shut a priority on a
hundredth<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.789> second<00:01:18.200> actually<00:01:19.200> let's

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
hundredth of a second actually let's

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.249 
hundredth of a second actually let's
change<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:20.119> I'm<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.360> set<00:01:21.569> that<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.289> a

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
change that I'm going to set that to a

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.990 
change that I'm going to set that to a
50th<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.319> a<00:01:25.410> second<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.490> capture<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
50th of a second so that we capture the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.490 
50th of a second so that we capture the
ambient<00:01:27.390> light<00:01:27.599> so<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:27.990> slow<00:01:28.170> enough<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
ambient light so it's slow enough to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.249 
ambient light so it's slow enough to
capture<00:01:28.679> that<00:01:28.890> ambient<00:01:29.250> light<00:01:29.810> but<00:01:30.810> also<00:01:30.959> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
capture that ambient light but also the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.389 
capture that ambient light but also the
aperture<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.649> going<00:01:31.800> to<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.220> wide

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
aperture is going to go really wide

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:33.859 
aperture is going to go really wide
because<00:01:32.640> obviously<00:01:32.880> we're<00:01:33.149> looking<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:33.599> quite

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
because obviously we're looking at quite

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.660 
because obviously we're looking at quite
a<00:01:33.929> lot<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.319> light<00:01:34.770> needed<00:01:35.190> to<00:01:35.280> come<00:01:35.429> in<00:01:35.550> through

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
a lot of light needed to come in through

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.339 
a lot of light needed to come in through
the<00:01:35.819> camera<00:01:36.179> and<00:01:36.330> then<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.020> we're<00:01:37.140> going<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
the camera and then what we're going to

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.859 
the camera and then what we're going to
do<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.800> throw<00:01:38.399> in<00:01:38.610> flash<00:01:39.090> because<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.509> second

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
do is throw in flash because the second

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.150 
do is throw in flash because the second
thing<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> lot<00:01:40.319> of<00:01:40.349> people<00:01:40.649> would<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.950> when

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
thing that a lot of people would do when

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.620 
thing that a lot of people would do when
they<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.429> situation<00:01:41.729> or<00:01:42.179> a<00:01:42.209> scene<00:01:42.420> like

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
they see a situation or a scene like

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.410 
they see a situation or a scene like
this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.080> just<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.099> plunk<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> flash<00:01:44.940> on<00:01:45.179> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
this is just a plunk the flash on and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.089 
this is just a plunk the flash on and
take<00:01:45.690> a<00:01:45.720> shot<00:01:45.929> with<00:01:46.080> flash<00:01:46.349> and<00:01:46.649> what<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:47.099 
take a shot with flash and what that

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:49.070 
take a shot with flash and what that
will<00:01:47.190> do<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> normally<00:01:47.819> kill<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.660> ambient

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
will do is normally kill all the ambient

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.330 
will do is normally kill all the ambient
lights<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.500> we'll<00:01:49.590> show<00:01:49.739> you<00:01:49.770> how<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.039> works

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
lights and we'll show you how that works

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.279 
lights and we'll show you how that works
in<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.640> second<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.599> last<00:01:51.810> shot<00:01:51.989> I'm<00:01:52.050> going<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
in a second the last shot I'm going to

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.440 
in a second the last shot I'm going to
do<00:01:52.410> is<00:01:52.619> show<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:52.920> how<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.130> combine<00:01:53.489> bounced

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
do is show you how to combine bounced

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.109 
do is show you how to combine bounced
flash<00:01:54.720> with<00:01:55.590> ambient<00:01:56.280> light<00:01:56.459> to<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:56.849> the<00:01:56.940> best

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
flash with ambient light to get the best

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.999 
flash with ambient light to get the best
image<00:01:57.330> so<00:01:58.020> let's<00:01:58.200> take<00:01:58.349> those<00:01:58.500> three<00:01:58.770> shots

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
image so let's take those three shots

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.109 
image so let's take those three shots
now<00:01:59.220> we've<00:01:59.369> got<00:01:59.520> everything<00:01:59.759> set<00:01:59.910> up

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
now we've got everything set up

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.990 
now we've got everything set up
everything's<00:02:00.690> okay<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:02.280> we've<00:02:02.459> got<00:02:02.489> ambient

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
everything's okay so we've got ambient

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.249 
everything's okay so we've got ambient
light<00:02:03.149> from<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> screen<00:02:03.690> there<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.020> screen

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
light from the screen there the screen

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.960 
light from the screen there the screen
there<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.500> lights<00:02:04.830> behind<00:02:05.039> there's<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.700> little

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
there the lights behind there's a little

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.510 
there the lights behind there's a little
light<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.390> computer<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.140> we've<00:02:08.009> also<00:02:08.190> got

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
light on the computer and we've also got

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.979 
light on the computer and we've also got
whatever<00:02:08.910> light<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.149> hitting<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.720> rest<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
whatever light is hitting the rest of

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.479 
whatever light is hitting the rest of
the<00:02:10.080> objects<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> room<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.039> let's<00:02:11.310> try

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
the objects in the room so let's try

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.100 
the objects in the room so let's try
that<00:02:11.670> now<00:02:11.730> we're<00:02:12.510> going<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.660> take<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> first

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that now we're going to take the first

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.720 
that now we're going to take the first
shot<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.739> want<00:02:13.950> me<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.069> see<00:02:14.250> me<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:14.519> but<00:02:14.640> we're

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
shot you want me to see me now but we're

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.640 
shot you want me to see me now but we're
going<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.879> take<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> first<00:02:15.329> shot<00:02:16.519> with

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
going to take the first shot with

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.760 
going to take the first shot with
fiftieth<00:02:19.650> per<00:02:19.800> second<00:02:21.050> 1.4<00:02:22.050> aperture<00:02:22.590> and

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
fiftieth per second 1.4 aperture and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.580 
fiftieth per second 1.4 aperture and
it's<00:02:23.430> giving<00:02:23.700> me<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.300> over<00:02:24.510> 320<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.440> let's

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
it's giving me a is over 320 so let's

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.910 
it's giving me a is over 320 so let's
take<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.920> shot<00:02:27.260> now<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.350> can<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:28.680> there

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
take that shot now you can see there

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.730 
take that shot now you can see there
that<00:02:29.550> we've<00:02:29.670> actually<00:02:29.790> captured<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:31.350> ambient

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
that we've actually captured the ambient

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.830 
that we've actually captured the ambient
light<00:02:31.920> really<00:02:32.250> nicely<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.150> bright<00:02:33.360> screen<00:02:33.690> on

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
light really nicely the bright screen on

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.390 
light really nicely the bright screen on
the<00:02:33.930> left<00:02:34.110> has<00:02:34.260> taken<00:02:34.620> most<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.010> exposure

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the left has taken most of the exposure

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.790 
the left has taken most of the exposure
so<00:02:36.150> we<00:02:36.180> could<00:02:36.450> increase<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> exposure<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
so we could increase the exposure to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.990 
so we could increase the exposure to
actually<00:02:38.100> account<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:38.700> what<00:02:38.910> we're

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
actually account for that but what we're

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.940 
actually account for that but what we're
going<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.150> do<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.390> lose<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.750> white<00:02:39.900> screen<00:02:40.290> but

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
going to do is lose the white screen but

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.260 
going to do is lose the white screen but
we've<00:02:41.070> captured<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.490> ambient<00:02:41.820> light<00:02:42.000> really

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
we've captured the ambient light really

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.680 
we've captured the ambient light really
nicely<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.960> can<00:02:43.110> see<00:02:43.320> there<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.800> that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
nicely so you can see there that that

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.760 
nicely so you can see there that that
setting<00:02:45.690> has<00:02:45.930> worked<00:02:46.170> we're<00:02:46.410> on<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.530> tripod

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
setting has worked we're on a tripod

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.410 
setting has worked we're on a tripod
we've<00:02:47.100> got<00:02:47.190> no<00:02:47.310> camera<00:02:47.670> shake<00:02:47.850> 50th<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.330> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
we've got no camera shake 50th of a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.660 
we've got no camera shake 50th of a
second<00:02:48.810> 1.4<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> bit<00:02:50.040> shallow<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.520> depth

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
second 1.4 is a bit shallow for a depth

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.830 
second 1.4 is a bit shallow for a depth
of<00:02:50.790> field<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.180> what<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.420> could<00:02:51.600> do<00:02:51.720> is

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
of field so what you could do is

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.050 
of field so what you could do is
increase<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> ISO<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.920> close<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.850> aperture

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
increase the ISO and close the aperture

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.970 
increase the ISO and close the aperture
down<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.360> bit<00:02:54.630> but<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:55.140> illustration<00:02:55.560> purposes

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
down a bit but for illustration purposes

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.590 
down a bit but for illustration purposes
we're<00:02:56.130> just<00:02:56.160> showing<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.580> there<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.480> we've

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
we're just showing you there that we've

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.310 
we're just showing you there that we've
got<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:58.140> reasonable<00:02:59.130> shot<00:02:59.900> just<00:03:00.900> from<00:03:01.110> using

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
got a reasonable shot just from using

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.580 
got a reasonable shot just from using
the<00:03:02.390> just<00:03:03.390> using<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> camera<00:03:03.900> with<00:03:04.170> no<00:03:04.290> flash

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
the just using the camera with no flash

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.949 
the just using the camera with no flash
we've<00:03:05.070> captured<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.520> ambient<00:03:05.820> light<00:03:05.970> okay<00:03:06.390> so

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
we've captured the ambient light okay so

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.570 
we've captured the ambient light okay so
now<00:03:07.140> what<00:03:07.290> I'm<00:03:07.470> going<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.650> do<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:08.280> set<00:03:08.550> the

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
now what I'm going to do is set the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.510 
now what I'm going to do is set the
camera<00:03:09.440> with<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.560> flash<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:11.070> take<00:03:11.250> another

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
camera with the flash to take another

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.480 
camera with the flash to take another
shot<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:11.820> let's<00:03:12.240> do<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:13.100> I'm<00:03:14.100> actually<00:03:14.280> going

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
shot so let's do that I'm actually going

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.330 
shot so let's do that I'm actually going
to<00:03:14.550> set<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:17.240> manual<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.920> I'm<00:03:19.920> going<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.190> go

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
to set it to manual and I'm going to go

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.580 
to set it to manual and I'm going to go
to<00:03:21.410> sixtieth<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.560> second<00:03:22.920> again<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.600> F<00:03:24.600> 7.1

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
to sixtieth of a second again and F 7.1

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.890 
to sixtieth of a second again and F 7.1
let's<00:03:25.800> go<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:25.980> f/8<00:03:26.360> I'm<00:03:27.360> going<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.570> switch<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
let's go to f/8 I'm going to switch the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.130 
let's go to f/8 I'm going to switch the
flash<00:03:28.110> on<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.920> we're<00:03:29.100> using<00:03:29.280> ETTL<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.989> I'm

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
flash on and we're using ETTL and I'm

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.570 
flash on and we're using ETTL and I'm
going<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.320> I'm<00:03:31.590> going<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.769> fire<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.160> directly

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
going to I'm going to fire it directly

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.890 
going to I'm going to fire it directly
out<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.880> scene<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:33.480> just<00:03:33.540> going<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.780> be<00:03:33.870> a

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
out the scene so it's just going to be a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.780 
out the scene so it's just going to be a
straightforward<00:03:34.200> shot<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.340> scene<00:03:35.550> using

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
straightforward shot to the scene using

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.840 
straightforward shot to the scene using
direct<00:03:36.239> flash<00:03:36.420> let's<00:03:36.660> see<00:03:36.780> how<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.019> goes

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
direct flash let's see how that goes

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.350 
direct flash let's see how that goes
okay<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:38.910> sixth<00:03:39.360> of<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.570> second<00:03:39.900> f8<00:03:40.790> auto<00:03:41.790> ISO

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
okay so sixth of a second f8 auto ISO

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.210 
okay so sixth of a second f8 auto ISO
which<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:42.630> going<00:03:42.840> up<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.050> 400<00:03:43.500> on<00:03:43.560> manual<00:03:43.980> and

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
which is going up to 400 on manual and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.020 
which is going up to 400 on manual and
we've<00:03:44.370> got<00:03:44.600> straightforward<00:03:45.600> flash<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.940> you

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
we've got straightforward flash and you

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.840 
we've got straightforward flash and you
can<00:03:48.180> see<00:03:48.390> there<00:03:48.650> what's<00:03:49.650> happened<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.190> the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
can see there what's happened is the

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.120 
can see there what's happened is the
flash<00:03:51.180> has<00:03:51.510> completely<00:03:51.959> killed<00:03:52.380> all<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:53.040> the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
flash has completely killed all of the

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.090 
flash has completely killed all of the
ambient<00:03:53.430> light<00:03:53.750> there's<00:03:54.750> it's<00:03:55.530> lit<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.890> scene

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
ambient light there's it's lit the scene

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.400 
ambient light there's it's lit the scene
okay<00:03:56.310> but<00:03:57.300> really<00:03:57.480> we've<00:03:57.870> killed<00:03:58.140> all<00:03:58.320> the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
okay but really we've killed all the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.080 
okay but really we've killed all the
ambient<00:03:58.769> light<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:58.950> there's<00:03:59.190> no<00:03:59.340> pleasing

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
ambient light and there's no pleasing

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.910 
ambient light and there's no pleasing
lights<00:04:00.480> anymore<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.050> flashes<00:04:01.470> just<00:04:01.680> dulled

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
lights anymore the flashes just dulled

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.520 
lights anymore the flashes just dulled
all<00:04:02.070> that<00:04:02.250> let's<00:04:02.430> have<00:04:02.550> another<00:04:02.640> go<00:04:02.970> at<00:04:03.060> that

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
all that let's have another go at that

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.080 
all that let's have another go at that
let's<00:04:04.530> increase<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:05.040> flash<00:04:05.250> slightly<00:04:05.760> take

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
let's increase the flash slightly take

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.370 
let's increase the flash slightly take
another<00:04:06.360> shot<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.600> can<00:04:09.750> see<00:04:09.900> yet<00:04:10.110> again

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
another shot and you can see yet again

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.770 
another shot and you can see yet again
even<00:04:10.620> if<00:04:10.709> we<00:04:10.800> power<00:04:11.100> up<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.340> lights<00:04:11.690> from<00:04:12.690> the

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
even if we power up the lights from the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.330 
even if we power up the lights from the
flash<00:04:13.019> there's<00:04:13.410> absolutely<00:04:13.739> no<00:04:13.920> ambient

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
flash there's absolutely no ambient

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.810 
flash there's absolutely no ambient
lighting<00:04:14.519> whatsoever<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:17.190> next<00:04:17.400> trick<00:04:17.609> to

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
lighting whatsoever so the next trick to

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.880 
lighting whatsoever so the next trick to
this<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:19.850> not<00:04:20.850> fire<00:04:21.359> direct<00:04:21.900> flash<00:04:22.200> at<00:04:22.710> the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
this is to not fire direct flash at the

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.170 
this is to not fire direct flash at the
actual<00:04:23.100> scene<00:04:23.430> because<00:04:23.790> that's<00:04:24.000> what's

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
actual scene because that's what's

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.000 
actual scene because that's what's
killing<00:04:24.360> out<00:04:24.600> all<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.990> ambient<00:04:25.530> light<00:04:25.710> and

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
killing out all the ambient light and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.770 
killing out all the ambient light and
also<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.700> fast<00:04:26.880> shutter<00:04:27.120> speed<00:04:27.390> is<00:04:27.510> killing

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
also the fast shutter speed is killing

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.420 
also the fast shutter speed is killing
out<00:04:27.870> all<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.110> ambient<00:04:28.440> light<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:29.160> what<00:04:29.340> I'm

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
out all the ambient light so what I'm

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.980 
out all the ambient light so what I'm
going<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.580> do<00:04:29.700> now<00:04:29.970> it's<00:04:30.510> bounce<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.960> flash

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
going to do now it's bounce the flash

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.999 
going to do now it's bounce the flash
using<00:04:31.710> it

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
using it

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.279 
using it
user<00:04:32.189> and<00:04:32.520> also<00:04:33.059> use<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.389> very<00:04:33.749> very<00:04:33.869> low

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
user and also use a very very low

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.230 
user and also use a very very low
shutter<00:04:34.559> speed<00:04:34.889> so<00:04:35.189> I'm<00:04:35.639> going<00:04:35.909> to<00:04:35.939> set<00:04:36.119> that

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
shutter speed so I'm going to set that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.189 
shutter speed so I'm going to set that
up<00:04:36.300> let's<00:04:36.809> put<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.080> flash<00:04:37.319> diffuser<00:04:38.039> on<00:04:39.199> and

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
up let's put the flash diffuser on and

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.629 
up let's put the flash diffuser on and
we're<00:04:40.800> going<00:04:40.919> to<00:04:40.979> bounce<00:04:41.159> it<00:04:41.399> from<00:04:41.550> the

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
we're going to bounce it from the

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.379 
we're going to bounce it from the
ceiling<00:04:42.029> and<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:44.550> settings<00:04:44.969> I'm<00:04:45.119> going<00:04:45.300> to

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
ceiling and the settings I'm going to

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.499 
ceiling and the settings I'm going to
give<00:04:45.509> this<00:04:45.800> still<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.860> manual<00:04:47.339> I'm<00:04:48.149> going<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.419> go

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
give this still a manual I'm going to go

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.869 
give this still a manual I'm going to go
down<00:04:48.779> to<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.409> sixth<00:04:50.099> of<00:04:50.189> a<00:04:50.309> second

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
down to a sixth of a second

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.629 
down to a sixth of a second
stay<00:04:51.479> on<00:04:51.509> f/8<00:04:52.129> I'm<00:04:53.129> going<00:04:53.279> to<00:04:53.339> stay<00:04:53.490> on

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
stay on f/8 I'm going to stay on

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.889 
stay on f/8 I'm going to stay on
automatic<00:04:55.099> ISO<00:04:56.099> and<00:04:56.399> I'm<00:04:57.300> going<00:04:57.509> to<00:04:57.539> actually

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:57.899 
automatic ISO and I'm going to actually

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:00.320 
automatic ISO and I'm going to actually
decrease<00:04:58.529> the<00:04:58.559> flash<00:04:59.039> output<00:04:59.279> a<00:04:59.490> bit<00:04:59.759> let's

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
decrease the flash output a bit let's

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.420 
decrease the flash output a bit let's
see<00:05:00.449> what<00:05:00.569> happens<00:05:00.809> there<00:05:01.080> I'm<00:05:01.439> decreasing<00:05:02.159> it

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
see what happens there I'm decreasing it

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.570 
see what happens there I'm decreasing it
by<00:05:02.580> one<00:05:02.879> so<00:05:03.779> now<00:05:04.050> what<00:05:05.009> I'm<00:05:05.099> hoping<00:05:05.279> is<00:05:05.490> going

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
by one so now what I'm hoping is going

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.889 
by one so now what I'm hoping is going
to<00:05:05.669> happen<00:05:05.909> the<00:05:06.029> slow<00:05:06.240> shutter<00:05:06.449> speed<00:05:06.719> of<00:05:06.839> a

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:06.899 
to happen the slow shutter speed of a

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:08.719 
to happen the slow shutter speed of a
sixth<00:05:07.139> of<00:05:07.199> a<00:05:07.259> second<00:05:07.649> will<00:05:07.830> keep<00:05:08.490> all<00:05:08.639> the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
sixth of a second will keep all the

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.969 
sixth of a second will keep all the
ambient<00:05:09.089> light<00:05:09.270> in<00:05:09.479> f/8<00:05:10.379> will<00:05:10.559> control<00:05:10.860> the

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
ambient light in f/8 will control the

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.619 
ambient light in f/8 will control the
flash<00:05:11.219> then<00:05:12.029> we're<00:05:12.240> going<00:05:12.360> to<00:05:12.419> give<00:05:12.509> it<00:05:12.599> just

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629 
flash then we're going to give it just

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.489 
flash then we're going to give it just
slightly<00:05:13.229> less<00:05:13.469> flash<00:05:13.770> than<00:05:13.949> normal<00:05:14.339> and<00:05:15.499> ISO

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:16.499 
slightly less flash than normal and ISO

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.239 
slightly less flash than normal and ISO
400<00:05:16.800> let's<00:05:17.219> see<00:05:17.309> what<00:05:17.430> happens<00:05:17.669> there<00:05:19.249> you

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:20.249 
400 let's see what happens there you

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:21.679 
400 let's see what happens there you
heard<00:05:20.460> there<00:05:20.699> it<00:05:20.849> was<00:05:20.939> a<00:05:20.969> much<00:05:21.270> slower<00:05:21.569> shutter

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:21.689 
heard there it was a much slower shutter

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:23.570 
heard there it was a much slower shutter
speed<00:05:22.199> and<00:05:22.469> if<00:05:22.800> you<00:05:22.919> look<00:05:23.069> at<00:05:23.189> that<00:05:23.309> image<00:05:23.430> now

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
speed and if you look at that image now

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.869 
speed and if you look at that image now
you<00:05:24.419> look<00:05:24.569> at<00:05:24.659> the<00:05:24.749> difference<00:05:25.139> the<00:05:25.889> flash<00:05:26.490> has

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:26.879 
you look at the difference the flash has

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.909 
you look at the difference the flash has
actually<00:05:27.180> lit<00:05:27.449> the<00:05:28.080> objects<00:05:28.469> quite<00:05:28.709> well

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
actually lit the objects quite well

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.230 
actually lit the objects quite well
quite<00:05:29.279> nicely<00:05:29.490> they've<00:05:29.789> given<00:05:30.029> them<00:05:30.149> the

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
quite nicely they've given them the

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.239 
quite nicely they've given them the
correct<00:05:30.449> colors<00:05:30.779> which<00:05:30.930> is<00:05:31.050> gray<00:05:31.349> we've<00:05:32.099> also

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:32.249 
correct colors which is gray we've also

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:33.920 
correct colors which is gray we've also
kept<00:05:32.699> all<00:05:32.879> the<00:05:33.119> ambient<00:05:33.479> light<00:05:33.629> in<00:05:33.809> the

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
kept all the ambient light in the

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.260 
kept all the ambient light in the
background<00:05:34.110> and<00:05:34.969> everything<00:05:35.969> is<00:05:36.089> lit

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
background and everything is lit

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.079 
background and everything is lit
absolutely<00:05:36.719> perfectly<00:05:37.520> so<00:05:38.520> if<00:05:38.669> we<00:05:38.819> just<00:05:38.939> look

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.089 
absolutely perfectly so if we just look

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.850 
absolutely perfectly so if we just look
through<00:05:39.240> those<00:05:39.449> again<00:05:39.689> quickly<00:05:40.199> the<00:05:40.649> first

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
through those again quickly the first

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.949 
through those again quickly the first
shot<00:05:41.189> using<00:05:41.610> no<00:05:41.939> flash<00:05:42.240> but<00:05:42.479> just<00:05:42.689> the<00:05:42.749> slow

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:42.959 
shot using no flash but just the slow

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:44.929 
shot using no flash but just the slow
shutter<00:05:42.990> speed<00:05:43.499> captured<00:05:44.339> all<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.459> ambient

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:44.939 
shutter speed captured all the ambient

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.540 
shutter speed captured all the ambient
light<00:05:45.199> but<00:05:46.199> it<00:05:46.289> didn't<00:05:46.589> capture<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.979> rest<00:05:47.399> of

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
light but it didn't capture the rest of

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.709 
light but it didn't capture the rest of
the<00:05:47.639> surrounding<00:05:48.120> things<00:05:48.389> that<00:05:48.539> were<00:05:48.629> in

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
the surrounding things that were in

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.259 
the surrounding things that were in
darkness<00:05:49.069> and<00:05:50.069> also<00:05:50.370> you<00:05:50.459> in<00:05:50.580> danger<00:05:50.759> of<00:05:51.089> with

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:51.269 
darkness and also you in danger of with

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:53.269 
darkness and also you in danger of with
a<00:05:51.300> slow<00:05:51.509> shutter<00:05:51.749> speed<00:05:52.080> getting<00:05:52.680> a<00:05:52.889> very

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
a slow shutter speed getting a very

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.670 
a slow shutter speed getting a very
shaky<00:05:53.610> shot<00:05:53.969> the<00:05:54.870> second<00:05:55.199> shot<00:05:55.379> where<00:05:55.589> we

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
shaky shot the second shot where we

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.439 
shaky shot the second shot where we
fired<00:05:55.979> direct<00:05:56.430> flash<00:05:56.639> straight<00:05:56.999> at<00:05:57.149> the<00:05:57.209> scene

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
fired direct flash straight at the scene

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.360 
fired direct flash straight at the scene
killed<00:05:57.899> all<00:05:58.139> the<00:05:58.319> ambient<00:05:58.680> light<00:05:58.830> because<00:05:59.159> as

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
killed all the ambient light because as

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.100 
killed all the ambient light because as
soon<00:05:59.580> as<00:05:59.669> the<00:05:59.759> light<00:05:59.939> hit<00:06:00.089> the<00:06:00.180> subject<00:06:00.629> it

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
soon as the light hit the subject it

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.110 
soon as the light hit the subject it
bounced<00:06:01.409> back<00:06:01.620> and<00:06:01.860> switched<00:06:02.099> off<00:06:02.309> the<00:06:02.550> the

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
bounced back and switched off the the

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.420 
bounced back and switched off the the
flash<00:06:03.599> and<00:06:03.899> it<00:06:04.259> basically<00:06:04.379> killed<00:06:05.249> that

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
flash and it basically killed that

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.040 
flash and it basically killed that
exposure<00:06:05.759> so<00:06:06.149> that<00:06:06.330> and<00:06:06.449> also<00:06:06.779> we're<00:06:06.930> on<00:06:06.990> a

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
exposure so that and also we're on a

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.079 
exposure so that and also we're on a
relatively<00:06:07.409> fast<00:06:07.680> shutter<00:06:07.919> speed<00:06:08.279> or<00:06:08.309> even<00:06:08.669> if

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.089 
relatively fast shutter speed or even if

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:10.040 
relatively fast shutter speed or even if
you're<00:06:09.180> on<00:06:09.269> a<00:06:09.330> slower<00:06:09.509> shutter<00:06:09.599> speed<00:06:10.019> the

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
you're on a slower shutter speed the

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.049 
you're on a slower shutter speed the
flash<00:06:10.649> still<00:06:10.919> kills<00:06:11.189> ambient<00:06:11.639> light<00:06:11.759> so<00:06:11.909> it's

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:12.059 
flash still kills ambient light so it's

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:14.839 
flash still kills ambient light so it's
no<00:06:12.180> good<00:06:12.479> so<00:06:13.259> finally<00:06:13.800> we<00:06:14.399> bounce<00:06:14.639> the<00:06:14.819> flash

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
no good so finally we bounce the flash

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.079 
no good so finally we bounce the flash
we<00:06:15.779> slowly<00:06:16.259> bring<00:06:16.889> the<00:06:16.919> flash<00:06:17.249> power<00:06:17.639> down<00:06:18.059> a

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.089 
we slowly bring the flash power down a

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.360 
we slowly bring the flash power down a
bit<00:06:18.389> but<00:06:18.959> also<00:06:19.110> to<00:06:19.409> slow<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.949> shutter<00:06:20.159> speed

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
bit but also to slow the shutter speed

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.799 
bit but also to slow the shutter speed
right<00:06:20.729> down<00:06:20.939> and<00:06:21.149> plunk<00:06:21.360> the<00:06:21.479> camera<00:06:21.719> on<00:06:21.779> a

00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:21.809 
right down and plunk the camera on a

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:24.110 
right down and plunk the camera on a
tripod<00:06:21.959> so<00:06:22.740> by<00:06:22.979> using<00:06:23.159> a<00:06:23.370> really<00:06:23.669> slow<00:06:23.879> shutter

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
tripod so by using a really slow shutter

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.429 
tripod so by using a really slow shutter
speed<00:06:24.389> of<00:06:24.419> a<00:06:24.569> sixth<00:06:24.809> of<00:06:24.870> a<00:06:24.959> second<00:06:25.319> you've

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:25.439 
speed of a sixth of a second you've

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:27.439 
speed of a sixth of a second you've
captured<00:06:25.680> all<00:06:25.889> the<00:06:25.919> ambient<00:06:26.370> light<00:06:26.519> we've<00:06:27.240> got

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
captured all the ambient light we've got

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:29.149 
captured all the ambient light we've got
the<00:06:27.569> flash<00:06:27.870> that<00:06:28.050> it's<00:06:28.169> lit<00:06:28.349> the<00:06:28.469> subject<00:06:28.919> just

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
the flash that it's lit the subject just

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:31.040 
the flash that it's lit the subject just
enough<00:06:29.490> to<00:06:29.639> actually<00:06:29.969> bring<00:06:30.449> out<00:06:30.569> the<00:06:30.689> detail

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
enough to actually bring out the detail

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.389 
enough to actually bring out the detail
and<00:06:31.199> the<00:06:31.259> proper<00:06:31.529> colors<00:06:31.830> of<00:06:31.949> everything<00:06:32.279> in

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:32.399 
and the proper colors of everything in

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:34.459 
and the proper colors of everything in
the<00:06:32.550> subject<00:06:32.969> but<00:06:33.449> the<00:06:33.599> ambient<00:06:33.990> light<00:06:34.139> looks

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
the subject but the ambient light looks

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:35.600 
the subject but the ambient light looks
absolutely<00:06:34.860> brilliant

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
absolutely brilliant

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.369 
absolutely brilliant
so<00:06:35.939> you<00:06:35.999> can<00:06:36.209> use<00:06:36.419> this<00:06:36.569> technique<00:06:36.809> for<00:06:37.259> if

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:37.379 
so you can use this technique for if
