00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.469
 zuma always amazed the market 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.940
 introducing revolutionary products 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.400
 useful and not often generated 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.900
 true trends or imitated by many 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.609
 other manufacturers 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.740
 after leading to the success of fendi 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.930
 audio and video recorder company 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.769
 Japanese continued to address the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.800
 own attention to development 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.150
 of guitar and bass effects 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.369
 introducing pedalboards like the g3 is the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.439
 g5 and proposing features 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.710
 high quality sound at a price 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.540
 incredibly convenient passion 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 of zoom to enclose an entire world 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.660
 in a small box and note since 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.879
 times of the 9200 model of 1989 comes 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.460
 therefore respected this tradition in the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.129
 new jewel just presented our 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.610
 hundred bt this pedal follows the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.440
 operation of the predecessor ns50 g ma 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.750
 introduces some new features 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.329
 extremely interesting as the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.129
 predecessor consists of a pedal cash 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.989
 single but actually offers the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.840
 possibility to choose between 100 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.150
 different effects against 55 of the ms 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.490
 50 certainly very interesting 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.430
 listen to the variety and quality of 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.990
 effects available in our hundred bt 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.060
 we therefore invite you to click on the buttons 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.680
 which you see in overlay for 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.490
 directly access the demos on 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.659
 sounds divided by defect type 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.189
 instead continuing to explore the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.140
 new for this new pedal 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.470
 we confirm the possibility of using 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.240
 6 effects simultaneously creating 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.920
 so of the real chains of 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.500
 editable presets with the maximum 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.720
 precision and storable in 50 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.600
 different user presets that can 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.979
 be called up manually 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.899
 organized in a progressive list with 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.710
 the ability to advance a preset 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.540
 at each press of the central button 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.880
 rs 100 bt can be easily 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.399
 integrated as a joker pedal inside 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.469
 of your pedalboard involves how 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.509
 any traditional pedal and can more 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.460
 to be connected both between the instrument 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.860
 is the input of the amplifier both in 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.969
 perfect looks 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.250
 having inside also some 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.899
 Amp simulations can be 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.039
 used with a simple ending of 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.989
 power 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.640
 cabinet simulation allows 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.830
 also the connection directly to a 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.319
 mixer thus reducing to the minimum terms 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.209
 the bulk of our instrumentation e 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.700
 making it a very useful pedal too 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.250
 for jam sessions where you don't know what's there 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.920
 the big news will be connected 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.170
 of ms one hundred bt but it resides really 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.209
 in the final letters of his name bt 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.620
 city the fact bluetooth saw that 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.049
 this pedal can be easily 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.560
 interfaced with ios devices 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.540
 through this technology itunes is 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.760
 free stop application available 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.120
 share that once downloaded on your 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.680
 ipad iphone or ipod touch will allow you 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.019
 to synchronize the pedal with yours 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.580
 apple device in the same way 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.519
 in which to perform ste any 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.680
 accessory equipped with the same system 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.670
 once the first is done 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.220
 tuning the pedal and the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.930
 ios device will recognize you and 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.510
 they will be ready to talk each time 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.459
 which will be turned on then you will access a 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.200
 virtual store where you can 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.359
 buy lots of new effects e 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.579
 amp simulations to render 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.690
 your ms a hundred bt more and more unique e 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.220
 rich 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.540
 let's find out more about the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.060
 operation of this very useful 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.280
 application as you can see are 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.680
 available pedals like the chip screen 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.510
 the big match a korjus boss but also 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.049
 various amps like a frank in 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.760
 orange a bomber and many others 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.920
 all these updates are a lot 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.540
 in fact you can buy cheap 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.850
 a new effect starting from 89 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.090
 cents and an amplifier for one euro 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.859
 and 79 you can also browse by categories 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.500
 to find the effect faster 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.609
 that interests us once identified 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.829
 the effect we were looking for 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:57.840
 we can listen to a demo to understand 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:59.730
 better sound quality of course a 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.590
 but we would need to integrate the effect 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.450
 in our set up to be able to use it with 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.310
 our tool is therefore possible 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.340
 download the effect inside the 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.810
 our ms one hundred myths and try it for 15 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.510
 minutes 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.020
 we will have a timer xvi will scan the time of 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.849
 utilization 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.400
 after which the effect will disappear from the 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.169
 pedal of course in these fifteen 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.910
 minutes we can access all the 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.550
 parameters to get an idea of â€‹â€‹all the 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.290
 functions available once convinced 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.850
 of what we want we can proceed 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.910
 to the purchase and managed like any other 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.530
 download via the itunes portal and the 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.240
 gallery effects and amplifiers 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.280
 it is regularly enriched with new ones 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.220
 models going to always expand of 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.360
 plus the tonal possibilities of the pedal 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.880
 always via the bluetooth connection 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.680
 it is possible to update the firmware every 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.560
 whenever zoom releases an upgrade 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.300
 functionality software introduction 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.430
 of bluetooth technology in a pedal 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.380
 for guitar definitely opens a new one 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.570
 way to expand the possibilities 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.430
 expressive of the musician and allows us 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.530
 to quickly obtain the effect to 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.660
 up during a recording session 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.520
 without having to leave the studio 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.350
 saving so much time and 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.800
 preserving our concentration 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.210
 the new zoom ms hundred bt is available 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.460
 at the best retailers of 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.630
 musical instruments and certainly can not 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.630
 missing in your setup
