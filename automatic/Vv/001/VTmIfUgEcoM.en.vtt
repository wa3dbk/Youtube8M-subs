00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
I got this at Walmart for about two

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.530 
I got this at Walmart for about two
dollars<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.860> sixty<00:03:50.280> nine<00:03:50.310> cents<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:50.910> believe<00:03:51.240> I

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
dollars and sixty nine cents I believe I

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.370 
dollars and sixty nine cents I believe I
did<00:03:52.170> feed<00:03:52.440> at<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.620> gas<00:03:53.580> station<00:03:54.260> for<00:03:55.260> about

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
did feed at a gas station for about

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.590 
did feed at a gas station for about
three<00:03:55.830> dollars<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.580> I<00:03:56.610> guess<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.330> price

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
three dollars so I guess the price

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.440 
three dollars so I guess the price
varies<00:03:58.050> depending<00:03:58.440> on<00:03:58.560> where<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.770> go<00:03:58.950> um<00:03:59.450> some

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.520 
varies depending on where you go um some

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.030 
bottle I think it's worth it though
I<00:04:09.860> mean<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:10.950> tastes<00:04:11.190> good<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:12.800> let's<00:04:13.800> face<00:04:13.980> it

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
I mean it tastes good and let's face it

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.500 
I mean it tastes good and let's face it
it's<00:04:14.370> hard<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.760> get<00:04:14.910> our<00:04:15.090> fruits<00:04:15.360> and

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
it's hard to get our fruits and

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.390 
it's hard to get our fruits and
vegetables<00:04:15.900> in<00:04:16.140> every<00:04:16.530> day<00:04:16.709> well<00:04:16.980> for<00:04:17.160> me<00:04:17.280> it

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
vegetables in every day well for me it

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.800 
vegetables in every day well for me it
is<00:04:17.600> I<00:04:18.600> think<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.200> recommended<00:04:19.680> amount<00:04:20.810> for

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
is I think the recommended amount for

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.770 
is I think the recommended amount for
women<00:04:22.230> is<00:04:22.650> about<00:04:22.680> 4<00:04:23.580> cups<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.150> fruits<00:04:24.600> and

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
women is about 4 cups of fruits and

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.050 
women is about 4 cups of fruits and
vegetables<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.230> day<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.770> then<00:04:26.220> for<00:04:26.490> men<00:04:26.760> it's

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
vegetables a day and then for men it's

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.880 
vegetables a day and then for men it's
like<00:04:27.419> 5<00:04:27.750> cups<00:04:29.270> they<00:04:30.270> say<00:04:30.600> half<00:04:31.169> of<00:04:31.440> your<00:04:31.590> plate

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
like 5 cups they say half of your plate

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.130 
like 5 cups they say half of your plate
for<00:04:32.700> each<00:04:32.940> meal<00:04:33.300> should<00:04:33.330> be<00:04:33.690> fruits<00:04:33.930> and

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
for each meal should be fruits and

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.060 
for each meal should be fruits and
vegetables<00:04:34.590> that's<00:04:35.580> hard<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.180> do<00:04:36.419> so<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.710> think

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
vegetables that's hard to do so I think

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.490 
vegetables that's hard to do so I think
it's<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.490> good<00:04:38.669> way<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:38.940> get<00:04:39.150> your<00:04:39.360> fruits<00:04:40.320> and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
it's a good way to get your fruits and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.280 
it's a good way to get your fruits and
vegetables<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.810> if<00:04:42.810> you<00:04:42.930> could<00:04:43.110> for

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290
