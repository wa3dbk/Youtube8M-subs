drills and then the dribbling course
this<00:01:55.530> gets<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.729> think<00:01:57.360> 60<00:01:58.200> VC<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.430> since

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
this gets you I think 60 VC and since

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.990 
this gets you I think 60 VC and since
you<00:01:59.790> get<00:01:59.970> around<00:02:00.330> three<00:02:00.840> drills<00:02:01.619> then<00:02:02.430> that'll

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
you get around three drills then that'll

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.139 
you get around three drills then that'll
be<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> total<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.659> around<00:02:03.780> 180<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.729> once<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:06.030> you

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
be a total of around 180 so once if you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.550 
be a total of around 180 so once if you
do<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.479> bunch<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.840> times<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.289> you'll<00:02:07.440> get

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
do that a bunch of times then you'll get

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.800 
do that a bunch of times then you'll get
rack<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.580> lot<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.819> VC<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.179> don't<00:02:09.479> think<00:02:09.690> this

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
rack up a lot of VC I don't think this

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.120 
rack up a lot of VC I don't think this
is<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> easiest<00:02:10.380> way<00:02:10.619> but<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.950> definitely

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
is the easiest way but it's definitely

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.610 
is the easiest way but it's definitely
quick<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:13.709> get<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.430> know<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:15.140> bunch<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.260> VC

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
quick and you get you know a bunch of VC

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.640 
quick and you get you know a bunch of VC
for<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.040> also<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.720> just<00:02:22.019> wait<00:02:22.200> for<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.470> drip

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
for this also so just wait for the drip

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.530 
for this also so just wait for the drip
of<00:02:22.769> course<00:02:22.980> load<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.970> go<00:02:24.120> through

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
of course load you can just go through

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.809 
of course load you can just go through
it<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:25.350> don't<00:02:25.530> even<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:25.890> have<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.280> sprint

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
it you don't even really have to sprint

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.570 
it you don't even really have to sprint
I<00:02:27.120> found<00:02:27.569> because<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.980> know<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.310> get<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.459> good

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
I found because you know you get a good

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.570 
I found because you know you get a good
amount<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.880> time<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.900> I'm<00:02:31.709> not<00:02:31.950> even<00:02:32.160> sprinting

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
amount of time so I'm not even sprinting

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.220 
amount of time so I'm not even sprinting
until<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.940> end<00:02:33.120> right<00:02:33.269> here<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.019> where<00:02:34.200> i

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
until the end right here this is where i

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.380 
until the end right here this is where i
sprint<00:02:34.650> usually<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.459> go<00:02:35.549> to<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> hoop<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:38.390> so

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
sprint usually to go to the hoop and so

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.820 
sprint usually to go to the hoop and so
you<00:02:39.450> know<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.840> didn't<00:02:40.140> even<00:02:40.230> have<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.500> do<00:02:40.620> any

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
you know you didn't even have to do any

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.250 
you know you didn't even have to do any
moves<00:02:41.069> which<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.459> pretty<00:02:41.700> nice<00:02:42.110> there's<00:02:43.110> not

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
moves which is pretty nice there's not

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.440 
moves which is pretty nice there's not
like<00:02:43.470> certain<00:02:43.860> specific<00:02:44.790> move<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.209> have<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
like certain specific move you have to

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.470 
like certain specific move you have to
do<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.130> know<00:02:47.310> don't<00:02:47.700> need<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> sprint<00:02:48.299> and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
do so you know don't need a sprint and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.310 
do so you know don't need a sprint and
then<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:50.100> get<00:02:50.280> around<00:02:50.610> these<00:02:50.820> guys

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
then to get around these guys

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.680 
then to get around these guys
the<00:02:52.320> you'll<00:02:53.130> see<00:02:53.370> them<00:02:53.459> coming<00:02:53.700> up<00:02:53.880> that

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
the you'll see them coming up that

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.380 
the you'll see them coming up that
little<00:02:55.019> guy<00:02:55.200> um<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:56.010> suggest<00:02:56.790> doing<00:02:57.180> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
little guy um I suggest doing a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.390 
little guy um I suggest doing a
crossover<00:02:58.079> that's<00:02:58.530> what's<00:02:58.859> worked<00:02:59.130> for<00:02:59.250> me

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
crossover that's what's worked for me

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.940 
crossover that's what's worked for me
but<00:03:00.120> right<00:03:00.420> here<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.930> can't<00:03:01.350> even<00:03:01.560> get

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
but right here you see I can't even get

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.979 
but right here you see I can't even get
around<00:03:02.220> them<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.359> crossover<00:03:03.840> works<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:05.989> so

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
around them but a crossover works and so

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.140 
around them but a crossover works and so
that's<00:03:07.739> what<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> use<00:03:08.190> little<00:03:08.760> crossover

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
that's what I use little crossover

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.350 
that's what I use little crossover
should<00:03:09.840> be<00:03:09.930> fine

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.210 

but<00:03:14.360> usually<00:03:14.840> that's<00:03:15.170> what<00:03:15.350> hold<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:15.830> up<00:03:16.010> is

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
but usually that's what hold you up is

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.820 
but usually that's what hold you up is
those<00:03:16.970> guys<00:03:17.750> are<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.200> little<00:03:18.380> hard<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.740> get

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
those guys are a little hard to get

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.760 
those guys are a little hard to get
around<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.960> I<00:03:20.960> just<00:03:21.020> let<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.410> know<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.680> have

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
around and I just let you know you have

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.220 
around and I just let you know you have
to<00:03:22.100> go<00:03:22.220> through<00:03:22.430> every<00:03:22.790> cone<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.390> you<00:03:23.420> can't

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
to go through every cone and you can't

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.810 
to go through every cone and you can't
see<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:24.800> did<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:24.950> little<00:03:25.100> crossover<00:03:25.520> right

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
see I just did a little crossover right

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.060 
see I just did a little crossover right
there<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.180> have<00:03:26.240> to<00:03:26.660> get<00:03:27.140> there<00:03:27.320> every<00:03:27.590> cone<00:03:27.830> if

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
there I have to get there every cone if

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.470 
there I have to get there every cone if
you<00:03:28.190> miss<00:03:28.370> one<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.580> have<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.820> go<00:03:28.940> back<00:03:29.180> and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
you miss one you have to go back and

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.530 
you miss one you have to go back and
then<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:29.780> probably<00:03:30.050> fail<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:30.980> yeah<00:03:31.820> and<00:03:32.000> then

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
then you probably fail so yeah and then

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.540 
then you probably fail so yeah and then
I'll<00:03:32.900> go<00:03:33.200> do<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.590> crossover<00:03:33.980> on<00:03:34.220> this<00:03:34.370> one<00:03:34.520> I

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
I'll go do a crossover on this one I

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.430 
I'll go do a crossover on this one I
think<00:03:34.640> yeah<00:03:35.210> nice<00:03:35.450> little<00:03:35.600> crossover<00:03:36.290> and

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
think yeah nice little crossover and

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.380 
think yeah nice little crossover and
then<00:03:37.040> right<00:03:37.460> to<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.670> hoop<00:03:38.230> so<00:03:39.250> those<00:03:40.250> are<00:03:40.610> the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
then right to the hoop so those are the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.140 
then right to the hoop so those are the
drills<00:03:44.709> so<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.770> got<00:03:46.070> 60<00:03:46.520> on<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:46.820> if<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.030> do

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
drills so I got 60 on that if you do

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.480 
drills so I got 60 on that if you do
three<00:03:47.420> times<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.810> get<00:03:47.900> 180<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:49.220> can<00:03:49.340> use

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
three times to get 180 and you can use

00:03:49.490 --> 00:04:05.559 
three times to get 180 and you can use
that<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.760> buy<00:03:49.880> whatever<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.300> want

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.380 

all<00:04:06.079> right<00:04:06.260> let's<00:04:06.530> wait<00:04:06.769> for<00:04:06.950> this<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.370> load<00:04:08.150> up

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
all right let's wait for this to load up

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.630 
all right let's wait for this to load up
a<00:04:08.510> little<00:04:08.659> bit<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.459> we'll<00:04:10.459> head<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.299> next

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
a little bit and we'll head to the next

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:24.700 
a little bit and we'll head to the next

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
doesn't matter everything saves anyway

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.010 
doesn't matter everything saves anyway
you're<00:04:31.669> going<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.880> go<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.120> quick<00:04:32.419> match<00:04:32.660> team

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
you're going to go to a quick match team

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.840 
you're going to go to a quick match team
up<00:04:33.199> I<00:04:33.380> found<00:04:33.560> this<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:34.009> best<00:04:34.310> way<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.610> get

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
up I found this is the best way to get

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.920 
up I found this is the best way to get
VC<00:04:35.360> or<00:04:35.570> one<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.169> them<00:04:36.289> at<00:04:36.440> least<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.800> get<00:04:37.930> 250

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
VC or one of them at least you get 250

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.749 
VC or one of them at least you get 250
or<00:04:39.169> 260<00:04:40.099> VC<00:04:40.940> could<00:04:41.870> be<00:04:41.960> even<00:04:42.259> more<00:04:42.470> for<00:04:43.160> playing

and<00:06:33.350> you<00:06:33.620> can<00:06:33.800> have<00:06:34.100> Ray<00:06:34.430> Allen<00:06:34.820> but<00:06:34.940> you<00:06:35.030> have

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
and you can have Ray Allen but you have

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.180 
and you can have Ray Allen but you have
to<00:06:35.330> buy<00:06:35.480> him<00:06:35.780> so<00:06:35.990> I<00:06:36.020> think<00:06:36.140> it's<00:06:36.350> pretty<00:06:36.500> pretty

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
to buy him so I think it's pretty pretty

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.460 
to buy him so I think it's pretty pretty
much<00:06:37.370> pointless<00:06:37.700> but<00:06:38.000> so<00:06:38.570> you<00:06:38.990> choose<00:06:39.170> Jason

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
much pointless but so you choose Jason

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.860 
much pointless but so you choose Jason
Richardson<00:06:39.950> against<00:06:40.610> whoever<00:06:41.060> player<00:06:41.510> you

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:41.870 
Richardson against whoever player you

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.410 
Richardson against whoever player you
want<00:06:42.130> you<00:06:43.130> can<00:06:43.310> go<00:06:43.430> to<00:06:43.490> the<00:06:43.670> stats<00:06:43.940> and<00:06:44.180> find

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
want you can go to the stats and find

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.970 
want you can go to the stats and find
who's<00:06:44.660> the<00:06:44.840> worst<00:06:45.050> player<00:06:45.260> out<00:06:45.440> of<00:06:45.560> these<00:06:45.740> I

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
who's the worst player out of these I

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.800 
who's the worst player out of these I
think<00:06:46.670> I<00:06:46.760> choose<00:06:46.970> like<00:06:47.150> Nick<00:06:47.390> Young<00:06:47.600> or

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
think I choose like Nick Young or

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.170 
think I choose like Nick Young or
something<00:06:48.110> like<00:06:48.260> that<00:06:48.580> but<00:06:49.580> it<00:06:49.850> doesn't

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
something like that but it doesn't

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.810 
something like that but it doesn't
really<00:06:50.510> matter<00:06:50.780> I<00:06:51.080> try<00:06:51.830> to<00:06:51.890> choose<00:06:52.340> somebody

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
really matter I try to choose somebody

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.670 
really matter I try to choose somebody
who's<00:06:53.150> not<00:06:53.540> that<00:06:53.870> great<00:06:54.350> and<00:06:55.240> so<00:06:56.240> you<00:06:57.140> just<00:06:57.290> go

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
who's not that great and so you just go

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.950 
who's not that great and so you just go
through<00:06:57.710> here<00:06:58.250> you<00:06:59.090> can<00:06:59.120> let<00:06:59.510> the<00:06:59.630> other<00:06:59.780> guy

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
through here you can let the other guy

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.020 
through here you can let the other guy
score<00:07:00.320> just<00:07:00.950> take<00:07:01.280> threes<00:07:02.080> once<00:07:03.080> you<00:07:03.650> know
