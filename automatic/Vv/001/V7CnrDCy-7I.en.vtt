00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
know if it dries different and I got a
couple<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.129> suggestions<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.820> may<00:01:03.000> help<00:01:03.239> I

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
couple of suggestions that may help I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.929 
couple of suggestions that may help I
think<00:01:04.260> one<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> main<00:01:04.830> things<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.489> causes

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
think one of the main things it's causes

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730 
think one of the main things it's causes
stripes<00:01:06.330> even<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.049> metallics<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
stripes even with like metallics and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.420 
stripes even with like metallics and
things<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.040> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
things like that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.130 
things like that
and<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.150> color<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.720> ones<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and this this color is one ones that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.420 
and this this color is one ones that
you're<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> biggest<00:01:11.010> problem

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you're going to have the biggest problem

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.700 
you're going to have the biggest problem
with<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.450> if<00:01:12.630> you're<00:01:12.780> spraying<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.619> you're

with but if you're spraying and you're

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.140 
with but if you're spraying and you're
not<00:01:13.860> completely<00:01:14.159> parallel<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> work

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
not completely parallel with the work

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600 
not completely parallel with the work
surface<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:16.409> might<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.740> trying<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.460> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
surface you might be trying to get this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.969 
surface you might be trying to get this
gun<00:01:17.970> where<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:19.770> right

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
gun where it is and if you see right

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.789 
gun where it is and if you see right
here<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.790> you're<00:01:21.060> kind<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.619> squaring<00:01:22.619> away

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
here if you're kind of squaring away

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.899 
here if you're kind of squaring away
with<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> cup<00:01:23.369> here

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
with the cup here

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
with the cup here
that's<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.810> parallel<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> surface<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
that's not parallel with the surface you

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.249 
that's not parallel with the surface you
really<00:01:26.189> need<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.520> about<00:01:26.729> right<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.479> or<00:01:28.080> if

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
really need to be about right here or if

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.260 
really need to be about right here or if
you're<00:01:28.409> holding<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.740> gun<00:01:28.950> handle<00:01:29.610> parallel

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you're holding the gun handle parallel

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.370 
you're holding the gun handle parallel
it's<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.439> bit<00:01:31.729> uneven<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.119> way<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.290> if

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
it's a little bit uneven this way so if

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.899 
it's a little bit uneven this way so if
you<00:01:34.439> think<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:35.130> whenever<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.610> spray

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you think about it whenever that spray

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.700 
you think about it whenever that spray
pen<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.270> coming<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:37.049> coming<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.380> drier

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
pen is coming out it's coming out drier

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
pen is coming out it's coming out drier
over<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.490> wetter<00:01:39.150> over<00:01:39.479> here<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.869> your

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
over here and wetter over here and your

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.539 
over here and wetter over here and your
best<00:01:40.200> probably<00:01:40.680> you've<00:01:40.770> seen<00:01:40.799> those<00:01:41.130> stripes

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
best probably you've seen those stripes

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.149 
best probably you've seen those stripes
is<00:01:42.060> where<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> get<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.689> wet<00:01:42.960> edge<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.649> this

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
is where you get that wet edge and this

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.840 
is where you get that wet edge and this

might really need to use the DT 895 so

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.349 
might really need to use the DT 895 so
make<00:03:16.459> sure<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.910> have<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.180> right

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
reducer and as far as codes it's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.090 
reducer and as far as codes it's
recommended<00:03:22.400> 2<00:03:22.639> to<00:03:22.819> 3<00:03:23.209> medium<00:03:23.870> wet<00:03:24.230> coats<00:03:24.500> so

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
recommended 2 to 3 medium wet coats so

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.280 
recommended 2 to 3 medium wet coats so
that's<00:03:25.250> maybe<00:03:25.700> what<00:03:26.150> I<00:03:26.389> would<00:03:26.569> do<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.780> put<00:03:26.989> two

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
that's maybe what I would do is put two

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.470 
that's maybe what I would do is put two
medium<00:03:27.859> wet<00:03:28.010> coats<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.760> then<00:03:28.880> come<00:03:29.090> back<00:03:29.299> with

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
that control coder that Misco to just

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.370 
asking for medium wet put on too heavy
that<00:04:16.880> might<00:04:17.060> cause<00:04:17.269> it<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.510> dry<00:04:17.750> different<00:04:18.229> and

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
that might cause it to dry different and

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.000 
that might cause it to dry different and
cause<00:04:18.859> some<00:04:19.130> type<00:04:19.250> of<00:04:19.310> stripes<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:21.680> anyway

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
cause some type of stripes so anyway
