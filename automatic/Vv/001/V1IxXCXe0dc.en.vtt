brush it out immediately let the curl
cool<00:01:44.590> down<00:01:44.890> because<00:01:45.520> that's<00:01:45.730> how<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.030> retains

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
cool down because that's how it retains

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:55.890

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
its shape so just keep moving on you

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.950 
its shape so just keep moving on you
gotta<00:01:56.080> start<00:01:56.560> at<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.710> top<00:01:56.950> clip<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:58.240> then

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.610 
hairspray it looks like it is ancient
and<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.360> think<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.690> packaging<00:05:11.139> is<00:05:11.289> literally

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
and I think the packaging is literally

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.250 
and I think the packaging is literally
from<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.800> 70s<00:05:11.919> or<00:05:12.580> something<00:05:12.970> but<00:05:13.750> it<00:05:13.900> works

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
from the 70s or something but it works

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.150 
from the 70s or something but it works
so<00:05:15.070> well<00:05:15.100> your<00:05:15.970> hair<00:05:16.180> will<00:05:16.330> not<00:05:16.450> budge<00:05:16.950> and<00:05:17.950> I

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
usually do this on about three sections

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.420 
usually do this on about three sections
I<00:05:20.710> could<00:05:21.100> give<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.400> a<00:05:21.490> second<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:22.210> set<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:24.280> back

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
I could give it a second to set it back

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.540 
I could give it a second to set it back
over<00:05:24.639> and<00:05:24.820> you<00:05:25.180> can<00:05:25.360> see<00:05:25.600> how<00:05:26.320> much<00:05:26.560> volume<00:05:27.130> it

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
over and you can see how much volume it

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.170 
over and you can see how much volume it
gives<00:05:27.760> you<00:05:27.940> at<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.090> past<00:05:28.389> am<00:05:28.660> to<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.020> size<00:05:29.289> I

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.939 

I<00:05:38.660> really<00:05:39.660> hope<00:05:39.870> that<00:05:40.080> you<00:05:40.230> guys<00:05:40.350> can<00:05:40.650> feel

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
this this is my first hair tutorial that

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.950 
this this is my first hair tutorial that
I've<00:05:45.960> ever<00:05:46.199> shown<00:05:46.650> I<00:05:47.180> do<00:05:48.180> want<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.510> pair<00:05:48.750> the

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
I've ever shown I do want to pair the

00:05:48.960 --> 00:06:08.180 
I've ever shown I do want to pair the
front

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.180 

and<00:06:09.190> then<00:06:09.400> we'll<00:06:09.760> do<00:06:10.710> two<00:06:11.710> more<00:06:11.890> little

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
and then we'll do two more little

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
and then we'll do two more little
sections<00:06:12.670> on<00:06:12.850> this<00:06:13.000> side<00:06:13.270> and<00:06:14.820> now<00:06:15.820> you<00:06:15.850> could

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
sections on this side and now you could

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.800 
sections on this side and now you could
just<00:06:16.240> take<00:06:16.570> your<00:06:16.630> fingers<00:06:17.140> and<00:06:17.470> kind<00:06:17.770> of

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
just take your fingers and kind of

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.530 
just take your fingers and kind of
loosen<00:06:19.810> up<00:06:20.020> those<00:06:20.320> curls<00:06:20.890> and<00:06:21.220> make<00:06:22.060> sure<00:06:22.330> the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
loosen up those curls and make sure the

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.770 
loosen up those curls and make sure the
top<00:06:22.810> you<00:06:23.680> can't<00:06:23.890> see<00:06:24.130> the<00:06:24.430> sections<00:06:24.970> of<00:06:25.360> the

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
top you can't see the sections of the

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.270 
top you can't see the sections of the
curls<00:06:26.110> so<00:06:26.320> make<00:06:26.440> sure<00:06:26.620> the<00:06:26.740> top<00:06:26.920> looks<00:06:27.160> a

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
curls so make sure the top looks a

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.330 
curls so make sure the top looks a
little<00:06:27.490> bit<00:06:27.610> smooth<00:06:28.060> I<00:06:28.450> usually<00:06:29.110> don't<00:06:30.040> take<00:06:30.280> a

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
little bit smooth I usually don't take a

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.130 
little bit smooth I usually don't take a
brush<00:06:30.610> to<00:06:30.850> it<00:06:30.880> until<00:06:31.300> the<00:06:31.420> very<00:06:31.600> end<00:06:31.720> when<00:06:32.110> I

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
brush to it until the very end when I

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.860 
brush to it until the very end when I
know<00:06:32.290> I<00:06:32.620> really<00:06:33.190> need<00:06:33.400> to<00:06:34.060> brush<00:06:34.210> up<00:06:34.420> a<00:06:34.480> top

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
know I really need to brush up a top

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.710 
know I really need to brush up a top
layer<00:06:35.200> because<00:06:35.760> otherwise<00:06:36.760> you<00:06:37.180> can<00:06:37.330> really

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
layer because otherwise you can really

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.130 
layer because otherwise you can really
damage<00:06:38.680> the<00:06:39.100> curls<00:06:39.490> and<00:06:39.850> you'll<00:06:40.660> have<00:06:40.840> to<00:06:40.960> do

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
damage the curls and you'll have to do

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.490 
damage the curls and you'll have to do
some<00:06:41.350> pieces<00:06:41.560> over<00:06:42.100> so<00:06:42.970> usually<00:06:43.900> that's<00:06:44.230> about

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
some pieces over so usually that's about

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.760 
some pieces over so usually that's about
what<00:06:44.650> I<00:06:44.680> do<00:06:44.800> I<00:06:45.570> spray<00:06:46.570> the<00:06:46.750> bottom<00:06:46.930> where<00:06:47.620> the

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
what I do I spray the bottom where the

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.870 
what I do I spray the bottom where the
curls<00:06:48.010> are<00:06:48.250> with<00:06:49.150> that<00:06:49.600> old<00:06:50.050> lady<00:06:50.400> right<00:06:51.400> and

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
curls are with that old lady right and

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.860 
curls are with that old lady right and
then<00:06:52.420> I<00:06:52.600> take<00:06:53.080> my<00:06:53.380> round<00:06:54.100> brush<00:06:54.430> and<00:06:54.870> just

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
then I take my round brush and just

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.860 
then I take my round brush and just
barely<00:06:56.140> go<00:06:56.470> over<00:06:57.060> the<00:06:58.060> areas<00:06:58.450> that<00:06:58.480> needs

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870 
barely go over the areas that needs

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:10.650 
barely go over the areas that needs
smooth<00:06:59.320> it<00:06:59.590> a<00:06:59.680> little<00:06:59.920> bit<00:07:01.680> and<00:07:02.680> I<00:07:03.280> spray<00:07:09.660> liked

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
smooth it a little bit and I spray liked

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.320 
smooth it a little bit and I spray liked
it<00:07:10.840> by
