to be Pirlo may be picking chiellini
over<00:01:34.259> Perla<00:01:34.470> would<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:35.040> better<00:01:35.189> because

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
over Perla would be a bit better because

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
over Perla would be a bit better because
of<00:01:35.610> course<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.119> bit<00:01:36.570> more<00:01:36.689> pace<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.079> midfield

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
of course a bit more pace in midfield

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
of course a bit more pace in midfield
would<00:01:37.740> help<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.670> forwards<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.210> course

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
would help going forwards and of course

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420 
would help going forwards and of course
defending<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.350> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> try<00:01:41.009> out<00:01:41.100> Pirlo

Schurrle next up in the team we'd over
play<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> mainly<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.070> chemistry<00:01:59.369> since<00:01:59.549> booty

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850

has got 84 pace which is perfectly fine

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.850 
has got 84 pace which is perfectly fine
of<00:02:02.460> course<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.820> think<00:02:03.149> his<00:02:03.329> name<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.840> Eichner<00:02:04.740> or

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
of course I think his name is Eichner or

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.580 
of course I think his name is Eichner or
something<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.250> yeah<00:02:05.719> 84<00:02:06.719> pace<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.110> 76

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
something like that yeah 84 pace and 76

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.979 
something like that yeah 84 pace and 76
dribbling<00:02:08.039> nothing<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> look<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.780> but

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
dribbling nothing really to look at but

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.330 
dribbling nothing really to look at but
i<00:02:10.170> think<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.440> left<00:02:10.619> hand<00:02:10.800> side<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.129> pitch

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
i think the left hand side of this pitch

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.910 
i think the left hand side of this pitch
is<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> lot<00:02:11.879> more<00:02:11.910> stronger<00:02:12.360> than<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> right

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
is a lot more stronger than the right

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.890 
is a lot more stronger than the right
side<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.520> kind<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.060> was<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.209> bit<00:02:14.420> biased<00:02:14.630> when

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
side and I kind of was a bit biased when

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.180 
side and I kind of was a bit biased when
I<00:02:14.959> was<00:02:15.140> playing<00:02:15.260> with<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.650> team<00:02:15.860> because<00:02:16.040> I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
I was playing with this team because I

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.250 
I was playing with this team because I
went<00:02:16.370> down<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.670> side<00:02:16.910> in<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.840> center<00:02:18.110> for

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
went down that side in the center for

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.900 
went down that side in the center for
position<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.739> do<00:02:18.800> sir<00:02:19.099> see<00:02:19.310> from<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.700> course

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
position we do sir see from of course

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.390 
position we do sir see from of course
Atletico<00:02:20.569> Madrid<00:02:21.040> unfortunately<00:02:22.040> he<00:02:22.280> only

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
Atletico Madrid unfortunately he only

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.760 
Atletico Madrid unfortunately he only
gets<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.790> chem<00:02:23.209> but<00:02:23.480> loads<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.440> people<00:02:24.530> are

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770
