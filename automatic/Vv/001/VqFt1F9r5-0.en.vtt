 I greet everyone with you android 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.380
 android 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.940
 Well, finally came out and cool 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.910
 the strategies I used to talk about 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.830
 can find ivan carry in my 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.570
 Playlist announce new games on android 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.730
 the game is called up nail dancing and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.869
 try a strategy which will 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.269
 fight different enemies 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.519
 use the titans and improve your 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.880
 want to cut into the warriors and more 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.059
 Now drag our map but where are 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.010
 our barracks and various temple buildings 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.510
 let's quickly disassemble the top 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.730
 It shows a different resource 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.340
 that we will be able to use 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.530
 Here they are shown on top of our level and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.010
 let's see give then ti in 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.370
 the hut 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.559
 we can see information about these 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.960
 bank move them to improve or 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.020
 We say by going to them so we can 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.370
 say exaggerate our warriors well to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.829
 Unfortunately, we have only one available so far. 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.359
 warrior in order so though 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.250
 exaggerate too need a certain 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.920
 a resource but we won't do it ourselves 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.140
 there is also a hall with titans in which we 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.640
 we will be able to acquire in addition 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.310
 various titans that we will 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.110
 help and various information find out 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.250
 here specifically here's a titan in my carry 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.409
 order so further that there is a toast 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.869
 if we go here, too, various buildings 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.900
 it's hard to buy with you but a lot of things 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.310
 let's see the battle itself that you 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.310
 sent pretty nice all 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.579
 made the game requires internet access 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.299
 at it and I have no internet not 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.640
 started 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.340
 here I have already given a few now 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.600
 move on to the game itself click click 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.630
 and rush into battle at the beginning we can then 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.070
 weave choose our army here it is us 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.920
 bodies of the torus unit we have this specifically 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.390
 human militia and then it will be gradually 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.490
 open others this one titan 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.619
 give push push and let's 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.210
 enjoy the very chest on the schedule is not 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.180
 game like the gameplay too 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.880
 quite interestingly done though rather 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.099
 just it will strain me Donat 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.569
 and constantly internet access is me 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.700
 It seems the main cons 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.590
 here is the first fight at our disposal 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.970
 gets how much squad 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.459
 all the archers appeared I was gone 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.290
 such a first line we have to say this with 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.480
 swords and shields and back archers 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.670
 in the middle titan so at first we have to 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.890
 arrange as you follow our you 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.819
 see will move just tab them and 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.030
 so we direct it like this 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.640
 archers, too, so we can place and 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.790
 we send our titanium we press the file and 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.530
 the battle went during melancholy melancholy we 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.989
 we can change here to run 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.819
 delete the camera can also send 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.829
 our characters for this simply because well, 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.420
 you also send well as you see u 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.579
 I'm very good at the first 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.540
 fight and wild just we practically 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.780
 overpowered 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.239
 these dudes though one squad is not all the same 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.870
 we won and over showed during 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.069
 sunset we fight ourselves going on and 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.709
 alignment of forces in strong color who 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.680
 saw showed our carry forces 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.040
 live and red enemy so and a our 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.780
 look for first win after passing 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.060
 each mission we earn when he 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.410
 amount of experience here you take 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.090
 occur the game itself is certainly not you 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.630
 it appears that she is in English 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.859
 Well, as they say post some 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.480
 cons be and so the game 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.459
 Interestingly done to me first 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.410
 of course I liked the graphics very much 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.530
 nicely implemented everything done 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.239
 interesting here let's go with can now 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.329
 do as I understand it we can 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.170
 improve our whale on so here we are 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.000
 money is his our carry parameters 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.799
 his characteristics rise 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.530
 Well, as you see, you need a certain 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:51.120
 the time for our titanium to look improved 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.430
 here let us play some more battle 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.760
 what moment am i sure after this 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.459
 video review and later lay out 1 15 minutes 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.829
 gameplay without their comment itself but to 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.410
 you watched what moments which 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.169
 aspects of the game we are shown how to teach and 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.299
 that he was already there to press here it was more 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.870
 less clear the game is not yet available in 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.109
 play google 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.190
 well you can download it and in others it 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:19.049
 say places so let's see 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.780
 see different dialogues for us on such 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.620
 tips 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.440
 give us a drag so let's play more 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.650
 will direct our enemies to ours 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.990
 units but this fillet of briks which is here 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.020
 present will crash into battle and lead 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.190
 beautiful graphics before plus 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.320
 convenient enough management all 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.470
 done well even me a man who 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.810
 i like strategies like to play 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.320
 This game is fun, but what's the point 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.510
 the enemies hid themselves and hid right away 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.660
 showing up but it will not help 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.060
 As a result, we won a hell no 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.430
 no, not all of them are very many and not 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.310
 just all the cracks but I think now we have them 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.740
 will overcome 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.080
 but the downside is that access to 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.850
 Internet and English is present 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.230
 more 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.660
 somewhere else donat who is here too 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:15.140
 enough to be present for an hour 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.660
 their archers okay what's appeared here 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.060
 another titan who attacked us but now 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.460
 we will fill it up even once with the enemy 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.650
 China by going to sleep on us very much and 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.390
 I think I can distance him to his 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.419
 and here's a titanchick let's attack 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.660
 attack him, let's show gruel and 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:37.490
 used as he well all herachit and our titanium 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:40.490
 keep up we think we will win accounting now 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.220
 and finally we won we won 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.110
 in short, I advise everyone to play with play 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.970
 this game is worth the game 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.130
 high quality and interesting and enough 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.979
 fascinating 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.890
 I will put this game I think everything 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.000
 4 plus to get out some I 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.039
 mystical stone and earned me 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.860
 card in the process of passing you do not 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.419
 will help in the future here is such a 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.400
 an interesting game about which I wanted to myself 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.240
 tell you and was with you android 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.240
