00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 this car has been a long time 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.600
 final if I do this if this car 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.250
 they sent to the Roman cyta agency 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.679
 they lent so that everyone could see it 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.639
 he came for me to fix the air 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.000
 conditioning follow you as they are 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.890
 this girl is very bad is very 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.270
 decalibrated 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.730
 if friends see it well 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.730
 how is this 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.540
 and these women are going to 54 we are going to grab 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.100
 the calibrator 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.100
 how is it 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.970
 we go to metals that are very hot 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.970
 the spark plug look at you guys 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:55.440
 already happened is at 80 and leave me half 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.200
 is at 65 and should be at 74 plus all 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.329
 what is already lowered this woman 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.699
 it came out a lot from its limit true 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.699
 let's take out the following catches 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.860
 let's see the number 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:20.480
 it's too tight you have to loosen a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.480
 little more than our rattle 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.090
 those women some insurance are original 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.090
 as they saw says energetic form 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.759
 if all these spark plugs are or I mean 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.360
 originals that are with those that came out of 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.050
 factory 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.260
 can or can not loosen 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.990
 we will not remove it from winds 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.230
 to see if here he was going to hands and here yes 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:54.610
 you can as are the new ones 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.610
 it costs work 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.560
 but we have it ready let's see 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.990
 our approach as long ago 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.960
 I put it on the side 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.340
 see you as it is already very worn 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.410
 in the central electrode 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.650
 and a little the lateral 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.010
 Yes friends 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.780
 let's take out the spark plug then 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.780
 number 4 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.660
 today we will see if it is not too tight
