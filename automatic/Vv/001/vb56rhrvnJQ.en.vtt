00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hi I'm Rocky Stars guys this is the LH

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.390 
hi I'm Rocky Stars guys this is the LH
mm<00:00:03.629> it's<00:00:03.899> made<00:00:04.110> by<00:00:04.290> tie-down<00:00:04.740> engineering

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
mm it's made by tie-down engineering

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.190 
mm it's made by tie-down engineering
when<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.850> guys<00:00:06.029> get<00:00:06.299> into<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> spot<00:00:06.839> where<00:00:06.899> you

when you guys get into a spot where you

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.140 
when you guys get into a spot where you
can't<00:00:07.470> get<00:00:07.589> material<00:00:08.040> up<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.550> deck<00:00:08.790> either

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
can't get material up to the deck either

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.610 
can't get material up to the deck either
because<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.599> boom<00:00:09.780> truck<00:00:10.019> has<00:00:10.260> got<00:00:10.410> other

on the lift and send them up the way
they<00:00:25.830> set<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.189> up<00:00:26.250> guys<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.760> there's<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.000> 4-foot

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
they set it up guys is there's a 4-foot

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.450 
they set it up guys is there's a 4-foot
segment<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.199> contains<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.890> operating

system<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.750> string<00:00:31.050> eight

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
system and then you just string eight

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.860

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
foots on top of that the LH mm will go

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.319 
foots on top of that the LH mm will go
to<00:00:33.960> 40<00:00:34.380> feet<00:00:34.590> by<00:00:34.770> simply<00:00:35.160> splicing<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.850> more

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
supposed to be on the lift so you don't

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.860 
supposed to be on the lift so you don't
have<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.730> worry<00:00:53.879> about<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> stuff<00:00:54.570> falling
