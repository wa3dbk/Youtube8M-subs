and there's loads of grip that said I'd

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.210 
and there's loads of grip that said I'd
never<00:04:28.240> describe<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:28.870> as<00:04:28.960> being<00:04:28.990> as<00:04:29.590> much<00:04:29.860> fun

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220

to<00:04:30.250> drive<00:04:30.670> as<00:04:31.000> something<00:04:31.360> like<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:31.540> Ford<00:04:32.350> Focus

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650

or a Mazda threats more competent than
engaging<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:37.000> you're<00:04:37.090> probably<00:04:37.180> thinking

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
engaging and you're probably thinking

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.300 
engaging and you're probably thinking
Matty<00:04:37.720> won't<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.080> just<00:04:38.200> use<00:04:38.380> your<00:04:38.410> special

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
Matty won't you just use your special

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.890 
Matty won't you just use your special
steering<00:04:40.000> wheel<00:04:40.150> button<00:04:40.510> to<00:04:40.630> make<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
steering wheel button to make the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.780 
steering wheel button to make the
steering<00:04:41.320> go<00:04:41.410> stiffer<00:04:41.770> by<00:04:42.400> putting<00:04:42.610> into

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
steering go stiffer by putting into

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.610 
steering go stiffer by putting into
sports<00:04:43.180> mode<00:04:43.450> there<00:04:43.930> any<00:04:44.020> problem<00:04:44.320> is<00:04:44.410> when

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
sports mode there any problem is when

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.820 
sports mode there any problem is when
you<00:04:44.710> do<00:04:44.920> that<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.910> just<00:04:46.150> feels<00:04:46.830> artificially

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
you do that it just feels artificially

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.220 
you do that it just feels artificially
heavy<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:48.340> quite<00:04:48.970> frankly<00:04:49.000> just<00:04:49.480> a<00:04:49.570> bit<00:04:49.690> weird

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.450 

another<00:04:53.230> thing<00:04:53.410> worth<00:04:53.500> noting<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:54.100> that<00:04:54.160> key

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
another thing worth noting is that key

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.580 
another thing worth noting is that key
is<00:04:54.610> used<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.300> be<00:04:55.480> a<00:04:55.630> lot<00:04:55.870> cheaper<00:04:55.900> than<00:04:56.440> their

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
is used to be a lot cheaper than their

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.530 
is used to be a lot cheaper than their
European<00:04:56.740> rivals<00:04:57.370> but<00:04:57.910> really<00:04:58.330> now<00:04:58.480> the

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
European rivals but really now the

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.090 
European rivals but really now the
difference<00:04:58.750> is<00:04:59.050> probably<00:04:59.350> only<00:04:59.500> about<00:04:59.590> five

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
difference is probably only about five

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.160 
difference is probably only about five
percent<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:01.480> thing<00:05:01.660> is<00:05:01.720> when<00:05:02.020> you<00:05:02.110> get

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
percent and the thing is when you get

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.840 
percent and the thing is when you get
into<00:05:02.290> a<00:05:02.350> kia<00:05:02.590> dealer<00:05:02.950> and<00:05:03.130> ask<00:05:03.340> for<00:05:03.640> a<00:05:03.700> discount

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
into a kia dealer and ask for a discount

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.910 
into a kia dealer and ask for a discount
they'll<00:05:04.300> probably<00:05:04.540> look<00:05:04.750> at<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:05.020> like<00:05:05.770> you're

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:05.920 
they'll probably look at you like you're

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.980 
they'll probably look at you like you're
a<00:05:05.980> bit<00:05:06.310> mad<00:05:06.669> because<00:05:07.090> if<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:07.330> go<00:05:07.360> into<00:05:07.540> a<00:05:07.630> voxel

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
a bit mad because if you go into a voxel

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.470 
a bit mad because if you go into a voxel
dealer<00:05:08.350> they<00:05:08.830> kind<00:05:09.070> of<00:05:09.100> expect<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.700> so<00:05:09.850> often

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
dealer they kind of expect it so often

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.320 
dealer they kind of expect it so often
an<00:05:10.990> Astra<00:05:11.470> can<00:05:11.650> be<00:05:11.740> cheaper<00:05:12.250> than<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.030> Kia

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
an Astra can be cheaper than the Kia

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.360 
an Astra can be cheaper than the Kia
Cee'd<00:05:13.660> and<00:05:14.020> then<00:05:14.620> there's<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:14.980> fact<00:05:15.130> that<00:05:15.190> its
