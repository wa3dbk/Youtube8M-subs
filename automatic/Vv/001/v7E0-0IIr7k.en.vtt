sessions at the hotel after the sessions

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.319 
sessions at the hotel after the sessions
and<00:00:30.439> you<00:00:30.560> know<00:00:30.679> this<00:00:31.029> there's<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.090> lot<00:00:32.239> of

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
and you know this there's a lot of

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.420 
and you know this there's a lot of
opinions<00:00:32.810> on<00:00:32.960> that<00:00:33.140> particular<00:00:33.770> subject<00:00:34.040> and

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
opinions on that particular subject and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.250 
opinions on that particular subject and
I<00:00:34.550> mean<00:00:34.700> you'll<00:00:34.880> talk<00:00:35.060> to<00:00:35.090> one<00:00:35.390> grower<00:00:35.630> who

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
I mean you'll talk to one grower who

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.590 
I mean you'll talk to one grower who
says<00:00:36.920> he<00:00:37.070> can<00:00:37.310> raise<00:00:37.550> eighty<00:00:38.120> bushel<00:00:38.570> wheat

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
says he can raise eighty bushel wheat

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.479 
says he can raise eighty bushel wheat
and<00:00:38.899> that's<00:00:39.020> his<00:00:39.199> ceiling<00:00:39.500> then<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:40.190> talk<00:00:40.370> to

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
and that's his ceiling then you talk to

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.369 
and that's his ceiling then you talk to
another<00:00:40.670> group<00:00:40.940> grow<00:00:41.390> within<00:00:41.690> maybe<00:00:42.020> an<00:00:42.230> hour

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
another group grow within maybe an hour

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.639 
another group grow within maybe an hour
to<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.420> makes<00:00:44.420> hundred<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:44.960> 20<00:00:45.199> bushel<00:00:45.530> we

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
to the makes hundred and 20 bushel we

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.650 
to the makes hundred and 20 bushel we
average<00:00:46.100> on<00:00:46.340> fields<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.090> he's<00:00:47.180> seen<00:00:47.420> on<00:00:47.629> a

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
average on fields and he's seen on a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.840 
average on fields and he's seen on a
calibrated<00:00:48.170> your<00:00:48.440> mind<00:00:48.680> to<00:00:48.829> these<00:00:48.980> making<00:00:49.430> on

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
calibrated your mind to these making on

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.049 
calibrated your mind to these making on
6180<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:51.109> regions<00:00:51.859> so<00:00:52.100> I'm<00:00:52.519> going<00:00:52.789> to<00:00:52.820> suggest

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
6180 in regions so I'm going to suggest

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.939 
6180 in regions so I'm going to suggest
to<00:00:53.300> calibrate<00:00:53.780> your<00:00:54.050> monitor<00:00:54.230> would<00:00:54.800> answer

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
to calibrate your monitor would answer

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.619 
to calibrate your monitor would answer
that<00:00:55.129> question<00:00:55.280> for<00:00:55.789> predict<00:00:56.120> for<00:00:56.269> a<00:00:56.359> producer

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
that question for predict for a producer

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.569 
that question for predict for a producer
if<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:57.469> produce<00:00:57.649> around<00:00:57.949> a<00:00:58.100> field<00:00:58.309> of<00:00:58.460> wheat

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
if you produce around a field of wheat

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.790 
if you produce around a field of wheat
the<00:00:58.699> average<00:00:59.000> is<00:00:59.120> 80<00:00:59.359> and<00:00:59.690> he<00:01:00.079> sees<00:01:00.379> under<00:01:00.649> your

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
the average is 80 and he sees under your

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.189 
the average is 80 and he sees under your
monitor<00:01:01.250> there<00:01:01.460> are<00:01:01.609> regions<00:01:02.089> that<00:01:02.269> make<00:01:02.449> 120

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
monitor there are regions that make 120

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.160 
monitor there are regions that make 120
140<00:01:03.620> 160<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.940> gives<00:01:05.180> you<00:01:05.330> some<00:01:05.570> perception

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
140 160 that gives you some perception

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.590 
140 160 that gives you some perception
as<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.440> what<00:01:06.620> is<00:01:06.850> available<00:01:07.850> from<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.270> point<00:01:08.480> of

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
as to what is available from a point of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.390 
as to what is available from a point of
view<00:01:08.660> of<00:01:08.720> your<00:01:08.960> potential<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.950> challenge<00:01:10.310> is

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
view of your potential the challenge is

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.109 
view of your potential the challenge is
taking<00:01:10.610> 60<00:01:11.210> bushel<00:01:11.680> regions<00:01:12.680> to<00:01:13.009> 160<00:01:13.820> 48

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
taking 60 bushel regions to 160 48

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.520 
taking 60 bushel regions to 160 48
regions<00:01:14.509> we<00:01:14.600> need<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.840> know<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.110> understand

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
regions we need to know and understand

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.590 
regions we need to know and understand
what<00:01:15.710> those<00:01:15.890> are<00:01:16.159> basic<00:01:16.729> soil<00:01:16.939> is<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.240> drainage

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
what those are basic soil is a drainage

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.050 
what those are basic soil is a drainage
is<00:01:17.840> even<00:01:18.079> management<00:01:18.560> whilst<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.070> reason<00:01:19.460> and

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
is even management whilst the reason and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.940 
is even management whilst the reason and
my<00:01:20.150> next<00:01:20.329> question<00:01:20.390> was<00:01:20.780> do<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.439> think<00:01:21.500> those

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
my next question was do you think those

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.429 
my next question was do you think those
the<00:01:22.159> yield<00:01:22.630> bringing<00:01:23.630> those<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.049> yields<00:01:24.320> up

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
the yield bringing those the yields up

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:25.990 
the yield bringing those the yields up
in<00:01:24.560> those<00:01:24.680> regions<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.399> that<00:01:25.579> going<00:01:25.820> to<00:01:25.880> be

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
in those regions is that going to be

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.530 
in those regions is that going to be
things<00:01:26.270> like<00:01:27.850> genetics<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.060> fungicide

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
things like genetics and fungicide

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.149 
things like genetics and fungicide
applications<00:01:30.170> or<00:01:30.350> is<00:01:30.439> it<00:01:30.560> going<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:30.770> be<00:01:30.950> more

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
applications or is it going to be more

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.190 
applications or is it going to be more
angered<00:01:31.460> on<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.700> practices<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.689> know<00:01:32.720> we're

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
angered on the practices you know we're

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.510 
angered on the practices you know we're
not<00:01:33.320> really<00:01:33.380> said<00:01:33.770> much<00:01:33.799> about<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.369> but

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
not really said much about it but

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.469 
not really said much about it but
selecting<00:01:35.180> varieties<00:01:35.420> by<00:01:36.200> soil<00:01:36.560> type<00:01:36.920> is

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
selecting varieties by soil type is

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.520 
selecting varieties by soil type is
important<00:01:38.479> we<00:01:38.659> found<00:01:38.869> that<00:01:39.110> certain

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
important we found that certain

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.170 
important we found that certain
varieties<00:01:39.979> do<00:01:40.130> better<00:01:40.369> on<00:01:40.430> play<00:01:40.700> soils

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
varieties do better on play soils

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.819 
varieties do better on play soils
perhaps<00:01:41.540> other<00:01:41.719> varieties<00:01:42.290> do<00:01:42.500> better<00:01:42.770> on

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
perhaps other varieties do better on

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.429 
perhaps other varieties do better on
that<00:01:43.159> more<00:01:43.700> challenge<00:01:44.149> of<00:01:44.689> coarse<00:01:44.930> textured

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
that more challenge of coarse textured

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.679 
that more challenge of coarse textured
sandy<00:01:46.040> soils<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.180> maybe<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.659> future

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
sandy soils so maybe in the future

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.359 
sandy soils so maybe in the future
there's<00:01:48.170> some<00:01:48.259> opportunities<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:48.920> do<00:01:49.130> some

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
there's some opportunities to do some

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.429 
there's some opportunities to do some
variable<00:01:49.729> rate<00:01:49.880> seeding<00:01:50.329> maybe<00:01:51.079> there's<00:01:51.289> some

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
variable rate seeding maybe there's some

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390

region<00:03:35.319> receives<00:03:35.709> for<00:03:35.980> different<00:03:36.310> crops<00:03:36.639> but

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
region receives for different crops but

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.720 
region receives for different crops but
I'm<00:03:37.540> going<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.780> say<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.169> Dakotas<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:38.769> Arizona

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
I'm going to say the Dakotas and Arizona

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.610 
I'm going to say the Dakotas and Arizona
and<00:03:39.849> California<00:03:40.120> would<00:03:40.630> be<00:03:40.660> all<00:03:40.840> there<00:03:41.079> so

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
and California would be all there so

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.280 
and California would be all there so
what<00:03:41.799> makes<00:03:42.040> them<00:03:42.220> innovative<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:44.260> know

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
what makes them innovative you know

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.460 
what makes them innovative you know
Arizona<00:03:44.680> has<00:03:45.370> an<00:03:45.669> average<00:03:45.819> state<00:03:46.750> yield

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
Arizona has an average state yield

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.830 
Arizona has an average state yield
between<00:03:47.620> 100<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.070> 110<00:03:48.670> bushels<00:03:49.540> per<00:03:49.600> acre

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
between 100 and 110 bushels per acre

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.800 
between 100 and 110 bushels per acre
they<00:03:50.650> do<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:50.890> really<00:03:51.220> good<00:03:51.370> job<00:03:51.430> I'm<00:03:52.390> gonna<00:03:52.540> say

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810

who's even Wednesday afternoon how many
sprays<00:04:11.110> do<00:04:11.290> we<00:04:11.350> need<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.560> put<00:04:11.740> it<00:04:11.830> on<00:04:12.010> with<00:04:12.640> when

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
sprays do we need to put it on with when

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.790 
sprays do we need to put it on with when
do<00:04:13.420> we<00:04:13.510> need<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.780> done<00:04:13.960> by<00:04:14.200> what<00:04:14.650> are<00:04:14.740> the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
do we need to be done by what are the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.380 
do we need to be done by what are the
rates<00:04:15.010> or<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.370> water<00:04:15.640> volume<00:04:15.820> is<00:04:16.120> one<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.329> the

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
rates or the water volume is one of the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.270 
rates or the water volume is one of the
surfactants<00:04:16.989> for<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.230> nozzles<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.859> mean

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
surfactants for the nozzles I mean

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.060 
surfactants for the nozzles I mean
they're<00:04:18.459> all<00:04:18.609> about<00:04:19.380> detail<00:04:20.380> and<00:04:20.950> then

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
they're all about detail and then

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.230 
they're all about detail and then
they're<00:04:21.220> able<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.459> do<00:04:21.609> that<00:04:21.790> because<00:04:21.940> the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
they're able to do that because the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.270 
they're able to do that because the
stability<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.960> climate<00:04:23.380> stability<00:04:23.770> of

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
stability of the climate stability of

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.220 
stability of the climate stability of
the<00:04:24.370> climate<00:04:24.790> would<00:04:24.910> be<00:04:25.060> part<00:04:25.420> of<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.660> yes<00:04:25.930> but

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
the climate would be part of it yes but

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.860 
the climate would be part of it yes but
in<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:26.620> region<00:04:26.890> they<00:04:27.190> also<00:04:27.390> raise<00:04:28.390> a<00:04:28.420> lot<00:04:28.750> of

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
in that region they also raise a lot of

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.660 
in that region they also raise a lot of
vegetables<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.890> they<00:04:29.920> understand<00:04:30.550> the

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
vegetables so they understand the

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.430 
vegetables so they understand the
importance<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.210> timing<00:04:31.450> they<00:04:31.900> understand<00:04:32.320> the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
importance of timing they understand the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.690 
importance of timing they understand the
importance<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.860> micronutrients<00:04:33.310> they

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
importance of micronutrients they

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.640 
importance of micronutrients they
understand<00:04:34.240> all<00:04:34.480> of<00:04:34.720> those<00:04:34.810> elements<00:04:35.200> very

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
understand all of those elements very

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.160 
understand all of those elements very
very<00:04:36.010> well<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:37.360> isn't<00:04:37.780> always

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
very well and that isn't always

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.700 
very well and that isn't always
transferred<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.220> other<00:04:39.400> areas<00:04:39.700> okay<00:04:40.480> I<00:04:41.200> work

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
transferred to other areas okay I work

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.560 
transferred to other areas okay I work
with<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.860> lot<00:04:41.919> of<00:04:42.040> growers<00:04:42.400> in<00:04:42.580> Kentucky<00:04:43.480> and

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
with a lot of growers in Kentucky and

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.450 
with a lot of growers in Kentucky and

time<00:04:45.669> have<00:04:45.910> began<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.510> realize<00:04:46.900> the

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
time have began to realize the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.200 
time have began to realize the
importance<00:04:47.560> of<00:04:47.680> timing<00:04:47.919> but<00:04:48.640> timing<00:04:48.910> is<00:04:49.150> just

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
importance of timing but timing is just

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.150 
importance of timing but timing is just
something<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:49.930> doesn't<00:04:50.320> cost<00:04:50.860> you<00:04:51.040> any

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
something that doesn't cost you any

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.070 
something that doesn't cost you any
money<00:04:51.400> at<00:04:51.610> all<00:04:51.730> but<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.210> makes<00:04:52.390> a<00:04:52.510> huge<00:04:52.540> impact

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
money at all but it makes a huge impact

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.990 
money at all but it makes a huge impact
on<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.380> bottom<00:04:53.530> line<00:04:53.680> because<00:04:54.550> unless<00:04:54.820> you

you know if you're four days late for

you know if you're four days late for

product<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:03.100> again<00:05:03.160> it<00:05:03.460> depends<00:05:03.790> on<00:05:03.880> what<00:05:04.090> is

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
product and again it depends on what is

product and again it depends on what is
easy<00:05:04.479> going<00:05:04.630> after<00:05:05.169> but<00:05:05.890> if<00:05:05.950> you're<00:05:06.100> going<00:05:06.250> to

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
easy going after but if you're going to

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.980 
easy going after but if you're going to
