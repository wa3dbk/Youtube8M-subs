00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.520
 tonic is at least some of the 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.680
 markets that have the best system of 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.139
 ultrasound to be able to say that 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.910
 cartridge is programmable 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.830
 I'm not here to give training. 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.110
 I will simply explain 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.050
 if you get some for us 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.779
 or any other store at least 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.489
 you will get a sense of how the window 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.770
 what happens to the cartridge 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.050
 when you receive and if you have a 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.610
 other sonics, especially those of 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.969
 lexmark 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.949
 It is advisable to do what 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.199
 using an ultrasonic we will go 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.449
 partially put in water until it 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.739
 stay in that ball of the cartridge can 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.489
 put some leasing products 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.530
 top 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.890
 We're going to put the cartridge here. 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.539
 inside will turn on the machine pretension I 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.600
 I just received a cartridge okay. 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:01.670
 do not fall yet I put the five 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:05.990
 exact seconds five seconds only pick up 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.659
 paper ready for five seconds I 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.520
 I want a clean corner because to help. 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.530
 to unravel despite the fact that she 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.649
 helps to develop quite well 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.110
 I did this makes recharging easy all this 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.509
 procedure that you have learned if you 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.399
 Does not she leave the farm in any way? 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.590
 I put this close 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.500
 call and leave 30 seconds until the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.250
 cartridge and make new cleaning do 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.649
 test to see if you're talking or not 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.060
 most cases at least 70% it already 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.860
 said top on time 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.600
 What can we do next if she 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.600
 do not blame yourself for putting more 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.850
 one minute until there is the development 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.340
 in the latter case you can open the lid and 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.100
 take the sponge put in here wash 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.289
 It's just that I do not know if it's worth it 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.460
 I work so hard to unravel a 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.490
 All good cartridge 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.170
 in the latter case you can simply 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.770
 discard the cartridge and sell one 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.859
 comparative with the client 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.929
 something so good manufactured 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:06.450
 I hope I have succeeded 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.899
 clarify a little about the other probe 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.899
 okay
