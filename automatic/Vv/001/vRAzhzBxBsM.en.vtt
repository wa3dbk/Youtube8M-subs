got the continuous lip so when end-user

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.080 
got the continuous lip so when end-user
can<00:02:44.980> take<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.370> move<00:02:45.730> it

can take it move it
put<00:02:46.600> it<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.780> different<00:02:47.080> areas<00:02:47.380> it<00:02:47.920> also<00:02:48.100> still

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
put it in different areas it also still

put it in different areas it also still
has<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.120> two<00:02:49.390> pin<00:02:49.780> position<00:02:49.960> where<00:02:50.380> it

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
has that two pin position where it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.880 
has that two pin position where it
actually<00:02:50.620> can<00:02:50.980> go<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.730> 17<00:02:52.210> degree<00:02:52.480> slope

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
actually can go and a 17 degree slope

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.020 
actually can go and a 17 degree slope
which<00:02:53.890> is<00:02:53.920> what<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.340> can<00:02:54.460> see<00:02:54.490> at<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.850> top

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
here so that we can get an extra level

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.690 
here so that we can get an extra level
and<00:02:59.080> that's<00:02:59.200> nice<00:02:59.500> when<00:02:59.710> you're<00:02:59.830> short<00:03:00.070> I'm<00:03:00.340> 5
