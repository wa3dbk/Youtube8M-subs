00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.280
 intermediary between laboratories and pharmacies ie practice coyotaje 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.350
 of medicines hence abusing their position and profiting from the misfortune of 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.099
 people 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.449
 by entering medications and pressuring pharmacies to buy them under 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:21.980
 its conditions 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.409
 otherwise they cut off the supply and it leads to bankruptcy Spain has not 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.179
 apart from the commercial structure we have seen how the number of forms is each 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.130
 less time 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.500
 it is including 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.640
 in the pharmacies again they are not associated 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 although they are not saying in these popular 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.790
 unfortunately, the tendency tends to disappear since the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.300
 pharmacies 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.750
 smaller with 20 30 years forty years in the market 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.900
 have seen a disadvantage 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.760
 ten years 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.239
 well he has managed to amass a fortune 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.989
 a coast of the health of the poorest and has become the ninth man 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.760
 richest in mexico 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.250
 and 400 million dollars according to the magazine forbes among its 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.410
 properties are also companies like the new textile lioness 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.900
 the property shows that there is 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.710
 and in the hotel zone of this tourist destination 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.690
 with a value close to 70 million dollars 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.690
 also a luxury hotel in Cancun and another in puerto vallarta 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.500
 once nothing happens he has stopped it 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.470
 two years ago the federal competition commission initiated a 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.530
 pahissa investigation was rafúl and surprise 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.270
 because despite the laboratories to reach lower prices than others 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.380
 dealers 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.420
 however the cofeco closed the case because laboratory surprisingly 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.810
 raised the complaint in this case we have only made an investigation 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.750
 in the upper cut once 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.410
 who more or less year and a half 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.330
 or the company itself that denounced 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.370
 the decision 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.890
 while in Peru laboratory was a temporary problem he did not vote 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.640
 so everything was the same 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.090
 casa saba site raising the prices of medicines and not only that 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.540
 also began to monopolize the territorial distribution 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.699
 those of beauty and of necessity 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.989
 that are sold in pharmacies that is the problem 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.079
 how are you 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.089
 the naples are you commenting 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:21.589
 the three are going up this is as expensive for the people as for 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:25.229
 we we lose people do not compare 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.899
 environment the cost of the medication because its 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.499
 distributors are seen to improve the competition more is called 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:32.589
 will deliver 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:34.789
 in such sense of the streets 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:38.199
 the cheapest dollar rosique 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.199
 the dgt will come from formalin and intel 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.469
 this 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.579
 buying the medicines today are the pharmacists themselves who demanded 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.769
 this hoarding is over so that more medicines can be sold 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.839
 cheap you should see more competitors 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.509
 This is a jungle of the series 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:59.599
 I would benefit 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.599
 there was more healthier competition 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.340
 this would leave the more competitive conditions 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.149
 in pharmacies tomorrow we will show you the consequences of this practice 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.209
 abusive 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.569
 and until the death that has caused and millions of Mexican families Caesar 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.879
 Therefore, for reasons 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.900
 the group that has control of the distribution of medicines also 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.900
 has made the plans of many family businesses fail 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.889
 but he rejects what she 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.249
 is the best is impure of the year and the destruction that has caused the monopoly 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:36.620
 by isaac saba raffoul 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.089
 in pharmacies 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:42.899
 guadalupe was the owner of interest just a few years ago the distributor floor 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:46.169
 of medicines in the house saba worked with zavala 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.449
 the muse of Saint Augustine what they do for us 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:52.489
 fearful 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.310
 He leaves his pharmacy to talk about the dirty tricks in which he used the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.699
 businessman isaac saba to press it 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:03.820
 and the consequences that his business finally had and they put a lot of pressure on me because 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.620
 the first one was the one who did not manage to cover all his notes 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.169
 they were also going down to a minimum remembers kameni with tests also 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.739
 important that ferrer 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.489
 the drugs 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.849
 for the same reason as guadeloupe 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:24.110
 Four thousand pharmacies have lowered their curtains in the last ten years 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.189
 your business has been reduced only to a pharmacy 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:32.379
 as well as his dream to create a heritage for his children that he has left 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:37.529
 / jar 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:39.639
 in November 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.289
 good that it has become rich of states yes no 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.120
 as not poor enough but what has been made clear is perhaps 

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:50.200
 easier and that if not accuse and condemn misery 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.190
 to families like theirs and that is the quiet fame with his family and that 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.220
 remember that all people are suffering while being 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.300
 with information of césar méndez beatriz gonzález 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.129
 Aztec information force 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.300
 the other matter the plenary of the chamber of deputies approved his project of 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.389
 budget for 2007 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.180
 the legislators want 4 thousand 704 million pesos, part of which 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.310
 will be spent personal services on the internet this budget project 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.280
 that 8%
