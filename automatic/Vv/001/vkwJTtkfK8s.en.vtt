00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210 

as<00:00:00.299> a<00:00:00.359> child<00:00:00.719> I'd<00:00:00.960> suffered<00:00:01.319> from<00:00:01.560> a<00:00:01.620> form<00:00:02.010> of

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
as a child I'd suffered from a form of

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.430 
as a child I'd suffered from a form of
arthritis<00:00:03.210> which<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.759> related<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:05.790> what<00:00:06.779> the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
arthritis which is related to what the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.070 
arthritis which is related to what the
doctors<00:00:07.830> think<00:00:08.010> then<00:00:08.309> caused<00:00:09.059> one<00:00:09.660> leg<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.990> be

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
doctors think then caused one leg to be

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.830 
doctors think then caused one leg to be
shorter<00:00:10.530> than<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.769> other<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.630> in<00:00:12.630> turn

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
shorter than the other and that in turn

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.650 
shorter than the other and that in turn
caused<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.500> spine<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.460> lean<00:00:14.730> over<00:00:14.759> slightly

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
caused the spine to lean over slightly

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.840 
caused the spine to lean over slightly
to<00:00:15.809> accommodate<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.980> slightly<00:00:17.400> shorter

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
to accommodate for that slightly shorter

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.150 
to accommodate for that slightly shorter
leg<00:00:18.029> as<00:00:18.240> an<00:00:18.660> adult<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> started<00:00:19.830> having

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
leg as an adult when I started having

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.189 
leg as an adult when I started having
this<00:00:20.310> decline<00:00:21.240> into<00:00:21.600> ill<00:00:21.720> health

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
this decline into ill health

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.080 
this decline into ill health
I<00:00:22.230> started<00:00:23.070> started<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> stomach

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
I started started up with a stomach

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.810 
I started started up with a stomach
condition<00:00:24.539> which<00:00:25.080> made<00:00:25.320> me<00:00:25.439> lose<00:00:25.619> weight

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
condition which made me lose weight

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.040 
condition which made me lose weight
dramatically<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.660> was<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> combination

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
dramatically so it was a combination

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.230 
dramatically so it was a combination
really<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.830> all<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.220> these<00:00:29.340> things<00:00:29.640> that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
really of all of these things that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.330 
really of all of these things that
brought<00:00:30.420> me<00:00:30.599> very<00:00:30.900> quickly<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> very

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
brought me very quickly to a very

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.120 
brought me very quickly to a very
weakened<00:00:32.880> state<00:00:33.030> where<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.530> losing<00:00:34.710> weight

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
weakened state where I was losing weight

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.880 
weakened state where I was losing weight
I<00:00:35.460> was<00:00:35.670> losing<00:00:36.059> strength<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.829> a

I was losing strength and I was in a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.319 
I was losing strength and I was in a
great<00:00:38.040> deal<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.280> pain<00:00:38.460> at<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.700> same<00:00:38.879> time<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
great deal of pain at the same time I

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.290

between ten years ago I walked into my
first<00:00:49.079> ever<00:00:49.379> Christian<00:00:49.800> science<00:00:50.160> lecture<00:00:50.550> as

a<00:00:50.789> disabled<00:00:51.329> person<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.930> when<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.320> found<00:00:52.649> out

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
a disabled person and when I found out

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.139 
a disabled person and when I found out
that<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.039> lecture<00:00:53.399> was<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> Christian

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that this lecture was a Christian

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.439 
that this lecture was a Christian
lecture<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.750> based<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.350> Bible<00:00:55.739> I

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
lecture and it was based on the Bible I

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.349 
lecture and it was based on the Bible I
pretty<00:00:57.449> much<00:00:57.719> shut<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> off<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.120> thought<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
pretty much shut it off in thought and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.200 
pretty much shut it off in thought and
didn't<00:01:00.629> want<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> part<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> at<00:01:01.710> all

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
didn't want to be a part of it at all

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.119 
didn't want to be a part of it at all
but<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.359> started<00:01:03.809> noticing<00:01:03.989> an<00:01:04.409> incredible

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
but I started noticing an incredible

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.170 
but I started noticing an incredible
sense<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.640> peace<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.590> also<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.100> pain<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.820> all

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
sense of peace and also the pain in all

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.399 
sense of peace and also the pain in all
the<00:01:09.299> different<00:01:09.540> parts<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:09.869> body<00:01:10.110> just

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the different parts of my body just

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.830 
the different parts of my body just
started<00:01:11.189> ever<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.700> gradually<00:01:11.939> melting<00:01:12.720> away

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
started ever so gradually melting away

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.940 
started ever so gradually melting away
it<00:01:13.530> felt<00:01:13.860> almost<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.790> somebody<00:01:15.090> was

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
it felt almost as if somebody was

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
it felt almost as if somebody was
inflating<00:01:16.950> me<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.700> air<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:18.840> just

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
inflating me with air and I was just

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.740 
inflating me with air and I was just
being<00:01:19.140> pumped<00:01:19.439> up<00:01:19.680> into<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.040> fuller<00:01:20.490> round<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
being pumped up into this fuller round a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.950 
being pumped up into this fuller round a
more<00:01:21.990> comfortable<00:01:22.259> sense<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> body<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.960> seem

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
more comfortable sense of a body I seem

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.840 
more comfortable sense of a body I seem
pretty<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> state<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.009> shock<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
pretty in in a state of shock really the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
pretty in in a state of shock really the
following<00:01:27.150> morning<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.689> realized<00:01:28.259> just

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
following morning when I realized just

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
following morning when I realized just
how<00:01:29.100> significant<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.180> healing<00:01:30.509> had<00:01:30.630> been

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
how significant this healing had been

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.080 
how significant this healing had been
and<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.590> slowly<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.070> surely<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.430> realized

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
and then slowly but surely I realized

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.810 
and then slowly but surely I realized
that<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.079> healing<00:01:34.500> method<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that this was the healing method that

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.569 
that this was the healing method that
can<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.200> taught<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.500> shared<00:01:38.130> with<00:01:38.340> others

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
can be taught and shared with others

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.120 
can be taught and shared with others
it's<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:38.970> random<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.320> unpredictable

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
it's not random it's not unpredictable

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 
it's not random it's not unpredictable
it's<00:01:41.610> something<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.299> really<00:01:42.540> rely

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it's something that you can really rely

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.990 
it's something that you can really rely
on<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:43.799> got<00:01:44.610> me<00:01:44.759> interested

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
on and that really got me interested

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.789 
on and that really got me interested
then<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> really<00:01:45.780> immersed<00:01:46.079> myself<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
then I really immersed myself in the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.249 
then I really immersed myself in the
study<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.850> ten<00:01:48.090> years<00:01:48.329> ago<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.600> walked<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.170> my

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
study so ten years ago I walked into my
