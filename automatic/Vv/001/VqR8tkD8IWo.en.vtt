think the objective is to do our best

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.860 
think the objective is to do our best
and<00:02:49.349> that's<00:02:50.349> certainly<00:02:50.620> what<00:02:50.860> I'm<00:02:50.980> about<00:02:51.160> I

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
and that's certainly what I'm about I

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.620 
and that's certainly what I'm about I
think<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:52.989> know<00:02:53.110> we<00:02:53.730> we've<00:02:54.730> got<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.940> major<00:02:55.239> job

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
think at the end of the day successful

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.879 
think at the end of the day successful
attract<00:05:38.880> players<00:05:39.090> so<00:05:40.020> you<00:05:40.440> know

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
attract players so you know

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.290 
attract players so you know
think<00:05:41.069> that<00:05:41.219> if<00:05:41.340> we<00:05:41.520> can<00:05:41.749> get<00:05:42.749> into<00:05:42.960> our<00:05:43.259> job<00:05:44.300> we

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
think that if we can get into our job we

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.209 
think that if we can get into our job we
can<00:05:45.539> attract<00:05:45.990> place<00:05:46.229> for<00:05:46.469> sure<00:05:46.590> but<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.129> think

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
can attract place for sure but I think

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:48.619 
can attract place for sure but I think
the<00:05:47.610> most<00:05:47.789> important<00:05:48.240> thing<00:05:48.270> is<00:05:48.449> that<00:05:48.479> the

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:48.629 
the most important thing is that the

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:50.300 
the most important thing is that the
players<00:05:48.840> within<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.289> region<00:05:49.439> have<00:05:50.009> the<00:05:50.129> best

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
players within the region have the best

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.989 
players within the region have the best
