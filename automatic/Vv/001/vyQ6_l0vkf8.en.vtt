there no I don't have taillight yet I'm
still<00:00:35.850> working<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.300> that

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
still working on that

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.010 
still working on that
will<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.410> led<00:00:37.680> it'll<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.510> slim<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.630> the<00:00:39.720> fenders

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
will be led it'll be slim to the fenders

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.010 
will be led it'll be slim to the fenders
I<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.910> but<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.330> haven't<00:00:42.660> found<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
I can get it but I haven't found the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.650 
I can get it but I haven't found the
right<00:00:43.050> one<00:00:43.290> yet<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> there's<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.970> bike<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.420> also

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
right one yet so there's the bike I also

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.270 
right one yet so there's the bike I also
changed<00:00:46.050> up<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> handlebars<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> stock

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
changed up the handlebars the stock

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.660 
changed up the handlebars the stock
Buckhorn's<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.210> rototillers<00:00:49.040> in<00:00:50.040> favor<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
Buckhorn's or rototillers in favor of a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.020 
Buckhorn's or rototillers in favor of a
much<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:52.070> sleek<00:00:53.240> set<00:00:54.240> of<00:00:54.360> bars<00:00:54.860> mean

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
much more sleek set of bars mean

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.930 
much more sleek set of bars mean
obstacle<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.310> LED<00:00:59.310> turn<00:00:59.550> signals

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
obstacle here for the LED turn signals

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.579 
obstacle here for the LED turn signals
was<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:01.610> smaller<00:01:02.610> draw<00:01:03.170> on<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> signal

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
was the smaller draw on the signal

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.770 
was the smaller draw on the signal
flasher<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.399> had<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.579> change<00:01:05.759> it<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.030> change

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
flasher so I had to change it out change

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.059 
flasher so I had to change it out change
out<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.079> thermal<00:01:07.409> flasher<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:08.009> an

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:08.069 
out the thermal flasher for an

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:11.330 
out the thermal flasher for an
electronic<00:01:08.609> one<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.380> did<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.710> require

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
electronic one and that did not require

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.779 
electronic one and that did not require
a<00:01:11.969> huge<00:01:12.899> load<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.939> then<00:01:16.189> it<00:01:17.189> turned<00:01:17.579> out

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
a huge load on it and then it turned out

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.069 
a huge load on it and then it turned out
that<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.770> turn<00:01:19.950> signal<00:01:20.399> indicator<00:01:20.789> bulb<00:01:21.659> in

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
that the turn signal indicator bulb in

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.849 
that the turn signal indicator bulb in
there<00:01:22.460> was<00:01:23.479> basically<00:01:24.479> providing<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.079> path<00:01:25.350> for

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
there was basically providing a path for

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.169 
there was basically providing a path for
current<00:01:25.889> to<00:01:26.249> flow<00:01:26.280> from<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:26.819> side<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
current to flow from one side to the

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.239 
current to flow from one side to the
other<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> turn<00:01:28.530> signals<00:01:28.889> are<00:01:29.009> flipped

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
other when the turn signals are flipped

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.359 
other when the turn signals are flipped
on<00:01:29.399> all<00:01:29.759> four<00:01:30.209> would<00:01:30.389> flash<00:01:30.719> weekly<00:01:31.369> instead

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
on all four would flash weekly instead

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.059 
on all four would flash weekly instead
of<00:01:32.549> two<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.630> side<00:01:33.899> flashing<00:01:34.619> strongly

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
of two just one side flashing strongly

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.270 
of two just one side flashing strongly
and<00:01:35.369> getting<00:01:36.329> an<00:01:36.450> indicator<00:01:36.859> so<00:01:37.859> I<00:01:37.889> had<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.069> put

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and getting an indicator so I had to put

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.859 
and getting an indicator so I had to put
a<00:01:38.310> couple<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.609> diodes<00:01:38.969> in<00:01:39.149> there<00:01:39.359> to<00:01:39.689> limit

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
a couple of diodes in there to limit

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.749 
a couple of diodes in there to limit
that<00:01:40.109> resistance<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:41.069> limit<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.459> current

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
that resistance or limit that current

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.550 
that resistance or limit that current
flow<00:01:41.939> rather<00:01:42.149> and<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:44.520> we're<00:01:44.670> square

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
flow rather and I think we're square

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.099 
flow rather and I think we're square
fire<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.799> up<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:50.329> one<00:01:51.329> thing<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.779> not

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
fire that up and one thing that is not

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:57.879 
fire that up and one thing that is not
working<00:01:52.499> yet<00:01:52.859> is<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:54.740> switch<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.889> the<00:01:55.979> bars

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889 
working yet is the switch on the bars

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:00.199 
working yet is the switch on the bars
there's<00:01:58.889> a<00:01:58.979> couple<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.310> loose<00:01:59.490> solder<00:01:59.789> joints

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
there's a couple of loose solder joints

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.779 
there's a couple of loose solder joints
in<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:00.649> of<00:02:01.649> course<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.039> screw<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> get<00:02:02.639> to

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
in there of course the screw to get to

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:03.109 
in there of course the screw to get to
them

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119

them
fixin<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:04.639> stripped

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.970 

the<00:02:13.940> indicator<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.900> front<00:02:18.170> which

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.250 

way<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.220> he<00:02:22.340> turning<00:02:22.550> oh<00:02:22.819> yeah<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.630> think<00:02:24.080> we

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
way is he turning oh yeah I think we

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:34.120 
way is he turning oh yeah I think we
know<00:02:24.819> on<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.970> back<00:02:26.800> flexion<00:02:27.800> of<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:33.010> look<00:02:34.010> at

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
know on the back flexion of it look at

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.090 
know on the back flexion of it look at
that<00:02:34.250> thing

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
that thing

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.630 
that thing
definitely<00:02:37.100> bright<00:02:38.140> definitely<00:02:39.640> indicative

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
definitely bright definitely indicative

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.940 
definitely bright definitely indicative
of<00:02:41.920> exactly<00:02:42.920> where<00:02:43.069> I'm<00:02:43.190> trying<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.519> go<00:02:44.950> same

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
of exactly where I'm trying to go same

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.820 
of exactly where I'm trying to go same
the<00:02:46.190> left

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.400 

so<00:02:50.460> I'm<00:02:50.580> at<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> left<00:02:52.250> as<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.670> see<00:02:54.410> these

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
so I'm at the left as you can see these

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.050 
so I'm at the left as you can see these
things<00:02:55.590> kick<00:02:55.890> out<00:02:56.010> some<00:02:56.040> white<00:02:58.190> so<00:03:00.710> that's

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
things kick out some white so that's

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.730 
things kick out some white so that's
that's<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.210> biggest<00:03:03.420> improvement<00:03:04.050> so<00:03:04.230> far<00:03:04.500> I

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
that's the biggest improvement so far I

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.980 
that's the biggest improvement so far I
guess<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.190> still<00:03:05.460> need<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.640> taillight<00:03:06.030> once

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
guess that I still need a taillight once

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.160 
guess that I still need a taillight once
I<00:03:07.110> get<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.410> rebuild<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.190> front<00:03:08.400> brakes<00:03:08.640> I

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
I get that rebuild the front brakes I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.570 
I get that rebuild the front brakes I
will<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:11.180> pretty<00:03:12.180> much<00:03:12.450> good<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.720> go

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
will be pretty much good to go

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.600 
will be pretty much good to go
and<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.670> can<00:03:14.790> learn<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:14.970> ride<00:03:15.210> this<00:03:15.240> beast<00:03:16.610> and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
and I can learn to ride this beast and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.120 
and I can learn to ride this beast and
that's<00:03:18.210> it<00:03:18.390> for<00:03:18.840> now<00:03:18.900> let's<00:03:19.530> see<00:03:19.680> what<00:03:19.800> happens
