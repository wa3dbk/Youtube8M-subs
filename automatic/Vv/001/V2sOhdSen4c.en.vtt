00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.760
 twisted more congratulations to you on this 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.840
 exciting victory for the second in a row 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.030
 you any emotions left thanks we 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.859
 very happy this victory but very 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 important for us of course we saw the match 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.480
 Soviet against Spartacus and we need 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.430
 It had to win in that no matter what you 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.140
 It was rather difficult but it is good that although 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.710
 in added time we could together 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.960
 Transbaikal these twos despite 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.640
 winning result during the game seemed 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 that the team did not get everything that is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.270
 case before the blows did not reach all see 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.500
 davis in this division saying not 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.160
 I know maybe we are tired after 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.480
 previous match with Kuban bang 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.430
 it was hard to just overclock the game 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.350
 add speed maybe due to field 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.870
 including because she did not allow 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.600
 do what someone else wanted 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.489
 played for 10 times and if you donâ€™t 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.100
 play speed is hard to find here 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.020
 study here so there may be special 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.670
 moments we have not created but on the other 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.159
 the parties did not let the opponent do anything 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 most of the match is tested by half 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.460
 time out maybe a little bit 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.689
 . 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.070
 if we brought it Krasnodar Krasnodar 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.080
 traditionally comfortable opponent for us 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.939
 last year we won with a score of 50 in 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.640
 this season also won but now 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.430
 such a series of small victories continues 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.140
 a score of 1021 on which it seems that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.780
 changed why we don't hammer anymore 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.780
 so much as before he risks the match 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.619
 I honestly don't know if I would again 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.079
 solutions there and of course drink or 50 more 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.909
 time and now it seems to me all who 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.409
 Comes to us they play even more from 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.540
 defense they get up in their half 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.909
 fields and try to counterattack it i 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.950
 again, these teams consider anyone to draw 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.040
 already very successful result this one 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.000
 maybe I have not seen again 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.130
 somewhere we are a little short 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 speed but on the other hand we are not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.000
 skip a long time ago 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.439
 rival just come not for that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.950
 to win and just to be yourself 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.950
 to cancel 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.090
 and license to become a super today to you 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.920
 I had to work a little superman 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.479
 when not and in the second half lost the ball 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.400
 and you had to run over 30 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.599
 meters to cover Wanderson and what are you 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.340
 felt at that moment about what then 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:19.230
 thought dvd in feel 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.630
 such things can always happen 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.920
 to have this barrels i just saw it and 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.900
 ran back as fast as 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.549
 it was possible therefore to the player 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.530
 I had to give under my partner 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.530
 here already and glory helped and then the ball and already 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.920
 glory back ski 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.599
 sauna after this tour we are on four points 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.010
 lag behind cisco what you think about everything 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.010
 this situation, it is still somehow change 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.000
 because now the situation will be more 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.489
 pushing cisco for dance four points this 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.410
 not so much as it was before the front 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.030
 they have quite a few very difficult games 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.980
 although we have next week 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.170
 quite difficult test in Krasnodar 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.549
 with kuban there is always not easy from 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.269
 win there then the odds we had was good 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.459
 way from the end of the season there are six or 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:08.459
 seven matches if we see the cup final you 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:10.019
 tiredness already feel i gave regimen 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.410
 this week we had to play on the floor 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.930
 hours more than usual I was injured 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.880
 and here such after four weeks to return 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.299
 your game and unexpectedly play another 120 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.040
 minutes 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.380
 it was a rather complicated atlanta 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.459
 change your passport now we have a whole week 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.680
 to recover 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.780
 recover and prepare for the match 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.639
 against Kuban one urban that is 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.010
 now your health is no 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.870
 fear no longer cause it to not all 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.639
 ok and i hope everything stays in 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.230
 this state until the end of the season 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.230
 maybe theirs to the end of my career
