an<00:00:17.550> unboxing<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.270> check<00:00:18.449> out<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.890> box<00:00:19.890> specs

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
an unboxing and check out the box specs

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.269 
an unboxing and check out the box specs
and<00:00:20.810> actually<00:00:21.810> we'll<00:00:22.080> zoom<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> little<00:00:23.130> bit

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
and actually we'll zoom in a little bit

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.920 
and actually we'll zoom in a little bit
so<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.820> hopefully<00:00:24.420> see<00:00:24.750> these<00:00:24.960> specs<00:00:26.930> we

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
so I can hopefully see these specs we

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.970 
so I can hopefully see these specs we
have<00:00:27.960> aspects<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.560> English<00:00:28.890> Russian<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.179> also
