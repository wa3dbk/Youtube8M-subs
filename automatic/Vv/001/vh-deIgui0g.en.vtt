00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.040
 meet ivan no on repair forums 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.180
 hiv among you are the owner of asus p565 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.980
 just got the device hands experienced 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.929
 user up plus her husband is not a group 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.320
 put an end to receiving reports with 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.389
 first mouth 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.559
 when you click it to me literally everything 

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:18.130
 February 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.960
 three weeks pumping as soon as i 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.539
 by the standards of going by while i'm his tets us 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.159
 immediately said 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.980
 percentage since entered under melee 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.369
 by mail 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.589
 and ordered it 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.559
 in front of the Chinese New Year house opposite 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.550
 vacation growth gave three weeks here and 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.420
 stress 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.470
 eagerly 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.730
 as carriers 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.890
 well, where doctors would not be so small 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.160
 we come from the habit of vadim mind 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.520
 crane 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.110
 Moscow arbitration showed that our 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.540
 little 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.820
 but actually 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.800
 during where the first week 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.640
 probably e 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.070
 that's just or 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.360
 opened in it all new and new 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.920
 impressions of items 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.250
 more cities 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.250
 high rise free 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.540
 n 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.840
 he has 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.230
 for example small chips it is interesting that he 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.990
 automatic 2 6 hours at 18 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.990
 switches his daytime skins south 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.930
 the percentage of it is like I already 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.390
 spoke utility to load almanac 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.250
 Christians from the Internet 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.180
 babes 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.520
 you 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.740
 400 mw expert are usually not supported a 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.360
 here again there 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.300
 but the fact that it is productive then 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.510
 that him 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.660
 finish and sensitive 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.390
 but this type of thing 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.110
 that is, about any proprietary utility 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.800
 there is 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.040
 interface melt 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.760
 famous little crawled bridge in 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.450
 I had to turn it off after all 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.830
 refuse in favor of the outcome bypassed because 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.330
 what 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.700
 Well, firstly, the proprietary interface itself 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.740
 This is drawn spivaka resolution 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.420
 which in itself is rather strange 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.310
 we are similar to this second dance package 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.610
 Forest D I ask 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.610
 n 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.310
 he doesn't have hot swappable memory cards 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.750
 so km is under 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.639
 yes from moth attack 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:13.719
 percent 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.459
 Well, if he has version 1 1 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.629
 respectively 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.489
 in card reader mode 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.769
 he's an adventure mode 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.199
 as liters respectively 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.449
 active sync will not surplus very quickly and 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.909
 damn mode which mode 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.909
 card reader 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:38.309
 I think that 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:40.189
 in which he knows why he is so 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.909
 performance in return where it is 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.979
 if holding a convention is not critical 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:46.839
 then the site hitachi sign 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.599
 and therefore in this sense probably all 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.329
 still had experience
