in this lesson I'm going to show how to
make<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:03.000> center<00:00:03.600> field<00:00:26.269> first<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.480> need<00:00:27.660> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
make a center field first you need to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.609 
make a center field first you need to
place<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.260> part<00:00:28.650> Nexus<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.179> wall<00:00:30.750> no

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
place the part Nexus to the wall no

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.459 
place the part Nexus to the wall no
space<00:00:31.949> between<00:00:32.360> must<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:33.540> next<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> wall

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
space between must be next to the wall

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.680 
space between must be next to the wall
otherwise<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.100> much<00:00:35.309> more<00:00:35.579> difficult

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.720

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.250 

and<00:02:16.130> it's<00:02:16.280> important<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.960> you're<00:02:17.960> not

pacifically slow you see the pockets in

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.650 
pacifically slow you see the pockets in
front<00:02:24.140> of<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.740> state<00:02:24.980> policy<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:26.150> must<00:02:26.390> have

front of the state policy you must have

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:41.470 
front of the state policy you must have
a<00:02:26.690> certain<00:02:27.500> speed<00:02:27.800> -<00:02:28.130> or<00:02:28.970> take<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.450> puck<00:02:40.480> in

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
a certain speed - or take the puck in

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.130 
a certain speed - or take the puck in
the<00:02:41.920> centrifuge<00:02:43.720> comes<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.900> two<00:02:45.110> different

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
the centrifuge comes in two different

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:56.850 
the centrifuge comes in two different
versions<00:02:45.560> it's<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.310> short<00:02:47.030> one<00:02:47.240> and<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.660> long<00:02:47.810> one

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.530 

and<00:02:57.860> if<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.130> defender<00:02:58.820> is<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.970> little<00:02:59.240> bit<00:02:59.330> up

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
and if the defender is a little bit up

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.390 
and if the defender is a little bit up
perilous<00:03:00.050> in<00:03:00.230> space<00:03:00.620> below<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.640> defender
