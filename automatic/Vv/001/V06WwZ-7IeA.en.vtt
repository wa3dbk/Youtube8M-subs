00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
know that there is a mat or a a glossy

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.590 
know that there is a mat or a a glossy
finish<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.820> does<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.210> come<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
finish so and this does not come in

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.749 
finish so and this does not come in
waterproof<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.770> does<00:01:56.009> only<00:01:56.310> come<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.729> one

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
waterproof and it does only come in one

color<00:01:57.149> which<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.390> black<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.530> know<00:01:58.590> it's

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
color which is black and I know it's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.100 
color which is black and I know it's
kind<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.189> downer<00:01:59.430> but<00:01:59.610> I<00:02:00.119> mean<00:02:00.689> most<00:02:00.899> people

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
kind of a downer but I mean most people

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.340 
kind of a downer but I mean most people
i<00:02:01.380> guess<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.119> black<00:02:03.630> mascara<00:02:04.110> so

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
maybe that's why they figured hey let's

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.169 
maybe that's why they figured hey let's
just<00:02:06.060> put<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> block<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:06.570> out<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.990> i<00:02:07.700> just<00:02:08.700> am<00:02:08.940> in

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
this is so amazing and then on top of

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.479 
this is so amazing and then on top of
that<00:02:20.180> it's<00:02:20.690> just<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.200> formula<00:02:21.709> is<00:02:21.739> great<00:02:22.220> it's

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
that it's just the formula is great it's

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.180 
that it's just the formula is great it's
not<00:02:23.060> wet<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.660> not<00:02:24.080> too<00:02:24.319> dry<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.770> right<00:02:25.069> in

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
not wet it's not too dry it's right in

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.640 
not wet it's not too dry it's right in
the<00:02:25.310> middle<00:02:25.489> now<00:02:26.150> for<00:02:26.540> example<00:02:26.650> Maybelline

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the middle now for example Maybelline

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.250 
the middle now for example Maybelline
mascaras<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.459> me<00:02:28.730> personally<00:02:29.000> are<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.540> little

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
mascaras to me personally are a little

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.280 
mascaras to me personally are a little
bit<00:02:30.470> drying<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.610> therefore<00:02:32.269> I<00:02:32.540> can't<00:02:33.140> really

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
bit drying so therefore I can't really

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.479 
bit drying so therefore I can't really
keep<00:02:33.470> them<00:02:33.650> for<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.860> long<00:02:33.980> time<00:02:34.220> because<00:02:34.370> they

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
keep them for a long time because they

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.070 
keep them for a long time because they
were<00:02:34.550> like<00:02:34.760> already<00:02:35.120> dry<00:02:35.480> when<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.720> open<00:02:35.959> and

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
were like already dry when I open and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.140 
were like already dry when I open and
try<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.230> put<00:02:36.410> them<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.890> then<00:02:37.580> my<00:02:38.090> next

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
try to put them on and then my next

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.180 
try to put them on and then my next
favorite<00:02:38.720> would<00:02:38.930> be<00:02:38.980> L'Oreal<00:02:39.980> telescopic

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
favorite would be L'Oreal telescopic

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.970 
favorite would be L'Oreal telescopic
which<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.060> really<00:02:41.360> really<00:02:41.569> wet<00:02:41.930> formula<00:02:42.470> so

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
which is really really wet formula so

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.740 
which is really really wet formula so
therefore<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.700> kind<00:02:44.300> of<00:02:44.330> don't<00:02:44.480> like<00:02:44.630> it

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
therefore I kind of don't like it

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.030 
therefore I kind of don't like it
because<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:45.019> gets<00:02:45.170> kind<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.440> messy<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.860> gets

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
because it gets kind of messy and gets

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.220 
because it gets kind of messy and gets
everywhere<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:47.390> know<00:02:47.450> some<00:02:47.780> people<00:02:47.810> said

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.750 
everywhere and I know some people said
that<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.830> kind<00:02:49.069> of<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.190> same<00:02:49.370> it's<00:02:49.580> kind

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
that this is kind of the same it's kind

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.880 
that this is kind of the same it's kind
of<00:02:49.790> wet<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.569> gets<00:02:50.690> like<00:02:50.840> everywhere<00:02:51.230> but

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
of wet and it gets like everywhere but

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.220 
of wet and it gets like everywhere but
