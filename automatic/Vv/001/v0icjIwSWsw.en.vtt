00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.640
 Hello here is wet the place of mine Jusic and I'll show you today 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.910
 the brand new by Studio 20 from Tepco the all-new small compact mount 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.219
 Interface with insanity effects 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.269
 for you to go on tour as a guitarist or what is 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.550
 the surface shape 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.230
 At Cay Corp, like Studio 20, it is very very well laid out and 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.230
 I would say just caught from left to right 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.419
 we have ABC de stand here 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.660
 and the costume mistakes that are first seen directly at first sight 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.100
 responsible for the zone 30 tracks so 4 times 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.230
 who can control here with the Studio 20 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.880
 that is important 20 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.610
 several things at the same time both an interface so I can not 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.470
 Signals subsequently directed specifically to the socialist singer 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.960
 but also start something 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.770
 The exact connections in time again right there have so high around them 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.990
 a leader who drives or for a bass we also have Bill Line 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.210
 inside and we also have a microphone port in the with 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.010
 Phantom power is supplied so also singer as the capacitor 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.250
 Use microphones 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.320
 need phantom power can work here 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.520
 and what does the device do? 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.370
 it's an interface I've already said something about USB to the computer 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.740
 is connected 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.970
 and it offers you music in addition to Zion 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.330
 you can record a lot in succession you want 32 tracks 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.120
 enough fat and it really meant to be used mobile me 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.330
 I also have 2 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.880
 Microphones so stereo left-right so I do not even need something to connect 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.130
 if I want to record something so fast 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.380
 I have tax optimized and as I said it also a controller with the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.829
 I then can the enclosed software from KAC before taxes 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.999
 and of course everything at a glance the software 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.500
 that tolerates 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.110
 Looks exactly the same way from the surface so the design is like that 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.080
 good as identical with her if you have already worked with the device itself 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.620
 also one on the directly 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.790
 find the entry and get started 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.770
 you see MediaTek Inc up here I've settled here 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.820
 a work of Plot Blue xhunter child growing I can use you 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.229
 So playing it can edit you can 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.429
 that's a lot of involved 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:15.069
 I can steer them back for a ticket from my RWE 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.179
 in the case of these tracks from Tepco 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.549
 But I can also say here Tarek monitoring so everything I directly in 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.939
 record the device 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.809
 I would like to have my headphones on, of course I connect 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.429
 it could be like over there 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.709
 and my overall output, ultimately, for everything together, I can do too 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.280
 directly on the device as I said control the parameters 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.300
 then you can also take over directly in the software and that will be one 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.479
 controlled to one over it 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:43.339
 Of course he also has a tuner for guitarists 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:47.269
 and here beside it for the input which apologized what a source 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.809
 Lyon has selected the two microphones here 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.269
 or just the one around him on the page 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.419
 and the very special in which the chairs 20 so it is just too 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.689
 refined rift and bassist so interesting 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.309
 that has of post so original the effects he probably as 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.319
 because string instrument knows players 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.659
 Year built effects of boss the so-called EU sm that he is comfort 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.029
 Decker compost object impoverished put murders 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.759
 and there could be twelve pieces out of a whole lot of food 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.270
 where you can seriously choose 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.730
 which has four Vidal effects he can freely prove that Ammann 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.440
 to be able to use land more chromatically 50 war could put on things from contractions 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.180
 the best 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.859
 Latency is free, that is 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.559
 The SBB and the crushers put the whole Jad there for you so no problem 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.119
 Maler Weise is when he sends something into the computer and again 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:40.129
 of course, the whole of course delays in the study 20 is that 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.669
 not the case, so you can work directly with the built-in effects of Boss 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.189
 This too when I'm off to start 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.309
 There is, for example, the two superchargers one mothers had had 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:50.200
 did not care 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.700
 he will be Nikolai you can of course still put on a tremolo 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.650
 Fraser Flemish all he wanted from the LaCie compartments algorithms 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.469
 So there are really no wishes left 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.889
 and that's why the light will be 20 in spite of the really very small dimensions so me 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.509
 would say that it is barely 20 inches wide 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:11.179
 fits in any laptop bag Nino Prague with 3 5 and Gilles Recording so 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.909
 really optimal 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.239
 and accordingly, it is also considered carefully you need of course how 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.489
 said the computer but to take in the software but 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.850
 Due to the compact dimensions is really very very transport can have 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.270
 be used every recording situation whether it always wants a bit CERN 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.940
 or will this be written on with the many tracks we have available 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.689
 no problem 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.599
 and as I said the internal Fechtel the samples the train holds the loops 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:37.610
 the basin cracks 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.210
 and the whole thing as extensive as possible 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.000
 Patty for terrorists bassist or even for singer from because like 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.210
 Of course the effects can of course apply to one voice 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.850
 I say it again briefly as the whole from the side of the buoy exactly what 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.640
 followed 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.370
 So as already described you have high in order to just entrance for the drivers 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.379
 and or what 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.629
 You have her line-in on the right-hand side, for example, for an Etiennes 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.360
 I would offer the whole 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.840
 Of course, Uli also has two here because with 1 the default 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.689
 left right is a construction site microphone forms like Studio 20 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.229
 and here as I said by default phantom power on it but that itches 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.030
 dynamic microphones pretty little 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.040
 on the other hand you can of course see a headphone jack 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.350
 because the whole is synonymous completely flat without boxes or the like 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.090
 Do it in peace and without others to star sometimes in the quiet 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.029
 KÃ¤mmerchen can record that 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.489
 Of course, visit with her can close a corresponding to 

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:34.979
 the effects of taxes here in there so have the whole synonymous 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.460
 foreleg 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.650
 also great if you as honest or bassist has honest hands full 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.789
 the rigid Joppich's recording also goes on over one foot 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.050
 and if I still want to make a bit of noise you can, of course 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.500
 Boxing active 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.039
 in the case then over ten finally to the whole house 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.300
 under the influence of interface to the computer 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.280
 Bush place 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.840
 as a USB so you also do not need a long time is why 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.370
 Super mobile yes what the like Studio 20 by Cham Cork the new compact 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.969
 Interface for recording guitar with great effects right in it 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:10.759
 and if it comes to the point try to test it then want to look 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:14.509
 It just takes us to study course as usual 33 days 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:17.389
 the way and 66 conference house so the next time smart
