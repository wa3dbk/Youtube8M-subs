00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.309
 with china 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.660
 so if you are thinking of entering 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.609
 This is the form I'll leave in the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.240
 description of this video but before you 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.350
 things here that have no more pre 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.659
 requirement no you do not need to have more 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.000
 not like a year ago had those 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.869
 1,500 subscribers 10 thousand views 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.180
 monthly 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.150
 this no longer exists I had 500 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.820
 registered when I was accepted at the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.520
 But there's a bit of a 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.659
 long there with the contract I was patient 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.479
 I took a reprimand from the recruiter but 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.759
 also of the case you enter a china 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.759
 in case you are accepted time patience 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.619
 I have people, how are we going to have that many? 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.649
 I'm already going to explain the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.180
 and that's it 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.040
 and there are also those people who are 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.750
 being one thing as I go 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.689
 explain no no it's not 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.820
 it is not the purpose of this video is to let 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.850
 talk channels from other channels poorly 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.340
 other channels but there is a galley 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.290
 desumidificadas being that only one 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.850
 when you are recording and the other 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.530
 When are you talking to me when? 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.740
 Are you going to talk to them? 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.020
 It's the people who are being rude to soy. 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.100
 replies year right 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.530
 Um this is not yet, it's not, it 's not cool 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.820
 The people are liking you the least. 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.930
 What do you have to do is pay attention? 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.210
 for them 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.370
 Ana the wood is spoken because tap has two 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.200
 thousand subscribers you have nobody who 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.510
 that it is clear that it has 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.890
 I answer a lot, my least ones. 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.500
 subscribed to facebook 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.780
 I too say the galerinha there in 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.060
 comments I 've always been very good 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.650
 I think I'm passing this on my 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.830
 videos passing this humility of mine 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.440
 videos that people are not doing that 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.750
 until you can be a ride a figure 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.120
 put something in there for us 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.710
 videos but one hour your mask drops and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.550
 You 'll fall with her. 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.350
 So let's call, let's try to pass. 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.240
 something good to pass the constructive one 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.250
 content and do not prioritize the 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.170
 Money, she's putting money in 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.240
 foreground and this is wrong 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.730
 placed in the second third should be 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.290
 after the whistle no you do not prioritize 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.060
 money does not want 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.010
 Of course I want, I'm trying. 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.550
 quality and content first. 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.010
 plan 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.670
 so she does not stay connected and we'll open 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.860
 the eye 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.130
 This is I know it's complicated but this one 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.830
 even the name here his personal name and 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.940
 mail here has two differences and 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.010
 personal mail 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.540
 this is linked with youtube that it 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.550
 kind of you've created your channel 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.310
 this is your staff you create 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.100
 several things always on it 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.090
 here you are 18 you have not 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.970
 problem is not the age you put 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.000
 How old are you and not, unfortunately? 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.830
 You have to have a responsible parent or 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.260
 mother I know is that everybody is with a 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:52.580
 little trouble convincing the father 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.170
 the mother of commercial ddd giving to 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.270
 make money with it, give it to you 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.250
 grow with it 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.740
 Unfortunately, that's personal, I'm not going. 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.540
 I can help you, each one knows the father. 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.830
 What are you talking about? 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.060
 shows a bit of work from the 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.010
 youtube try to get on a website quit 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.730
 serious and shows them that this is 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.680
 good 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.930
 then the next I can not and I will not 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.140
 make a form that the following year 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.880
 will have the options your channel is in 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.000
 Correct situation what is this here 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.790
 regular situation that has no 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.760
 copyright the gang is bouncing 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.150
 music and the moment is wrong, right? 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.700
 not 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.190
 I do not do this but only be a problem for the 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.090
 your channel and what I recommend entering 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.340
 on here 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.570
 the by copyright in very good songs 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.180
 here of various types tep rock and snow 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.650
 hip hop in all styles and I think 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.310
 it's going to be a good you take a look 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.160
 for a flat on the vii or pro for the cloth 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.430
 background of a video and that's it 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.770
 Good people, this is the one from China. 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.270
 so it is logical that there are other methods 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:07.400
 one of each knows what he has been doing 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.440
 I can more tgs the rpm is right 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.620
 I I will not get up there 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.240
 nobody here logs in here that it has 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.210
 each one has its own 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.880
 yours is a mistake is happening is 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.710
 she is having 80 100 enrolled in this 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.770
 getting back in touch with any network 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.200
 anybody is wrong, have to think 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.020
 here a year your channel if you want to have 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.500
 something serious is here a year two years and 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.320
 if you think about his future 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.720
 are long contracts if you go see the 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.479
 your contract with the net are 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.210
 contracts well done or not very long 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.900
 and you will have to fulfill and a headset 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.370
 for those who do not know it's this deal here 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.950
 You do not have to start with a 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.530
 long contract you can get with 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.740
 the quality is a little lower but this is 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.620
 My, I 'm prioritizing this to 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.740
 Video and audio quality is fine 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.130
 people must have answered a lot there 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.380
 people make it clear also 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.270
 pages the people are talking about cutting through 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.300
 disclosure does not disclose how 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:18.229
 I do I started from under that not 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.479
 there was nothing only friends who were everything 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:23.630
 everything based on everything was my friends there 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.540
 Do it there, I'll never do it there either. 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.780
 and I heard them I'm doing the way 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:33.740
 right here is the logical pages you have 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.330
 some I got it in humility I 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.409
 I came to him and I said look I'm with 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.539
 I work on youtube 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:41.089
 and I wanted to partner with the 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:44.689
 Are you going cool there? 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:48.050
 content and said 'do not calm vote' 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:49.999
 like cdc the change is with everyone and it is 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.669
 That's good, people. I hope you have. 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:55.129
 Many people answered there, thank you very much 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:57.889
 to all that success they have attended 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:00.439
 he is so little in the cock in the videos anymore 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:02.059
 who will watch from his net in his 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.189
 favorite if you are not registered 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:06.619

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:08.869

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:11.619
 have noticed and that's a hug in 

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:11.619
