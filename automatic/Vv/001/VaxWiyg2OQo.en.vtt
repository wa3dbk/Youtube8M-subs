these<00:00:18.860> laelia<00:00:19.860> pumila

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
these laelia pumila

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.760 
these laelia pumila
which<00:00:21.360> is<00:00:21.540> under<00:00:21.750> species<00:00:22.349> from<00:00:23.239> Brazil<00:00:24.239> and

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
which is under species from Brazil and

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.990 
which is under species from Brazil and
we're<00:00:25.770> gonna<00:00:25.890> be<00:00:26.099> taking<00:00:26.460> them<00:00:26.579> these<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:26.790> now

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
we're gonna be taking them these are now

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.950 
we're gonna be taking them these are now
probably<00:00:27.270> about<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:28.489> don't<00:00:29.489> know<00:00:29.779> seven<00:00:30.779> or

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
probably about I don't know seven or

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.620 
probably about I don't know seven or
eight<00:00:31.110> months<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.680> these<00:00:31.919> pots<00:00:32.270> we<00:00:33.270> go<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.600> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
eight months in these pots we go this is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.080 
eight months in these pots we go this is
a<00:00:33.750> six<00:00:34.020> centimeter<00:00:34.500> pot<00:00:34.790> we're<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.030> be

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
a six centimeter pot we're going to be

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.630 
a six centimeter pot we're going to be
taking<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> up<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.840> which<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.399> an<00:00:38.399> eight

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
taking it up to this which is a an eight

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.029 
taking it up to this which is a an eight
nap<00:00:38.879> centimeter<00:00:39.420> pot<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.620> we're<00:00:40.739> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> be

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
nap centimeter pot and we're going to be

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.900 
nap centimeter pot and we're going to be
using<00:00:42.440> plain<00:00:43.440> course<00:00:44.249> bark<00:00:46.010> which<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.309> twelve

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
using plain course bark which is twelve

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.669 
using plain course bark which is twelve
to<00:00:48.269> eighteen<00:00:48.570> millimeters<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.410> think<00:00:49.589> the

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
to eighteen millimeters I think the

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.610 
to eighteen millimeters I think the
particle<00:00:50.129> size<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:52.230> we're<00:00:52.320> gonna<00:00:52.379> do

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
particle size so what we're gonna do

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.290 
particle size so what we're gonna do
first<00:00:52.859> of<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.159> and<00:00:53.519> all<00:00:53.609> the<00:00:53.760> tags<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.179> this

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
first of all and all the tags on this

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.680 
first of all and all the tags on this
thing<00:00:55.489> take<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.609> out<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.909> pot<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.569> give

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
thing take it out to the pot just give

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.750 
thing take it out to the pot just give
it<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> squeeze<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.159> which<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.489> gonna

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it to squeeze like this which is gonna

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.309 
it to squeeze like this which is gonna
free<00:00:59.999> I<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.210> rules<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.809> stuck<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:01.319 
free I know rules of the stuck to the

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.680 
free I know rules of the stuck to the
pot<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:02.069> you<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.309> pull<00:01:02.519> it<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.789> there's<00:01:03.629> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
pot if you just pull it out there's a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
pot if you just pull it out there's a
chance<00:01:03.929> that<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.229> might<00:01:04.500> rip<00:01:05.400> some<00:01:05.610> other

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
chance that you might rip some other

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.110 
chance that you might rip some other
rooms

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
rooms

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:15.110 
rooms
so<00:01:06.390> we've<00:01:06.870> squeezed<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:11.990> as<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.230> see<00:01:14.120> got

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
so we've squeezed it as you can see got

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.560 
so we've squeezed it as you can see got
a<00:01:15.180> nice<00:01:15.330> little<00:01:15.480> root<00:01:15.780> system<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.410> on<00:01:16.530> there

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
a nice little root system going on there

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
a nice little root system going on there
so<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.690> can<00:01:18.870> say<00:01:19.050> that<00:01:19.260> there's<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> new<00:01:19.740> growth

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
so you can say that there's a new growth

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.740 
so you can say that there's a new growth
coming<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.810> can<00:01:21.810> remove<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.170> old<00:01:22.590> leaf

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
coming I can remove that old leaf

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.679 
coming I can remove that old leaf
carefully<00:01:25.520> like<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:28.370> under<00:01:29.370> the<00:01:29.490> pot

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
carefully like not under the pot

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:39.460 
carefully like not under the pot
if<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.710> start<00:01:32.189> with<00:01:37.640> now<00:01:38.640> there's<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:38.970> most

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
if I start with now there's not most

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.800 
if I start with now there's not most
route<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.909> we've<00:01:42.090> got<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
route on this so we've got really got a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.830 
route on this so we've got really got a
big<00:01:43.049> problem<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.649> gaps<00:01:44.429> appearing<00:01:45.119> around

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
big problem with gaps appearing around

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.440 
big problem with gaps appearing around
the<00:01:46.289> roots<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.890> know<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.369> with<00:01:47.880> no<00:01:48.030> compass

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the roots you know with with no compass

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.710 
the roots you know with with no compass
there<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.159> nevertheless<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> tap<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
there so nevertheless do the tap all the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.809 
there so nevertheless do the tap all the
way<00:01:51.899> around<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> set<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
way around and that's going to set the

00:01:53.819 --> 00:02:02.800 
way around and that's going to set the
lock<00:01:53.970> back<00:01:54.360> into<00:01:54.990> their<00:01:55.140> rooms<00:01:55.610> keep<00:01:56.610> going

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.020 

and<00:02:03.740> them<00:02:03.860> down

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.640 

the<00:02:09.030> lame-duck<00:02:09.360> bucket<00:02:12.140> I'll<00:02:13.140> move<00:02:13.350> on<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the lame-duck bucket I'll move on to the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:24.410 
the lame-duck bucket I'll move on to the
next<00:02:17.720> same<00:02:18.720> principle<00:02:21.230> remove<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.380> tag<00:02:23.420> give

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
next same principle remove the tag give

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.790 
next same principle remove the tag give
it<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.630> squeeze<00:02:29.450> there<00:02:30.450> we<00:02:30.540> go<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:31.410> no<00:02:31.620> root

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
it to squeeze there we go like no root

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.040 
it to squeeze there we go like no root
system<00:02:32.250> any<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.060> these<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.390> old<00:02:33.630> dead<00:02:33.870> room
