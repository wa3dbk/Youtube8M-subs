00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.760
 dear friends with you 1up and now 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.340
 I'd like to talk about disguise in 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.189
 the game world of tanks and show you the most 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.830
 invisible tanks in this game nose and so 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.359
 disguised in general guys stumbled upon 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.980
 very interesting article link to 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.289
 which I am given to you naturally 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.469
 the description here is very detailed 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.360
 masking principle 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.450
 you will have something to read the article is suitable 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.100
 both for beginners and experienced ones 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.200
 the table shows the coefficients 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.870
 masking all tanks that too 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.100
 not least how much this information 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.719
 relevant 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.510
 Well, in terms of recent experience 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.170
 ponerfili disguise after the shot I Th 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.180
 I can't say anything here and 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.699
 comment on the moment but having at least 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.890
 some information is already good at 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.570
 In general, it is important for those who did not know us 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.580
 there is a detection test in the game 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.090
 that is, when the viewpoint is on 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.950
 the tank produces some such rays that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.869
 in contact with the dimensional points then 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.960
 that blue is the overall point all 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.790
 this is a little yellow orange 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.280
 this is a viewing point that is a touching 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.840
 these rays with dimensional points 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.549
 shine this tank that is from usa 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.040
 the corner will stick out just this 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.040
 the participation of guns without dimensional point as 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.750
 shown that the tank will not light up exactly like 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.640
 if this piece of caterpillars hang around and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.240
 without an overall point that tank is also not 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.150
 light up 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.520
 because sometimes it gives you to understand when you 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.439
 leaving some part of the tank because 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.439
 the corner and do not light anyone and do not 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.360
 shine a new one that did not know what else 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.280
 important there is also 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.979
 the frequency of this check is 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.899
 detection that is according to that is, 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.399
 which is definitely the site to 50 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.979
 meters periodically from every tenth 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.530
 split second to 150 meters every 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.439
 half a second to 270 meters every second 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.570
 and up to 4 45 meters every two seconds 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.179
 this explains the fact when you drive 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.009
 allow the river and shine on those who 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.400
 not far away afterwards 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.280
 some time there 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.260
 that is, now you know why what 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.120
 still important you also have 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.379
 the duration of the light about which I already 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.959
 spoke that is guaranteed time 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.299
 exit this light is 10 seconds but it 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.860
 also depends on perk rancor 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.209
 let's say together the enemy that you 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.950
 shines here everything is explained where 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.959
 simpler and clearer that is generally us 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.540
 the frequency of exit from the light that is 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.849
 the duration of the exit from the light of 5-10 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.680
 seconds and it depends on the guys only 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.400
 server load on load 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.069
 as the developers said if so 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.530
 Pericles released memorable then he gives plus 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.230
 2 seconds to light as per it 7-12 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.480
 seconds and these 720 as he will 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.370
 treat someone like this perk 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.769
 vindictive so also to his teammate 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.879
 that can shoot something that too 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.549
 consider still consider class 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.920
 bonus camouflage nets which for 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.599
 life costs 15 percent for arrows then 10 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.750
 percent and for heavy tanks and arta 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.849
 five percent and camouflage become and gives 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.440
 the bonus is not all though five percent 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.870
 let's say it gives 4 percent to disguise 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.910
 table walk three percent heavy tank 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.160
 and arte generally 2 percent but even type 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.609
 these two percent and there is a sense 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.290
 After all, this term is a factor in what 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.659
 the difference of the terms of multipliers 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.639
 there is a valid if the tank is good 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.530
 masking ratio then bonus 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.629
 multiplier will give it a weighty 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.760
 effect if he has bad cassettes 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.840
 masking well, you know, let it be 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.430
 give virtually nothing at all 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.199
 will give here will be more important 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.639
 bonus on terms than on disguise and 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:50.560
 yet there is so q and a fact as the existence of 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.379
 muzzle brake on the gun here 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.680
 explain this with the example of the bl-10 gun 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.970
 muzzle brake and ISU-152 that is with 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.500
 the muzzle brake without bushes pt glows 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.970
 426 meters from without muzzle brake with 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.430
 the instrument was 9 with 4 22 meters of course this 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.519
 not very significant differences but still a fact 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.260
 remains a fact and so the guys on would be 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.940
 I wanted to talk about the most inconspicuous 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.190
 tanks in the game naturally class Fri-Sau 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.170
 he 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.900
 grumble at not shining and such 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.750
 below the killer because of the bushes and they have 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.820
 The coefficient of masking is not higher 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.300
 so you can if you call it even here 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.380
 you see 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.270
 of the middle tanks of the ussr most 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.800
 this object is masked 416 but also understandable 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.800
 kiton understated just to horror 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:46.130
 from pet this is su-85b su-76 but these are 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.180
 small Fri-shki and of more or less large 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.760
 this is su-122 54 here we are twenty one 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.760
 a full eight tenths of a percent well and there 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.580
 still su-101 near what is important by the way 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.770
 out of tenths pt with us 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.840
 masked object 2 68 by the way 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.640
 why is n't 63 this surprises me to remember 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.380
 lose 3 this will be a little lower than 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.110
 hang 8 but strange further we have German 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.880
 tanks at all of you can see if 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.510
 Watch German pt here we have 3 pieces and 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.830
 marder ii also a hojo that is 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.110
 sufficiently disguised yes yes it was possible 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.460
 long ago understand these them small 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.100
 silhouette by the way 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.010
 developers don't give exact numbers and 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.110
 referring to the fact that in battle it depends on 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.570
 many factors and so dry numbers 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.750
 here will be unacceptable and here all 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.770
 this is not official data 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.280
 so you can guys with them 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.520
 read and understand something for yourself 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.520
 can learn some new things for themselves 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.770
 reveal and masked tanks and think 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.510
 you will be interested so guys on 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.520
 do not forget to put this in me 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.350
 Like and subscribe to the channel 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.180
 also remind you can trample 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.950
 part in a symbolic rally 100 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.080
 gold for this you can leave 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.150
 comments at the end of which will indicate your 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.830
 game nickname and also need to be 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.470
 subscribed to the channel and like 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.110
 under this video and there guys have everything 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.270
 read the article get to know her and 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.100
 write your opinion in the general comments 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.100
 Good luck to everyone in battles and happily
