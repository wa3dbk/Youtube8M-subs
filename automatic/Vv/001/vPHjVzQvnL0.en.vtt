00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello today a little tutorial 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.620
 who will be there to complete the previous 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.340
 which dealt with the management of lives 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.839
 indeed I noticed that I had 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.869
 used some methods a little bit 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.130
 heavy and that there is a technique 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.449
 much more optimized to do what 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.029
 I did so I will I am from you 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.689
 show you go directly into the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.850
 veins sheets and we already see modified 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.570
 this part there so I remind you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.190
 here in fact we had posted a game 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.180
 over when the character of the over 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.520
 life and so we had put that when 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.460
 any key and released have 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:55.260
 recreated a hero recreated a weapon on 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.570
 give life to three and make 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.300
 again the invisible game over so that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.730
 walk but there is much more 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.729
 simple so right now i'm going 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.189
 delete these four entries and I'm going 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.380
 not replace my action action so I 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:21.600
 click on actions I go on system 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:24.799
 I'm doing arc layout rest so the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.479
 restorer will reload the level and 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.670
 I add another action of a system 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.220
 always and I'm looking for 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 variable global reset simply I'm going 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.119
 reset but life as I had 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.020
 initially defined 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.020
 so here I'm going to do a test 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.580
 toc well my life going down that did not 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.660
 not changed 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.880
 arrived at 0 I arrive on the game over 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.370
 I press a key the game 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.110
 restart my life be the good the 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.570
 good value that's it's the first 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.440
 thing 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:07.610
 I also noticed something else in 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.350
 the game I noticed I may have 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.960
 stop a little bit fast the last 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.750
 I noticed that if I do not take 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.230
 this opinion and that I die I start again 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.340
 and so my new life here it is 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.270
 not necessarily desired otherwise it's not 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.200
 necessarily very logical that lives 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.690
 come back whenever the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.670
 character dies so what it takes 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.230
 make 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.340
 we have to go back in the veins shit and 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.110
 it's this training done so who 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.540
 does that when the character of graves 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.820
 lower than the game one reloads so is 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.100
 come back and high level at 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.660
 level 1 and have without deleting a life 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.720
 so that's what to do 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.910
 here we must follow already deleted this 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.910
 entrance is there we go 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.910
 e 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.250
 move the people 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:21.230
 an action hero this position look for 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.940
 position 8.7 position and no it takes 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.590
 put the values where you want it 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.660
 reveal 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:39.410
 so I look and I find my 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:46.750
 character we are at 160 9 903 9,903 on 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:49.570
 can try I pick up and balbigny 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:59.650
 I repeat this time the food 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:04:03.130
 do not come back infinity that's it 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.240
 walk properly then a little 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.540
 interesting element too 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.200
 I add as you can see there 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.660
 for the moment the test is very small 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.209
 if you wish to have your game in 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.549
 full screen simply changed 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.890
 the settings that is here 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.970
 you click in the empty you go on 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:28.210
 view and full screen browser you 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.990
 put on on whatever you wish 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.890
 wish me I use skies we go 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.660
 do a test and we see right away 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:41.680
 that the game is in full screen that's all 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.580
