00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
and it's really important to be using

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.060 
and it's really important to be using
heat<00:02:24.100> protectants<00:02:24.970> when<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.390> straightened

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070

curl and just cause the Sun and you're

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.860 
curl and just cause the Sun and you're
just<00:02:33.640> going<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:33.910> want<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.120> massage<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.480> into

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
just going to want to massage it into

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.860 
just going to want to massage it into
your<00:02:35.140> roots<00:02:35.790> give<00:02:36.790> yourself<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.390> nice<00:02:37.660> massage

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.570 

but<00:02:43.870> my<00:02:44.019> hair<00:02:44.290> completely<00:02:44.560> isn't<00:02:45.280> covered

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
but my hair completely isn't covered

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.720 
but my hair completely isn't covered
with<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.970> that's<00:02:46.750> why<00:02:46.930> it's<00:02:47.080> good<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.730> dampen

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
with this that's why it's good to dampen

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.750 
with this that's why it's good to dampen
your<00:02:48.910> hair<00:02:49.090> before<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.570> apply<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:51.640> so

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
your hair before you apply it just so

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.000 
your hair before you apply it just so
that<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.060> easier<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.600> spread<00:02:52.810> around<00:02:52.959> but<00:02:53.380> it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
that it's easier to spread around but it

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.780 
that it's easier to spread around but it
doesn't<00:02:54.130> matter

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.369 

so<00:03:00.360> you're<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.659> going<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.959> want<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.140> keep

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
so you're just going to want to keep

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:16.059 
so you're just going to want to keep
applying<00:03:01.829> this

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.140 

and<00:03:16.640> once<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.749> pretty<00:03:18.170> much<00:03:18.730> have<00:03:19.730> your<00:03:19.939> hair

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.379 
all coated with it what I like to do is
I<00:03:25.519> like<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.510> take<00:03:26.629> about<00:03:26.780> this<00:03:27.079> much<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:28.389> I'm

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
I like to take about this much and I'm

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.929 
I like to take about this much and I'm
just<00:03:29.749> going<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:30.049> apply<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:30.639> right<00:03:31.639> on<00:03:31.790> the

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939

just going to apply this right on the
ends<00:03:33.519> even<00:03:34.519> take<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.730> little<00:03:34.969> bit<00:03:35.150> more<00:03:35.329> because

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
ends even take a little bit more because

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.140 
ends even take a little bit more because
it<00:03:35.750> ends<00:03:36.079> is<00:03:36.650> what<00:03:36.889> it<00:03:36.980> really<00:03:37.219> shows<00:03:37.670> all<00:03:38.090> of

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
it ends is what it really shows all of

the<00:03:38.389> damage<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.519> you<00:03:40.519> should<00:03:40.790> be<00:03:40.819> at<00:03:41.299> least

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
the damage and you should be at least

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.319 
the damage and you should be at least
trimming<00:03:42.230> your<00:03:42.260> hair<00:03:42.590> every<00:03:43.000> couple<00:03:44.000> weeks
