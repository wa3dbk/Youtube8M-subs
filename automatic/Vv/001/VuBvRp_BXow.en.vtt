00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
started playing games with a system that

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.430 
started playing games with a system that

move<00:04:17.549> forward<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.599> in<00:04:18.720> many<00:04:18.870> ways<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.169> find<00:04:19.289> it

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
move forward and in many ways I find it

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.649 
move forward and in many ways I find it
hilarious<00:04:19.560> when<00:04:20.430> so<00:04:20.699> many<00:04:20.910> people<00:04:21.239> seem<00:04:21.419> only

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
hilarious when so many people seem only

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.020

for<00:04:24.630> me<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.110> most<00:04:25.260> exciting<00:04:25.440> changes<00:04:26.250> have

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
for me the most exciting changes have

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.870 
for me the most exciting changes have
been<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:26.700> the

I<00:04:39.750> remember<00:04:40.410> over<00:04:40.560> 10<00:04:40.770> years<00:04:40.980> ago<00:04:41.130> discussing

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
I remember over 10 years ago discussing

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.640 
I remember over 10 years ago discussing
with<00:04:41.850> friends<00:04:42.240> how<00:04:42.570> amazing<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.290> would<00:04:43.350> be<00:04:43.410> to

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
with friends how amazing it would be to

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.230 
with friends how amazing it would be to
create<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.950> realistic<00:04:44.280> simulation<00:04:44.670> of<00:04:45.090> the

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
create a realistic simulation of the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.660 
create a realistic simulation of the
alien<00:04:45.630> movie<00:04:45.960> yeah<00:04:46.440> at<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.950> time<00:04:46.980> we<00:04:47.490> couldn't

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
alien movie yeah at the time we couldn't

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.040 
alien movie yeah at the time we couldn't
imagine<00:04:47.970> how<00:04:48.240> this<00:04:48.390> would<00:04:48.510> be<00:04:48.600> possible<00:04:48.780> given

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
imagine how this would be possible given

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.440 
imagine how this would be possible given
the<00:04:49.260> limitations<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:49.980> gaming<00:04:50.370> yeah<00:04:51.120> it's<00:04:51.270> been

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
the limitations of gaming yeah it's been

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.930 
the limitations of gaming yeah it's been
done<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:51.900> done<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.830> a<00:04:52.860> level<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.310> amazing

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
done and done to a level of amazing

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.640
