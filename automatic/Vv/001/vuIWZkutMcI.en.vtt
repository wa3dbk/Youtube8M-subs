00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
bigger if this is this right here is too

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.609 
bigger if this is this right here is too
long<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.200> simply<00:01:32.060> take<00:01:33.060> scissors<00:01:33.390> handy<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
long you simply take scissors handy and

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.630 
long you simply take scissors handy and
you<00:01:34.979> cut<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.360> way<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.460> this<00:01:38.460> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
you cut it like that way but this is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.940 
you cut it like that way but this is
just<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.710> then

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
just right so what you do is you then

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.030 
just right so what you do is you then
like<00:01:41.820> what<00:01:42.090> he<00:01:42.180> did<00:01:42.360> was<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:42.780> good

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
like what he did was really good

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.080 
like what he did was really good
decrease<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.280> only<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.610> fold<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:47.520> then

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.240 

fold<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.299> again<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.320> must<00:01:52.560> another<00:01:52.890> mistake

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
fold it again and I must another mistake

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.120 
fold it again and I must another mistake
you<00:01:53.460> did<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.299> good<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:55.020> its<00:01:55.380> ribs<00:01:55.740> that's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
you did it's not good if its ribs that's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.620 
you did it's not good if its ribs that's
bad<00:01:57.140> take<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> look<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:59.250> see<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.820> doesn't<00:02:00.270> slip

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
bad take a look you see it doesn't slip

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.620 
bad take a look you see it doesn't slip
all<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.110> way<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> there<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.490> stays<00:02:03.090> there

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
all the way up to there it stays there

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.740 
all the way up to there it stays there
so<00:02:04.619> then<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.369> add<00:02:05.579> tape<00:02:06.380> and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
so then you add tape and

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:17.880 
so then you add tape and
and<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:10.810> same<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.410> side<00:02:15.660> three<00:02:16.660> sit<00:02:17.110> back

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and get same on the side three sit back
