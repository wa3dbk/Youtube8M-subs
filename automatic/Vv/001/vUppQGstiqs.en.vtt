00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
 who may have the action now on 42 absolutely not the runner 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.970
 learned to run a marathon within a year 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.790
 this one was pretty much appreciated today 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.129
 Madoff the whole series of problems 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.780
 down runner problems 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.429
 at any age it works now 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.570
 Georg SOB wants the conversation 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.680
 Sponsors are for the therapist from Freiburg we come to there too 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.550
 are the main problems when running 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.050
 Achilles tendon problems I'm at the top 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.210
 but also knee problems today in women than in men and dense 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.220
 followed by approach discomfort to the hip for example 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.609
 Today, her tip is yes 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:38.670
 he pauses for running aground 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.129
 wrong because 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.090
 to suggest everyone immediately after a break of maybe three four weeks 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.060
 Percent the worst weaver the resilience of structures joints 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.360
 Muscles are 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.420
 if one starts to dance again after three weeks 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.750
 Sander has the same problem even to a greater extent clear again 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.200
 what do you advise 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.880
 I've kept on running but a bit reduced that may be for the 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.470
 Runners simply mean now you only think ten minutes make break and 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.950
 then watch how it goes on 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.640
 not to train the performance should be the resilience of his then 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.730
 the tissue is fractious one train 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.010
 Taking targeted pair exercises to do just that for the percent areas team 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.310
 Make problems 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.130
 this exercise 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.570
 Now look what can you do the warmest since many teeth 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.020
 stand the more old 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.080
 for example are 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.140
 the easiest way 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.910
 Feel the burden first to introduce the soul 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.320
 Weight loss support also known in the chair 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.100
 the plateaus they originated 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.670
 next level would be easy 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.719
 the whole really 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.530
 without weight loss 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.920
 and if a piece wants to go further says that actually goes well without 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.510
 Complaints are enough Cats know but should so long as said 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.210
 We do not wait, it hurts 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.899
 exactly the deed should be gone again afterwards 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.000
 Basil does exercise 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.550
 imperceptible therefore man is Russians but as by no means more level 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.260
 go Son that you bring these burdens in the tens 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.350
 and percent 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.330
 Next level would be Anna Level and stairs 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.760
 could go then 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.159
 Percent extremely Tricia strain so braking burden for the soul 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.749
 process further no 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.000
 they also started repeating how often should one do that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.830
 Every day 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.740
 second time a day maybe 15 20 repetitions 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.010
 not so the stairs go up over so what come in so both everyday use 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.969
 exactly 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:28.200
 Speaking of installation take everyday life particularly important point 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.290
 we also have to do with other exercises 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.949
 when brushing your teeth when washing your hands, for example 

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:36.119
 I'll put one foot on the left at five to twelve 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:38.939
 CNY to five to twelve soft knees bend 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.680
 and now do those indiscriminate exercises over the coordination of my knee and gave 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.840
 so that even in everyday life again what made two minutes brushing two 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.949
 Train for a few minutes that's better for the front 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.729
 the 5 the knee problems he gets but how they see damage 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:58.459
 shown that percentages latest quotes 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.899
 Namely Marten examinations USA made where one has seen knee pain 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.899
 You can also influence the wall race of the hip muscles and 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.509
 it's a body all connected with everything so it's really great simple 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.369
 Exercise they did in their study 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:15.419
 Milk farmers put up 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.859
 and thus exercise hip flexor muscles 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.119
 which indirectly stabilizes the knee because it prevents that is never in the 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.739
 Burden on them gives way 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.959
 So a very simple story association for a few euros and in these 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.599
 Invest time behind Vettel 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.359
 Thank you very much
