00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello to all in this video I you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.700
 explain how to make cream 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:13.099
 chantilly also background we will need to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:17.930
 whole cream liquid icing sugar 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:20.130
 a siphon and two gas cartridges 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.800
 so here we are going to start 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.800
 pour the cream into the siphon 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:42.840
 do not pour to the top then we go 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.840
 put 3 tablespoons icing sugar 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:01:17.810
 we close we're shaking that's it 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.110
 will then introduce the first 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.110
 cartridge so we put in an acer 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:38.300
 here we hear that gas has been 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:44.030
 inside we shake we remove the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:46.420
 cartridge and we put the other one 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.420
 principle 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.310
 the gas is inside and we shake 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.399
 so here is once done will not remain 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.399
 to serve 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:18.349
 like these we get so from the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.349
 whipped cream with siphon soon in voice
