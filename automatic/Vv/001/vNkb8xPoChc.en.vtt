00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:16.470
 hello everyone from fly 239 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:20.189
 with a broken sensor that's how we see 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:25.560
 Now mother sensor for this to us 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:31.289
 you need here such things plus 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.920
 So here I was picking up a point and a screwdriver all 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.540
 let's remove the cap and and we will 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.579
 use to be able to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.090
 there throw our bolts rake 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:53.550
 look here are four bolts unscrewed such 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:55.230
 here's a screwdriver cover i remind 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.500
 use as a storage vessel 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.500
 bolts to not lose them 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:19.640
 then take this or that thing and 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.450
 here is how you see 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.880
 can and nail 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.880
 but better and plastic stuff 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.850
 a button falls out, you lose 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.080
 Here you took this speaker if you need 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:20.920
 change 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:25.500
 let's put it off aside 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.500
 sensor disconnect it 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.670
 see if there are any buttons here too 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.670
 are there any bolts here 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:55.830
 there seems to be no button right now 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:56.580
 unstick as we shoot so doing 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:04.319
 At once 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:09.620
 so as not to break the loop here 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.620
 We went to withdraw from our fee 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.180
 see how it is removed from us 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:43.190
 here we have it with the display so here 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:48.950
 and removes let's put it in place 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:52.840
 here here open two bolts with him 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.840
 completely all that does not interfere 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.960
 see everything is removed is normal 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:21.820
 Here removed we put off until the side well and 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:28.810
 here it â€™s the sensor itself 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:33.220
 We see like this 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:37.900
 way you can him with him here after 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.580
 as we cleared here the frame is needed for 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:45.750
 start checking sensor 1 it 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.750
 workable bought a sensor 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.400
 such is the teaching 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.509
 wait for it to turn on test 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.030
 that's how we see 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:41.350
 everything works all keys 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.350
 top everything works everything is disconnectable and 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:51.410
 so here we use double-sided tape 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.389
 who have no scotch can neatly on 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:06:01.300
 glue 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:06:01.300
 I prefer adhesive tape to glue 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.140
 pasted 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:25.569
 wipe here also there was nothing 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:27.900
 no paws you left no trace 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.900
 us 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:45.529
 and here we also clean ourselves a crane in order 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.529
 nothing left 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.530
 paste it all back 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.540
 we connect a loop 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:18.770
 Here is the principle of replacing the very 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.750
 Now we just collect the sensor for fly 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.020
 it in reverse order and use 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.460
 phone all all until you meet new 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.639
 who have not subscribed to my channel 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.970
 subscribe and who helped put the finger 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.970
 up
