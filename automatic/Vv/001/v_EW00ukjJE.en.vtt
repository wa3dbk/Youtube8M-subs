00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
the cover above the cab I was thinking

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.550 
the cover above the cab I was thinking
about<00:03:50.930> doing<00:03:51.079> blue<00:03:51.349> there<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.829> blue<00:03:52.760> there

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.789 
I think the elevator channel sets about
to<00:04:00.199> do<00:04:00.979> the<00:04:01.159> whole<00:04:01.459> top<00:04:01.940> here<00:04:02.449> blue<00:04:02.799> orange

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
to do the whole top here blue orange

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.670 
to do the whole top here blue orange
pink<00:04:04.099> yellow<00:04:04.430> green<00:04:04.900> then<00:04:05.900> blue<00:04:05.930> along<00:04:06.440> the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
pink yellow green then blue along the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.000 
pink yellow green then blue along the
bottom<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:08.319> haven't<00:04:09.319> decided<00:04:09.650> what<00:04:09.889> I'm

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
bottom so I haven't decided what I'm

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.369 
bottom so I haven't decided what I'm
going<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.250> do<00:04:10.370> yet<00:04:10.639> so<00:04:10.849> this<00:04:11.269> primer<00:04:12.019> is

supposed<00:04:12.829> to<00:04:13.159> cure<00:04:14.060> for<00:04:14.620> at<00:04:15.620> least<00:04:15.829> a<00:04:16.099> day<00:04:16.340> I'm

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
supposed to cure for at least a day I'm

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.449 
supposed to cure for at least a day I'm
the<00:04:16.789> like<00:04:16.970> here<00:04:17.389> for<00:04:17.599> a<00:04:17.630> day<00:04:17.870> or<00:04:18.049> two<00:04:18.400> while<00:04:19.400> I

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.360 
get comments on what paint scheme I
should<00:04:23.060> use<00:04:23.240> so<00:04:23.560> guess<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:24.800> is<00:04:24.979> history<00:04:25.310> in
