00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.250
 hi to all the boys 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.910
 welcome to the second by use 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:17.160
 siting these the dec profile we have 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:21.039
 left hanging of the bar minga bis e 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.730
 the completed seed sky completed 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:29.080
 really and modified post mac 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.779
 always based also on the tops they have 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.710
 that fact, however, took a bit of inspiration 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.570
 I think I'll have to wait again 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.420
 but I think this list goes already 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.890
 well to be mounted to make i 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.690
 tournaments and things so it will be the part 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.200
 final of the bar profile of the dec profile 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.310
 BIS 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:56.860
 oh well we go to us immediately 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:58.540
 I illustrate then all burning abyss 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.640
 let's assume that yes 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.310
 they destroy if we do not control others 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.080
 show me that I'm burning avis have 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.230
 all this effect and then each of 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.070
 they have an additional effect except the 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:16.350
 our big tumer that came out in the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.760
 new sachet of us ruby ​​challengers 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.380
 this becomes special if there is not between 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.400
 magic traps and no server do 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.200
 only virgiles because it can be 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.690
 used only as a leasing subject for a 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:36.970
 bar nina bis then three per disk weapons 3 for 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.530
 graf 3 for five add in 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.229
 hand a demon level 3 and vote 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.710
 special a ming bar and we revoke species 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:50.310
 do not speak from the cemetery these valdes 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:53.260
 then the new entries are the call cup and the alix 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.100
 call cabral we just need to say 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.080
 to target more than fer lake or 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.330
 to evoke much more easily 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.190
 many even if they have a good effect 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.740
 cous or when the effects of the muzzles 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.530
 let us see this here go back to 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.420
 one positioned on the ground in the hands of 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.280
 controller let's say they could do with 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.840
 better 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.200
 we hope for new reinforcements 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.760
 reinforcements much stronger and then the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.450
 basic card of the deck that turin 3 for 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:37.030
 essential to revoke any 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:47.850
 the ramos area of ​​rank 3 then therefore 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:58.840
 then in total we play 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:03:01.660
 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 18 monsters now 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:09.730
 finished monsters department we move to that 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:13.780
 of 3 spells per gobin swindler 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.060
 serves to speed up the 32 deck for by 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.050
 mystical space typhoon for any 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:25.290
 event with clive ott with vanity in 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:27.880
 mirror match against shuttles and other stuff 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.920
 Unfortunately the barese brought the fool 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.540
 limited allows us to do all the 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.500
 junk with bread with monsters 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.570
 burning is an anime charge can always 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.130
 come in handy I tried the list of 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.870
 patrick van 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:48.780
 in reality it can therefore be useful 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.780
 we try a total of 7 spells 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.260
 then two for the lake of fire of the abyss 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.180
 burning win condition just because 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.160
 we send two barnini monsters we have 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.030
 on land we destroy three cards on the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.990
 terrain I can send then send 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.850
 first bit destroyed then very strong 2 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.890
 for why 3 for me seems a little too much 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.840
 distracted the heavy even if Italy 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.450
 moisi 23 for and can stay there 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.870
 quietly which three for of 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:24.130
 fenix blasters are shoes and 2 leaks 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.620
 always have 20 to two discarded players per 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.470
 vote of the top car vanity in this 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.250
 meta that can be used both in 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:37.810
 offensive and defensive mode then 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:39.940
 also the temper trap stands and 2 skills 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.850
 results and for the effects of the monsters 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.070
 wind has and various stuff a warning is a 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:55.980
 composed of that in this goal e 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:05:05.650
 the main is now over 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:07.900
 let's move on to the extra then a virgil in 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.440
 this case to me I did not look ever 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.000
 to do it you have to do more than one duel 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:19.630
 so I think one goes well though 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.970
 also in two accomplices postal 2 dante 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.720
 ditto for the third I happen to do the 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.330
 third to two chasms so we can stay 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.960
 then two downers for the lakes of various branches 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:35.080
 3 a rhythm that can become the 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.620
 bunch vector against milan attack 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:43.340
 2 alucard compacts in time 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.130
 because you often do it very often in 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.040
 Germany to stay a while with prohibit them 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:53.300
 to be the congo painter for 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:57.110
 knock down click killer and leo of one 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:01.250
 brilliant number 30 and then paper making 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:04.940
 win the number 47 shark games 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:12.220
 total nightmare of 15 extra cards 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:12.220
 obviously very easy as what 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.910
 here is the ex we also finished now 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.699
 let's go to the site which is a lot 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.220
 subjective as a side of the board 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:28.039
 of the council at least in mine 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:32.050
 comics we play so we play 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:36.260
 this place I have a sorrow of sadness 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:38.539
 this is the background to just leave the ball 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.960
 and all the other technicians don't leave 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:48.050
 that the 2 loss effects are activated 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:50.780
 head of best monac 2 max c for their 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.620
 special actions 2 stormed because if 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.780
 yes of these uses the opponent's moves 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.139
 two fusions pescia dom 2 exchange 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.900
 creatures in all dec 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:05.210
 can work in all techs since 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.360
 you exchange balling the internal palinsisti 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.220
 of the opponent types of monsters appeal 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:15.080
 of the adversary the mirror the newspapers 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:18.010
 there is for statella of various things and 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.440
 mirror goods these two are very strong 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:24.020
 very strong since the comic books do not 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.050
 there are very competitive scoring 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.800
 all shuttle parking artifacts are 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:34.889
 few of the data remained a minor in 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:40.770
 so it's better to have a side too 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:42.150
 good enough guys what to say 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.620
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:51.240
 you can take inspiration from this 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:53.719
 eclipse and see you next time 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.719
 opening 

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:03.210
 I can say I think to make quebec profile 

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.020
 to fool time between an opening 

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.710
 the other 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:12.379
 so rest assured hi guys 

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:12.379
 the next and put a nice like hello
