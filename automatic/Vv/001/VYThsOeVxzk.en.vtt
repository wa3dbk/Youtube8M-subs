hi<00:00:06.270> YouTube<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.990> got<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> video<00:00:07.529> request<00:00:08.189> from

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 
hi YouTube I got a video request from

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.520 
hi YouTube I got a video request from
small<00:00:10.019> pet<00:00:10.380> care<00:00:10.710> 101<00:00:11.690> she<00:00:12.690> requested<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.380> video

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
small pet care 101 she requested a video

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.790 
small pet care 101 she requested a video
about<00:00:14.429> feet<00:00:14.820> lamps<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.750> I'm<00:00:16.440> going<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.619> do<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
about feet lamps so I'm going to do a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.980 
about feet lamps so I'm going to do a
video<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.220> those<00:00:17.580> I'm<00:00:18.090> also<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.690> include

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
video on those I'm also going to include

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.529 
video on those I'm also going to include
UV<00:00:19.560> lights<00:00:19.970> which<00:00:20.970> are<00:00:21.090> also<00:00:21.270> very<00:00:21.420> important

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
UV lights which are also very important

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.060 
UV lights which are also very important
heat<00:00:24.539> lamps<00:00:26.420> maintain<00:00:27.420> your<00:00:27.990> bearded<00:00:28.710> dragons

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
heat lamps maintain your bearded dragons

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.979 
heat lamps maintain your bearded dragons
body<00:00:29.429> temperature<00:00:30.000> at<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.990> normal<00:00:31.880> temperature

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
body temperature at a normal temperature

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.620 
body temperature at a normal temperature
because<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.800> probably<00:00:35.700> know<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.510> are

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
because as you probably know they are

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.799 
because as you probably know they are
cold<00:00:36.989> blooded<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.309> their<00:00:38.940> body<00:00:39.300> temperature

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
cold blooded so their body temperature

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.900 
cold blooded so their body temperature
is<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.140> same<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.710> whatever<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.489> temperature

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
is the same as whatever the temperature

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.479 
is the same as whatever the temperature
around<00:00:42.030> them<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.590> since<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.129> are

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
around them is and they since they are

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.049 
around them is and they since they are
native<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.649> Australia<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.190> pretty<00:00:47.610> warm

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
native to Australia it is pretty warm

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.520 
native to Australia it is pretty warm
pretty<00:00:48.719> warm<00:00:48.960> year-round<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> they<00:00:52.260> need<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
pretty warm year-round so they need to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.490 
pretty warm year-round so they need to
be<00:00:52.710> warm<00:00:53.129> year-round<00:00:53.989> which<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
be warm year-round which is what the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.860 
be warm year-round which is what the
heat<00:00:55.680> lamp<00:00:55.920> does<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.609> buy<00:00:59.760> them<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.359> pet

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
heat lamp does you can buy them at pet

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.030 
heat lamp does you can buy them at pet
stores<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.320> probably<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.799> them<00:01:04.890> out

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
stores you can probably get them out

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.480 
stores you can probably get them out
like<00:01:05.189> hardware<00:01:05.640> stores<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.090> stuff<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:06.930> I

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
like hardware stores and stuff but I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.929 
like hardware stores and stuff but I
that<00:01:08.490> would<00:01:08.640> be<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.090> pet<00:01:09.420> store<00:01:10.460> her<00:01:11.460> heat<00:01:11.760> lamp

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
that would be a pet store her heat lamp

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.969 
that would be a pet store her heat lamp
actually<00:01:12.420> came<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:12.780> her<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> said<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.680> well

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
actually came with her and said as well

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.399 
actually came with her and said as well
as<00:01:14.100> her<00:01:14.250> you'd<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.570> light<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:15.900> I'm<00:01:16.080> sure<00:01:16.290> you

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
as her you'd be light but I'm sure you

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
as her you'd be light but I'm sure you
can<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:18.119> source<00:01:18.360> too<00:01:19.850> if<00:01:20.850> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
can get that at that source too if you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.700 
can get that at that source too if you
have<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.840> mesh<00:01:22.170> top<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:23.909> cage<00:01:26.030> then<00:01:27.710> just

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
have a mesh top to your cage then just

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.350 
have a mesh top to your cage then just
be<00:01:28.890> sure<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.159> when<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.700> put<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> heat<00:01:30.150> lamp

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
be sure that when you put the heat lamp

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.090 
be sure that when you put the heat lamp
on<00:01:31.909> back<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.509> top<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> cage<00:01:34.710> that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
on back like on top of the cage that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.160 
on back like on top of the cage that
it's<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> mesh<00:01:36.000> part<00:01:36.299> not<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.990> outer

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
it's on the mesh part not on the outer

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.770 
it's on the mesh part not on the outer
rim<00:01:37.610> because<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> goes<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.360> outer<00:01:39.540> rim

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
rim because if it goes on the outer rim

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.590 
rim because if it goes on the outer rim
it<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.229> melt<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:41.670> be<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> big

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it can melt it and that would be a a big

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.469 
it can melt it and that would be a a big
mess<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.229> B<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.100> would<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.250> hard<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> take<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
mess and B it would be hard to take the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.020 
mess and B it would be hard to take the
lid<00:01:45.659> off<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.890> careful<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.909> have

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
lid off so be careful of that and I have

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.210 
lid off so be careful of that and I have
I<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.630> also<00:01:48.869> heard<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.860> burn

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
I have also heard that it can burn

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.969 
I have also heard that it can burn
through<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> mesh<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.979> haven't

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
through the mesh but I haven't

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.270 
through the mesh but I haven't
experienced<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.540> class<00:01:55.100> for<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> year

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
experienced it like in class for a year

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.399 
experienced it like in class for a year
we<00:01:56.399> had<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> school<00:01:56.820> pet<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.270> my<00:01:57.479> teacher<00:01:57.719> had

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
we had a school pet and my teacher had

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.399 
we had a school pet and my teacher had
always<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.969> had<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.270> heat<00:02:00.390> lamp<00:02:00.570> directly<00:02:01.229> on

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
always just had to heat lamp directly on

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.280 
always just had to heat lamp directly on
the<00:02:01.860> mesh<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.210> worked<00:02:03.390> out<00:02:03.570> fine<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:04.140> her

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the mesh and it worked out fine for her

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.399 
the mesh and it worked out fine for her
so<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.540> want<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> be

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
so I don't know you just want to be

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.580 
so I don't know you just want to be
careful<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.920> watch<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.959> do<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.470> an

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
careful and watch it if you do have an

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.240 
careful and watch it if you do have an
experience<00:02:11.069> with<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.370> then

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
experience with that then

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.820 
experience with that then
you<00:02:13.250> can<00:02:13.459> get<00:02:13.670> clipped<00:02:14.120> or<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.720> can<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.050> just

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
you can get clipped or you can like just

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.940 
you can get clipped or you can like just
hang<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.190> like<00:02:16.370> above<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.470> just<00:02:18.650> like<00:02:18.770> hook

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
hang it like above so and just like hook

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.220 
hang it like above so and just like hook
it<00:02:19.130> above<00:02:19.580> right<00:02:19.970> above<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.330> th<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:20.959> it's<00:02:21.110> not

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
it above right above the th so it's not

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.680 
it above right above the th so it's not
touching<00:02:21.470> exactly<00:02:22.220> but<00:02:22.880> always<00:02:23.180> be<00:02:23.330> careful

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
touching exactly but always be careful

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.740

not<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.989> touch<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.980> lock<00:02:25.220> or<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:25.819> part<00:02:26.090> just

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
not to touch the lock or this part just

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.260 
not to touch the lock or this part just
pick<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.080> up<00:02:27.200> by<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.349> wire<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.310> UV<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.970> fine

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
pick it up by the wire the UV is fine

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.320 
pick it up by the wire the UV is fine
but<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.989> UV<00:02:33.350> light<00:02:33.709> is<00:02:34.370> very<00:02:34.819> important

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
but the the UV light is very important

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.020 
but the the UV light is very important
it<00:02:35.600> gives<00:02:35.810> them<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:37.069> does<00:02:37.310> for<00:02:37.550> them<00:02:37.670> what<00:02:37.910> the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
it gives them it does for them what the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.030 
it gives them it does for them what the
Sun<00:02:38.239> does<00:02:38.269> for<00:02:38.720> us<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:39.650> gives<00:02:39.830> some

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
Sun does for us so it gives some

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.449 
Sun does for us so it gives some
vitamins<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.360> stuff<00:02:41.630> like<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:43.069> doesn't

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
vitamins and stuff like that it doesn't

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.009 
vitamins and stuff like that it doesn't
give<00:02:43.580> them<00:02:43.670> warmth<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.450> gives<00:02:44.690> them<00:02:44.959> the

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
give them warmth but it gives them the

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.229 
give them warmth but it gives them the
vitamin<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:47.150> that's<00:02:47.330> also<00:02:47.660> very<00:02:47.690> important

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
vitamin so that's also very important

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.680 
vitamin so that's also very important

them<00:03:12.620> taking<00:03:13.519> them<00:03:13.640> back<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.769> don't<00:03:15.769> know<00:03:15.920> if

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
them taking them back I don't know if

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
too hot oh yeah when their mouth is open

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.940 
too hot oh yeah when their mouth is open
it<00:03:25.370> means<00:03:25.519> they're<00:03:25.730> happy<00:03:26.410> her<00:03:27.410> heat<00:03:27.739> lamp

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
it means they're happy her heat lamp

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.849 
it means they're happy her heat lamp
isn't<00:03:28.220> very<00:03:28.519> strong<00:03:28.910> which<00:03:29.269> is<00:03:29.420> why<00:03:29.720> we<00:03:30.590> have

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
isn't very strong which is why we have

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.800 
isn't very strong which is why we have
this<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:34.549> just<00:03:34.760> brings<00:03:34.970> her<00:03:35.150> closer<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.630> the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
this so it just brings her closer to the

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.099 
this so it just brings her closer to the
top<00:03:36.140> so<00:03:36.620> it's<00:03:36.799> better<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:41.209> that's<00:03:41.810> what<00:03:42.079> that

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
top so it's better so that's what that

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.900 
top so it's better so that's what that
does<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:44.260> hope<00:03:45.260> this<00:03:45.470> helped<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.130> if<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:46.640> have
