right<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.489> I<00:02:10.519> have<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.729> dick<00:02:11.000> around<00:02:11.030> with<00:02:11.450> it

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
right and I have to dick around with it

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.100 
right and I have to dick around with it
later<00:02:11.780> on<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:13.269> that's<00:02:14.269> a<00:02:14.480> scoop<00:02:14.720> with<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:15.079> I

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
later on so that's a scoop with that I

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.750 
later on so that's a scoop with that I
want<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.349> pull<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.620> tie<00:02:15.799> rod<00:02:16.040> off<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.610> and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
want to pull the tie rod off of it and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.180 
want to pull the tie rod off of it and
this<00:02:17.510> housing<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.110> going<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.380> get<00:02:18.500> scrapped

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
this housing is going to get scrapped

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.190 
this housing is going to get scrapped
because<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.209> don't<00:02:20.390> think<00:02:20.510> anybody<00:02:20.989> will

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
because I don't think anybody will

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.559 
because I don't think anybody will
really<00:02:21.500> want<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.799> they're<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:22.459> cheap<00:02:22.730> nobody

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
really want it they're so cheap nobody

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.170 
really want it they're so cheap nobody
really<00:02:23.750> buys<00:02:23.870> them<00:02:24.140> anymore<00:02:24.970> there's<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
really buys them anymore there's the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.370 
really buys them anymore there's the
ring<00:02:26.329> and<00:02:26.480> pinion<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> 376<00:02:29.109> 373<00:02:30.109> gear

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
ring and pinion it is a 376 373 gear

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.940 
ring and pinion it is a 376 373 gear
ratio<00:02:31.389> it's<00:02:32.389> pretty<00:02:32.660> pretty<00:02:33.380> decent<00:02:33.739> shape

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
ratio it's pretty pretty decent shape

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.710 
ratio it's pretty pretty decent shape
it's<00:02:34.400> got<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.549> little<00:02:34.730> bit<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:34.940> rust<00:02:35.120> on<00:02:35.299> it<00:02:35.359> but

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
it's got a little bit of rust on it but

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.050 
it's got a little bit of rust on it but
overall<00:02:36.680> not<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.190> bad<00:02:37.370> I'm<00:02:37.549> pretty<00:02:37.609> happy

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
overall not that bad I'm pretty happy

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.840 
overall not that bad I'm pretty happy
with<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.480> bearings<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:39.220> little<00:02:40.220> little

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
with it the bearings a little little

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.059 
with it the bearings a little little
rusty<00:02:41.239> but<00:02:41.269> again<00:02:41.600> I'll<00:02:42.079> read<00:02:42.350> be<00:02:42.530> replacing

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
rusty but again I'll read be replacing

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.199 
rusty but again I'll read be replacing
those<00:02:43.660> each<00:02:44.660> side<00:02:44.989> had<00:02:45.139> a<00:02:45.170> metal<00:02:45.889> washer<00:02:46.209> I'm

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
those each side had a metal washer I'm

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.280 
those each side had a metal washer I'm
guessing<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.930> adjust<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:49.840> load<00:02:50.840> and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
guessing to adjust the the load and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.819 
guessing to adjust the the load and
center<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.489> center<00:02:52.880> chunk<00:02:53.120> there<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.829> haven't

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
center the center chunk there I haven't

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.319 
center the center chunk there I haven't
found<00:02:54.980> any<00:02:55.130> any<00:02:56.060> shims<00:02:56.510> at<00:02:56.870> all<00:02:57.109> so<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.370> don't

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
found any any shims at all so I don't

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.729 
found any any shims at all so I don't
have<00:02:59.389> to<00:02:59.540> get<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.690> bad<00:02:59.930> thing<00:03:00.230> I'm<00:03:00.500> probably

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
have to get a bad thing I'm probably

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.280 
have to get a bad thing I'm probably
going<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.010> have<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.160> shop<00:03:01.459> put<00:03:02.389> those<00:03:02.569> in<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
going to have a shop put those in the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.370 
going to have a shop put those in the
other<00:03:03.500> housing<00:03:03.920> for<00:03:04.130> me<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.489> because<00:03:04.639> I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
other housing for me just because I

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.360 
other housing for me just because I
don't<00:03:06.380> know<00:03:06.470> what<00:03:06.620> I'm<00:03:06.709> doing<00:03:06.980> because<00:03:07.130> I've

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
don't know what I'm doing because I've

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.860 
don't know what I'm doing because I've
never<00:03:07.489> done<00:03:07.609> it<00:03:07.819> before

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
never done it before

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.750 
never done it before
seemingly<00:03:09.470> give<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.739> pretty<00:03:09.920> easy<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.310> do<00:03:10.489> and

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
seemingly give you pretty easy to do and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.370 
seemingly give you pretty easy to do and
I<00:03:11.239> could<00:03:11.420> get<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.599> couple<00:03:12.079> like<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:14.380> figure

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
I could get a couple like the figure

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.449 
I could get a couple like the figure
what<00:03:15.500> it's<00:03:15.620> called<00:03:15.829> but<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.069> tool<00:03:16.250> that

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
what it's called but the tool that

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.750 
what it's called but the tool that
measures<00:03:16.819> backlash<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:17.690> things<00:03:17.840> like<00:03:18.019> that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
measures backlash and things like that

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.250 
measures backlash and things like that
and<00:03:19.760> do<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:20.000> myself<00:03:20.150> it's<00:03:20.780> probably<00:03:21.139> not<00:03:21.200> very

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
and do it myself it's probably not very

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.839 
and do it myself it's probably not very
difficult<00:03:21.620> but<00:03:22.069> I<00:03:22.099> don't<00:03:22.310> have<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.459> press

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
difficult but I don't have a press

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.760 
difficult but I don't have a press
either

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
either

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.890 
either
so<00:03:25.490> I'm<00:03:25.550> hoping<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.360> know<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.480> can<00:03:26.750> bring

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
so I'm hoping that you know I can bring

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.670 
so I'm hoping that you know I can bring
them<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.110> bear<00:03:27.380> housing<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.100> give<00:03:29.060> them<00:03:29.180> those

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
them a bear housing and give them those

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.460 
them a bear housing and give them those
gears<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.270> supply<00:03:32.270> them<00:03:32.480> with<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.930> install

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
gears and supply them with the install

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.920 
gears and supply them with the install
kit<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.770> bearings<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:34.820> probably<00:03:35.420> new<00:03:35.540> axle

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
kit and bearings and probably new axle

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.770 
kit and bearings and probably new axle
seals<00:03:36.140> as<00:03:36.290> well<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:37.250> hopefully<00:03:38.060> they<00:03:38.210> can<00:03:38.480> set

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
seals as well and hopefully they can set

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.410 
seals as well and hopefully they can set
that<00:03:38.960> up<00:03:38.990> for<00:03:39.290> me

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
that up for me

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.300 
that up for me
relatively<00:03:41.420> cheaply<00:03:41.960> I<00:03:44.980> would<00:03:45.980> think

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
relatively cheaply I would think

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.540 
relatively cheaply I would think
probably<00:03:49.060> under<00:03:50.060> 200<00:03:50.480> bucks<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.840> would<00:03:50.960> hope

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
probably under 200 bucks I would hope

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.590 
probably under 200 bucks I would hope
you<00:03:52.550> know<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.670> did<00:03:52.880> all<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.150> hard<00:03:53.240> work<00:03:53.450> and

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
you know I did all the hard work and

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.770 
you know I did all the hard work and
stripping<00:03:54.020> it<00:03:54.110> all<00:03:54.230> they<00:03:54.350> have<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.620> do<00:03:54.740> is

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
stripping it all they have to do is

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.190 
stripping it all they have to do is
install<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.930> gears<00:03:57.170> really<00:03:57.980> easy<00:03:59.080> but<00:04:00.080> the

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
install the gears really easy but the

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.920 
install the gears really easy but the
scraps<00:04:00.470> loaded<00:04:00.800> up<00:04:00.920> trailers<00:04:01.700> cut<00:04:01.880> down<00:04:02.090> so

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
scraps loaded up trailers cut down so

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.110 
scraps loaded up trailers cut down so
that's<00:04:02.990> kind<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.290> where<00:04:03.440> we're<00:04:03.590> at<00:04:03.620> today<00:04:04.120> it's

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
that's kind of where we're at today it's

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.990 
that's kind of where we're at today it's
gotten<00:04:05.510> pretty<00:04:05.630> cold<00:04:05.960> here<00:04:06.170> lately<00:04:06.490> so<00:04:07.490> I'm

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
gotten pretty cold here lately so I'm

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.100 
gotten pretty cold here lately so I'm
going<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.150> try<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.300> work<00:04:08.510> on<00:04:08.630> that<00:04:08.660> stuff<00:04:08.990> in

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
going to try to work on that stuff in

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.540 
going to try to work on that stuff in
the<00:04:09.200> garage<00:04:09.350> I<00:04:09.470> might<00:04:09.800> bring<00:04:09.980> my<00:04:10.130> torpedo

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
the garage I might bring my torpedo

another<00:04:14.780> update<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:17.390> leaf<00:04:17.570> blower<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.680> worked

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
another update the leaf blower it worked

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.090 
another update the leaf blower it worked
great<00:04:19.360> short-lived<00:04:20.360> but<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.200> was<00:04:21.350> it<00:04:21.709> works

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
great short-lived but it was it works

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.160 
great short-lived but it was it works
good<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:25.010> crankshaft<00:04:25.340> snapped<00:04:25.990> snap<00:04:26.990> right

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
good the crankshaft snapped snap right

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.440 
good the crankshaft snapped snap right
in<00:04:27.290> half<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:28.520> threw<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.820> blade<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.240> bent

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
in half and it threw the blade and bent

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.570 
in half and it threw the blade and bent
it<00:04:29.600> all<00:04:29.720> up<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.140> I<00:04:30.410> can<00:04:30.710> no<00:04:30.830> longer<00:04:30.860> use<00:04:31.190> this

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
it all up so I can no longer use this

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.320 
it all up so I can no longer use this
unit<00:04:33.100> I<00:04:34.100> was<00:04:34.460> looking<00:04:34.700> for<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.880> fan<00:04:35.090> but

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
unit I was looking for a fan but

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.210 
unit I was looking for a fan but
apparently<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:35.990> can't<00:04:36.230> find<00:04:36.470> them

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
apparently I can't find them

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.190 
apparently I can't find them
my<00:04:37.610> advice<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:38.210> somebody<00:04:38.690> that's<00:04:38.840> doing<00:04:39.110> a

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
my advice to somebody that's doing a

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.160 
my advice to somebody that's doing a
repower<00:04:39.560> is<00:04:39.970> buy<00:04:40.970> something<00:04:41.480> with<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.780> exact

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
repower is buy something with the exact

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.670 
repower is buy something with the exact
same<00:04:42.380> shaft<00:04:42.770> size<00:04:43.070> don't<00:04:44.230> don't<00:04:45.230> skimp<00:04:45.530> out

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
same shaft size don't don't skimp out

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.210 
same shaft size don't don't skimp out
and<00:04:45.950> use<00:04:46.070> a<00:04:46.100> 3/4<00:04:46.730> shaft<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.210> an<00:04:47.330> adapter<00:04:47.630> just

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
and use a 3/4 shaft and an adapter just

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.490 
and use a 3/4 shaft and an adapter just
it<00:04:49.220> didn't<00:04:49.550> hold<00:04:49.640> together<00:04:49.820> didn't<00:04:50.690> work

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
it didn't hold together didn't work

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.500 
it didn't hold together didn't work
so<00:04:53.070> not<00:04:53.280> with<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.520> looks<00:04:54.060> like<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.330> bends

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
so not with that looks like the bends

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.540 
so not with that looks like the bends
warmed<00:04:54.900> up<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:55.680> can<00:04:55.860> move<00:04:55.980> it<00:04:56.130> out

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
warmed up you can move it out

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.680 
warmed up you can move it out
so<00:04:58.090> take<00:04:59.020> care<00:04:59.050> guys<00:04:59.379> and<00:05:00.389> I'll<00:05:01.389> have<00:05:01.539> more

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
so take care guys and I'll have more

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.399 
so take care guys and I'll have more
updates<00:05:02.080> on<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:03.120> 14<00:05:04.120> bolt<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:05.940> 10<00:05:06.940> bolt<00:05:07.409> build

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
updates on the 14 bolt and 10 bolt build

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:14.700 
updates on the 14 bolt and 10 bolt build
for<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.550> 3/4<00:05:10.090> ton<00:05:10.240> swap<00:05:10.569> in<00:05:11.379> my<00:05:12.060> 77<00:05:13.060> k10<00:05:13.710> which

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
for the 3/4 ton swap in my 77 k10 which

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.760 
for the 3/4 ton swap in my 77 k10 which
is<00:05:14.860> now<00:05:14.979> going<00:05:15.099> to<00:05:15.190> be<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.340> K<00:05:15.550> 20<00:05:16.169> it<00:05:17.169> has<00:05:17.379> pretty

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
is now going to be a K 20 it has pretty

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.980 
is now going to be a K 20 it has pretty
much<00:05:17.949> once<00:05:18.220> on<00:05:18.400> everything<00:05:18.789> else<00:05:18.970> so<00:05:19.389> this<00:05:19.780> is

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
much once on everything else so this is

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.249 
much once on everything else so this is
the<00:05:20.169> last<00:05:20.349> little<00:05:20.740> bit

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 
the last little bit

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.170 
the last little bit
this<00:05:23.259> 10<00:05:23.470> bolt<00:05:23.680> is<00:05:23.800> a<00:05:23.830> is<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.699> c<00:05:24.849> exact

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
this 10 bolt is a is the c exact

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.659 
this 10 bolt is a is the c exact
identical<00:05:25.659> to<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:25.990> 1-ton<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:27.190> only<00:05:27.370> difference

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
identical to a 1-ton the only difference

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.279 
identical to a 1-ton the only difference
is<00:05:27.819> the<00:05:27.940> spring<00:05:28.210> perches<00:05:28.449> are<00:05:28.780> outboard<00:05:29.199> of

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
is the spring perches are outboard of

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.689 
is the spring perches are outboard of
the<00:05:29.409> frame<00:05:29.620> whereas<00:05:29.949> the<00:05:30.099> one<00:05:30.250> tons<00:05:30.490> are

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
the frame whereas the one tons are

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.379 
the frame whereas the one tons are
inboard<00:05:31.889> of<00:05:32.889> course<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.789> 10<00:05:34.000> bolt<00:05:34.240> is

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
inboard of course the 10 bolt is

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.350 
inboard of course the 10 bolt is
actually<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:34.990> exact<00:05:35.380> same<00:05:35.650> as<00:05:35.979> the<00:05:36.759> half-ton

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
actually the exact same as the half-ton

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.330 
actually the exact same as the half-ton
version<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:38.319> only<00:05:38.349> difference<00:05:38.860> is<00:05:39.039> that<00:05:39.069> it

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
version the only difference is that it

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.140 
version the only difference is that it
has<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.849> glove<00:05:40.120> hubs<00:05:41.250> bigger<00:05:42.250> spindle<00:05:42.789> bearings

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
has a glove hubs bigger spindle bearings

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.600 
has a glove hubs bigger spindle bearings
but<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.509> spindles<00:05:43.930> are<00:05:44.050> identical<00:05:44.770> different

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
but the spindles are identical different

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.510 
but the spindles are identical different
backing<00:05:45.970> plates<00:05:46.319> larger<00:05:47.319> rotors<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:48.009> the

or<00:05:52.480> on<00:05:52.630> that<00:05:52.750> as<00:05:52.990> we<00:05:53.410> get<00:05:54.370> there

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520
