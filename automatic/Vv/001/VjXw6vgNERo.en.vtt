00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.859
 hi friends, I don't know about you, but I am very 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.810
 I like to go for mushrooms 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.969
 truth unfortunately more often 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.920
 go not to the forest but to the market now 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.500
 Chanterelle season began more precisely I would say 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.029
 he is in full swing so would just 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.860
 crime not to cook out of them 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.030
 anything tasty now 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.630
 the traditional 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.090
 and very simple fried chanterelles 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.710
 [music] 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.770
 first thing chanterelles should be a little 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.570
 peel off grass and earth from sand 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.360
 all that will then creak on 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.850
 afraid to collect teeth to buy chanterelles 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.790
 probably not needed at all is considered that 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.040
 these are some of the safest mushrooms they 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.100
 contain chinomanose and trametonolinovaya 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
 acid that can destroy 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.100
 shell parasitic substances including 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.140
 and in humans therefore 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.280
 various parasites and worms chanterelles 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.769
 don't really like unlike people for 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.239
 which these mushrooms are very useful for 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.860
 eye for liver 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.450
 we do it very tasty mushrooms 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.210
 who do not require any special 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.979
 hassle preparing the way when buying 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.660
 chanterelles on the market please note that 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.570
 perfectly clean they still don't be 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.130
 should these usually sin 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.869
 unscrupulous sellers who 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.060
 washed chanterelles so they look 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.340
 more beautiful and at the same time filled 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.440
 water therefore weigh much more 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.000
 same time when as a result of chanterelles 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.080
 turn up in the pan all the water 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.200
 leaves and chanterelles remains with gulkin nose 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.140
 now chanterelles should be quite a bit 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.010
 rinse with water does not abuse 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.000
 quite a bit 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:39.090
 put the pan on the fire and send 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.880
 there chanterelles on well warmed 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.490
 pan tomim chanterelles letting go of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.000
 they all moisture which will be enough 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.560
 many and a couple of times it will have to be drained 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.540
 we do not add this pan first 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.210
 no butter no seasoning 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.160
 Is that quite a bit of salt in order 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.330
 so that the moisture comes out even more 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:04.340
 intensely until all the moisture comes out of 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.440
 chanterelles will prepare onions it is necessary 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.330
 chop one chanterelle on the floor 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.300
 small bulb common onion 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.110
 or a couple of small steps will be quite 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.390
 enough 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.940
 as soon as all the moisture of chanterelles comes out 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.430
 you must add onions to them altogether 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.709
 recommended onion pre 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.200
 fry in a separate pan 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.520
 I deliberately took a big frying pan 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.890
 so as not to smudge 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.170
 extra bows so the bow will 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.250
 fry here just on a separate 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.050
 half and now is the time 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:44.180
 add butter make it easy 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.239
 golden hue to translucency 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.570
 as soon as the onion comes to condition 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:55.380
 mix it with chanterelles add 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:59.810
 a little olive oil a little 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.450
 a piece of cream and over medium heat 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.360
 fry all this beauty which is already 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:12.360
 incredibly delicious smells almost to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.630
 readiness and in the meantime I will grind 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.450
 dill can take any other favorite 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.440
 green parsley green onion even kendo 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.440
 quite fit 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.060
 periodically do not forget mushrooms 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.520
 stir remember that we need fried 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.920
 chanterelles are not burnt in any way and 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.470
 and in order to make the dish still 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:41.459
 fragrant I'll take a small clove 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.850
 garlic and finely finely finely his 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.510
 ruble 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.420
 [music] 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.580
 the mushrooms are almost ready 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.790
 it's time to add some greens and 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.560
 garlic 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.860
 mushrooms with herbs and garlic fry 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:07.230
 just a minute is not the final touch 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.720
 this is a good spoonful of delicious chubby 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.340
 homemade sour cream can of course be 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.520
 do without sour cream 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.140
 but with her definitely tastier as always 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.810
 the fatter the tastier 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.540
 sometimes the main thing with pleasure and 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.050
 without remorse 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:31.110
 add a little black pepper 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.350
 if necessary, add salt and 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.300
 me mushrooms 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.000
 turned out and so salty enough so 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.960
 as the judge added the very beginning 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.250
 fry literally 20-30 seconds ready 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.830
 fried chanterelles can be a dish 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.380
 basic can become a side dish for meat or 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.419
 for example mac can be a bird 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.610
 also fried potatoes in general 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.620
 choose yourself as their main thing so that 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.870
