00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 hello in this video we are going to teach you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.600
 make a duck very quickly 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.750
 let's ride our playground just 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.509
 let's avoid a con it or a little ball 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.759
 round and a little orange fondant 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.660
 you can do it the peak as it is not very 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:36.240
 easy as you want good we go to 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.070
 raise our with a little 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.500
 let's put the tail as for 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.240
 up we're going to do a little peak 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.510
 and we raise it to make it more 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.000
 funny 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.760
 slowly 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.760
 it does not have to be much either 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.130
 and we are going to hit him 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.270
 let's cut a little bit of the stick 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.270
 that we do so much 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.710
 and we are going to hit him 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.259
 the head and my body 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.210
 the edible glue 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.710
 we place 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.440
 as city 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.570
 is doing it in a pretty size 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.490
 big so you can see it well you can 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.200
 make a little bit smaller if you want 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.260
 a duckling to put it on top of a 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.040
 cupcake that as you see 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.420
 now 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.420
 and we hit the piquito 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.079
 in the part 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.430
 you see 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.030
 what are we going to do to do the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.840
 We are going to stretch a little bit of 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.840
 yellow fondant 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.690
 we stretch a little 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.830
 with this leaf ejector cutter 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.830
 let's make the wings very well 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.830
 I'm not going to texturize so that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.830
 look like a leaf 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.109
 so 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.349
 with edible glue 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.150
 let's glue the wings 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.120
 on the sides you'll see how funny 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.120
 remains 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.810
 this is one 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.220
 you can put them higher or lower 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.220
 that as you want 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.230
 and it's in the other 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.190
 how funny 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.430
 The little duck 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.790
 open a little bit either side 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.790
 duck 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.790
 and now 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.060
 with one here we are going to do the 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.060
 little eyes 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.150
 A) Yes 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.550
 and if we are going to paint them in black 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.240
 to highlight more 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.930
 so and now we're going to do it in the part 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.440
 from above to make it funnier 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.430
 like little hairs 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.430
 we'll see 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.410
 we stretch the sleeve a little 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.300
 and we must do as a kind 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.010
 of tortilla chips 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.010
 to put it on top 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.650
 you have a little 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.400
 and we're going to hit him up here in form 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.400
 as chiriqui 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.759
 you are there 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.970
 a little bit 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.880
 and we would have already mounted 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.230
 the duckling you have seen that it is fast and 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.490
 how easy 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.490
 you can do it the size you want
