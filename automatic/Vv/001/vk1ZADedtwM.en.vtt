00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:03.989
 so hello st-imier mef 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.450
 many tributes I think of access romagna and and from Thursday 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.409
 - ask quito to fascinate the ports 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:15.889
 to recommend his gps 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.890
 and its autopilot 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.769
 so of course there is no problem 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.769
 I'll do a little tutorial on you 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.679
 when I took it as a day on March 6th 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.999
 which is I think of the plane easier 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.089
 to master the game 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.430
 First of all there are two kinds of autopilot 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.550
 there is 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.180
 those like this 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.680
 as on the 6th of March 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.499
 this one 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.910
 in the country all the way down is that everything was very simple 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.820
 where there are those like for airliners and bouygues the airbus 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.080
 who are 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.670
 are faster to find 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.100
 because the others 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.510
 a board on the dashboard 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.990
 which is reserved for autopilots and let's just participate 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.990
 we're just a little hack on the quartz radio 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.150
 so good for 100 euros and cgg veritas the reports 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.140
 the airport cashier is quoted on the cac on austria 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 when I started all that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.130
 cinema 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.830
 then we close his 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.580
 and during his gps with the capital key and the 3 not the producer of the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.790
 digital the 38 db will hit this march to charge 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.390
 so we see next 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.220
 in the lottery they come here airports 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.160
 Educational enfora is there 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.590
 j &amp; j and ctv so we'll click on 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.010
 countries with the arrow in the middle 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.390
 marseille show dinners and indirect page so that's ok 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.690
 plot a route that will be 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.960
 who will qualify pink on your gps 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.050
 and that's too much of the ball 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.050
 you will only have to follow it 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.119
 you actually had it so we will have tried 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.959
 the five experts who are flashing 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.149
 then the cla the little dumpling which is speaking time down right 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.859
 had stopped hosting them 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.339
 the other 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.479
 paged 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.479
 and with your keyboard you have crisis it's missed 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.450
 so anyway sofia cinephile 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.159
 Well that's it 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.579
 when you press ok 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.489
 so go select the lies at that time tnt 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.909
 once again bless alas the request is activated 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.209
 in fact not been 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.819
 so look here 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.819
 clear rules tunnel jc tsi 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.839
 that's a good thing done then 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.539
 here is to close your GPS per month until 3 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:54.990
 it is no longer than two hours 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.589
 for the autopilot 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.639
 for the autopilot 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.819
 this is the radio 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.039
 here is the radio she tells comparable transponder 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.489
 and here is your GPS 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.219
 we will fly at an altitude 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.679
 rome 5 thousand feet it seems reasonable 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:17.199
 so here's a caps lock selector so 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.269
 pressed until you have 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.939
 the 5000 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.320
 too much 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.759
 5000 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:28.049
 so what are the buttons that are beneath then so hit that's the 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.439
 main switch of the autopilot so that's right 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.449
 it is to activate it 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.199
 in europe this site of cap conservators so you have to 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.179
 enter the map 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:42.199
 a cape on his compass yes 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:44.959
 the autopilot they follow but that's not what interests us for 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.049
 a thief like these 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.319
 what interests us is the 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.149
 this is the 6 and 9 of its navigation lock switches so that's it 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.279
 go 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:58.619
 how the autopilots will settle on the gps and var% e 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.029
 we will follow the road 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:02.739
 which was drawn 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.119
 then travel switches from the nearby airlock and help for 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:09.829
 the landing I look at the blacks last night I do not know anything at all I got 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:10.919
 never served 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.849
 and percent and altitude lock switches that's what 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.149
 will allow you 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:18.149
 2 of all kinds and to the region 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.550
 to have a constant attitude the one we settled his teammates of 5000 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.330
 feet 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.070
 below us help is the vertical climb speed 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.770
 it is repeating minutes so if you select minute for example at 1 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.770
 5307 thousand feet 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.470
 whether to settle them 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.590
 yet school if we win that counts 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.370
 that I played wedged thousand foot he was well feasted domestically 700 feet 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.330
 minutes 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
 so good we did not hurt too much and come to an end 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.279
 Well, here we go 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:55.209
 because where are the women in this business 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.120
 then to go back 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.120
 this majestic 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.300
 so that's 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.599
 in the same route as 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.870
 the need is a machine that benefits new immigrants 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.089
 surf on the slopes that's it's the main thing 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:17.709
 we will also try to follow the young people who leave and come back to 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:20.709
 power on vacation before reacting to the world 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.909
 cdc holds via the plane that takes him through my fault 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.180
 so the first money part of the girls video then we end up 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.459
 on the track for the next part
