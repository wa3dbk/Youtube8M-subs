00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.190 
colors I think this is your best bet and
there's<00:01:56.880> also<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.240> cheaper<00:01:57.630> option<00:01:57.659> there's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
there's also a cheaper option there's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.030 
there's also a cheaper option there's
the<00:01:58.380> 35<00:01:58.860> millimeter<00:01:59.130> F<00:01:59.610> 2.0<00:02:00.680> but<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> really

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the 35 millimeter F 2.0 but I really

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.410 
the 35 millimeter F 2.0 but I really
don't<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.759> gives<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> same

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
don't think that it gives you the same

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.899 
don't think that it gives you the same
color<00:02:04.229> rendition<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.189> lens<00:02:05.430> gives<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
color rendition that this lens gives you

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.309 
color rendition that this lens gives you
and<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.689> actually<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.649> also<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.459> use<00:02:08.640> this

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
and I actually I also like to use this

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.259

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
for detail shots at weddings because you

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.880

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
you're just wanting to use it for table

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.879 
you're just wanting to use it for table
settings<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.540> details<00:02:17.959> it's<00:02:18.349> a<00:02:18.499> really<00:02:18.769> great

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:18.889 
settings and details it's a really great

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.459 
settings and details it's a really great
lens<00:02:19.189> for<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.519> too<00:02:19.909> so<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.870> really<00:02:21.170> can't<00:02:21.409> go

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
lens for that too so you really can't go

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.619 
lens for that too so you really can't go
wrong<00:02:21.709> with<00:02:21.889> this<00:02:22.040> lens<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.150> actually

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
wrong with this lens this is actually

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.780 
wrong with this lens this is actually
the<00:02:23.749> first<00:02:23.959> L<00:02:24.260> Series<00:02:24.530> lens<00:02:24.889> that<00:02:25.129> I<00:02:25.159> bought<00:02:25.459> I

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
the first L Series lens that I bought I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.539 
the first L Series lens that I bought I
said<00:02:26.269> in<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.719> different<00:02:27.079> video<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.650> 51.2

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
said in a different video that the 51.2

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.759 
said in a different video that the 51.2
L<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.909> my<00:02:29.090> favorite<00:02:29.450> lens<00:02:29.689> but<00:02:30.379> this<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.739> a

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
L is my favorite lens but this is a

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.190 
L is my favorite lens but this is a
really<00:02:31.129> close<00:02:31.430> second<00:02:31.939> because<00:02:32.389> it's<00:02:32.780> just

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
really close second because it's just

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.559 
really close second because it's just
really<00:02:34.040> bright<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.370> vibrant<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.000> crisp<00:02:35.299> but

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
really bright and vibrant and crisp but

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.479 
really bright and vibrant and crisp but
the<00:02:35.900> 51.2<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.769> think<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.129> a<00:02:37.159> little<00:02:37.280> bit

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the 51.2 I think is a little bit

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.159 
the 51.2 I think is a little bit
creamier<00:02:38.000> which<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.389> why<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.540> like<00:02:38.749> that<00:02:38.959> lens

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:39.169 
creamier which is why I like that lens

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.979 
creamier which is why I like that lens
more<00:02:39.530> but<00:02:39.919> this<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.700> like<00:02:40.909> the<00:02:41.120> fun<00:02:41.359> lens<00:02:41.629> you

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
more but this is like the fun lens you

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.479 
more but this is like the fun lens you
can<00:02:42.139> do<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.260> lot<00:02:42.469> of<00:02:42.500> really<00:02:42.680> fun<00:02:42.799> things<00:02:43.280> with

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
can do a lot of really fun things with

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.059 
can do a lot of really fun things with
this<00:02:43.639> and<00:02:43.939> I<00:02:44.629> just<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.019> love<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:45.349> I<00:02:45.650> can't<00:02:45.950> go

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.129 
wrong with it so let's talk the
logistics<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:50.000> lens<00:02:50.239> kind<00:02:50.689> of<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.840> size

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
logistics of the lens kind of a size

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.890 
logistics of the lens kind of a size
weight<00:02:51.639> kind<00:02:52.639> of<00:02:52.699> what<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:52.909> looks<00:02:53.090> like<00:02:53.299> so

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
compare it to something like a bottle a

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.640 
compare it to something like a bottle a
full<00:03:01.969> size<00:03:02.209> bottle<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.629> nail<00:03:02.750> polish<00:03:02.989> or<00:03:03.620> a
