00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.219

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.699
 even our most advanced weapons 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.699
 have proved useless 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.990
 make it send 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.329

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.320

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.910
 universal fighting machine in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.820

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.050
 but I know that because of mankind 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.370

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.690
