going on to the blocker board it's going

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.019 
going on to the blocker board it's going
to<00:00:30.439> be<00:00:30.529> a<00:00:30.560> relatively<00:00:31.070> flat<00:00:31.339> blocker<00:00:31.640> blocker

to be a relatively flat blocker blocker

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.000 
to be a relatively flat blocker blocker
board<00:00:32.419> but<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:32.990> do<00:00:33.140> have<00:00:33.290> a<00:00:33.350> little<00:00:33.530> bit<00:00:33.680> of<00:00:33.800> a

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
board but you do have a little bit of a

board but you do have a little bit of a
curve<00:00:34.280> up<00:00:34.490> near<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.730> tops<00:00:35.030> to<00:00:35.270> help<00:00:35.750> prevent

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
curve up near the tops to help prevent

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.560 
curve up near the tops to help prevent
from<00:00:36.560> the<00:00:36.710> puck<00:00:37.070> skipping<00:00:37.520> over<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:38.300> blocker

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
better rebound control and then going

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.440 
better rebound control and then going
into<00:00:41.990> the<00:00:42.140> blocker<00:00:42.410> board<00:00:42.800> as<00:00:43.180> you<00:00:44.180> can<00:00:44.240> see

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.810 
into the blocker board as you can see
it's<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.660> nice<00:00:44.840> thick<00:00:45.170> blocker<00:00:45.470> board<00:00:45.860> with<00:00:46.670> the

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
dual density phones in there so you have

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.930 
dual density phones in there so you have
the<00:00:48.860> low<00:00:49.040> density<00:00:49.460> as<00:00:49.550> well<00:00:49.730> as<00:00:49.850> the

the low density as well as the
high-density<00:00:50.300> phones<00:00:50.810> in<00:00:51.020> there<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:51.740> those

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
high-density phones in there so those

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.230 
high-density phones in there so those
bolts<00:00:52.370> are<00:00:52.460> going<00:00:52.610> to<00:00:52.670> give<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:52.940> some<00:00:53.090> really

the<00:01:52.729> game<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.119> also<00:01:53.569> just<00:01:53.840> give<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.139> some

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
the game and also just give you some

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.050 
the game and also just give you some
really<00:01:54.469> improved<00:01:54.920> grip<00:01:55.159> with<00:01:55.369> that<00:01:55.549> kind<00:01:55.789> of<00:01:55.880> a

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
really improved grip with that kind of a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.789 
really improved grip with that kind of a
snake<00:01:56.479> skin<00:01:56.780> sort<00:01:57.049> of<00:01:57.139> material<00:01:57.560> right<00:01:57.770> there

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
snake skin sort of material right there

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.179 
snake skin sort of material right there
and<00:01:58.219> then<00:01:58.999> I<00:01:59.060> going<00:01:59.539> on<00:01:59.749> to<00:02:00.499> the<00:02:00.679> actual

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
and then I going on to the actual

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.099 
and then I going on to the actual
position<00:02:01.729> of<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.060> hand<00:02:02.329> on<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.539> blocker<00:02:02.869> you

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
position of the hand on the blocker you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:04.690 
position of the hand on the blocker you
can<00:02:03.259> see<00:02:03.469> it's<00:02:03.979> going<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.189> be<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.340> little<00:02:04.520> bit

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
can see it's going to be a little bit

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.520 
can see it's going to be a little bit
low<00:02:04.969> a<00:02:05.209> little<00:02:05.539> bit<00:02:05.630> higher<00:02:05.810> on<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.200> blocker

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
low a little bit higher on the blocker

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.620 
low a little bit higher on the blocker
than<00:02:06.889> most<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:07.999> that's<00:02:08.149> going<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.390> give<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.569> a

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
than most so that's going to give you a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.420 
than most so that's going to give you a
little<00:02:08.780> bit<00:02:08.990> of<00:02:09.080> extra<00:02:09.440> distance<00:02:09.830> down<00:02:10.220> at<00:02:10.369> the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
little bit of extra distance down at the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.950 
little bit of extra distance down at the
bottom<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.940> blocker<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.420> give<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.900> a

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
bottom of the blocker to give you a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.380 
bottom of the blocker to give you a
little<00:02:12.110> bit<00:02:12.430> easier<00:02:13.430> blocking<00:02:13.910> on<00:02:14.060> some<00:02:14.270> of

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
little bit easier blocking on some of

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.550 
little bit easier blocking on some of
those<00:02:14.480> lower<00:02:14.750> shots

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
those lower shots

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.860 
those lower shots
and<00:02:15.650> then<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:16.250> going<00:02:16.580> into<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:16.970> cuff<00:02:17.599> right

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
and then I going into the cuff right

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.839 
and then I going into the cuff right
here<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.260> can<00:02:18.410> see<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.770> pretty<00:02:19.220> open<00:02:19.459> cuff

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
here you can see it's a pretty open cuff

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.850 
here you can see it's a pretty open cuff
but<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.209> can<00:02:20.480> kind<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.140> close<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.560> up<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.770> little

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
but you can kind of close it up a little

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.350 
but you can kind of close it up a little
bit<00:02:22.010> have<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> little<00:02:22.400> bit<00:02:22.760> tighter<00:02:23.030> if<00:02:23.209> you'd

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
bit have a little bit tighter if you'd

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.600 
bit have a little bit tighter if you'd
like<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.200> then<00:02:24.830> also<00:02:25.160> they<00:02:25.459> have

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
like to do that and then also they have

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.070 
like to do that and then also they have
that<00:02:25.790> adjustment<00:02:26.300> right<00:02:26.480> there<00:02:26.660> at<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.810> wrist

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
that adjustment right there at the wrist

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.110 
that adjustment right there at the wrist
so<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.860> really<00:02:28.160> cinch<00:02:28.430> down<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.730> fit<00:02:28.910> right

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
so you really cinch down the fit right

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.460 
so you really cinch down the fit right
at<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.390> wrist<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.810> then<00:02:29.989> going<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.319> the

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
at the wrist and then going on to the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.229 
at the wrist and then going on to the
inside<00:02:30.860> of<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.040> blocker<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.090> see

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
inside of the blocker you can see

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.759 
inside of the blocker you can see
they're<00:02:32.390> using<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.780> same<00:02:33.019> kind<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.380> material

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
they're using that same kind of material

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.009 
they're using that same kind of material
they're<00:02:33.860> using<00:02:34.130> in<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.370> palm<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.599> inside

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
they're using in the palm in the inside

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.680 
they're using in the palm in the inside
of<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.319> blocker<00:02:36.800> so<00:02:37.190> some<00:02:37.849> really<00:02:38.090> great<00:02:38.300> dry

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
of the blocker so some really great dry

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.360 
of the blocker so some really great dry
feel<00:02:39.110> on<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.410> inside<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> blocker<00:02:40.160> as

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
feel on the inside of the blocker as

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.280 
feel on the inside of the blocker as
well<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:40.849> can<00:02:40.880> see<00:02:41.209> they<00:02:41.330> have<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.690> kind

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
well and you can see they have that kind

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.839 
well and you can see they have that kind
of<00:02:42.349> pillow<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.920> designing<00:02:43.310> in<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:43.730> that's

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
of pillow like designing in so that's

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.009 
of pillow like designing in so that's
going<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.030> help<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.330> dampen<00:02:44.660> some<00:02:44.870> of<00:02:44.959> the
