hey<00:00:01.350> guys<00:00:01.530> search<00:00:01.860> Nathan<00:00:02.250> ear<00:00:02.399> we're<00:00:03.240> all<00:00:03.300> had

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hey guys search Nathan ear we're all had

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.230 
hey guys search Nathan ear we're all had
a<00:00:03.480> previous<00:00:03.780> video<00:00:04.879> didn't<00:00:05.879> doing<00:00:06.120> some

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
a previous video didn't doing some

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.470 
a previous video didn't doing some
driving<00:00:06.629> tips<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.610> one<00:00:08.610> thing<00:00:08.820> he<00:00:08.940> covered

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
driving tips and one thing he covered

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.039 
driving tips and one thing he covered
was<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.769> he<00:00:11.130> did<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.580> flash<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.360> was

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
was and he did it in a flash and was

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.490 
was and he did it in a flash and was
hard<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.469> perceive<00:00:14.210> but<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.509> seemed<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.199> if

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
hard to perceive but it seemed like if

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.480 
hard to perceive but it seemed like if
you<00:00:17.100> press<00:00:17.550> W<00:00:18.289> strategically<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.980> could<00:00:20.220> make

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
you press W strategically you could make

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.840 
you press W strategically you could make
the<00:00:20.520> flash<00:00:21.300> accelerate<00:00:22.020> faster<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the flash accelerate faster and so I

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
the flash accelerate faster and so I
want<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.269> check<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.350> more<00:00:25.470> detail<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
want to check in this in more detail and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.640 
want to check in this in more detail and
try<00:00:26.340> some<00:00:26.550> other<00:00:26.609> vehicles<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
try some other vehicles and so what I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.880 
try some other vehicles and so what I
found<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.720> all<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.170> ground<00:00:31.380> vehicles

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
found is that all the ground vehicles

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.090 
found is that all the ground vehicles
except<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> Sun<00:00:32.700> during<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.000> game<00:00:33.210> have

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
except the Sun during the game have

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.729 
except the Sun during the game have
three<00:00:35.100> speed<00:00:35.370> transmissions<00:00:36.739> automatic

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
three speed transmissions automatic

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.670 
three speed transmissions automatic
transmissions<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> sender<00:00:39.149> beating

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
transmissions with the sender beating

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.510 
transmissions with the sender beating
for<00:00:40.680> speed

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
for speed

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.380 
for speed
and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:44.140> can<00:00:44.320> actually<00:00:44.770> cause<00:00:45.070> it<00:00:45.700> to<00:00:45.940> shift

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
and you can actually cause it to shift

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.620 
and you can actually cause it to shift
to<00:00:47.380> the<00:00:47.410> next<00:00:47.860> year<00:00:49.320> faster<00:00:50.320> by<00:00:50.530> strategically

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
to the next year faster by strategically

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.070 
to the next year faster by strategically
tapping<00:00:52.630> the<00:00:52.750> W<00:00:53.080> key<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.370> that<00:00:54.690> you'll<00:00:55.690> see<00:00:55.960> the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
tapping the W key so that you'll see the

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.070 
tapping the W key so that you'll see the
seat<00:00:56.380> speed<00:00:56.710> stabilized<00:00:57.400> and<00:00:57.730> then<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.870> will

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
seat speed stabilized and then you will

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.869 
seat speed stabilized and then you will
release<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.800> W<00:01:00.070> key<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:00.340> immediately<00:01:00.610> press

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
release the W key and immediately press

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.450 
release the W key and immediately press
it<00:01:01.030> again<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:01.510> you'll<00:01:02.230> you'll<00:01:02.770> accelerate

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
it again and you'll you'll accelerate

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.010 
it again and you'll you'll accelerate
through<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.730> next<00:01:03.940> gear<00:01:04.270> and<00:01:04.479> so<00:01:04.690> on<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:04.960> so

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
through the next gear and so on and so

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.380 
through the next gear and so on and so
forth<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.680> so<00:01:06.640> i'm<00:01:06.850> going<00:01:06.940> to<00:01:07.060> show<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.180> with

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
forth and so i'm going to show you with

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.630 
forth and so i'm going to show you with
this<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:08.680> speed<00:01:10.200> Thunder<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:12.220> it<00:01:12.340> normally

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
this for speed Thunder what it normally

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.580 
this for speed Thunder what it normally
looks<00:01:12.940> like<00:01:13.300> we<00:01:13.450> just<00:01:13.600> hold<00:01:13.780> down<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.110> W<00:01:14.410> key

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
looks like we just hold down the W key

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.130 
looks like we just hold down the W key
now<00:01:15.520> this<00:01:15.850> is<00:01:17.040> without<00:01:18.040> any<00:01:19.140> performance

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
now this is without any performance

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.080 
now this is without any performance
upgrades<00:01:20.890> right<00:01:21.190> now<00:01:21.399> for<00:01:21.940> this

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
upgrades right now for this

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.510 
upgrades right now for this
demonstration<00:01:22.270> so<00:01:23.050> if<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:23.920> did<00:01:24.070> have<00:01:24.310> this

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
demonstration so if you did have this

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.510 
demonstration so if you did have this
speed<00:01:24.850> frame<00:01:25.210> it<00:01:25.509> would<00:01:25.780> be<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.410> higher<00:01:27.100> speed

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
speed frame it would be a higher speed

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.749 
speed frame it would be a higher speed
before<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.070> should<00:01:30.100> before<00:01:30.670> you

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
before you but you should before you

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.590 
before you but you should before you
shift<00:01:31.030> although<00:01:31.720> even<00:01:31.960> though<00:01:32.200> oddly<00:01:32.320> speed

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
shift although even though oddly speed

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.920 
shift although even though oddly speed
but<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.750> speed<00:01:34.780> performance<00:01:36.180> slot<00:01:37.180> suppose

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
but the speed performance slot suppose

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.230 
but the speed performance slot suppose
he<00:01:38.170> increases<00:01:38.740> acceleration<00:01:39.399> it<00:01:39.820> didn't<00:01:40.119> seem

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
he increases acceleration it didn't seem

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.290 
he increases acceleration it didn't seem
to<00:01:40.300> impact<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.350> whole<00:01:41.619> time<00:01:41.950> /<00:01:42.670> gear<00:01:43.030> that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
to impact the the whole time / gear that

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.400 
to impact the the whole time / gear that
much<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:45.040> at<00:01:45.250> all<00:01:45.310> I<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:46.060> wasn't<00:01:46.600> able<00:01:46.660> perceive

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
much if at all I I wasn't able perceive

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.740 
much if at all I I wasn't able perceive
a<00:01:47.500> difference<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.009> anyway<00:01:48.880> here's<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.420> sock

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
a difference so anyway here's a sock

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.370 
a difference so anyway here's a sock
Rosser<00:01:50.229> just<00:01:50.410> pulling<00:01:50.830> down<00:01:51.009> w<00:01:51.929> so<00:01:52.929> it<00:01:53.050> holds

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
Rosser just pulling down w so it holds

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.270 
Rosser just pulling down w so it holds
around<00:01:53.590> 22<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.729> then<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.209> boosts<00:01:55.569> up<00:01:55.660> to<00:01:55.899> vote

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
around 22 and then it boosts up to vote

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.580 
around 22 and then it boosts up to vote
37<00:01:57.280> 38<00:01:57.459> and<00:01:57.759> then<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.880> Bruce<00:01:58.149> for<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.479> again<00:01:58.590> 250

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
37 38 and then a Bruce for it again 250

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.550 
37 38 and then a Bruce for it again 250
250<00:02:00.369> beating<00:02:00.729> them<00:02:00.819> beers<00:02:01.240> for<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:01.509> again<00:02:01.690> so

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
250 beating them beers for it again so

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.870 
250 beating them beers for it again so
you<00:02:02.619> can<00:02:02.740> see<00:02:02.920> there's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.619 

before<00:02:06.880> zones<00:02:07.379> for<00:02:08.379> years<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:10.000> now<00:02:10.269> what<00:02:10.509> I'm

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
before zones for years so now what I'm

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.750 
before zones for years so now what I'm
going<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.899> do<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.379> things<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:15.640> all

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
going to do and one of the things we all

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.330 
going to do and one of the things we all
covered<00:02:16.209> in<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.480> video<00:02:16.690> was<00:02:17.170> always<00:02:17.980> driving

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
covered in this video was always driving

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.080 
covered in this video was always driving
outside<00:02:19.030> which<00:02:19.629> I<00:02:19.959> very<00:02:20.590> much<00:02:20.800> agree<00:02:21.010> with<00:02:21.340> and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
outside which I very much agree with and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.610 
outside which I very much agree with and
I'll<00:02:22.510> show<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.780> what<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.019> harasser

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
I'll show you what the harasser

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.530 
I'll show you what the harasser
especially<00:02:24.519> since<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.849> Rastas<00:02:25.209> got<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.390> nice

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
especially since the Rastas got a nice

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.800 
especially since the Rastas got a nice
loud<00:02:25.780> engine<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:26.830> hear<00:02:27.370> clearly<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:28.239> RPM

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
loud engine you can hear clearly the RPM

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.220 
loud engine you can hear clearly the RPM
when<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.170> need<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.440> shift<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:31.150> now<00:02:31.230> oops

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
when you need to shift but for now oops

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.970 
when you need to shift but for now oops
i'm<00:02:32.799> going<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.430> show<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.790> inside<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.390> vehicle

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
i'm going to show you inside the vehicle

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.289 
i'm going to show you inside the vehicle
okay<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.580> I'm<00:02:37.030> going<00:02:37.239> to

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
okay so this is I'm going to

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.850 
okay so this is I'm going to
strategically<00:02:37.840> tap<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.290> when<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.500> see<00:02:38.739> it

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
strategically tap so when I see it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.339 
strategically tap so when I see it
starting<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.700> stabilize<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.900> speed<00:02:41.140> I'm

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
starting to stabilize and speed I'm

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.569 
starting to stabilize and speed I'm
going<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.590> release<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:42.010> W<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.400> press<00:02:42.549> it

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
going to release the W and press it

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.030 
going to release the W and press it
again<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.540> here<00:02:43.690> we<00:02:43.780> go<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:44.380> can<00:02:44.650> see<00:02:44.799> how<00:02:44.890> much

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
again so here we go you can see how much

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:54.610 
again so here we go you can see how much
quicker<00:02:45.250> well<00:02:45.670> accelerate<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:48.060> boom

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.410 

effect<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.459> first<00:02:55.730> one<00:02:55.909> I<00:02:56.060> could<00:02:56.239> have<00:02:56.330> even

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
effect that first one I could have even

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:06.190 
effect that first one I could have even
done<00:02:56.629> her<00:02:56.690> earlier<00:02:57.080> once<00:02:57.500> again

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.410 

so<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.410> see<00:03:07.560> it's<00:03:07.980> especially<00:03:08.940> with<00:03:09.300> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
so you can see it's especially with the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.220 
so you can see it's especially with the
roster<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.230> with<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.190> April<00:03:12.230> improvement

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
roster and with the April improvement

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.340 
roster and with the April improvement
update<00:03:13.560> pass<00:03:13.980> that's<00:03:14.400> getting<00:03:15.020> you<00:03:16.020> can<00:03:16.170> get

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
update pass that's getting you can get

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.100 
update pass that's getting you can get
at<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.500> stickier<00:03:17.040> situations<00:03:17.930> quite<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.960> bit

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
at a stickier situations quite a bit

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.010 
at a stickier situations quite a bit
better<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:20.120> I've<00:03:21.120> confirmed<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.780> also

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
better and I've confirmed this also

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.160 
better and I've confirmed this also
works<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.560> tanks<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:24.170> everything

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
works on the tanks but everything

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.270 
works on the tanks but everything
outside<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:27.440> Thunder<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.560> three-speed

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
outside of the Thunder is a three-speed

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.949 
outside of the Thunder is a three-speed
which<00:03:29.490> you<00:03:29.640> will<00:03:29.730> see<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.420> processor<00:03:30.900> in

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
which you will see that the processor in

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.370 
which you will see that the processor in
a<00:03:31.050> second<00:03:31.410> here<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:32.100> flash<00:03:32.400> though<00:03:33.380> like

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
a second here the flash though like

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.230 
a second here the flash though like
we're<00:03:34.530> all<00:03:34.590> showed<00:03:34.800> in<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.010> video<00:03:35.130> it's<00:03:35.670> in

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
we're all showed in the video it's in

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.030 
we're all showed in the video it's in
fact<00:03:36.450> i'll<00:03:36.570> show<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.810> right<00:03:37.050> now<00:03:37.260> it's<00:03:37.860> very

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
fact i'll show you right now it's very

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.800 
fact i'll show you right now it's very
hard<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.310> see<00:03:39.410> very<00:03:40.410> clear<00:03:41.180> shift<00:03:42.180> states<00:03:42.510> like

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
hard to see very clear shift states like

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.400 
hard to see very clear shift states like
you're<00:03:43.050> just<00:03:43.200> holding<00:03:43.350> out<00:03:43.650> w<00:03:44.810> now<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.959> doesn't

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
you're just holding out w now it doesn't

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.340 
you're just holding out w now it doesn't
have<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:47.060> tachometer<00:03:48.060> at<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.989> bottom

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
have a little tachometer at the bottom

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.930 
have a little tachometer at the bottom
left<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.130> i<00:03:50.430> suppose<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.270> could<00:03:51.390> go<00:03:51.600> by<00:03:51.780> that

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
left so i suppose you could go by that

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.150 
left so i suppose you could go by that
so<00:03:53.940> here's<00:03:54.270> me<00:03:54.690> trying<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.320> strategically<00:03:55.890> tap

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
so here's me trying to strategically tap

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.420 
so here's me trying to strategically tap
it<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.550> boom<00:03:56.970> boom<00:03:58.250> boom<00:03:59.250> right<00:04:00.090> there

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.569 

so<00:04:03.060> with<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> harasser<00:04:03.959> you'll<00:04:04.140> see<00:04:04.379> it<00:04:04.859> still

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
so with the harasser you'll see it still

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:19.490 
so with the harasser you'll see it still
has<00:04:05.790> three<00:04:06.689> very<00:04:07.290> distinct<00:04:07.890> states<00:04:18.500> again

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
has three very distinct states again

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.610 
has three very distinct states again
these<00:04:19.709> are<00:04:19.949> all<00:04:20.130> just<00:04:20.160> stock<00:04:21.000> fits<00:04:21.620> this

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
these are all just stock fits this

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.990 
these are all just stock fits this
demonstration<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.520> guess<00:04:23.699> you're<00:04:23.970> just

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
demonstration I guess you're just

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.770 
demonstration I guess you're just
holding<00:04:24.300> down<00:04:24.600> w<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:26.130> it's<00:04:26.520> holding<00:04:26.910> around<00:04:27.120> 39

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
holding down w so it's holding around 39

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.670 
holding down w so it's holding around 39
that<00:04:28.350> we<00:04:28.470> spent<00:04:29.389> 72

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
that we spent 72

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
that we spent 72
the<00:04:32.680> final<00:04:33.100> gear<00:04:33.690> at<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:35.230> now<00:04:36.120> we're<00:04:37.120> going<00:04:37.330> to

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
the final gear at so now we're going to

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.270 
the final gear at so now we're going to
strategically<00:04:39.700> shift<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:41.380> now<00:04:41.770> I<00:04:41.800> know<00:04:41.950> I'm

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
strategically shift so now I know I'm

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.540 
strategically shift so now I know I'm
going<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.580> need<00:04:42.730> to<00:04:42.940> shift<00:04:43.840> around<00:04:44.550> just

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
going to need to shift around just

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.420 
going to need to shift around just
before<00:04:45.670> hits<00:04:46.000> 39<00:04:46.450> so

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.390 

there<00:04:52.520> we<00:04:52.610> go<00:04:52.730> we're<00:04:52.880> all<00:04:53.030> yet<00:04:53.270> tough<00:04:53.540> sweet

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
there we go we're all yet tough sweet

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.320 
there we go we're all yet tough sweet
so<00:04:56.400> now<00:04:56.940> for<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.360> external<00:04:57.990> view<00:04:59.330> now

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
so now for the external view now

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.520 
so now for the external view now
actually<00:05:00.810> i'm<00:05:00.960> going<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.140> show<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.230> once

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
actually i'm going to show you once

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.160 
actually i'm going to show you once
again<00:05:01.830> with<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.300> just<00:05:03.300> whole<00:05:03.450> name<00:05:03.600> night<00:05:03.780> w

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
again with the just whole name night w

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.050 
again with the just whole name night w
you'll<00:05:04.560> notice<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:05.160> second<00:05:05.580> shift<00:05:05.790> point

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
you'll notice the second shift point

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.480 
you'll notice the second shift point
isn't<00:05:06.360> doesn't<00:05:07.020> hold<00:05:07.230> nearly<00:05:07.680> as<00:05:07.920> long<00:05:08.190> it's

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
isn't doesn't hold nearly as long it's

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.360 
isn't doesn't hold nearly as long it's
not<00:05:08.700> nearly<00:05:09.000> as<00:05:09.150> drastic<00:05:09.810> so

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
not nearly as drastic so

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.520 
not nearly as drastic so
if<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:12.910> don't<00:05:13.180> want<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.510> try<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:13.720> master<00:05:14.139> this

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
if you don't want to try to master this

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.080 
if you don't want to try to master this
you<00:05:14.770> just<00:05:14.889> want<00:05:15.130> to<00:05:15.190> get<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.490> most<00:05:15.669> amount<00:05:15.850> of

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
you just want to get the most amount of

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.090 
you just want to get the most amount of
benefit<00:05:16.960> with<00:05:17.229> the<00:05:17.380> least<00:05:17.590> amount<00:05:17.770> of<00:05:18.040> time

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
benefit with the least amount of time

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.939 
benefit with the least amount of time
investment<00:05:18.669> that<00:05:19.210> first<00:05:19.600> shift<00:05:19.840> point<00:05:20.169> is<00:05:20.500> the

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
investment that first shift point is the

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.679 
investment that first shift point is the
most<00:05:21.669> important

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689 
most important

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:26.169 
most important
so<00:05:24.379> now<00:05:24.889> i'm<00:05:24.979> going<00:05:25.009> to<00:05:25.129> do<00:05:25.219> external<00:05:25.669> view<00:05:25.969> and

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:26.179 
so now i'm going to do external view and

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:29.450 
so now i'm going to do external view and
i<00:05:26.509> can<00:05:26.719> just<00:05:26.809> go<00:05:26.989> by<00:05:27.169> the

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.790 

more<00:05:29.580> of<00:05:29.669> the<00:05:29.759> engine<00:05:30.440> like<00:05:31.440> I'm<00:05:31.590> going<00:05:31.740> to

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
more of the engine like I'm going to

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.890 
more of the engine like I'm going to
just<00:05:31.889> shut<00:05:32.069> up<00:05:32.160> for<00:05:32.190> a<00:05:32.340> second<00:05:32.699> and<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.690> can

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
just shut up for a second and you can

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.719 
just shut up for a second and you can
first<00:05:34.110> here<00:05:34.319> inside<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:35.069> can<00:05:35.190> actually<00:05:35.340> hear

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
first here inside you can actually hear

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:42.270 
first here inside you can actually hear
hang<00:05:36.120> or<00:05:36.780> just<00:05:37.440> before<00:05:37.979> 40<00:05:38.220> kilometers

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
okay so now i'm going to shift it this

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:09.420 
okay so now i'm going to shift it this
time<00:06:03.170> before<00:06:03.860> it<00:06:04.010> it<00:06:04.280> holds<00:06:04.340> there

Gus you can see much more

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.410 
Gus you can see much more
consistent<00:06:13.180> acceleration<00:06:14.020> there<00:06:14.170> I<00:06:14.410> shifted

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
consistent acceleration there I shifted

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.490 
consistent acceleration there I shifted
