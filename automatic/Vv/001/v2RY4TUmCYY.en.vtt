00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
previously this year I've had one fish

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.770 
previously this year I've had one fish
and<00:01:12.500> apart<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.830> time<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:15.000> was<00:01:15.210> totally

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
and apart from one time that was totally

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.080 
and apart from one time that was totally
dead<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:17.070> had<00:01:17.220> runs<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> other

dead I have had runs on the other
occasions<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.049> other<00:01:19.080> two

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
occasions as well the other two

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010 
occasions as well the other two
occasions<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> I'm<00:01:21.270> hoping<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.840> fish

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
frenzy and hopefully I'll have an eel to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
frenzy and hopefully I'll have an eel to
show<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:28.229> my<00:01:28.350> Labour's<00:01:33.979> quarter<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.100> midnight

really out unpredictable angling can be
i<00:04:36.250> think<00:04:36.940> of<00:04:37.180> time<00:04:37.479> for<00:04:37.750> of<00:04:37.840> god

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
i think of time for of god

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.670 
i think of time for of god
and<00:04:39.330> when<00:04:40.330> i<00:04:40.390> actually<00:04:40.690> reached<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.229> water's

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
and when i actually reached the water's

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.080 
and when i actually reached the water's
edge<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.040> i've<00:04:42.160> seen<00:04:42.370> our<00:04:42.580> bad<00:04:42.880> but

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
edge and i've seen our bad but

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.060 
edge and i've seen our bad but
conditions<00:04:43.510> would<00:04:43.600> be<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:44.590> wasn't<00:04:44.890> for<00:04:44.979> the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
conditions would be it wasn't for the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.390 
conditions would be it wasn't for the
fact<00:04:45.190> I<00:04:45.370> was<00:04:45.400> there<00:04:45.729> I<00:04:46.060> probably<00:04:46.840> wouldn't

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
fact I was there I probably wouldn't

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.650
