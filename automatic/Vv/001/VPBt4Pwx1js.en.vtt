00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.370
 I lick to start lizard before him before making the jam with the 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.660
 Slices of oranges in syrup that really is very interesting is that 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.870
 I treasure here in aguaragüe reason for which in this way both give 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.940
 losing a bit the bitterness that the orange currently has to leave it 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.039
 at least overnight or if we can 24 hours in cold water to be 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.770
 go softening a little bit to her that way we're going to make them stay 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:25.829
 most usual 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.650
 i afterwards and everyone wants them to be softer what we expect 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.500
 do that in any case when we talk to cooking in water we will 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.899
 change that water several times but I'll tell you what to play with this process 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.019
 to leave the conagua 24 hours 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.470
 they will go with a very good taste and really almost no bitter 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.630
 we started cutting kate as lion gieco moved to appointments of these 3 and 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.749
 we put why 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.020
 our hands were at risk 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.010
 And that's just how we're going to achieve this sweet p 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.519
 of sliced ​​orange in syrup that truly lives enchanted that it was 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.140
 very very rich is 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.520
 the orange flavor set although it stays very firm very fresh 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.720
 And they are not as bitter as the midfield 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.610
 orange that usually tend to prepare percent we will have shorten 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.620
 only sas 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.710
 Now we are looking for the Tetuan slices to have seeds and that is that the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.120
 we remove, we have to remove the seed, we remove the little seed that they have and this 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 way we're not going to meet the ac milan 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.150
 on the set for whoever is not unpleasant to eat it because really 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.240
 who loves both bitter lizard 5 if we take a bite in a close 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.770
 It is truly unpleasant two of the removed with a little knife so 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.970
 simple priest 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.470
 too laborious to cite the dreaded ones can also do this with 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.289
 oranges of navels and creamy orange navel 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.020
 instead of herat 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.890
 or classic orange we could say that and now what we're going to do is take it 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.859
 directly 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.490
 ap cooking and then no other 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.390
 of medium size 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.700
 where they fit well 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.909
 the loose slices not too tight 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:16.839
 In this way, we are going to place it, it is fundamental that the boiling 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.520
 always do it with fire 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.820
 very very low 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.800
 the whole cooking process nobody because otherwise the oranges were going to disarm 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.520
 absolutely i will only be left with the shells c i think that 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.109
 in this case they go up with the cooking shell 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.089
 and what we're going to do now is add the lithium that lithium is 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.969
 simply water 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:39.709
 and the oranges are going to go 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.330
 perfuming this liquid and they will also release their cube and it will form 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.189
 an amparo in syrup we went with a lot of orange flavor that really goes to 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.980
 to be very very nice 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.419
 then we put 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:57.200
 the water we add some cloves of smell aita 4 clarito dolor 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.789
 a little cinnamon 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:03.239
 and we used to set it on fire so that this starts to cook slowly 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.699
 decide that it is lots of cold water of cold water exactly fundamental point 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.990
 this is that we have in mind as I told you the boiling very very low 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.510
 always at minimum you have to do it and if we want you to have it under your hoop and 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.510
 still once the robot breaks we change the water ten streets we remove 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.269
 that water and we return to add fresh water 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.950
 and it is a procedure how to repeat 4 5 times and we want 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.840
 to go down to the bitterness to win now you have to leave the flavor the access 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.640
 same with each change of water that also goes to all we advocate losing 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.260
 Orange flavor and how we prepare it in thin slices are finite slices 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.500
 really bitterness is pursued is very light so I recommend that you 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.020
 try it this way 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.429
 who was in any case 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:53.730
 percent evaluates in bled cinema not to take it into account for another 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.149
 the sweet that is worth to prepare 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:57.619
 and now we are going to add 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:02.089
 the sugar lizard isern we leave it directly to víctor samuel sugar 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.700
 etc and 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.890
 but Spain started cooking in no time we are going to put the spoon 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.170
 to stir because what is going to happen is that if the explosion the new appointment of 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.840
 activated orange begin to disarm 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.450
 here we try to revolver then fundamental already we have the its 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.389
 letter we already have the agent cia we're going 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.389
 I had how to use it to flavor the Taliban chinarro to remove the left 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.909
 at low heat until the transparent and easy but still with 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:34.699
 orange color I do not want that this absolutely loses its color or its flavor 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.310
 not that it has orange color that has an orange flavor then once 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.349
 we see that they have already begun to become transparent, we take out an ipro love but 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.180
 here we like the taste of total talitas and nora cocinemos image was what 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.669
 he said he is working there fer phenomenon very well
