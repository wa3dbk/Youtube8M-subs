00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
just amazing I think the only thing

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.080 
just amazing I think the only thing
about<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.480> line<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.960> kind<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:19.090> offended

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
about the line that I kind of offended

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.330 
about the line that I kind of offended
about<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.870> fact<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.200> these<00:02:21.500> are<00:02:21.740> former

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
about is the fact that these are former

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.060 
about is the fact that these are former
stewardesses<00:02:23.110> airline<00:02:24.110> attendants<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.920> guess

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
stewardesses airline attendants I guess

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.280 
stewardesses airline attendants I guess
is<00:02:25.220> what<00:02:25.370> they<00:02:25.460> call<00:02:25.610> them<00:02:25.760> today<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.290> they

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
is what they call them today that they

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.290 
is what they call them today that they
invented<00:02:27.710> these<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.160> has<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.460> former<00:02:28.880> flight

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
invented these and has a former flight

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.449 
invented these and has a former flight
attendant<00:02:29.440> myself<00:02:30.440> why<00:02:30.740> didn't<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.100> think<00:02:31.130> of

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
attendant myself why didn't I think of

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.040 
attendant myself why didn't I think of
this<00:02:31.520> because<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.300> brilliant<00:02:32.870> it's

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
this because it's brilliant it's

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.980 
this because it's brilliant it's
organized<00:02:33.709> now<00:02:34.220> after<00:02:34.760> I'd<00:02:34.880> had<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.360> bag<00:02:35.690> for

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
organized now after I'd had this bag for

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.740 
organized now after I'd had this bag for
just<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.290> little<00:02:36.440> while<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:37.010> decided<00:02:37.540> then<00:02:38.540> you

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
just a little while I decided then you

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.150 
just a little while I decided then you
can<00:02:38.930> go<00:02:39.080> into<00:02:39.290> something<00:02:39.709> smaller<00:02:39.950> because

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
can go into something smaller because

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.610 
can go into something smaller because
they<00:02:40.400> have<00:02:40.520> smaller<00:02:40.940> bags<00:02:41.300> as<00:02:41.540> well<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.989> and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
they have smaller bags as well and and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.800 
they have smaller bags as well and and
so<00:02:43.010> now<00:02:43.040> I'm<00:02:43.459> using<00:02:43.640> this<00:02:44.030> little<00:02:44.239> bag<00:02:44.510> right

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810
