you're always competing against them you
always<00:03:07.989> want<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.319> beat<00:03:08.440> their<00:03:08.620> time<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:11.680> like

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
always want to beat their time just like

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.949 
always want to beat their time just like
in<00:03:11.860> World<00:03:12.190> War<00:03:12.280> two<00:03:12.670> when<00:03:12.910> when<00:03:13.209> pilots<00:03:13.690> sucked

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
in World War two when when pilots sucked

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.990 
in World War two when when pilots sucked
down<00:03:14.079> the<00:03:14.140> enemy<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:14.860> kind<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.250> rate<00:03:15.819> their

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
down the enemy that kind of rate their

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.190 
down the enemy that kind of rate their
kills<00:03:16.269> down<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.660> side<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.989> plane

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
kills down the side of the plane

kills down the side of the plane
visually<00:03:17.680> we<00:03:18.220> thought<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.579> photos<00:03:18.970> would<00:03:19.150> be

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
visually we thought that photos would be

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.940 
visually we thought that photos would be
a<00:03:19.239> cool<00:03:19.540> way<00:03:19.569> of<00:03:19.750> doing<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:20.410> we<00:03:20.590> figured<00:03:20.860> one

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
a cool way of doing it so we figured one

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.979 
a cool way of doing it so we figured one
it<00:03:21.069> take<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.730> next<00:03:21.880> level<00:03:21.970> where<00:03:22.390> you

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
it take that to the next level where you

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.539 
it take that to the next level where you
could<00:03:23.170> see<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.500> people<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.890> were<00:03:23.980> racing<00:03:24.160> so

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
could see the people you were racing so

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.550 
could see the people you were racing so
every<00:03:24.700> time<00:03:24.849> you<00:03:25.000> crash<00:03:25.269> up<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.599> come<00:03:25.750> down<00:03:25.959> it

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
every time you crash up to come down it

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.350 
every time you crash up to come down it
