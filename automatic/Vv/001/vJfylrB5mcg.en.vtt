00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.730
 hello to all this gentleman the v12 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.210
 I present a part that search and destroy 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.300
 so what know me minimum 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.390
 except that search and destruction and got up 12 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.950
 it's very far from being a love story 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.810
 while I'm going to use aca 47 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.940
 to begin 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.740
 and unrelated - concluding for me 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.460
 you will understand why 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.630
 there I hate looking for destruction 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.140
 ab simply because 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200
 I will wait a long time 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.240
 so I'm going for a walk in my soul 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.560
 and suddenly 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.060
 I'm going to have to wait for the race to end and I'm really that 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.920
 makes me he is in the search destruction 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.950
 I'm not a patient waiting for the round to end 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.800
 to be able to appear 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.810
 for me so have fun 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.550
 for that very very rarely does search destruction 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.040
 but here we go, I do it to please the natural person 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.170
 who play with me 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.610
 it's a vancouver treat then have the opportunity to hear it because it has 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.520
 commented on one of my parts 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 It's part of my mission on this myth 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.610
 the boat again to macao 74 p 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.270
 kieran culkin i think you have rounder 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.970
 all noticed when we 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.570
 for objective matches often find the question of June 14 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 even more when 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.760
 that's really so people 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.609
 you saw that I was lacking examples 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.850
 in order to make a big party 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.850
 I do not even talk about reading a message during the game 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
 Feminine so easily 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.350
 I admit that he managed to 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.160
 sir very quickly 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.110
 and yet what raised the 17 so we always tend to appreciate 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.489
 proud of prestige do not really need to textile 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.090
 it's respectable my sending between people who create a second 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.279
 account 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.949
 often dead brown could not tell me true 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.949
 easy not to make a big score while we believe this study the 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.159
 that little prestigious soaps say nothing bafé you go out my counter 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:26.659
 got up 12 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.429
 with which I did not spend prestigious 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.879
 you are an accurate control I can really strong of sports vale 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.529
 so to know strictly nothing to say 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.229
 so here I have a dilemma be executed knowing that it's already starting to 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.759
 get upset either I left or I produced I took it with 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:44.409
 philosophy 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.469
 she is so that's what I did I chose to play with space 12 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.810
 and a museum guide to identify a maximum despite teasing palermo 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.349
 the most appropriate 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.019
 yet big scores 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.799
 in this kind of match 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.689
 so we could realize that I managed to get rid of enough 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.909
 easily the two enemies the third and I sent my soul 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.620
 I managed to kill someone and he did not know that I never use 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.429
 but grenoble 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.429
 it's one of the biggest fault I'm someone who lies 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.219
 and here I go mining country the other two other two other enemies 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.979
 the group that holds the orders accumulate 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.919
 the singer 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.429
 six and a half years ago in one of their bases a landreau team I 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:28.639
 practically killed the whole country's key 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.979
 the whole team 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.759
 for a few months his accounts knowing that 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.759
 I'm really bogus in for two games 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:40.689
 the internship is addressed as 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.609
 he has in hand 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.179
 a weapon with which I read 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:48.259
 that I take the most pleasure to play 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.529
 I thought India was one of the first to have advised you to 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:53.419
 see the test 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.450
 this man 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.919
 these acts I have a lot of 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.179
 of comment between the saying and thank you for 

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:02.129
 the way 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.699
 opened his eyes on this man he is really too classic 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.029
 I take a lot of fun playing with it's clear that I'm one of 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:10.629
 first 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.179
 to have praised his merits 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:15.930
 shepherd do not think stops 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.669
 there most people 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:19.930
 now when 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.500
 courted with the Toulouse stadium I think me necessarily that's it 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.569
 quite funny 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.569
 so we find again we have on his side chained 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.520
 to sing 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.880
 we can observe, however, that the fact of levitation 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.680
 it's quite funny 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.060
 so we hired on the other hand 3 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.610
 we are happy that the world 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.830
 in fact I'm trying to do exactly the same 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.779
 the path 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:48.150
 québec the texts then when among the minimal 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.719
 the hit and run 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.559
 hoping to find someone in this state 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.080
 so the couple's request I would not send 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.529
 so that's very stupid of me 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.529
 I still have an opponent 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.129
 I reloaded 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.150
 I have red dots that line up behind 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.479
 so we just saw that my uncle my partner just got killed 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:10.909
 iphone 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.279
 and then I was avenging him 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.270
 so it's gone 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.999
 or that you like 9 hours 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.229
 the opponent ofc was made twice 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.080
 so it's a pretty good part especially for me who have not at all 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.419
 regulars this day of 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.710
 today they are today two game modes sufficiently 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.130
 more than I found it nice to force you to use the customer area 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.270
 in this kind of match-play data it would be threatened 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.669
 quite uncommon 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.840
 by the way you could observe that the world wears Norman means the living room 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.960
 saying thieves 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.409
 I do not see how the most stolen will be in this night train while 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.669
 the purpose of this study 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:49.689
 So here is 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.169
 % and I wish you 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:52.949
 2 a good day
