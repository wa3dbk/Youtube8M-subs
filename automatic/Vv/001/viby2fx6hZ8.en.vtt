00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.100 

so<00:01:30.670> let's<00:01:30.909> look<00:01:31.030> at<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.270> first<00:01:31.390> trick<00:01:31.750> how<00:01:32.079> to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
so let's look at the first trick how to

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.410 
so let's look at the first trick how to
clip<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.500> carabiner<00:01:32.680> into<00:01:33.189> a<00:01:33.220> bowl<00:01:33.460> first<00:01:34.210> you

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
clip the carabiner into a bowl first you

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.359 
clip the carabiner into a bowl first you
have<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.570> decide<00:01:34.930> which<00:01:35.200> way<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:36.009> gate<00:01:36.220> is

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
have to decide which way the gate is

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:37.859 
have to decide which way the gate is
going<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.579> be<00:01:36.700> facing<00:01:36.939> in<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.299> bolt<00:01:37.509> we<00:01:37.750> all

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
going to be facing in the bolt we all

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.480 
going to be facing in the bolt we all
know<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.229> trick<00:01:38.470> about<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:38.920> want<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.250> gate

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
know the trick about you want the gate

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.249 
know the trick about you want the gate
facing<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.090> way<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.390> Rope<00:01:40.570> is<00:01:40.720> coming<00:01:41.049> from

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
facing the way the Rope is coming from

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.870 
facing the way the Rope is coming from
and<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.560> spine<00:01:41.860> towards<00:01:42.220> where<00:01:42.369> it's<00:01:42.520> going

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
and the spine towards where it's going

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.060 
and the spine towards where it's going
so<00:01:43.090> in<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.689> case<00:01:43.869> here<00:01:44.289> we're<00:01:44.740> going<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.890> have

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
so in the case here we're going to have

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.730 
so in the case here we're going to have
the<00:01:45.240> carabiner<00:01:46.240> gate<00:01:46.539> in<00:01:46.780> on<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.200> left<00:01:47.500> side

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
the carabiner gate in on the left side

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.550 
the carabiner gate in on the left side
of<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.009> bolt<00:01:48.189> so<00:01:48.820> we<00:01:48.939> want<00:01:49.119> to<00:01:49.210> move<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.380> pivot

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
of the bolt so we want to move the pivot

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.850 
of the bolt so we want to move the pivot
arm<00:01:50.799> over<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.490> left<00:01:51.670> side<00:01:52.830> take<00:01:53.830> your

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
arm over to the left side take your

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.690 
arm over to the left side take your
carabiner<00:01:54.759> gate<00:01:55.320> put<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.470> gate<00:01:57.130> through<00:01:57.549> the

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
carabiner gate put the gate through the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.179 
carabiner gate put the gate through the
fingers<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.270> bring<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.170> up<00:01:59.289> into<00:01:59.649> here<00:02:00.039> and

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
fingers and bring it up into here and

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.570 
fingers and bring it up into here and
then<00:02:00.939> move<00:02:01.869> it<00:02:02.020> up<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.860> it's<00:02:03.009> as<00:02:03.100> vertical<00:02:03.549> as

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
then move it up so it's as vertical as

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.880 
then move it up so it's as vertical as
possible<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.840> look<00:02:05.140> at<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.500> holds<00:02:05.619> the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
possible and look at that it holds the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:18.510 
possible and look at that it holds the
gate<00:02:06.069> open<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:09.569> pick<00:02:10.569> it<00:02:10.690> up<00:02:11.519> find<00:02:12.519> your<00:02:12.670> bolt

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.080 

and<00:02:19.710> clip<00:02:20.710> it<00:02:20.860> on<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.220> have<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.400> move<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.850> head

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
and clip it on you have to move the head

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
and clip it on you have to move the head
of<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:23.250> squid<00:02:24.250> over<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.060> right<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.870> close

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
of the squid over to the right to close

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.940 
of the squid over to the right to close
the<00:02:26.290> gate<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.710> then<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.070> spin<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:29.500> rope<00:02:29.710> arm

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
the gate and then you spin the rope arm

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.810 
the gate and then you spin the rope arm
off<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.670> you've<00:02:31.450> got<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:32.550> carabiner<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:33.730> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
off and you've got a carabiner in the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.580 
off and you've got a carabiner in the
bolt<00:02:34.000> cool<00:02:34.660> huh

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.860 

all<00:02:39.069> right<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:39.580> now<00:02:39.730> we<00:02:39.790> got<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.150> quick<00:02:40.690> drop

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
all right so now we got the quick drop

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.300 
all right so now we got the quick drop
in<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.230> bolt<00:02:41.440> I'm<00:02:41.709> going<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.920> show<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.069> how<00:02:42.250> to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
in the bolt I'm going to show you how to

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.180 
in the bolt I'm going to show you how to
hang<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.060> rope<00:02:43.239> in<00:02:43.420> there<00:02:43.950> pivot<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.040> rope

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
hang the rope in there pivot the rope

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.430 
hang the rope in there pivot the rope
arms<00:02:45.519> 90<00:02:46.000> degrees<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> body<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.200> squid

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
arms 90 degrees to the body of the squid

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.710 
arms 90 degrees to the body of the squid
like<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.069> then<00:02:48.220> take<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.459> bite<00:02:48.849> of<00:02:49.090> rope

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
like that and then take a bite of rope

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.089 
like that and then take a bite of rope
and<00:02:50.700> put<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.790> through<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.540> squid<00:02:52.980> through<00:02:53.980> the

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
and put it through the squid through the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.880 
and put it through the squid through the
rope<00:02:54.250> arms<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.849> then<00:02:55.660> pivot<00:02:55.989> those<00:02:56.230> back<00:02:56.500> till

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
rope arms and then pivot those back till

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.339 
rope arms and then pivot those back till
they<00:02:57.069> engage<00:02:58.060> with<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.420> little<00:02:58.629> D<00:02:58.840> dents<00:02:59.080> and

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
they engage with the little D dents and

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.650 
they engage with the little D dents and
they<00:02:59.440> hold<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.830> there<00:03:00.160> if<00:03:00.940> you're<00:03:01.360> using<00:03:01.480> a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
they hold that there if you're using a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.330 
they hold that there if you're using a
really<00:03:01.690> skinny<00:03:02.290> rope<00:03:02.560> by<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.799> way<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.069> know

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
really skinny rope by the way you know

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.610 
really skinny rope by the way you know
sub<00:03:03.610> 9<00:03:03.849> 5<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.569> may<00:03:04.720> want<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.080> wrap<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> few

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
sub 9 5 you may want to wrap a few

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.830 
sub 9 5 you may want to wrap a few
pieces<00:03:05.830> of<00:03:06.010> tape<00:03:06.280> around<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.819> pivot<00:03:07.360> arms<00:03:07.690> to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
pieces of tape around the pivot arms to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.690 
pieces of tape around the pivot arms to
hold<00:03:07.959> that<00:03:08.200> because<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.560> rope<00:03:08.739> will<00:03:08.950> slide

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
hold that because the rope will slide

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.220 
hold that because the rope will slide
through<00:03:10.060> there<00:03:11.579> but<00:03:12.579> bring<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.569> bite<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> rope

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
through there but bring that bite a rope

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.780 
through there but bring that bite a rope
up<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:15.040> quick-draw<00:03:17.370> it's<00:03:18.370> almost<00:03:18.579> like

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
up to the quick-draw it's almost like

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.580 
up to the quick-draw it's almost like
lassu<00:03:19.360> in<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.599> quick-draw<00:03:19.810> we<00:03:20.260> want<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.500> get

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
lassu in the quick-draw we want to get

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.280 
lassu in the quick-draw we want to get
the<00:03:20.709> rope<00:03:20.890> on<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.400> gate<00:03:21.610> side<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.360> then<00:03:23.110> you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
the rope on the gate side and then you

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:32.260 
the rope on the gate side and then you
pull<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:24.010> rope<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.690> with<00:03:25.690> your<00:03:25.840> hand<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.809 

there<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:32.900> go

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.000 

all<00:03:38.299> right<00:03:38.480> trick<00:03:38.749> number<00:03:38.900> three<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.769> the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
all right trick number three this is the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.679 
all right trick number three this is the
this<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:40.819> the<00:03:40.909> cool<00:03:41.090> thing<00:03:41.299> of<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.480> squid

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
this is the cool thing of the squid

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.910 
this is the cool thing of the squid
because<00:03:41.959> I'm<00:03:42.109> going<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.260> show<00:03:42.379> you<00:03:42.409> how<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.650> get

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
because I'm going to show you how to get

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.349 
because I'm going to show you how to get
that<00:03:43.069> quick-draw<00:03:43.609> right<00:03:43.879> out<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.209> bowl

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
that quick-draw right out of the bowl

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.330 
that quick-draw right out of the bowl
first<00:03:45.139> take<00:03:45.409> a<00:03:45.439> look<00:03:45.650> at<00:03:45.709> what<00:03:45.829> side<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.129> gates

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
first take a look at what side the gates

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.220 
first take a look at what side the gates
on<00:03:46.579> in<00:03:46.879> this<00:03:47.120> case<00:03:47.299> it's<00:03:47.540> on<00:03:47.629> the<00:03:47.719> left<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.139> I'm

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
on in this case it's on the left so I'm

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.259 
on in this case it's on the left so I'm
going<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.409> rotate<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:49.040> pivot<00:03:49.310> arm<00:03:49.489> over<00:03:50.150> to

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
going to rotate the pivot arm over to

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.420 
going to rotate the pivot arm over to
the<00:03:50.359> left<00:03:50.569> side<00:03:50.749> of<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.019> squid<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:51.920> basically

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
the left side of the squid and basically

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.819 
the left side of the squid and basically
undo<00:03:52.909> what<00:03:53.480> we<00:03:53.599> did<00:03:53.780> here<00:03:54.019> on<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:54.170> ground<00:03:54.500> to

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
undo what we did here on the ground to

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.099 
undo what we did here on the ground to
clip<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.670> in<00:03:56.079> go<00:03:57.079> up<00:03:57.260> there<00:03:58.659> put<00:03:59.659> the<00:03:59.750> fingers

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
clip it in go up there put the fingers

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.339 
clip it in go up there put the fingers
right<00:04:00.319> around<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.709> gate<00:04:01.450> pull<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.569> down<00:04:02.840> and

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
right around the gate pull it down and

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.899 
right around the gate pull it down and
watch<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:03.799> it's<00:04:04.010> opening<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.519> gate<00:04:04.700> right

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
watch that it's opening the gate right

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.599 
watch that it's opening the gate right
there<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.480> now<00:04:06.379> we<00:04:06.439> have<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.859> wiggle<00:04:07.159> a<00:04:07.579> little

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
there and now we have to wiggle a little

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.309 
there and now we have to wiggle a little
bit<00:04:07.849> this<00:04:08.150> takes<00:04:08.359> a<00:04:08.480> little<00:04:08.569> bit<00:04:09.019> of<00:04:09.139> practice

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
bit this takes a little bit of practice

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.020 
bit this takes a little bit of practice
you<00:04:09.680> guys<00:04:09.829> you<00:04:10.010> got<00:04:10.129> a<00:04:10.159> wiggle<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.790> sort<00:04:10.969> of

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
you guys you got a wiggle and sort of

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.240 
you guys you got a wiggle and sort of
just<00:04:11.209> feed<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.629> in<00:04:11.750> there<00:04:12.019> so<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.980> body

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
just feed it in there so that the body

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.920 
just feed it in there so that the body
of<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.549> carabiner<00:04:13.969> is<00:04:14.150> trapped<00:04:14.450> between<00:04:14.629> the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
of the carabiner is trapped between the

I<00:05:08.350> could<00:05:08.680> probably<00:05:09.100> bounce<00:05:09.400> test<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:10.060> on<00:05:10.240> the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
I could probably bounce test that on the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.300 
I could probably bounce test that on the
ground<00:05:10.570> and<00:05:10.750> break<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:11.139> carabiner<00:05:11.770> okay

ground and break the carabiner okay

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.000 
ground and break the carabiner okay
people<00:05:12.610> have<00:05:13.000> broken<00:05:13.810> carabiners<00:05:14.590> with<00:05:14.770> stick

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
people have broken carabiners with stick
