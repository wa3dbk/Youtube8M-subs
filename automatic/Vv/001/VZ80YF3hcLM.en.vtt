00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.519
 well hello to each and all of these 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.679
 knox I hope you are well and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.670
 I also hope that if at home 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.529
 snow at home you are not 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.090
 refrigerated that you are not yet 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.650
 turned into a snowman or that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.359
 you have not broken the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.980
 figure we will meet for a 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.840
 new video today on black ops 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.760
 2 as you recognized on the map 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.890
 loader flow in the confirmed elimination 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.960
 and I go all the details and class 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.430
 for culture visualize a little bit 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.200
 better with what I will play during this 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.210
 gameplay so I was playing at peace 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
 splitting 57 minutes a little 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.440
 silent to stay discreet power 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.000
 turn my enemies into you I had 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.500
 thirst for a roof which allows it so 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.350
 to have two assets as you know 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.870
 I had ghosts and bulletproof vest 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.489
 to avoid the gonads a bit boring 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.980
 strengths in all three 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.079
 dexterity and finally in mortals I had 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.910
 double c4 I was going to danger myself close I 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.829
 believe it's called what allows me 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.399
 so to have c4 and power everything 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.829
 to fart 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.570
 and at the level of the strip scores I'm going 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.979
 play with the aircraft so end that is 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.780
 really strict scores favorites 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.290
 which is really very bad and very 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.710
 convenient 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.510
 the orbital micro station and the system 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.979
 u I'll come back a little bit more 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.890
 late on it for you I used 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.729
 this combination explains us that's it 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.439
 but first of all I'm still going 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.240
 welcomed the newcomers 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.380
 subscribers I could have because 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.580
 as you know for a certain 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.140
 many of you I passed on 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.820
 a community channel there is no 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.740
 very long time but I really had 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.960
 message support messages from 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.790
 rabbits compliments full of good 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.229
 things and it really makes me happy 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.880
 thank you very much for that I hope 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.079
 it makes me really happy the pine nuts 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 always that I can do 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.400
 and then and then I hope he does not 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.170
 did not know inactive by one stroke 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.430
 and that when you watch the videos 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.780
 would not leave a small body or a small 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.980
 live it's really always fun 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.860
 and that motivates it is thanks to you that 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.740
 this adventure continues and that and that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.230
 makes you want to overtake so 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.090
 this is for the little story before this 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.730
 gameplay story of me counting what 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.290
 happened a little heart beats you 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.250
 know that the cause has come out since a 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.480
 moment that there is no end killstreak 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.009
 of this strict body so that I have 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.630
 always struggling between narrow score that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.030
 is that there is no strict score 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.150
 to hide one is only for a little bit 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.730
 replace the moab of w3 now there is 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.140
 the famous nuclear title bah me I 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.640
 still do not have anyone listening 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.230
 and I want to tell you because 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.410
 because I have bad luck 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.350
 2 i can not and 3 i do not know i think 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.510
 that it's treyarch did not want that 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.430
 I have those who because I had beautiful 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.050
 try to play with guns 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.790
 assault of all possible weapons 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.470
 all possible game modes that this 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.430
 either the dominate knows the war of 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.260
 territory the mmo in many things I 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.630
 could not do it even while playing and that 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.209
 some scop will enthrall jammers 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.360
 micro stats makes it impossible either I 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.070
 could not be in series either 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.870
 I would die stupidly either I'm dead 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.830
 once again at 28 with my own 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.850
 group of women 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.430
 that was nice and so here I am 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.260
 did not happen I even told myself that the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.850
 serious I would not have the nuclear title 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.040
 who will not ask what has become of 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.900
 so banal behind since in 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.660
 all the parts that I think there are 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.100
 always a person who have so there 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.260
 in no doubt years I think they 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.640
 have realized and we really have it and that 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.080
 it's really the nuclear artist but 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.840
 it is true that sometimes I have doubts 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.310
 when when I have this person who has the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.260
 nuclear title and that remains in front of 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.690
 me three four five parts and he 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.730
 only the negative, which makes the 5 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.440
 13 had 10 or 20 things like that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.940
 so his best equipment these 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.260
 electric sticks I ask myself the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.750
 question of whether he really 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.060
 realized by himself also he sought to 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.700
 to have a little thumb in the voice of a 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.100
 a little easier way which for 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.200
 I take away all the credit for having this 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.610
 famous title because boost a teach 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.280
 not completely emptied completely 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.130
 useless and I find that before a 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.989
 disgusting just like the detector of 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.760
 6.6 feathered or kill me break up 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.310
 series of many many times this 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.709
 famous viewfinder with the diamond logo 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.450
 red pardon that appears all this 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.980
 really disgusting you do not play 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.340
 with that sincerely because I find 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.019
 that in absolute humiliation is 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.639
 really hungry you will not progress with 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.680
 fanfare to me I tell you it's not 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.600
 possible it is better to take a two 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.910
 three four five says aulas with 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.230
 normal viewers and all and in the end you 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.090
 will start to progress that of 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.910
 play with it and do a little sport 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.080
 near drinking there passage I think that 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.220
 Call of the old was with me 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.630
 because I do not know how he got me 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.860
 not killed 1 I tell you sincerely 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.060
 I was very very hot 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.920
 and also it's bah listen when we do not 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.900
 do not necessarily think about 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.220
 put a goal in kind help I'm going 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.540
 make a big gameplay you have 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.400
 tried a little nape or anything 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.560
 we can possibly do that 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.780
 you will see for yourself you have seen 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.650
 that I received a message 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.510
 so it's someone who was in the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.400
 part that told me that I was camping so 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.440
 I would like you to tell me what 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.390
 you think if I camped or not you 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.220
 but I have not necessarily found a 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.000
 moment I'm going to temporize I you 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.500
 explain why 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.320
 but tell me a bit about what you 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.020
 think and I'm going to give you actually 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.780
 me but my techniques and my tips 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.030
 that the strength of having tried I find the 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.890
 simplest the most useful to try a 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.210
 thing if you like me galley you is 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.630
 at the end of the roll and tell you it's 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.730
 not serious 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.650
 I would not have or anything bah I 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.180
 will give you one or two things that 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.750
 I think are important to try 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.150
 this thing 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.190
 the first located with adults 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.600
 billion and ghosts that's at and 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.160
 bulletproof vest that's a 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.810
 requirement because it saves you from me 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.660
 take grenades that avoids you 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.130
 to be visible to drones and and you 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.430
 can pick up ammo for your 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.560
 money 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.320
 it's really three agreements that are 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.630
 complementary the second is 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.520
 take a weapon like the peace of w or 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.780
 a weapon that we eat it would rather 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.900
 well that allows you to move 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.610
 easily adjust the movements and 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.620
 who also has a lot of balls because 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.670
 that it's true that the 50 ball pgw 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.900
 still in the charger what 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.490
 allow you two or three 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.420
 enemies so there I will temporize I 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.550
 go camping you see there are three 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.320
 red dots on the radar i'm at 25 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.870
 so the nuclear title start to 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.760
 come in my head is to say if we 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.320
 succeeded this time but you 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.450
 go see that time is going to squeeze me 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.400
 I'm 85 plates already we know 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.980
 it ends at 100 and I have no 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.750
 enemy before that's it 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.120
 I tell myself shit he'll have to go 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.420
 still try to find 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.560
 these last five enemies alarm and I 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.600
 will advise you feast beats the 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.490
 microstation and the same u system for 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.650
 two things the micro stadium is going to you 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.960
 allows to see the enemies and the system 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.220
 Lmd deprives their radar this viewfinder 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.780
 they use bizarre laser 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.210
 of effector of signs that this kind of 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.680
 twice and into exile in scor site 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.980
 strict so it's not bad it turns me off 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.420
 and the environment project or something 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.760
 while you are in series so 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.920
 I really recommend this and 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.330
 then you will see that you have no 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.920
 reason we do not arrive if you 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.510
 get to make nice little scores 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.030
 from time to time there is no need 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.220
 to be a huge player in less I am 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.290
 far from being a huge wood but good 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.460
 here 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.990
 and then do not hesitate to try 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.430
 maybe another game mode if you 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.170
 only pay in one game mode 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.790
 you do not get there I tried that 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.170
 was in half for a while 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.750
 it's true that I did not succeed at all 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:08.060
 and you see that I finally unlock my 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.470
 little nuclear Hallelujah I was in a hurry 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.390
 by the time I almost missed because 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.450
 time but it's nice I finally 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.230
 this nuclear title so so that's it 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.760
 really happy 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.960
 and then the gameplay is not disgusting I 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.800
 find me I'm pretty happy I 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.750
 even think it's the best 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.370
 gameplay that I did one finds it more 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.780
 beautiful claude personally to you from 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.850
 tell me 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.450
 so I'll leave you there 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.160
 do not hesitate to follow me on twitter 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.260
 because I'm doing a lot of bullshit 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.520
 then I answer a lot of things and 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.800
 then there will be a lot of ads 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.930
 on it if you have twitter and then bah 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.190
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.500
 and then I'm waiting for your comments 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:43.120
 here I leave you with this little 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.120
 nuclear power worldwide
