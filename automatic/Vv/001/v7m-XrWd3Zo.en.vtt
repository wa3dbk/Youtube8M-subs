00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello everyone in this video I show you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.349
 how to learn how to make these easy 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.610
 origami hearts 

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:10.820
 let's see the materials that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.559
 we need 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.930
 the materials that you are going to need 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.510
 loan crafts a square of paper 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.570
 in this case I use I am using 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.490
 a square of 20 x 20 centimeters but 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.259
 the size you will define according to 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.710
 How big do you want me to give you? 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.470
 be your heart and nothing else a scissors 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.470
 We can start 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.620
 the first step will be to take your paper and 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.050
 make her a girl right in the middle 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.129
 in this part you are going to cut it so that 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.129
 the triangles remain 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.480
 with the triangle placed on the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.600
 next way with the tip towards 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.400
 up we're going to make the client step that 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.400
 will fold them in half 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.490
 I do not know 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.830
 Yeah come on 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.650
 once you have doubled it we will take 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.760
 the tip and we'll go down to a couple of 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.760
 centimeters of the edge 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.270
 taking care that the brand points to the brand 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.630
 that we have previously done 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.420
 now let's take the sides and the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.450
 we are going to lift taking care that 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.750
 here join with the line that already 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.220
 we had previously marked 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.220
 with the double meaning 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.950
 Once you have your diamond you will give it 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.350
 return 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.119
 and in this part I quote that I should 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.570
 have been blank if you're 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.750
 using the decorated portal we are going to 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.320
 lower the tips and fold them from this 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.630
 way 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.210
 As you can see, it is taking shape in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.060
 the heart now so that we do not get 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.840
 unfold what we're going to do is make 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.440
 a fold 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.440
 on the side 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.770
 taking care that double also a 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.770
 little bit 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.490
 of this brand that is this fold that 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.490
 we did up here 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.510
 well we achieve the dimensions 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.430
 and ready and have our heart 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.580
 now I'm going to repeat the process in 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.880
 quick version with this piece of paper that we 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.880
 remains 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.600
 i 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.600
 all right 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.720
 Well how could you see this is a 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.000
 craftsmanship is super-fast to make them 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.130
 I'm going to give a tip that is that to our 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.450
 heart from the back you can 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.360
 put a little bit of adhesive on the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.120
 little tips that we bend so that 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.540
 stay fixed and you can use it as a 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.880
 about to put the cards that real 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.010
 in this valentine as it will open 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.550
 only from this part here can you 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.380
 put your appointments and well I hope that 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.000
 this craft they like but that about 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.130
 everything serves them 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.110
 this craft of something that is very very 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.030
 her father is that the more a 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.830
 practice the rubber band will be like 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.380
 you can see this is the first heart that 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.360
 I did and the second one because there was one 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.520
 little bit nicer and then you can 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.200
 use any piece of paper 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.590
 of care you have out there for these 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.900
 dates 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.430
 good many thanks for giving me 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.790
 of their time and see them in following 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.120
 video 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.120
 bye
