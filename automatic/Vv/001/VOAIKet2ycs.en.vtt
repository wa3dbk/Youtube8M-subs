00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
steel in manufacturing process so

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.659 
steel in manufacturing process so
they're<00:02:59.900> using<00:03:00.169> very<00:03:00.379> sturdy<00:03:00.980> front<00:03:01.340> it's

this very very well made basically and

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.319 
this very very well made basically and
that<00:03:07.189> lifetime<00:03:07.430> warranty<00:03:07.639> is<00:03:08.000> probably

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
that lifetime warranty is probably

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.089 
that lifetime warranty is probably
almost<00:03:08.569> never<00:03:08.900> going<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.079> be<00:03:09.199> used<00:03:09.500> as<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.829> guess

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
almost never going to be used as I guess

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.330 
almost never going to be used as I guess

just based on how substantial it is this

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.740 
just based on how substantial it is this
you're<00:03:13.340> getting<00:03:13.549> a<00:03:13.609> nice<00:03:13.819> low<00:03:14.060> pan<00:03:14.299> of<00:03:14.510> is

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
components we have this the base which

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.229 
components we have this the base which
this<00:03:36.290> thing<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.650> massive<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.579> as<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:38.150> can

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
this thing is massive and as you can

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.409 
this thing is massive and as you can
hear<00:03:38.299> it<00:03:39.019> is<00:03:39.919> steel<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.849> this<00:03:41.000> isn't<00:03:41.299> going

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
hear it is steel so this isn't going

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.819 
hear it is steel so this isn't going
anywhere<00:03:41.930> I'm<00:03:42.019> just<00:03:42.139> going<00:03:42.259> to<00:03:42.319> tilt<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.709> up

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
anywhere I'm just going to tilt it up

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.379 
anywhere I'm just going to tilt it up
slightly<00:03:43.189> so<00:03:43.459> you<00:03:43.549> can<00:03:43.699> look<00:03:43.819> down<00:03:43.939> the<00:03:44.120> cone

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
slightly so you can look down the cone

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.589 
slightly so you can look down the cone
you<00:03:45.349> can<00:03:45.470> see<00:03:45.650> inside<00:03:45.919> there<00:03:46.159> that<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.329> what

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
you can see inside there that is what

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.360 
you can see inside there that is what
you're<00:03:47.840> going<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.109> screw<00:03:48.439> the<00:03:48.530> pole<00:03:48.709> into<00:03:49.009> and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
you're going to screw the pole into and

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.399 
you're going to screw the pole into and
give<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.609> just<00:03:49.639> a<00:03:49.849> really<00:03:50.060> sturdy<00:03:50.540> base<00:03:50.810> so

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:51.409 
give it just a really sturdy base so

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:52.179 
give it just a really sturdy base so
let's<00:03:51.530> go<00:03:51.620> ahead<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:51.829> show<00:03:51.919> you<00:03:52.009> what<00:03:52.129> it

correction<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:16.870> actually<00:04:16.989> said<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.320> was<00:04:17.350> all

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
correction I actually said it was all

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.170 
correction I actually said it was all
steeled<00:04:17.830> its<00:04:18.040> steel<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.549> aluminum<00:04:19.060> and

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
steeled its steel and aluminum and

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.610 
steeled its steel and aluminum and
construction<00:04:19.780> it's<00:04:19.959> important<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.440> mention

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
construction it's important to mention

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.290 
construction it's important to mention
since<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.070> needs<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.310> be<00:04:21.400> light<00:04:21.580> stable<00:04:22.090> and

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
since it needs to be light stable and

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.260 
since it needs to be light stable and
solid<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.800> is<00:04:24.100> very<00:04:24.520> substantial<00:04:25.120> by<00:04:25.210> the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
solid so it is very substantial by the

solid so it is very substantial by the
way<00:04:25.420> very<00:04:26.170> sturdy<00:04:26.910> overall<00:04:27.910> I<00:04:27.940> really<00:04:28.120> like<00:04:28.300> it

have 10 degrees down and 20 degrees up

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.570 
have 10 degrees down and 20 degrees up
and<00:04:59.200> if<00:04:59.290> I<00:04:59.410> put<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.650> back<00:04:59.860> towards<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.400> center

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580

and if I put it back towards the center
here<00:05:01.030> you<00:05:01.480> have<00:05:01.660> a<00:05:01.690> small<00:05:02.290> amount<00:05:02.440> about<00:05:02.710> 25

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
here you have a small amount about 25

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.390 
degrees left and right in terms of the
tilt<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:06.700> as<00:05:07.540> well<00:05:07.900> as<00:05:08.170> being<00:05:08.560> able<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:08.800> rotate

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
tilt and as well as being able to rotate

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.770 
tilt and as well as being able to rotate
this<00:05:09.720> from<00:05:10.720> landscape<00:05:11.760> up<00:05:12.760> to<00:05:13.030> portrait<00:05:13.540> and

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
this from landscape up to portrait and

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.180 
this from landscape up to portrait and
so<00:05:14.200> obviously<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:14.560> can<00:05:14.680> do<00:05:14.770> that<00:05:14.890> with<00:05:15.010> each

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190

so obviously you can do that with each
one<00:05:15.340> of<00:05:15.460> these<00:05:15.520> is<00:05:15.700> just<00:05:15.850> easier<00:05:16.120> for<00:05:16.150> me<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.360> do

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540
