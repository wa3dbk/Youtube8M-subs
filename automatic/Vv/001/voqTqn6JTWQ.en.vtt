 the skin 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.240

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.850
 remove a tattoo the laser acts by 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.759
 Affinity with melanin by undoing 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.890
 pigments of the skin macrophages is 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.140
 say the cells that eliminate the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.149
 detritus of the organism are responsible for 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.009
 eliminate those pigments 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.240
 you just need a session that lasts a 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.610
 half an hour to finish so 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.760
 definitively with the dark coloration of 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.459
 dark circles that yes the drawback is the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.470
 postoperative you need a period of 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.420
 convalescence of one week at least 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.950
 the issue is that after the 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.140
 intervention is formed a crust that 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.480
 it takes a few days to fall 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.510
 shortly after the new skin appears 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.459
 without pigmentation and with a better appearance 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.370
 during convalescence you can do 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.489
 normal life but using sunglasses 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.800
