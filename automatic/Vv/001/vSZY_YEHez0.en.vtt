 true origin of superman and what

 gave way to the golden age of the copies 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.619
 after 'action comics' more than anything 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.510
 during the second world war been 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.100
 the creation of many superiors like 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.320

 known as marvel gives rise to 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.259
 captain america whose influence on the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.600
 comics during the second world was 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.280
 so big that it made the comics 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.799
 were part of the packages that were 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.810
 they carry the yaks during the war those 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.040
 Cool packages arrived at the hands of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.040
 the Japanese and so too 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.320
 1949 with the founder of facebook spanish 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.090
 convert to this last technique this is 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.920
 the publishing house spearhead returns 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.510
 of the creativity of the comics during 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.330
 the 50s until the publication of force 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.970
 where the medium is attacked like the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.000
 source of the ills of all youth 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.580
 and hearings are held and lead to 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.560
 comic creation is all code 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.150
 arm of self-censorship of comics and that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.150
 I appreciate the medium for many years 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.010
 1956 and if comic is designed several 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.530
 superiors of the golden age but now 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.879
 with origins of scientific fiction 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.469
 starting in showcase number 4 with the 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.939
 new flash and with a new design of 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.939
 costume for children carmen 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.300
 1961 such a bieber was an employee of 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.160
 atlas the year seat was tired of his 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.910
 work and I wanted to give up the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.860
 comics industry 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.270
 his wife said because it 's a story 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.610
 as you want before you give up 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.160
 we'll say what happened and that's how it was 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.930
 originated fantastic four number one was a 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.880
 comic that broke schemes of all kinds 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.190
 in the first comic they did not even have 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.840
 uniform in the characters is brought to 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.910
 the end of the war was the race 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.620
 against the communists towards space and 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.630
 that leads to empowering these 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.070
 characters that despite being like a 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.440
 family did not even get along with each 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.230
 they gave me a three-dimensionality 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.460
 to comics that had never been seen 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.200
 this he did with the help of jack kirby 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.730
 the creator of the captain america and of 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.650
 many other early characters 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.600
 assets are considered as the person 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.990
 that brought the dynamism and movement to 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.510
 the comics 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.040
 then on the table infantas and decided 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.990
 experiment with another character in the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.840
 which martín form the editor in that 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.210
 so I did not have much faith this 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.920
 spider-man character who became 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.930
 in the archetype of youth of all 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.520
 the comics of the modern era the 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.740
 his work indicated he also helped 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.380
 much to Spanish popularity and so it 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.850
 created the hand of the comic giving way to everything 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.680
 what we see today in the culture 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.690
 popular as in the movies of I ask 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.790
 games in marvel students is in 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.790
 everywhere and this is thanks to the stand 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.600
 during the sixties and the revolution 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.850
 ejido and small drugs in the points 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.070
 something that exxon amputation asked to 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.620
 stalin make a story of the amazing 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.550
 spider-man where the dangers will be 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.889
 of getting these things 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.750
 the comic book of eli team did not want 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.090
 let it be published to what he said 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.129
 stanley al excelsior and I'm going to take it out 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.599
 all ways proving that really the 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:40.210
 problem is not the content of the 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.069
 comics after green lantern and vinaròs 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.490
 two characters who did not have much 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.620
 follow-up then were 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.000
 related by demián and units create 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.830
 a comic full of content 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.690
 especially in a story where 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.060
 we discovered that speed and the assistant 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.159
 green out is a human kingdom to which 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.080
 they offered nothing but to put them 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.990
 the lurches 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.240
 that won him the food of the us to the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.689
 authors and that's how you liberalize with 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.689
 my color 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.759
 in the 80s will be a 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.389
 extraordinary revolution in creation 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:20.460
 of the comic or precedents as commander 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.590
 of frank miller's plane arrive 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.469
 stories like watchmen the dark knight 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.270
 Greek vectors the people but not those 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.580
 stories proved to the world that the 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.080
 comics are a spearhead in what 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.960
 refers to the narrative and 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.759
 especially to visual media 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.860
 so much that watchmen is considered one of 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:40.139
 the 100 best novels of the 20th century by 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.189
 the time warner and trans influenced a 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.189
 large number of filmmakers 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.020
 this background led to things like 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.750
 the match in the 90s and the creation of 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.610
 sport that was a character that was put 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.830
 the madrazos with the two companies more 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.350
 great from the world of marvel comics and 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.840
 he says something that is not easy but 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.970
 well that's how we got to what it is 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.800
 the modern day pig of comics 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.240
