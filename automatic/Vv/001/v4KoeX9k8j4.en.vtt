weapon in the game and in this episode I

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.150 
weapon in the game and in this episode I
am<00:00:20.850> using<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.420> Barrett<00:00:21.779> 50<00:00:21.960> Cal<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.590> 50<00:00:22.920> Cal

am using the Barrett 50 Cal the 50 Cal
is<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> default<00:00:24.150> snipers<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
is one of the default snipers in the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.870 
is one of the default snipers in the
game<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.710> arguably<00:00:26.099> also<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
game and it's arguably also one of the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.790 
game and it's arguably also one of the
best<00:00:27.090> ones<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.420> use<00:00:27.660> because<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.500> its<00:00:28.740> high

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
best ones to use because of its high

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.230 
best ones to use because of its high
damage<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.609> always<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.090> be<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
damage it's always going to be a

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240 
damage it's always going to be a
one-shot<00:00:30.510> kill<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> torso<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.830> up<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
one-shot kill to the torso and up and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.130 
one-shot kill to the torso and up and
also<00:00:32.759> because<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.270> semi-automatic<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.020> it's

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
also because it's semi-automatic so it's

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.780 
also because it's semi-automatic so it's
not<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.290> bolt-action<00:00:34.680> sniper<00:00:34.920> rifle<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.579> can

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
not a bolt-action sniper rifle you can

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.150 
not a bolt-action sniper rifle you can
continuously<00:00:36.329> shoot<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.989> weapon<00:00:37.140> until<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
continuously shoot the weapon until the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.680 
continuously shoot the weapon until the
weapon<00:00:38.550> has<00:00:38.579> no<00:00:38.760> more<00:00:39.120> bullets<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:39.600> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
weapon has no more bullets and then you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.030 
weapon has no more bullets and then you
have<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.840> reload<00:00:40.260> that's<00:00:40.469> why<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.770> really

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
have to reload that's why it's really

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220 
have to reload that's why it's really
good<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.760> those<00:00:41.940> two<00:00:42.180> things<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:42.750> well<00:00:43.020> as

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
good for those two things as well as

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.590 
good for those two things as well as
this<00:00:43.410> little<00:00:43.620> nuance<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:45.210> modern

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
this little nuance here in modern

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
this little nuance here in modern
warfare<00:00:45.750> 3<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.140> snipers<00:00:46.770> are<00:00:46.980> allowed<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> use

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
warfare 3 the snipers are allowed to use

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.639 
warfare 3 the snipers are allowed to use
silencers<00:00:47.940> without<00:00:48.600> any<00:00:48.870> damage<00:00:49.200> reduction

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
silencers without any damage reduction

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.950 
silencers without any damage reduction
which<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.129> quite<00:00:50.340> different<00:00:50.610> from<00:00:50.760> xbox<00:00:51.329> 360

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
which is quite different from xbox 360

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.840 
which is quite different from xbox 360
and<00:00:51.989> ps3<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.590> that's<00:00:52.739> why<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.100> kind<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> just

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and ps3 and that's why I kind of just

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.010 
and ps3 and that's why I kind of just
wanted<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.149> try<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.989> actually

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
wanted to try it out see if it actually

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.990 
wanted to try it out see if it actually
work<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.680> actually<00:00:55.829> does<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.789> want

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
work and it actually does so if you want

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.790 
work and it actually does so if you want
to<00:00:57.030> use<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> silencer<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.140> sniper<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.680> not

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
to use a silencer on your sniper and not

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.889 
to use a silencer on your sniper and not
be<00:00:58.980> shown<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> radar<00:00:59.670> go<00:01:00.420> ahead<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.690> do

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
be shown on the radar go ahead and do

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
be shown on the radar go ahead and do
that<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.170> will<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.410> use<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.190> lose

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that you will not use you will not lose

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.429 
that you will not use you will not lose
any<00:01:02.910> damage<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.480> that's<00:01:03.809> why<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> kind<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.290> like

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
any damage and that's why I kind of like

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.840 
any damage and that's why I kind of like
the<00:01:04.559> weed<00:01:04.739> because<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.189> wii<00:01:05.339> has<00:01:05.580> those

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the weed because the wii has those

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.270 
the weed because the wii has those
little<00:01:06.150> nuances<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.049> xbox<00:01:07.320> 360<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.100> the

to<00:04:50.020> quickscope<00:04:50.560> or<00:04:50.770> user<00:04:51.039> secondary<00:04:51.729> or

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
to quickscope or user secondary or

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.089 
to quickscope or user secondary or
whatever<00:04:52.090> so<00:04:52.780> that's<00:04:52.900> what<00:04:53.139> I<00:04:53.169> think<00:04:53.439> makes<00:04:53.889> a

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
whatever so that's what I think makes a

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.219 
whatever so that's what I think makes a
good<00:04:54.129> sniper<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.789> dynamic<00:04:55.629> sniper<00:04:55.930> and

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
good sniper a dynamic sniper and

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.740 
good sniper a dynamic sniper and
appropriate<00:04:57.009> sniper<00:04:57.280> for<00:04:57.969> call<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.180> duty<00:04:58.599> and

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
appropriate sniper for call of duty and

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.080 
appropriate sniper for call of duty and
also<00:04:59.349> to<00:04:59.409> on<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.770> side<00:05:00.099> note<00:05:00.129> if<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.550> want<00:05:00.909> to
