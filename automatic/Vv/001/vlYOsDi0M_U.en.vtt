00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
section so that's when I actually

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.020 
section so that's when I actually
started<00:00:47.380> to<00:00:47.620> train<00:00:47.829> with<00:00:48.010> weights<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.850> thing

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
little while and hopefully we gave it

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.080 
little while and hopefully we gave it
that<00:03:41.110> way<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:44.760> haven't<00:03:45.760> had<00:03:45.850> any<00:03:46.000> problems

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
that way so I haven't had any problems

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.640 
that way so I haven't had any problems
this<00:03:46.510> time<00:03:46.570> around<00:03:47.700> for<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.790> fact<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.650> you

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
this time around for the fact that you

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.850 
this time around for the fact that you
learn<00:03:50.890> from<00:03:51.160> your<00:03:51.310> mistakes<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:52.750> find<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.800> you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
learn from your mistakes I find it you

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.070 
learn from your mistakes I find it you
know<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.160> every<00:03:54.730> time<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:54.940> die<00:03:55.120> it<00:03:55.300> gets<00:03:55.990> a

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
know it every time I die it gets a

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.350 
know it every time I die it gets a
little<00:03:56.200> easier<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.830> don't<00:03:57.610> want<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.790> say<00:03:57.910> easier

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
little easier I don't want to say easier

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.870 
little easier I don't want to say easier
in<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.570> diet<00:03:58.780> itself<00:03:59.280> it's<00:04:00.280> harder<00:04:00.640> cuz<00:04:00.760> you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
in the diet itself it's harder cuz you

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.449 
in the diet itself it's harder cuz you
know<00:04:01.060> what's<00:04:01.240> coming<00:04:01.770> but<00:04:02.770> for<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.040> fact<00:04:03.280> that

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
know what's coming but for the fact that

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.460 
know what's coming but for the fact that
you<00:04:03.670> you're<00:04:03.970> not<00:04:04.260> second-guessing<00:04:05.260> yourself

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
you you're not second-guessing yourself

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.520 
you you're not second-guessing yourself
you<00:04:05.920> know<00:04:06.310> what<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.700> expect<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.630> in<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.230> sense

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
you know what to expect so in that sense

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.040 
you know what to expect so in that sense
I<00:04:08.890> would<00:04:09.280> say<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.640> it's<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:10.600> hasn't<00:04:10.989> been

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
I would say that it's it hasn't been

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.660 
I would say that it's it hasn't been
harder<00:04:11.350> believe<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.130> or<00:04:12.190> not<00:04:12.340> when<00:04:12.580> I'm

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670
