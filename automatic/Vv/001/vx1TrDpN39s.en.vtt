00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
overlap it two inches I should be fine

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.830 
overlap it two inches I should be fine
now<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.280> know<00:01:51.549> my<00:01:51.970> machine<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.780> know

now because I know my machine and I know
that<00:01:53.290> it<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:54.509> will<00:01:55.509> leave<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:56.020> little<00:01:56.259> gap<00:01:56.680> I

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
that it it will leave a little gap I

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.090 
that it it will leave a little gap I
take<00:01:57.640> an<00:01:57.850> eighth<00:01:58.150> inch<00:01:58.420> off<00:01:58.900> so<00:01:59.590> if<00:01:59.890> you're

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
take an eighth inch off so if you're

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.010 
take an eighth inch off so if you're
starting<00:02:00.460> with<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.970> two-and-a-half<00:02:01.450> inch

binding take an eighth off the two and a

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.029 
binding take an eighth off the two and a
half<00:02:05.890> inches<00:02:06.790> which<00:02:07.450> would<00:02:07.750> be<00:02:08.049> two<00:02:08.769> and<00:02:08.979> a

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
half inches which would be two and a

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.339 
half inches which would be two and a
half<00:02:09.250> minus<00:02:09.789> 1/8<00:02:10.179> would<00:02:11.019> be<00:02:11.260> two<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:13.349> you

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
half minus 1/8 would be two and you

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.890 
half minus 1/8 would be two and you
would<00:02:14.500> overlap<00:02:14.980> at<00:02:15.190> two<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.760> 3/8<00:02:16.360> since

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
would overlap at two and 3/8 since

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.680 
would overlap at two and 3/8 since
of<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.230> two<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.769> half<00:02:18.030> again<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.060> started

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
of the two and a half again I started

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.350 
of the two and a half again I started
with<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.049> two<00:02:20.349> inch<00:02:20.709> binding<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:21.670> I'm<00:02:21.970> going

with the two inch binding so I'm going

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.009 
with the two inch binding so I'm going
to<00:02:22.390> overlap<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.400> seven-eighths<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.420> cut

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
to overlap one and seven-eighths and cut

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.440 
to overlap one and seven-eighths and cut
that<00:02:26.260> piece<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.650> top<00:02:27.280> piece<00:02:27.640> off

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
that piece that top piece off

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.850 
that piece that top piece off
so<00:02:29.370> here's<00:02:30.370> D<00:02:30.819> here's<00:02:30.900> my<00:02:31.900> bottom<00:02:32.110> binding

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
so here's D here's my bottom binding

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.030 
so here's D here's my bottom binding
here's<00:02:33.400> my<00:02:33.640> top<00:02:33.940> binding<00:02:34.540> I'm<00:02:35.049> gonna<00:02:35.379> overlap

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
here's my top binding I'm gonna overlap

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.339 
here's my top binding I'm gonna overlap
it<00:02:36.340> I'm<00:02:36.459> going<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.640> set<00:02:37.000> my<00:02:37.180> ruler<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:38.319> that

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
it I'm going to set my ruler so that

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.080 
it I'm going to set my ruler so that
it's<00:02:38.829> at<00:02:39.129> 1<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.019> 7/8<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.409> then<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.370> find<00:02:42.879> it

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
it's at 1 and 7/8 and then I find it

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.349 
it's at 1 and 7/8 and then I find it
easiest<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:45.120> pin<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:47.549> I'm<00:02:48.549> going<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.730> take<00:02:49.030> my

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
easiest to pin it I'm going to take my

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.110 
easiest to pin it I'm going to take my
pin<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:50.260> I'm<00:02:50.769> just<00:02:51.010> going<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.340> pin<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.910> with<00:02:52.090> a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
pin and I'm just going to pin it with a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.830 
pin and I'm just going to pin it with a
1<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.750> 7/8<00:02:53.819> this<00:02:54.819> is<00:02:54.970> kind<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.299> hard<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.540> do

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
1 and 7/8 this is kind of hard to do

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.400 
1 and 7/8 this is kind of hard to do
while<00:02:56.489> videotaping<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.900> I'm<00:02:58.959> going<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.170> lay

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
while videotaping it so I'm going to lay

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.500 
while videotaping it so I'm going to lay
it<00:02:59.590> down<00:02:59.620> and<00:03:00.129> see<00:03:00.459> if<00:03:02.819> if<00:03:03.819> I<00:03:04.000> can<00:03:04.209> get<00:03:04.359> that

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
it down and see if if I can get that

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.479 
it down and see if if I can get that
accurate<00:03:05.079> 1<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.940> 7/8<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.329> then<00:03:07.720> pin<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:09.220> the

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
accurate 1 and 7/8 and then pin just the

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.569 
accurate 1 and 7/8 and then pin just the
top<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> left<00:03:11.620> side<00:03:12.450> binding<00:03:14.310> once<00:03:15.310> I

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
top just the left side binding once I

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.660 
top just the left side binding once I
have<00:03:15.970> marked<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.200> then<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.709> can<00:03:18.129> go<00:03:18.280> ahead<00:03:18.310> and

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
have marked it then I can go ahead and

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.339 
have marked it then I can go ahead and
take<00:03:18.909> my<00:03:18.940> scissors<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.180> cut<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.660> straight

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
take my scissors and just cut a straight

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.890 
take my scissors and just cut a straight
edge<00:03:26.160> once<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.340> have<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.579> straight<00:03:28.060> edge<00:03:28.419> and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
edge once you have a straight edge and

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.589 
edge once you have a straight edge and
again<00:03:29.019> I've<00:03:29.560> overlapped<00:03:30.069> one<00:03:30.459> at<00:03:30.609> 7<00:03:31.030> 8<00:03:31.239> I'm

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
again I've overlapped one at 7 8 I'm

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.809 
again I've overlapped one at 7 8 I'm
going<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:32.169> open<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.919> left<00:03:33.250> side<00:03:34.500> lay<00:03:35.500> it

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
going to open the left side lay it

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.289 
going to open the left side lay it
horizontal<00:03:36.819> take<00:03:37.750> my<00:03:38.019> right<00:03:38.470> side<00:03:39.090> lay<00:03:40.090> it

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
horizontal take my right side lay it

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.650 
horizontal take my right side lay it
vertical<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:42.879> why<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.150> need<00:03:43.629> a

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
vertical and this is why you need a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.439 
vertical and this is why you need a
little<00:03:44.079> bit<00:03:44.379> of<00:03:44.709> a<00:03:44.980> distance<00:03:45.430> between<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.239> two

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
little bit of a distance between the two

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.759 
little bit of a distance between the two
because<00:03:47.109> it<00:03:47.260> does<00:03:47.500> get<00:03:47.739> cumbersome<00:03:48.519> I<00:03:49.769> am

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
because it does get cumbersome I am

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.530 
because it does get cumbersome I am
going<00:03:51.069> to<00:03:51.449> pin<00:03:52.449> that<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:52.930> place

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
going to pin that in place

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.500 
going to pin that in place
and<00:03:56.099> then<00:03:57.099> I'm<00:03:57.280> going<00:03:57.489> to<00:03:57.579> draw<00:03:57.879> a<00:03:57.910> line<00:03:58.209> from

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
and then I'm going to draw a line from

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.619 
and then I'm going to draw a line from
corner<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.019> corner<00:03:59.519> just<00:04:00.519> like<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:01.060> do<00:04:01.299> when

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
corner to corner just like you do when

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:28.660 
corner to corner just like you do when
you<00:04:01.810> join<00:04:02.079> your<00:04:02.379> strips

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.070 

just<00:04:29.360> corner<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.990> corner<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:32.330> I'm<00:04:32.450> using<00:04:32.690> my

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
just corner the corner and I'm using my

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.150 
just corner the corner and I'm using my
hair<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> marker<00:04:34.130> to<00:04:34.900> go<00:04:35.900> from<00:04:36.680> corner<00:04:36.980> to

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
hair a marker to go from corner to

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.550 
hair a marker to go from corner to
corner<00:04:37.600> now<00:04:38.600> I'm<00:04:38.690> going<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:38.930> be<00:04:39.080> stitching

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
corner now I'm going to be stitching

00:04:39.560 --> 00:05:05.049 
corner now I'm going to be stitching
right<00:04:40.040> on<00:04:40.340> top<00:04:40.670> of<00:04:40.940> that<00:04:41.120> line

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:05.059 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.689 

take<00:05:06.059> my<00:05:06.240> pens<00:05:06.599> out<00:05:06.929> and<00:05:07.229> before<00:05:07.409> I<00:05:07.770> cut<00:05:08.279> my

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
take my pens out and before I cut my

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.510 
take my pens out and before I cut my
waist<00:05:09.059> I'm<00:05:09.509> going<00:05:10.259> to<00:05:10.529> check<00:05:10.949> to<00:05:11.249> make<00:05:11.459> sure

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
waist I'm going to check to make sure

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.850 
waist I'm going to check to make sure
that<00:05:11.939> the<00:05:12.149> binding<00:05:12.659> is<00:05:12.839> going<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.289> lay<00:05:13.529> nice

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
that the binding is going to lay nice

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.149 
that the binding is going to lay nice
and<00:05:14.249> straight<00:05:14.789> and<00:05:15.089> it<00:05:16.020> sure<00:05:16.439> is<00:05:16.679> going<00:05:16.919> to<00:05:16.979> lay

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
and straight and it sure is going to lay

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.219 
and straight and it sure is going to lay
nice<00:05:17.429> and<00:05:17.669> straight<00:05:17.969> so<00:05:18.179> I<00:05:18.240> can<00:05:18.449> go<00:05:18.629> ahead<00:05:18.749> and

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
nice and straight so I can go ahead and

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.419 
nice and straight so I can go ahead and
cut<00:05:19.559> if<00:05:19.889> you<00:05:20.759> had<00:05:21.240> a<00:05:21.270> little<00:05:21.629> bulk<00:05:22.080> then<00:05:22.889> my

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:23.429 
cut if you had a little bulk then my

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:25.989 
cut if you had a little bulk then my
suggestion<00:05:23.999> would<00:05:24.300> be<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.539> take<00:05:25.080> your<00:05:25.379> strips

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:25.999 
suggestion would be to take your strips

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:28.969 
suggestion would be to take your strips
overlap<00:05:26.999> them<00:05:27.330> again<00:05:27.689> and<00:05:27.990> cut<00:05:28.740> another

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
overlap them again and cut another

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.299 
overlap them again and cut another
eighth<00:05:29.699> of<00:05:29.969> an<00:05:30.119> inch<00:05:30.300> sometimes<00:05:31.289> your<00:05:31.979> feed

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:32.309 
eighth of an inch sometimes your feed

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.109 
eighth of an inch sometimes your feed
dogs<00:05:32.339> and<00:05:33.089> your<00:05:33.479> presser<00:05:33.959> foot<00:05:34.339> will<00:05:35.339> not<00:05:35.610> work

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:36.119 
dogs and your presser foot will not work

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:39.139 
dogs and your presser foot will not work
together<00:05:36.539> and<00:05:37.139> it<00:05:37.409> it<00:05:37.769> slides<00:05:38.399> a<00:05:38.699> little<00:05:38.849> bit

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:39.149 
together and it it slides a little bit

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:41.600 
together and it it slides a little bit
more<00:05:39.479> than<00:05:39.749> it<00:05:39.959> should<00:05:39.990> and<00:05:40.709> that's<00:05:41.189> the

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
more than it should and that's the

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.889 
more than it should and that's the
reason<00:05:42.059> why<00:05:42.779> you<00:05:42.839> should<00:05:43.580> test<00:05:44.580> it<00:05:44.879> take<00:05:45.689> the

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:45.899 
reason why you should test it take the
