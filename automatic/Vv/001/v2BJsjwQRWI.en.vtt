the<00:02:53.340> rose<00:02:53.520> gold<00:02:53.760> own<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.209> got<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.510> one

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the rose gold own but I got this one

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.350 
the rose gold own but I got this one
like<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.260> don't<00:02:55.980> know<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.430> year<00:02:56.520> ago<00:02:56.880> or<00:02:57.209> two

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
like I don't know a year ago or two

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.230 
like I don't know a year ago or two
years<00:02:57.390> ago<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.750> don't<00:02:57.870> even<00:02:58.140> remember<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.850> I

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
years ago I don't even remember and so I

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.790 
years ago I don't even remember and so I
don't<00:03:00.480> think<00:03:00.630> they<00:03:00.780> had<00:03:00.930> rose<00:03:01.170> gold<00:03:01.410> then<00:03:01.560> but

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
don't think they had rose gold then but

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.730 
don't think they had rose gold then but
it's<00:03:02.730> technically<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.330> men's<00:03:03.690> watch<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.560> I

honestly I don't wear my watches that

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.729 
honestly I don't wear my watches that
much<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:30.900> because<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.170> live<00:03:31.440> where<00:03:31.620> it's

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
much just because I live where it's

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.500 
much just because I live where it's
really<00:03:31.890> hot<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.459> gets<00:03:32.640> sweaty<00:03:32.970> on<00:03:33.180> my<00:03:33.330> arm

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
really hot and it gets sweaty on my arm

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.600 
really hot and it gets sweaty on my arm
underneath<00:03:33.900> her<00:03:34.140> watches<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:34.800> I'm<00:03:35.040> super

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
underneath her watches so I'm super

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.040

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
and I just think a men's watch for fall

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.229 
and I just think a men's watch for fall
is<00:03:39.989> like<00:03:40.019> one<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.440> biggest<00:03:40.800> like<00:03:41.790> pieces
