ultrasound mammograms got biopsies done

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.980 
ultrasound mammograms got biopsies done
and<00:05:18.990> then<00:05:19.200> on<00:05:19.470> the<00:05:19.770> 13th<00:05:20.160> of<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.580> 3rd<00:05:20.760> 2013<00:05:21.750> -<00:05:21.960> I

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
and then on the 13th of the 3rd 2013 - I

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.950

it's a bit of a shock to the system to

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.760
