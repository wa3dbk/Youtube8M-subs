00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.719
 Hello my name is homeless and 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.679
 I would trust the first onslaught 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.329
 from Photoshop numbers 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.179
 Andy has never asked many videos 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.730
 for people who are really known Stuttgart dpa - Amanda Knox have immediately 

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:23.019
 to do as well 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.859
 find enough of the window and the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.390
 like no more desire 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.539
 because it is still under parole 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.470
 Sticking to Photoshop residence 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.329
 so 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.160
 I work with Photoshop cs4 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.350
 I do not know but a stripping wire 3/2 harder us 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.000
 but basically it is so that the work surface is not there 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.170
 really with attractive option 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.070
 that is, they really have 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.320
 but team boss Jean Todt 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.820
 This is how the labor market expert lets the art work with the work area 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.420
 Press contact Mrs. 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.730
 there are all photos license but also maximized is refinished 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.290
 the next and the most important is the better classed in the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.060
 State have by the way 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.390
 then all tools are in it 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.470
 For this photo editing also the directly with the mouse »broadcast 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.120
 can be 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.160
 generated as a brush or BIZ exit 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.210
 they are not anymore 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.670
 Konrad again said Marco Kohne 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.070
 then, of course, could be crude 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.120
 in gripping or selling times monitor Tabbert Zugzwang Horizon 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.740
 comes the outdoor unit pack unit 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.850
 but all that does not betray them and that is can be seen here 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.810
 one left 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.420
 and that's fine 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.359
 Initially, Options is production areas 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.890
 that is here 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.770
 by Gisbert relative options 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.770
 the option pretty much on how big the tool will be 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.000
 or 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.370
 the areas might hope for that 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.150
 or in the rails 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.200
 Mode water repellent Tip 1 Mode will not come later talk 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.160
 opel cars wide 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.500
 later to the 12th 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.850
 the next one is the one 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.160
 It looks like we have almost everything I know then that really 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.919
 serious 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.029
 that feels with me and then i have all the dax values ​​filed the 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.379
 Standard Photoshop are not meeting 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.789
 because they are important to me and often by bike 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.869
 I can normally reach the windows 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:26.529
 and not all windows about Schmidt 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:31.319
 At any rate, tools that are normally not open are not 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.739
 at the pole arrangement 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.849
 That's how the Ticino train journey demands and just open this window 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.849
 Frank tree 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.849
 and as it really needs sites hoping for 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.159
 Minimize Qantas 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.419
 Dock year 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.569
 then she picked her up over the border 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.119
 you can do the SZ two word by word 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.119
 according to mine 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.709
 another photo 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.979
 while in the format 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:05.319
 would have just made a very good cut around the relapse rates 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.209
 distributed over the house 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.789
 that does not work 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:14.119
 or not always in its deadline 2 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.959
 This works mostly in the report photo Thomas RUTTKE is led 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:18.489
 always 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.489
 Leoben 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.489
 that enlivens selection 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.159
 to attack over and up to 4000 jobs Billy talent participated 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.919
 but not 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.839
 the outdoor area circled work we would like to process 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.219
 is here 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.219
 Tractors 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:38.089
 10 candidate was 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:39.669
 claps by default 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:42.239
 and he points here marked 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.510
 October what we just see what we are experiencing is already taken 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.099
 but there is also little use 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.049
 on icy roads 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.780
 Here I suddenly saw that I would like to exercise Thomas Kress 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:56.099
 I am this 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.099
 This window is already on the game 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:02.229
 that can be up to us 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:06.519
 according to what I think of the calculator or even how big the picture is different 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.149
 in Hartenstein most dodgy other ex-partners had 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.409
 Edit very large files you can ever go to the starting point 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.959
 but in the heels 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.439
 the next thing from the evening the four mentioned the St 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.730
 the most important handed as a landlady 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.090
 With 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.020
 Photoshop work 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.210
 Of course this must have been fortunate in front of their clients and it has remained 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.599
 Look in through the brothers over it 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.659
 times as a brother and sister works on this slide 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.409
 but not in the picture directly 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.699
 you could perhaps edit a film role in Kästners 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.520
 without these two things influencing each other 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.680
 and you can just just the old ones 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.249
 mix here 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:58.620
 or who also influence Ierapetra Sprints adopted fiercely 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.620
 could yes suit with the force I can govern that 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.680
 the code of honor 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.879
 stated 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.879
 Xamax has convinced us many topics labor market 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.810
 and 2 that will subsequently become Beton's mine too 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.900
 really cool effect or working hours are 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.620
 in the many of her work 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.120
 also the next vice-premier normal as well as restaurants 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.860
 Berlin - can work with Ross Nachterstedt I have something about the 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.050
 search function 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.400
 he has a lot of brainwork, I can make her hope to death 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.419
 And some of them had it 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.249
 ensures the drive 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:42.249
 the shift schedules record days that now lives still victims 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.759
 That's how I started right now 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.219
 10 15 the bank did not end 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:53.969
 Fact is these levels in Hoetmar I can still work sometimes lower 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.469
 Norbert Röttgen Ortner 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.749
 what you handed her 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:03.499
 knew too is known 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:05.509
 as Lily's visibility 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:07.589
 after some strong old 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:10.789
 With his critique of the experts, it is extremely demanding 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:13.879
 the report something I 15 0 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.259
 you can go to Cape Town 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.259
 but that will have faced the fundamental world of work 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.770
 I just hope a little helped 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.449
 if it continues like last 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.770
 in the middle of the Coeur BMW on types » 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.449
 Though all life's special tools 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:31.710
 on the selection of factory
