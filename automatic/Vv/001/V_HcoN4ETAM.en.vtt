00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
it over your head I do that all the time

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.130 
it over your head I do that all the time
it<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.520> really<00:00:20.930> effective<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.020> creating

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
it it's really effective in creating

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.040 
it it's really effective in creating
space<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> first<00:00:23.100> match<00:00:23.480> is<00:00:24.480> against<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
space but the first match is against a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.540 
space but the first match is against a
team<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.320> from<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> Dutch<00:00:26.010> league<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.369> I'm

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
team that from the Dutch league that I'm

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.820 
team that from the Dutch league that I'm
not<00:00:26.760> familiar<00:00:26.939> with<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.630> all<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.529> not

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
not familiar with at all I do not

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.230 
not familiar with at all I do not
recognize<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.340> name<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.609> means<00:00:29.730> nothing<00:00:29.939> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
recognize the name it means nothing to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.749 
recognize the name it means nothing to
me<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.929> usually<00:00:31.769> that's<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.099> good<00:00:32.309> sign<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.520> me

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
me so usually that's a good sign for me

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.670 
me so usually that's a good sign for me
because<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.149> means<00:00:33.390> they're<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:34.110> top

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
because it means they're not a very top

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.830 
because it means they're not a very top
team<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:35.489> means<00:00:35.790> cold<00:00:36.180> jerk<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.660> just

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
team and which means cold jerk in just

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.569 
team and which means cold jerk in just
Bank<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.230> few<00:00:37.260> goals<00:00:37.620> or<00:00:37.860> assists<00:00:38.160> or<00:00:38.309> whatever

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
Bank a few goals or assists or whatever

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.580 
Bank a few goals or assists or whatever
against<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.840> was<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> case

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
against them but this was not the case

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.520 
against them but this was not the case
the<00:00:41.219> chances<00:00:41.730> were<00:00:41.879> very<00:00:42.210> even<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.780> very

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the chances were very even and very

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
the chances were very even and very
little<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.040> match<00:00:44.219> ended<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.090> end<00:00:45.210> of

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
little in this match ended the end of
