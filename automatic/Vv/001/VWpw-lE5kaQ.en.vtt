00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
much so you don't have to be worried

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.270 
much so you don't have to be worried
about<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:43.050> it's<00:01:43.200> undercooked<00:01:43.710> or<00:01:44.039> anything

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
about if it's undercooked or anything

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.029 
about if it's undercooked or anything
like<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:45.470> when<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.560> sear<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.009> lamb

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
like that and when you sear the lamb

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.100 
like that and when you sear the lamb
basically<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> flavor<00:01:48.149> stays<00:01:48.330> inside<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
basically the flavor stays inside the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.609 
basically the flavor stays inside the
meat<00:01:49.259> after<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:50.149> you<00:01:51.149> cook<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.509> long<00:01:51.899> time<00:01:52.140> so

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
meat after that you cook it long time so

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.550 
meat after that you cook it long time so
the<00:01:52.920> flavor<00:01:53.190> is<00:01:53.429> inside<00:01:53.789> it<00:01:54.000> won't<00:01:54.179> go<00:01:54.300> out

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
the flavor is inside it won't go out

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.260 
the flavor is inside it won't go out
okay<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.649> basically<00:01:55.920> called<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.819> close<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
okay so basically called you close the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.460 
okay so basically called you close the
holes<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.670> was<00:01:59.940> seared<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.050> also

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
holes so now this was seared and also
