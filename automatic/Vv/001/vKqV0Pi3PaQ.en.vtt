 equipped with two cost processors 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.000
 working in parallel simona not as a starting point a great one 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.429
 quantity of guitar models historical amplifiers 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.779
 it is therefore a world that allows us to add effects 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.099
 audio notified to the low hey thanks to the optional father tour to work 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.260
 as a pc to midi converter 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.150
 the big central display 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.850
 allows us to be able to access graphically both on the call of the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.760
 chosen on the modification of the parameters 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.410
 the two sections of the underlying cosmos are updated according to tressette 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.750
 recalled potentiometer baranzate allows you to balance are the two 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.690
 processors 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.690
 on the right we find the general parameters section 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.250
 including the commission verifying powers 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.810
 require iphone controllers 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.470
 or check the pc 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.680
 Pietro's 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.680
 a parameter a TV signal 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.130
 the same. cortemilia also through 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.510
 you p. 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
 positioned on the left for pisapia 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.190
 nuclear safety 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.460
 here it is called 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.020

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.020
 Pietrosanti 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.420
 we modify the channels 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.320
 starting maybe already model dg starcraft low synthesis we want imola 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.030
 then kind of amplifiers we want to use
