 chemical chin thousand creator of the franchise has a violent image 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.870

 besides resident evil he is famous for dino crisis quiles 7 vanquish and 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.820
 coming soon sadous of the damned 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.670
 However, before entering this trend, his 16-bit creations were 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.950
 very different 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.820
 he was working in disney games and as his own voice lavin 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.910
 so when he had the opportunity to create a new game for the in that 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.390
 then powerful and new playstation a range of opportunities 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.920
 it opened 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.210
 -construction of nightmares 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.180
 the 32 bits of playstation in addition to displaying 3d graphics had a 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.840
 enviable capacity with its format the cd that allowed him to store video and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.300
 voice performances 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.420
 with this potential mikami preferred to focus on older audiences 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.500
 In the beginning this project was a fps but it happened not long before 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.920
 change the concept 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.050
 The main inspirations were alone in the dark and sweet young 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.660
 the latter especially keeps many similarities with the final result 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.779
 sweet jones a capcom rpg that was released in 1989 and is based on a 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.459
 movie of the same name 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.719
 in it a group of five researchers enter a mansion in search of a 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.340
 cool 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 but when the sow enters mysteriously it closes and they get caught in the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.139
 haunted Mansion 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.649
 it sounds familiar 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.499
 the theme of the cursed mansion the fighters 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.189
 that each character has different abilities 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.180
 the limited inventory system and even the animations where the door is 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.669
 slowly opens a clever way to disguise the loading screens in 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.579
 resident evil were taken directly to tr t get it just came out 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.409
 in Japan 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.499
 they are so similar that it was rumored that resident evil was going to be a ring and its 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.649
 former 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:02.019
 shinji mikami could not just mix sweet jovi alone in the dark and 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.869
 throw it at the launch of the plan and station 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:09.029
 his biggest ambition was graphic resident evil had to be one of the titles 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.719
 most impressive graphically speaking 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.069
 to achieve it used backgrounds pretended sides mixed with 3d characters 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.829
 and until veronica code were preserved this type of funds 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.799
 the main enemies were replaced by zombies 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.759
 this by the influence of ribbons york rosemary 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.959
 the transformation of humans to these creatures was by an epidemic by 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.109
 what his creation took the name of biohazard although for its launch 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.389
 American and other regions changed to resident evil 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:41.689
 the story of the first was simple 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.079
 one of the rescue groups of being the alpha team was in search of 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.109
 disappeared that they have bravo which were lost in the outskirts of raccoon city 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.299
 while investigating cases of suspected cannibalism 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.969
 resident evil is one of the most influential franchises 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.280
 in the forest some strange creatures attack the alpha team so they flee and 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.939
 they find refuge in a mansion 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.699
 several of the members are lost and the exit is clogged with dogs 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:10.439
 fined 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.689
 so the remaining members stay in the mansion to look 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:14.409
 information 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.099
 to the missing members 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.209
 a way out 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.639
 and above all survive 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.830
 from the start of the game you could choose a character 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.699
 cris I mean jill valentine both with different abilities but being 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.039
 honest it was easier to finish it with jit because I was a teacher to force 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.509
 locks and had a gun from the start unlike kristen fish ando 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.659
 I only had a knife 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:42.930
 but even with Jill this was a walk in the park because they invented a new 

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:43.809
 gender 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:48.090
 survival horror that consists of giving you a limited amount of ammunition and 

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:51.580
 healing items for the player to feel vulnerable and easier 

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:54.669
 create an environment conducive to fear 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.919
 with everything and the performances of voice and liberec are laughable resident evil was 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.319
 It was not long before he was transferred to Sega Saturn and PC 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.759
 epidemic 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.169
 it was no surprise when the next resident evil was announced 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.039
 but what was raised several tiles was when shinji mikami decided to return to 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.740
 start the development of the game when the first version of resident evil 2 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.159
 it was close to being finished 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.159
 this abortion was called resident evil 1 points 5 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.069
 still not far from the formula of the original 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.059
 Resident Evil 2 is considered one of the best entries in the series 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.819
 and his greatest achievement is having compressed all the material and entering it into a 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:35.819
 cartridge 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.410
 Resident Evil 2 was also released for Nintendo 64 and even better 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.409
 graphics that in the PC and playstation versions 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.419
 code veronica the title would continue the history of crisi claire redfield 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.970
 and resident evil 3 memes are developed at par and few years 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.300
 then resident evil zero arrived 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.990
 they all told different events that took place in very different times 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.490
 different even the 0 told what happened before the first game but what 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.889
 they had all in common was that they kept the same formula 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:06.780
 gameplay 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.580
 however resident evil 4 would be a rebound would influence the games of 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.580
 action forever 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.009
 up to here the first part of the resident evil story 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.889
 wait for the next greetings to all 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.889
 see you later 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.060
 age
