than ipad air 2 that I use as my main

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.370 
than ipad air 2 that I use as my main
computer<00:03:05.850> seriously<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:07.270> can<00:03:07.570> do<00:03:07.750> even<00:03:08.050> more

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
computer seriously this can do even more

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.270 
computer seriously this can do even more
and<00:03:09.070> it<00:03:09.490> decent<00:03:10.090> more<00:03:10.810> expensive<00:03:11.650> if<00:03:11.830> you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
and it decent more expensive if you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.310 
and it decent more expensive if you
compare<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.120> Opera<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.690> with<00:03:14.290> a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
compare it to the Opera to with a

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.550 
compare it to the Opera to with a
keyboard<00:03:14.800> case<00:03:15.310> because<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:17.080> has<00:03:17.530> a

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
keyboard case because this has a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.920 
keyboard case because this has a
keyboard<00:03:17.980> built<00:03:18.550> into<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.210> device<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.900> have

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
keyboard built into the device you have

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.500 
keyboard built into the device you have
to<00:03:20.530> compare<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.190> an<00:03:21.430> ipad<00:03:21.880> with<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> keyboard

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
to compare it to an ipad with a keyboard

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.030 
to compare it to an ipad with a keyboard
case<00:03:23.020> so<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.310> is<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.520> really<00:03:24.940> nice<00:03:25.600> device<00:03:26.380> to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
case so this is a really nice device to

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.370 
case so this is a really nice device to
stop<00:03:27.370> complaining<00:03:28.150> about<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.840> personally

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
stop complaining about it and personally

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.130 
stop complaining about it and personally

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
so on so maybe we'll do an experiment

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.340 
so on so maybe we'll do an experiment
and<00:03:44.500> try<00:03:44.740> to<00:03:44.860> see<00:03:45.220> if<00:03:45.640> this<00:03:46.120> device<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.840> better
