 Keyboard size is the greater of 4 seconds of, I'm a little bit country a moderate shift 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.480
 4 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.470
 I do not even know there's a time when I can not live with this kind of thing . 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.540
 What is the most 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.540

 Each is real , spread out in the morning , 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.450

 Butge a bit long in the shoe, but bosyeoyo Ah Sin Enchanter contributor 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.120
 You see the power button in the upper part. 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:26.110
 I go to the button and the voice actor. 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.650
 There's one thing I can do to see this poisonous poison. 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.060
 Whether this is a micro sd terminal 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.510
 The East Sea has a volume control section. 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.860
 It has a right earphone jack portion 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.860
 I do not have this part, just a pair of rubber feet and two speakers. 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:52.480
 If you look to the left, the start button is usually the bottom part of the screen looks a little different 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:59.830
 It's from the beginning to hypnosis 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:02.860
 And cover up to usb 3.0 terminal and hdmi perth tournament 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.490
 There is a html terminal. 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:12.930
 During the mountain climbing, I put the topper and made it possible for me to go when I needed it. 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:18.930
 There is a transparent terminal, and the keyboard does not look like a fighter. 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:22.710
 The keyboard looks a little unusual, just a simple Bluetooth keyboard, not a bit 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:28.440
 The challenge is to have a lot of functionality now 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:32.820
 Such products yieotneundeyo determined product word is all three look after the Bluetooth 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.410
 I chose more branches, so I connected the three beeps, 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.540
 You can put it on your favorite part if you want. 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.340
 When you pick three tablets, 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:50.760
 That's all I'm going to be selected in the barracks and bars on tha one escape keyboard 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.990
 So I came to the city with the convenience of two cities two colors three pc 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.450
 Burning 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:59.940
 Bluetooth can also be peeled zest and the Dwarf both jaws can express anything but 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.550
 If you push the Ordos, it will progress. 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.630
 And my good point is, 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.350
 The comparison is thin, light and touchpad 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.350
 Most of them were not burned. 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.350
 Ah 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.830
 That's good. 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.400
 Or in 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.730
 If you put on another hat and represent it, it will be theater team. 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.139

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.710
 5 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.210
 When those who top the highs for the actual law is already so obscure come up 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.639
 Maybe. 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:05:01.120
 This is when you need face with all Thai eh eh left and tablet Source 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:05.470
 Also, I can paste it even if I have a kibo chart . 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.520
 It can be quite inconvenient to carry a keyboard . 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.600
 What Professor prying apart a little could go out this gets put aside the two terminals 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.979
 It's cumbersome. 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:19.900
 I am attached to the cognitive part. 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:22.630
 How did it go like this? 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:27.760
 Bouncing 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:31.300
 This is the same as that seen many tablet terminal charges are charging terminal 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.180
 The two are so identical that I plug them in. 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.210
 I'm going to charge 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:42.670
 I have to give you a little something . 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:47.770
 And this is exactly the same. 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:52.300
 Three balls can be enough again. I have two charging terminals. 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:55.990
 That's why I 'm supposed to make a few generations of sleep . 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.840
 Would result in thicker parts are also two little off dementia now does such a part 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.480
 I think I've got a few songs to do.
