 vision 8 but yes don't care I'll just go 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.649

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.090
 bad in a way alone and it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.469
 team is really sick paul in minute 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.450

 the ball didn't even go there altogether 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.460
 say situation familiar 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.320
 oxlade-chamberlain of course still 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.869
 his chic goals from the previous episode 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.440

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.750
 my mouth 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.180
 you say perfectly what i thought is one thing 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.540
 certainly a goal in the air 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.580
 after all these chances and here he is 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.740
 striker made an oh and I'm not going 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.750
 This series is about teaching wisely 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.460
 yes it is almost unbelievable I understand 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.920
 nothing there either because but tendon is not 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.020
 everett almost everything but casola 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.540
 equally wold gps but it has one 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.160
 beautiful velvet staircase and lays it like that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.200
 down to about tern 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.580
 for the 2 0 the very last minute of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.320
 the game comes through again 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.420
 with her he saw us filming no 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.610
 division shoots beautifully within this 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:06.630
 is really a fancy goal but at your is 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:08.700
 nothing can really be done if necessary 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.400
 just two points and oil promotion 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.710
 yoga new this in full throttle for that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.230
 title unfortunately as a press and contract 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.180
 Expired after and then 200 coins total 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.580
 for a contract for perry yes sorry 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.770

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.160
 kwl comes in and then we find this 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.440
 opponent fuck that's just one 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.860
 team with quite a lot of bad luck and it looks 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.780
 it really looks really good it's a big one 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.640
 known that we are midget through relics 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.650

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.830
 and yeah yeah I knew our pian small 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.230
 but at first I did n't know that dima was 183 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.330
 That is really pretty good for the keeper 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.070
 small if you are clear then just 8 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.989
 centimeters tall that there is neck but still 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.680
 that is always possible at will small in my 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.440
 u20 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.489

 yes prank at least I thought so 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.040
 the last moment I think of that guy 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.780
 suddenly sees him correct for himself 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.310
 i could sit there on it could in fifa 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.810
 but a goal out in the air 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.340
 and 2 minutes later 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.099

 fast players and if they do a little 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.500

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.780
 yes dance to your source on perma 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.580

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.670
 and then you 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.230
 yeah fucking pretty goal I had that too 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.360
 the same thing should be done so honestly 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.910

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.480
 not for nothing the best goalie of the game 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.069
 the workload to score against this 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.660
 but guys what you are going to see now is 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.459
 maybe play football 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.599
 one of the nicest goal I see makes it 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.269
 goes so fast 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.379
 tap tap tap everyone is free and deeds 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.049

 u22 they end up with a great final score 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.079
 I sometimes didn't shoot him anymore 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.120
 then this man but your hero knows his team 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.690
 just made me fucking smart like me 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.519
 it also do something about it 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.019
 it's all about the tendon and yes he 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.090
 she uses tactics also it's all about 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.250
 the tendon and if you have tactics and your team with 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.570
 you then notice what master is incredibly good 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.950
 yes he makes the team where it alone 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.660
 but can run with it and then you go there 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.370
 just more and yes that is what I am too 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.260

 bring in a dot and then we play 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.400
 again very standard against such a fucking 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.930
 bpl team which is way too expensive for the 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.760
 vision 8 but if you have a minute 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.130
