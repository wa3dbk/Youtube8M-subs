well this is the chlorine Genie unit as

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.080 
well this is the chlorine Genie unit as
you<00:00:06.720> can<00:00:06.839> see<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.890> unit<00:00:08.250> looks<00:00:08.460> very<00:00:08.790> similar

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
water that same submerged cell while

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.920 
water that same submerged cell while
it's<00:03:03.550> separating<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.120> sodium<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.690> chloride
