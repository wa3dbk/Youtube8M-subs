00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:19.900
 Hi there, this video blog 1 we are talking 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:20.619
 about our release today we will 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.020
 sample 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.939
 the same kind of beer on which 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.259
 produced in completely different places 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.580
 of our planet in this case we have 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.699
 a representative from our standard 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.910
 Gordon for 60 rubles something 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:40.870
 roll with us hiring bakey and at the same time 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.840
 we found his younger brother need you u 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.520
 older on the car only in size 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.930
 the bottom line is that this is 03 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.600
 a jar worth as much as 135 this kind of beer 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.949
 occurred in the village of hoegaarden in 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.899
 of flanders in 1465 when he was brewed in 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.870
 monastery when much at all here 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.180
 two monasteries were founded this year 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.420
 territory and then he began to use 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.460
 a furious success that is to say was very 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.790
 popular not only in that environment but also 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.110
 surrounding how to tell lands and then 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:20.530
 already closer how to say 20 years hoegaarden 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.689
 the plant as which it was produced was 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.229
 bought by him a run from then on naturally 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.390
 flour where there is of course a plant in europe 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:33.180
 which outputs it produces this 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.920
 dear him tell likelihood 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.460
 let's compare expensive analog 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.869
 european beer and our russian 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.869
 information about this beer is some 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.259
 it is written that you need to try it 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.740
 necessarily in 6 faceted glass to 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.400
 hens 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.200
 and the temperature of the drink should be 23 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.090
 degrees no more then you can 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.490
 feel it real tastes we have it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.360
 went very strong even now hid 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.190
 ice so to speak the surface of the bottle then 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.190
 there is in my department very, very much 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:22.820
 the way we gryadochki the way 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:28.610
 did it yourself review here really bush 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:31.610
 the main thing is that it tastes better than this beer 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.800
 principle when it's icy refreshing 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.470
 nice but when i tried both 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.000
 looks like nothing strictly on beer 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.730
 walk around density is not there 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.880
 she has a rather thin orange taste 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.980
 felt and saldana taste that you are me 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.480
 no bright taste principle when you do it 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.710
 first ready to do and take well 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.830
 feel and then when you him 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.610
 have a little look 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.990
 I feel bad I honestly was 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.680
 him a worse opinion 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.490
 I have not heard many complaints in principle 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.490
 very nothing 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.850
 we put the end let's try 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.950
 European version of this beer which 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.920
 very praises it was not very 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.060
 just find firstly it costs 400 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.920
 rubles almost per liter and sells some 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.660
 specialized stores I already 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.440
 because my father really loves 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.440
 hoegaarden 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.820
 so to say a real sample and that 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.380
 there is no better beer than even external comparison 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.250
 hoegaarden and our and imported but 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.310
 immediately visible 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.850
 he is yellow greenish tinged and he 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.950
 transparent skin appeared even though I 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.870
 poured very neatly she is very tight 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:06.940
 and the death of the bubbles is right for you 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.250
 coriander wheat is all felt 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.130
 previous report 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:17.520
 she gave herself to alcohol of course with alcohol 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.520
 try these 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.320
 it is very tasty very very very 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.690
 tender let's say there will be just I think 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.490
 that this is one of the most gentle blunted 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.910
 which I blood was there is no pain 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.080
 chunchon all the flesh comes in very tasty 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.770
 really do not correctly say that 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.880
 it needs to be used only when we 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.760
 ice is just 23 degrees because 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:52.530
 no wonder he is called a cold heart 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:54.630
 principle of my former succession is delicious 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.669
 beer but for now i want to say i was 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.320
 a little surprised that when i try 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.840
 she was watery the same as 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.620
 the first to look for a sample I thought she was 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.970
 will be much more dense so she 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.960
 almost more watery than 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.680
 previous version but it's me down to that 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.800
 it's bad 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:19.639
 so to say his feature is very light 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:23.190
 nice, let's rate 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:26.370
 we like Russian 6 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.970
 points he is in principle quite good he is nothing 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:34.229
 so it does not repel 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:38.039
 but weakly vasenka a version of foreign 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:41.900
 uganda pleased me nicely and 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:44.820
 it deserves 8 in half points 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.599
 drink only good with you was peace in 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.599
 bye everyone
