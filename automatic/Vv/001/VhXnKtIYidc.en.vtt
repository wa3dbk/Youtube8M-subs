00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
some dimension and it does look much

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.340 
some dimension and it does look much
better<00:00:41.820> when<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.210> start<00:00:42.450> adding<00:00:42.629> blush<00:00:43.079> and

things but I just wanted to show you the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.170 
things but I just wanted to show you the
raw<00:00:46.160> blending<00:00:47.160> capabilities<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.059> these

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
raw blending capabilities of these

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.010 
raw blending capabilities of these
colors<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.000> other<00:00:54.030> thing<00:00:54.329> too<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.570> is

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
colors and the other thing too is is

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.900 
colors and the other thing too is is
with<00:00:55.260> these<00:00:55.440> colors<00:00:55.829> obviously<00:00:55.949> each<00:00:56.460> time

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
with these colors obviously each time

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.670 
with these colors obviously each time
you<00:00:57.180> layer<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.449> down<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.559> bit

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you layer it down it's a little bit

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.130 
you layer it down it's a little bit
darker<00:00:59.160> even<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.059> same<00:01:00.480> color<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> you're

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
darker even the same color that you're

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.950 
darker even the same color that you're
using<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.600> over<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
using so I'm not going to go over the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.270 
using so I'm not going to go over the
center<00:01:04.260> because<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> don't<00:01:04.619> want<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.979> be<00:01:05.100> any

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
center because I don't want it to be any

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.440 
center because I don't want it to be any
darker<00:01:06.229> but<00:01:07.369> by<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.670> around<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> edges<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
darker but by going around the edges you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.980 
darker but by going around the edges you
can<00:01:09.600> actually<00:01:10.530> achieve<00:01:11.119> some<00:01:12.119> data<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.510> if<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
can actually achieve some data so if I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
can actually achieve some data so if I
show<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.590> go<00:01:13.710> back<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:13.950> 11<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.760> you'll

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
show you if I go back with 11 and you'll

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.490 
show you if I go back with 11 and you'll
see<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.390> will<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.720> even<00:01:16.049> darker<00:01:16.259> again

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
see that this will get even darker again

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.600 
see that this will get even darker again
so<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:20.009> achieve<00:01:21.350> different<00:01:22.350> levels<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
so you can achieve different levels of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.870 
so you can achieve different levels of
just<00:01:24.390> two<00:01:24.659> colors<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.340> back<00:01:26.460> over

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
just two colors and just going back over

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
just two colors and just going back over
and<00:01:27.240> over<00:01:27.479> itself<00:01:28.189> of<00:01:29.189> course<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.850> be

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and over itself of course you have to be

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.960 
and over itself of course you have to be
careful<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:31.159> don't<00:01:32.159> go<00:01:32.369> too<00:01:32.430> far<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
careful that you don't go too far and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
careful that you don't go too far and
then<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.720> can't<00:01:33.960> blend<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> paper

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
then you can't blend on the paper

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:45.710 
then you can't blend on the paper
anymore<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.479> go<00:01:42.659> okay<00:01:43.649> next<00:01:44.720> we've

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
anymore and there you go okay next we've

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
anymore and there you go okay next we've
got<00:01:46.130> D<00:01:47.130> 15<00:01:50.689> like<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.079> my<00:01:52.740> base<00:01:52.979> color<00:01:53.340> being

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
got D 15 like so my base color being

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
got D 15 like so my base color being
very<00:01:54.240> quick<00:01:54.659> because<00:01:54.810> I've<00:01:55.020> only<00:01:55.170> got<00:01:55.409> ten

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
here just so we can see that she does

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.540 
here just so we can see that she does
have<00:03:27.640> all<00:03:27.820> its<00:03:28.030> skin<00:03:30.270> just<00:03:31.270> like<00:03:31.600> so<00:03:32.190> okay<00:03:33.190> and

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
to the color that I'm achieving as well

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:39.450 
to the color that I'm achieving as well
there's<00:05:38.860> all<00:05:39.159> these<00:05:39.400> different

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
there's all these different

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.879 
there's all these different
possibilities<00:05:39.969> and<00:05:40.750> what<00:05:41.199> you're<00:05:41.349> seeing<00:05:41.590> on

possibilities and what you're seeing on

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.100 
possibilities and what you're seeing on
the<00:05:42.069> computer<00:05:42.699> might<00:05:43.270> be<00:05:43.419> different<00:05:43.779> to<00:05:43.900> what

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
the computer might be different to what
