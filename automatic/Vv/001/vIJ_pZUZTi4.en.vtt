00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello everyone guys and now I have 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.089
 map appeared so to say 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.240
 aunty 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:15.150
 well this is a colonel I will say this but it 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.289
 a scribe of some but you have something that 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.199
 normal and the feeling that I'm all 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.560
 clan doing this is now on Aunt Motya 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.260
 passage because accounting is cruel all 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.359
 brutally this teacher damage and another plus 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.719
 to all that really delivers 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.880
 big problems because of him 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.790
 shitty health increases them and damage 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.629
 rocket launchers but it's just an epic 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.010
 it's hard 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.960
 I will say this is the first such went to the mountains 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.530
 bazookas on the right destroyed 5 defs and realized 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.370
 that not even 5 a4 defo and destroyed by 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 right side and i will say so that were 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.420
 but then I just met a squall hurricane 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.960
 my bazooka mountains here just went out 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.760
 This option guys do not roll 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.740
 let me show you how it was all in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.850
 a bird telling you just need one 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:20.720
 see again and you will understand it yourself 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.729
 she is the first attack they are all released 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.220
 blunted leaks forgot what they have here 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.250
 life wagons and realized that this is not 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:35.280
 worth let out his small army and 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.610
 damn it's just life trying to distract but 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.710
 for a long time this was not enough 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.670
 just here here these laser 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.799
 life guns under 80 thousand well this 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:54.210
 unreal cool it's straight tin 2 and so 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:58.049
 it finally can crust I blunted I call that is 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.810
 you attacked too everything that is attacked by 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.130
 Specific here I kill lasers with 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.829
 and are aware that as it is not so but 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.899
 shells when he could save and I decided 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.269
 go out 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.349
 all the same, I did without booster under boost 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.849
 I think it would be more awesome 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:21.650
 I blunted out and then realizing that 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.370
 I simply leaked the second attack 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.829
 without manta 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:30.650
 that is, I ended up with just two attacks 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:32.420
 in fact and here it is the second attack I am no longer 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.400
 began to bother and because i'm here 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.950
 I definitely won’t win 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.700
 points to get one of 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.739
 spare parts 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.560
 I just threw out warriors and shows under 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.639
 pick up a little points but I will say this 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.489
 warriors are 18 years old and I understood how this 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:55.639
 the base is dismantled by three such warriors 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:59.780
 the base can not be disassembled so here 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:02.620
 headache what's up there i am under the fog 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.389
 prokrasa to headquarters 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.400
 Of course, all this is under a wild boost 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:10.480
 need to do because without thickly here 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.299
 exactly nothing prokanaet and under boost 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.699
 once gray headquarters by three attacks i think 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:22.519
 it is real if it fly into and 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:25.819
 throw shock or stockings to be treated I 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.010
 I think that it may have been but all the same 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.150
 Of course it will be sad if at least one 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.859
 of these attacks fail all 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.370
 we can say that this is aunt motya 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.709
 pass well damn I do not know supercell 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.599
 muddied some topic 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.229
 I will say this with these attacks I edita 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.109
 pissed off anyone but 500 1000 gold and for sure 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:51.549
 pissed ie supercell does 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:54.349
 forcing us for the sake of these new guns 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.650
 spend a bunch of a bunch of resources that is 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:00.650
 your gold a lot of time plus everything 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.409
 they can be said alluding to the fact that 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.079
 you need to do everything under boost and you of course 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.720
 do you do under thick leave and from where 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.729
 get you won't attack without 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.010
 beads on such a base, I understand that you are here 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:15.560
 just did not do it you will have to 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.479
 spend more time on this game 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.239
 everything is so thought out to the smallest detail 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.620
 have you anyway and so play 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.010
 your 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.650
 even more than before so guys here 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.120
 think for yourself 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.150
 should you keep playing you beat 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.150
 as further everything is harder to you these 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.449
 spare parts for any need here by the way 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.550
 Blunted it would be necessary if I the second 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:44.380
 I would still attack I would get though 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:47.800
 to me here 300000 Dublin it would be 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.600
 at least some sense is realized 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.260
 so to tell them materialized 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.020
 Means of Music is the one part that is 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.120
 I do not need to at least something in 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.039
 labs are set up from this lab 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.520
 gone 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:07.060
 let's say she loboda look here 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.840
 shock generator i.e. 4 such 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.710
 spare parts 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.400
 I have one she that is so that I again 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.310
 I will find three also I will get here 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.740
 this shock and generator is wow but i dont 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.210
 I know if it's worth it 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.310
 the rest of the parts here let's say these 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.930
 here are the gears there like light bulbs i 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.389
 I think that it will be given from 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.430
 Hammerman who will attack and I 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.580
 I don’t know exactly what day it is 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.979
 expect well I think that these parts 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.639
 get you will need to put statues 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:43.120
 to protect your base statues on damage 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:45.400
 your base, you can say so and put 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.010
 It's all under boost specifically call 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.380
 exact day i will try it on the internet 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.910
 climb look can be very 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.360
 it is written but I think that there anyway 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.970
 what is written but the video is not spam 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.150
 spontaneous pure yet plus me 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.010
 attacked wars wars without one 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.620
 paratrooper just a miracle in a hurry 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.360
 I wanted to quickly figure out what to 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.340
 what 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.500
 in short guys and here is one option 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.610
 hand warriors seems to me here these on 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:18.970
 this only my aunt warriors can something 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.550
 do but either i don't know either take 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.529
 these ognevich coffee go on the right side 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:28.619
 try here to settle the situation in 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:31.819
 there is such a flurry such a tin here you still 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:35.209
 and the laser beam of some damn country 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:39.089
 fatal gun just fucked up 

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:42.449
 Sorry about the guys quarreling is just a scribe 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:43.819
 so here is my feeling from this 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.349
 Timothy Vodka 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.569
 In short, it seems full who does not want 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:51.779
 waste gold don't even try to climb 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:54.769
 but I think for anyone you need to do it and 

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:58.859
 by the way it appears after level 45 

00:06:54.769 --> 00:07:00.779
 terror level forty fifth hammer 

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:02.789
 when you call level forty five 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:05.399
 Hammerman only then you will appear 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:07.229
 Well, and so I think it will only appear 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:10.679
 then when you have a lab 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:13.739
 the laboratory of us appears the same 

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:16.109
 level they are written from what level to 

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:19.639
 appears so guys i won't say with 

00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:22.619
 what kind of headquarters and laboratory is replenished 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.629
 bye month all the news in the update i 

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:26.609
 at home someone was interesting news 

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:28.529
 so guys hump sound don't take don't 

00:07:26.609 --> 00:07:30.019
 only warriors lose time only warriors 

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:33.659
 maximum level 

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:36.239
 Well, this is my opinion that this is the only way 

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:38.759
 render one hundred percent and of course 

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:42.029
 everything needs to be put on boost in full 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:45.209
 program otherwise I think there catch 

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:50.360
 just nothing here so guys this is mine 

00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:54.379
 opinion of what and how you go it is purely 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:57.089
 personally yours to me basically no difference 

00:07:54.379 --> 00:08:00.349
 okay guys all good luck everyone bye 

00:07:57.089 --> 00:08:00.349
 I hope you have something to help
