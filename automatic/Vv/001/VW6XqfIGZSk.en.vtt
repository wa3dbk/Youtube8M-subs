00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.570 
think what's really fun about
skateboarding<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:17.019> when<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.100> get<00:02:18.280> something

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
new and kind of scary when you finally

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.120 
new and kind of scary when you finally
land<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.810> scary<00:02:23.170> thing<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.799> and<00:02:24.010> you

land that scary thing and you and you
feel<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:25.299> tension<00:02:25.630> release<00:02:26.459> that's<00:02:27.459> one<00:02:27.700> of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
feel that tension release that's one of

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.039 
feel that tension release that's one of
the<00:02:27.850> better<00:02:27.970> feeling<00:02:28.420> is<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.600> little<00:02:28.630> biggest

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
the better feeling is a little biggest

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.680 
the better feeling is a little biggest
adrenaline<00:02:29.230> rush<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.950> ever<00:02:30.160> experience

the<00:02:34.960> lines<00:02:35.290> as<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.130> stand

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
the lines as you stand

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.900 
the lines as you stand
I<00:02:40.800> thought<00:02:41.800> I<00:02:42.010> could<00:02:42.160> push<00:02:42.340> myself<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.820> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
I thought I could push myself to the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.360 
I thought I could push myself to the
next<00:02:43.150> level<00:02:43.480> when<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:43.690> protected<00:02:44.170> can<00:02:44.920> try<00:02:45.130> big

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
next level when I protected can try big

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.130 
next level when I protected can try big
tricks<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.000> not<00:02:46.150> worry<00:02:46.330> about<00:02:46.720> getting<00:02:46.990> hurt

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
tricks and not worry about getting hurt

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.170 
tricks and not worry about getting hurt
I<00:02:49.860> think<00:02:50.860> everybody<00:02:51.460> should<00:02:51.700> know<00:02:51.910> that

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
I think everybody should know that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.330 
I think everybody should know that
everything<00:02:52.930> happens<00:02:53.260> for<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.530> reason<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:54.160> that

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
everything happens for a reason and that

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.780 
everything happens for a reason and that
there's<00:02:55.150> always<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.540> way<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:56.340> overcome<00:02:57.340> an

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
there's always a way to overcome an

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
there's always a way to overcome an
obstacle<00:02:58.000> if<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.140> want<00:02:59.320> it<00:02:59.560> enough
