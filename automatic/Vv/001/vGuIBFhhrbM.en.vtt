00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 everyone talks about it nobody knows what they do 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.189
 in reality it is not true that is several 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.440
 people already know by now what they do 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.059
 what are the skill books for whom? 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.190
 is given to those who call them skill books for 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.289
 the memo who calls them books who them 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.150
 I don't know in these manuals 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.680
 days I really heard about them all 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.630
 the colors about this thing 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.580
 so for this reason I decided to 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.170
 make a video that will be really a lot 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.750
 short so it will be part of the category 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.349
 video flash for answers to questions 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.570
 in short, more frequent and I decided to 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.880
 tell you blessed skill books to that 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.309
 what are they used for, and blah blah blah 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.710
 blah blah blah bla premise what 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.940
 fundamental that probably Thursday 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.200
 there will be the usage event that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.600
 suitable for the use of these 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.480
 scribox and that is there will be double the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 possibility of increasing the level 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.920
 of skill of your character then 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.890
 my advice is to keep them 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.550
 as much as possible these manuals 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.379
 at least until Thursday 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.860
 compatibly with the maximum number 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.479
 of your char box that anyway 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.810
 I remind everyone that the maximum limit is 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.740
 200 so you see some manage me one 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.619
 decent manner 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.720
 I'll show you immediately these are the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 books that I obviously kept 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.640
 used full body ones because 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.390
 so the lomax skill ata immediately for 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 regarding mister 2 nanÃ¬ b2 e 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.290
 I don't have django django yet but 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.530
 But the sky shortly is the level 29 has 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.930
 time at 35 mister 2 really a lot 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.600
 useful therefore I will exploit the event of 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.490
 Thursday and Nami P2 is very useful therefore 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.390
 I will also use 20 for her 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.950
 Thursday now that the box we take a 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.570
 example the skybox gives me this skill 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.640
 books first of all like all 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.159
 other skill books refers only 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.869
 this character at this level of 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.520
 evolution 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.799
 this does not mean that he cannot 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.179
 be used on other characters but not 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.119
 will have no effect except to give 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.860
 5,000 of experience that is not little to 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.690
 use a skybox as a former monster goes 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.000
 very well especially when that 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.549
 character you don't have or not 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.280
 think about taking it shortly or how much 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.380
 less is a character not very strong 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.239
 very weak I posted on the page not 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.000
 I know how many of you have seen that I have 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.450
 developed a skybox pq lobby here 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.350
 the really useless one then 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.850
 also used to pick up of 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.160
 level your characters 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.019
 in the current event that is hina's 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.810
 I can do it also to locke gene 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.120
 that if you have some decent character 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.860
 in a blue team you will realize immediately 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.859
 which really serves no purpose 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.600
 bad stats bad skills can 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.850
 be a good only at the beginning like 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.280
 filler and in the blue team but they are there 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.640
 blue messages much stronger than that is 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.640
 in conclusion 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.670
 let's say I want to try 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.130
 increase the dynami skill level 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.130
 so I will select dwarfs from power up 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:15.600
 here is where my beloved will reach them 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.500
 manual I will press key player or to have 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.739
 fear 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.900
 I will have a more or less low chance a 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.560
 depending on the skill level of the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.010
 current character to increase this 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.970
 level 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.540
 now once the level increases 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.750
 of the skill will be lowered by one turn 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.139
 time expected for the charge of this 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.840
 I hope it was clear and therefore one 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:46.380
 time let's say that the pinco skill 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.579
 pallino is loaded in 25 turns the skill is 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.630
 level 5 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.180
 the board 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.620
 pallino will load in twenty turns is 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.570
 something really very useful not 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.630
 increases the damage does not increase the effect 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.900
 it does not change it but time decreases e 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.670
 this thing is gold and gold 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.190
 I'll give you an example of just one example 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.080
 really practical that will immediately make you 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.420
 understand what I mean 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.320
 and I do it with everyone's darling 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.340
 we 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.340
 the darkness 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.440
 here is my alla mirabella species in the 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.120
 level 1 which is charged in 32 rounds the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.510
 I take special care of getting off when 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.240
 emma at max level up to 17 rounds 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.750
 imagine the bestial power of mine 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:35.190
 eyes 17 shifts that lowers by 30 per 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.740
 a hundred hpd all enemies is one thing 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.780
 bestial so I recommend using 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.880
 good your skyboxes to use them at 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.970
 better to wait for Thursday to be there 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.340
 the skill event double chance 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.710
 to increase the skill level 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.360
 I greet you and refer you to hold 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.600
 the channel asks if you liked it is 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.460
 was useful or at least you have seen 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.610
 until the end put a like one 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.150
 comment on the next one 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.150
 Hello
