00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.360 
that one was I liked that board I think
best<00:02:58.920> out<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.130> three<00:02:59.460> so<00:02:59.580> far<00:03:00.710> this<00:03:01.710> one<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.160> rode

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
best out of three so far this one I rode

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.120 
best out of three so far this one I rode
for<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.730> little<00:03:03.030> bit<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.930> only<00:03:04.590> thing<00:03:04.770> was<00:03:04.890> is

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
for a little bit the only thing was is

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.770 
for a little bit the only thing was is
the<00:03:05.310> wheels<00:03:05.790> were<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.060> little<00:03:06.240> soft<00:03:06.450> for<00:03:06.540> me

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.480 
the wheels were a little soft for me
yeah<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.200> these<00:03:07.530> wheels<00:03:07.770> were<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> little<00:03:08.280> bit

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.400 
yeah so these wheels were a little bit
soft<00:03:08.760> compared<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.330> what<00:03:09.480> Julie<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.930> used<00:03:10.200> to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
soft compared to what Julie is used to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.630 
soft compared to what Julie is used to

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
so that's kind of a cool little feature

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.660 
so that's kind of a cool little feature
not<00:04:07.019> too<00:04:07.260> much<00:04:07.440> just<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:08.130> little<00:04:08.160> bit<00:04:08.370> of<00:04:08.549> a

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
not too much just a little bit of a

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.130 
not too much just a little bit of a
round<00:04:08.850> figuration<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.720> board<00:04:09.989> is

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
round figuration of this board is

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.440 
round figuration of this board is
identical<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:11.160> board<00:04:11.459> except<00:04:11.880> for<00:04:12.120> the

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
identical to this board except for the

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.690 
identical to this board except for the
wheels<00:04:12.660> being<00:04:12.989> different<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.890> we<00:04:14.580> can

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
wheels being different so that we can

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.580 
wheels being different so that we can
ever<00:04:14.790> talk<00:04:15.000> about<00:04:15.090> anymore<00:04:15.330> yeah<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.320> as<00:04:16.440> I

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
ever talk about anymore yeah so as I

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.289 
ever talk about anymore yeah so as I
just<00:04:16.769> mentioned<00:04:17.160> this<00:04:17.310> board<00:04:17.640> is<00:04:17.790> configured

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
just mentioned this board is configured

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.270 
just mentioned this board is configured
exactly<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.109> same<00:04:19.320> as<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.590> previous<00:04:19.799> board

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
exactly the same as the previous board

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.120 
exactly the same as the previous board
the<00:04:21.209> only<00:04:21.390> difference<00:04:21.989> is<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.470> wheels<00:04:22.740> in

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
the only difference is the wheels in

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.370 
the only difference is the wheels in
fact<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.760> even<00:04:23.790> has<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.330> exact<00:04:24.690> same<00:04:24.780> kind<00:04:25.260> of

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
fact it even has the exact same kind of

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.620 
fact it even has the exact same kind of
grip<00:04:25.590> tape<00:04:25.620> it's<00:04:26.040> got<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.580> mob<00:04:26.910> grip<00:04:27.210> tape<00:04:27.419> but

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
grip tape it's got a mob grip tape but

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.270 
grip tape it's got a mob grip tape but

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
this photo at the Pacific Palisades so

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.890 
this photo at the Pacific Palisades so
yeah<00:04:44.310> it's<00:04:44.520> very<00:04:44.669> similar<00:04:45.300> in<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.479> lot<00:04:45.630> of<00:04:45.660> ways

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
yeah it's very similar in a lot of ways

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.010 
yeah it's very similar in a lot of ways
it<00:04:46.650> also<00:04:46.800> has<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.250> bones<00:04:47.490> Reds<00:04:47.820> bearings<00:04:48.270> has

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
it also has the bones Reds bearings has

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.020 
it also has the bones Reds bearings has
the<00:04:49.080> exact<00:04:49.410> same<00:04:49.620> seismic<00:04:50.190> trucks<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.669> exact

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
the exact same seismic trucks the exact

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.869 
the exact same seismic trucks the exact
same<00:04:51.270> measurements<00:04:51.930> on<00:04:52.289> the<00:04:52.620> deck<00:04:52.800> itself

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
same measurements on the deck itself

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.790 
same measurements on the deck itself
the<00:04:54.150> only<00:04:54.270> difference<00:04:54.660> as<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:55.199> said<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.620> yes

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
the only difference as I said is yes

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.990 
the only difference as I said is yes
these<00:04:56.009> pawel<00:04:56.370> rat<00:04:57.030> bones<00:04:57.330> wheels<00:04:57.780> at<00:04:58.169> 97<00:04:59.009> a<00:04:59.190> in

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
these pawel rat bones wheels at 97 a in

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.330 
these pawel rat bones wheels at 97 a in
durometer<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.690> 60<00:05:01.349> millimeters<00:05:01.800> in<00:05:02.039> diameter

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
durometer and 60 millimeters in diameter

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.640 
durometer and 60 millimeters in diameter
so<00:05:02.909> they're<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.120> little<00:05:03.240> bit<00:05:03.449> harder<00:05:03.870> than<00:05:04.050> the

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
so they're a little bit harder than the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.710 
so they're a little bit harder than the
ones<00:05:04.949> on<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.370> Victoria<00:05:05.909> of<00:05:06.060> our<00:05:06.210> tuga<00:05:06.539> deck

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
ones on the Victoria of our tuga deck

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.850 
ones on the Victoria of our tuga deck
this<00:05:07.409> one<00:05:07.800> was<00:05:08.009> very<00:05:08.039> difficult<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.180> ride<00:05:09.860> even

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
this one was very difficult to ride even

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.270 
this one was very difficult to ride even
though<00:05:10.979> she's<00:05:11.220> gorgeous<00:05:12.169> this<00:05:13.169> one<00:05:13.379> has<00:05:13.620> it

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
though she's gorgeous this one has it

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.100 
though she's gorgeous this one has it
has<00:05:14.460> seismic<00:05:15.060> trucks<00:05:15.360> on<00:05:15.539> it<00:05:15.690> which<00:05:15.930> are

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
has seismic trucks on it which are

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.450 
has seismic trucks on it which are
really<00:05:16.259> designed<00:05:16.740> originally<00:05:17.159> for<00:05:17.190> long

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
really designed originally for long

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:50.640 
really designed originally for long
boarding<00:05:17.789> and<00:05:17.940> stuff<00:05:18.120> so

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:58.540 

all<00:05:51.650> right<00:05:51.860> I<00:05:52.040> can<00:05:52.340> move<00:05:56.710> I'm<00:05:57.710> struggling<00:05:58.220> so

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
all right I can move I'm struggling so

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.230 
all right I can move I'm struggling so
much<00:05:58.580> deep<00:05:59.150> down<00:05:59.360> I<00:06:00.100> don't<00:06:01.100> get<00:06:01.220> speed<00:06:01.490> so<00:06:01.970> yeah

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
much deep down I don't get speed so yeah

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.730 
much deep down I don't get speed so yeah
this<00:06:02.780> board<00:06:02.990> was<00:06:03.080> very<00:06:03.230> difficult<00:06:03.410> because

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
this board was very difficult because

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.890 
this board was very difficult because
the<00:06:04.340> trucks<00:06:04.640> I<00:06:04.880> tightened<00:06:05.270> numbers<00:06:05.600> tight<00:06:05.780> as

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
the trucks I tightened numbers tight as

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.100 
the trucks I tightened numbers tight as
we<00:06:05.990> could<00:06:06.170> and<00:06:06.580> they<00:06:07.580> were<00:06:07.640> still<00:06:08.420> very<00:06:08.690> very

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
we could and they were still very very

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.080 
we could and they were still very very
very<00:06:09.380> wobbly<00:06:09.800> and<00:06:10.100> loose<00:06:10.310> and<00:06:10.640> I<00:06:10.760> couldn't

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
very wobbly and loose and I couldn't

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.400 
very wobbly and loose and I couldn't
really<00:06:11.210> get<00:06:11.450> a<00:06:11.510> lot<00:06:11.660> of<00:06:11.810> speed<00:06:11.960> in<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.260> bowl

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
really get a lot of speed in the bowl

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.630 
really get a lot of speed in the bowl
because<00:06:12.590> I<00:06:12.740> was<00:06:12.860> more<00:06:13.040> worried<00:06:13.340> about<00:06:13.370> my

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
because I was more worried about my

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.540 
because I was more worried about my
bounce<00:06:14.740> but<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:15.830> bolt<00:06:16.010> but<00:06:16.190> the<00:06:16.310> board's

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
bounce but the bolt but the board's

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.340 
bounce but the bolt but the board's
pretty<00:06:16.760> cool<00:06:17.000> I<00:06:17.030> mean<00:06:17.360> I<00:06:17.570> like<00:06:17.930> the<00:06:18.020> idea<00:06:18.080> of
