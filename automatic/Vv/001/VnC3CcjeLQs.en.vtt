00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.539 
time of the making man city games
because<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.829> know<00:01:40.890> during<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> week<00:01:41.400> when

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
because I know during the week when

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.679 
because I know during the week when
there<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.790> football<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> little<00:01:42.570> bit

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
there is football it is a little bit

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.240 
there is football it is a little bit
tough<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.290> at<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.530> time<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> guess

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
tough to do it at that time so I guess

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.319 
tough to do it at that time so I guess
maybe<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:44.640> there's<00:01:44.790> football<00:01:44.970> during<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
maybe when there's football during the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.109 
maybe when there's football during the
week<00:01:45.479> we'll<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.110> an<00:01:46.200> earlier<00:01:46.500> upload<00:01:46.890> like
