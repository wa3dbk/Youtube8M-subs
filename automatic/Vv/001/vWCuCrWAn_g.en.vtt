00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
as you know a diagram of where stuff is

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.809 
as you know a diagram of where stuff is
on<00:02:27.969> the<00:02:28.090> tablet<00:02:28.599> how<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.930> use<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.439> tablet

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
on the tablet how to use the tablet

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.559 
on the tablet how to use the tablet
stuff<00:02:30.819> like<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.299> okay<00:02:32.519> so<00:02:33.519> then<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.329> have

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
stuff like that okay so then you have

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.839 
stuff like that okay so then you have
the<00:02:35.049> next<00:02:35.260> one<00:02:35.379> is<00:02:35.680> consumer<00:02:36.219> information

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
the next one is consumer information

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.819 
the next one is consumer information
about<00:02:37.060> radiofrequency<00:02:37.719> emissions<00:02:38.620> and

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
about radiofrequency emissions and

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.550 
about radiofrequency emissions and
responsible<00:02:39.489> driving<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.139> know<00:02:41.260> don't

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
responsible driving so you know don't

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.229 
responsible driving so you know don't

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
wall port and you can see that it you

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.819 
wall port and you can see that it you
know<00:03:47.169> kind<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.879> as<00:03:48.879> this<00:03:49.239> weird<00:03:49.569> edge<00:03:49.930> thing<00:03:50.349> so

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
know kind of as this weird edge thing so

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.270 
know kind of as this weird edge thing so
this<00:03:50.979> is<00:03:51.069> strangely<00:03:52.000> big<00:03:52.719> in<00:03:53.259> my<00:03:53.439> opinion<00:03:53.949> for

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
this is strangely big in my opinion for

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.259 
this is strangely big in my opinion for
a<00:03:54.310> wall<00:03:55.090> port<00:03:55.629> USB<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.979> wall<00:03:57.129> adapter<00:03:57.430> but<00:03:57.909> I

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
a wall port USB the wall adapter but I

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.259 
a wall port USB the wall adapter but I
don't<00:03:58.780> know<00:03:58.919> it's<00:03:59.919> not<00:04:00.099> bad<00:04:00.459> it's<00:04:00.909> just<00:04:01.120> a

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
don't know it's not bad it's just a

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.800 
don't know it's not bad it's just a
weird<00:04:01.509> design<00:04:01.840> compared<00:04:02.409> to<00:04:02.620> some<00:04:02.949> others<00:04:03.340> and

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
weird design compared to some others and

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.050 
weird design compared to some others and
then<00:04:04.810> of<00:04:05.049> course<00:04:05.079> we<00:04:05.530> have<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.889> actual<00:04:06.310> USB

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
then of course we have the actual USB

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.170 
then of course we have the actual USB
wire<00:04:07.359> so<00:04:08.109> you<00:04:08.139> have<00:04:08.650> this<00:04:09.579> end<00:04:09.849> of<00:04:09.969> the<00:04:10.060> wire

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
wire so you have this end of the wire

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.719 
wire so you have this end of the wire
obviously<00:04:10.959> which<00:04:11.259> is<00:04:11.469> what<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.370> would<00:04:12.489> plug

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:12.729 
obviously which is what you would plug

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.409 
obviously which is what you would plug
in<00:04:12.969> to<00:04:13.599> your<00:04:13.629> computer<00:04:13.959> and<00:04:15.060> then<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.209> have

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
in to your computer and then you have

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.319 
in to your computer and then you have
the

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
the

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.479 
the
and<00:04:17.539> which<00:04:18.079> is<00:04:18.259> obviously<00:04:18.739> what<00:04:19.009> you'd<00:04:19.189> plug

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
and which is obviously what you'd plug

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.570 
and which is obviously what you'd plug
into<00:04:19.729> your<00:04:19.939> tablet<00:04:20.509> to<00:04:20.539> charge<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.229> or
