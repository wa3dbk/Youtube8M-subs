00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.330
 car daeus car 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.650
 beauty 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.780
 Now I will tell you what you need 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:21.740
 pay attention when buying a car 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.740
 We look at the front wing bumper joint 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.330
 the discrepancies are pretty big go further 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:45.330
 front driver door closes 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:48.390
 with a pretty strong push this thing in 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:52.379
 principle could be corrected because 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.580
 this door lock is worth a little 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:01.530
 higher than expected but if you look closely 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:05.850
 ok then the lower it stands above it stands 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.140
 in order for the door to snap into place 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.130
 rose above look at the gap 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.520
 top door and bottom door 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.340
 below it means more than the door we have hanging 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.280
 crooked 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.090
 if you lower this retainer a little 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.229
 Delhi 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.750
 then the door will close well then 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.750
 top here in this place 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.360
 the driver's door will be much lower 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.330
 look further here everything is fine 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.110
 the paint is fine 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:54.800
 there are no scuffs but there is one more 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.800
 from yanchik look at the door trim 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.950
 it is clear that it is not glued to 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.310
 the end that's all the flaws that I noticed 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:14.310
 on your car and ask you when 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:17.330
 buying pay attention to them thanks 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.330
 who listened
