it's really simple to find the tools
decent<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:30.860> think<00:00:31.099> in<00:00:31.189> some<00:00:31.220> ways<00:00:31.489> better

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
decent and I think in some ways better

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.319 
slick and we're gonna work to improve
the<00:00:36.590> performance<00:00:37.100> over<00:00:37.219> time<00:00:37.370> but<00:00:37.699> quickly

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
the performance over time but quickly

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.180 
the performance over time but quickly
let<00:00:38.480> me<00:00:38.510> just<00:00:38.750> show<00:00:38.870> you<00:00:38.899> how<00:00:39.109> it<00:00:39.170> works<00:00:39.289> you

let me just show you how it works you
know<00:00:40.250> basically<00:00:40.609> to<00:00:40.699> the<00:00:40.910> flow<00:00:41.329> sheets<00:00:41.629> to<00:00:42.469> the

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
know basically to the flow sheets to the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.470 
know basically to the flow sheets to the
radiology<00:00:43.129> tab<00:00:43.340> or<00:00:43.609> any<00:00:43.730> place<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:43.969> you<00:00:44.269> see

radiology tab or any place that you see
a<00:00:44.510> radiology<00:00:45.379> report<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:45.920> it's<00:00:46.010> going<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.160> be

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
a radiology report so it's going to be

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.169 
a radiology report so it's going to be
in<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.429> all<00:00:46.579> results<00:00:47.030> tab<00:00:47.590> as<00:00:48.590> well<00:00:48.940> but<00:00:49.940> for

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
in the all results tab as well but for

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:51.520 
in the all results tab as well but for
today<00:00:50.449> I'm<00:00:50.629> just<00:00:50.839> going<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.050> go<00:00:51.199> to<00:00:51.230> that

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
today I'm just going to go to that

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.450 
today I'm just going to go to that

straightforward view if there's multiple

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.290 
straightforward view if there's multiple
images<00:01:24.470> you'll<00:01:24.650> see<00:01:24.860> them<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.010> scroll<00:01:25.850> bar<00:01:25.880> down

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
different image you can also just use

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.790 
different image you can also just use
the<00:01:30.890> scroll<00:01:31.190> wheel<00:01:31.600> by<00:01:32.600> default<00:01:33.080> to<00:01:33.500> scroll

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
the scroll wheel by default to scroll

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.530 
the scroll wheel by default to scroll
through<00:01:34.070> those<00:01:34.250> images<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.000> it's<00:01:35.270> pretty

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
through those images so it's pretty

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.890 
through those images so it's pretty
quick<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:36.050> view<00:01:36.790> slices<00:01:37.790> of<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:38.000> scat<00:01:38.240> cat<00:01:38.600> scan

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
quick to view slices of a scat cat scan

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.730 
quick to view slices of a scat cat scan
like<00:01:39.110> this<00:01:40.210> if<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:41.540> right<00:01:41.900> click<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.500> drag

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
like this if you right click and drag

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.310 
like this if you right click and drag
down<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.790> will<00:01:43.910> enlarge<00:01:44.090> your<00:01:44.570> image<00:01:44.870> a<00:01:45.080> little

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
down it will enlarge your image a little

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.830 
down it will enlarge your image a little
bit<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:46.760> performance<00:01:47.240> on<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:47.450> is<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.630> little

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
bit the performance on that is a little

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.190 
bit the performance on that is a little
bit<00:01:47.990> sluggish<00:01:48.320> but<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:48.920> does<00:01:49.160> work<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:51.050> can

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
bit sluggish but that does work you can

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.100 
bit sluggish but that does work you can
also<00:01:51.380> adjust<00:01:51.620> contrast<00:01:52.420> on<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.540> left<00:01:53.780> click

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
also adjust contrast on the left click

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.130 
also adjust contrast on the left click
and<00:01:54.380> dragging<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:55.940> some<00:01:56.810> place<00:01:56.990> that

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
and dragging this is a some place that

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.840 
and dragging this is a some place that
the<00:01:57.260> performance<00:01:57.740> really<00:01:57.830> need<00:01:58.130> some<00:01:58.310> help<00:01:58.550> so

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the performance really need some help so

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.350 
the performance really need some help so
we'll<00:01:59.630> keep<00:01:59.810> working<00:02:00.020> on<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.210> be<00:02:02.330> a

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
we'll keep working on that it can be a

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.209 
we'll keep working on that it can be a
little<00:02:02.540> bit<00:02:02.750> slow

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.059 

but<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:07.780> pretty<00:02:07.960> much<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.229> simple<00:02:08.470> there's

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
but it's pretty much that simple there's

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.320 
but it's pretty much that simple there's
some<00:02:09.190> tools<00:02:09.399> over<00:02:09.700> here<00:02:09.879> for<00:02:10.060> angle

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
some tools over here for angle

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.750 
some tools over here for angle
measurement<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.869> variety<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.230> things<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.769> can

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
measurement a variety of things you can

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.430 
measurement a variety of things you can
poke<00:02:12.940> around<00:02:12.970> on<00:02:13.390> those<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.810> find<00:02:14.019> them

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
poke around on those and find them

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.160 
poke around on those and find them
obviously<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.310> got<00:02:15.459> another<00:02:16.120> series<00:02:16.690> up<00:02:16.900> here

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
obviously you got another series up here

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.780 
obviously you got another series up here
if<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.349> want<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.620> switch<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.129> series<00:02:18.640> you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
if you want to switch to that series you

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.100 
if you want to switch to that series you
can<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.590> again<00:02:20.709> depending<00:02:21.069> on<00:02:21.810> how<00:02:22.810> big<00:02:22.989> as

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
can and again depending on how big as

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.860 
can and again depending on how big as
series<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:24.120> decent<00:02:25.120> performance<00:02:25.660> for

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
series it is it's decent performance for

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.619 
series it is it's decent performance for
looking<00:02:26.110> through<00:02:26.319> those<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:28.180> I'm<00:02:28.390> just

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
looking through those and I'm just

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.390 
looking through those and I'm just
scrolling<00:02:28.900> with<00:02:29.200> my<00:02:29.379> scroll<00:02:29.739> wheel<00:02:29.769> now<00:02:30.220> when

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
scrolling with my scroll wheel now when

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.800 
scrolling with my scroll wheel now when
it<00:02:30.519> does<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.709> that's<00:02:33.220> about<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.810> worked

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
it does that so that's about it worked

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.410 
it does that so that's about it worked
for<00:02:35.200> obviously<00:02:35.860> plain<00:02:36.129> films<00:02:36.750> as<00:02:37.750> well<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:39.420> in

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
for obviously plain films as well and in

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.819 
for obviously plain films as well and in
theory<00:02:40.840> they're<00:02:40.989> gonna<00:02:41.079> load<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:41.380> little<00:02:41.680> bit

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
theory they're gonna load a little bit

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.550 
theory they're gonna load a little bit
more<00:02:42.010> quickly<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.390> we<00:02:46.480> have<00:02:46.599> this<00:02:46.660> plain<00:02:46.959> type

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
more quickly so we have this plain type

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.199 
more quickly so we have this plain type
Elvis<00:02:47.920> film<00:02:48.190> here<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.610> it's<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.790> little<00:02:48.940> bit

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.940 

lacking<00:02:52.209> in<00:02:52.569> contrast<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.500> can

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
lacking in contrast so I can

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.400 
lacking in contrast so I can
theoretically<00:02:54.870> make<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.079> little<00:02:56.200> bit

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
theoretically make that a little bit

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.770 
theoretically make that a little bit
darker<00:02:56.799> with<00:02:57.069> this<00:02:57.250> left<00:02:57.970> click<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.450> scroll

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
darker with this left click and a scroll

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.850 
darker with this left click and a scroll
up<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.230> little<00:03:02.590> bit<00:03:02.739> slow<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.129> work

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
up and it's a little bit slow to work

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.430 
up and it's a little bit slow to work
but<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:05.980> can<00:03:06.010> adjust<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.700> contrast<00:03:07.440> and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
but you can adjust that contrast and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.319 
but you can adjust that contrast and
then<00:03:09.870> take<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.019> hand<00:03:11.579> move<00:03:12.579> this<00:03:12.940> over<00:03:13.150> a

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
then take the hand move this over a

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.069 
then take the hand move this over a
little<00:03:13.510> bit<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.950> recenter<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:16.600> if<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.840> right

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
little bit to recenter it and if I right

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:24.800 
little bit to recenter it and if I right
click<00:03:17.109> and<00:03:17.590> drag<00:03:17.799> down<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:19.109> can<00:03:20.109> zoom<00:03:20.350> into<00:03:20.590> that

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.050 

there's<00:03:25.810> other<00:03:26.200> tools<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:27.629> will<00:03:28.629> allow<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:28.989> to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
there's other tools I will allow you to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.869 
there's other tools I will allow you to
manipulate<00:03:31.060> these<00:03:31.599> images<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:32.760> that's<00:03:33.760> about

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
manipulate these images so that's about

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.670 
manipulate these images so that's about
it<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:34.209> pretty<00:03:34.480> straightforward<00:03:34.900> and

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
it it's pretty straightforward and

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.290 
it it's pretty straightforward and
that's<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.340> new<00:03:36.459> functionality<00:03:36.910> that's

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
that's a new functionality that's

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.520 
that's a new functionality that's
available<00:03:37.560> for<00:03:38.560> films<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.220> were<00:03:39.340> taken

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
available for films that were taken

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.910 
available for films that were taken
somewhere<00:03:41.530> around<00:03:42.360> mid-june<00:03:43.360> or<00:03:43.660> later<00:03:43.920> if

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
somewhere around mid-june or later if

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.500 
somewhere around mid-june or later if
this<00:03:45.160> doesn't<00:03:45.459> let<00:03:45.610> up<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:45.970> means<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.269> film

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
this doesn't let up that means the film

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.509 
this doesn't let up that means the film
isn't<00:03:47.349> in<00:03:47.500> there<00:03:47.680> you'll<00:03:47.860> have<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.129> view<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.340> in

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
isn't in there you'll have to view it in

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.640 
isn't in there you'll have to view it in
matte<00:03:48.730> view<00:03:48.910> but<00:03:49.209> starting<00:03:50.019> about<00:03:50.110> mid-june
