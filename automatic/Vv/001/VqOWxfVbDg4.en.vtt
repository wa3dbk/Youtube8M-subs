00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.610 

right<00:00:42.150> then<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.020> will<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:43.380> three

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
right then you will see these three

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.710 
right then you will see these three
screws<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.400> two<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.970> three<00:00:45.330> which<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.600> need

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
screws one two and three which you need

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.910

to<00:00:45.780> remove

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.639 

I'm<00:00:53.760> claiming<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.329> screws<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.079> need<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> push

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
I'm claiming the screws you need to push

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.700 
I'm claiming the screws you need to push
the<00:00:55.730> entire<00:00:56.730> lid<00:00:57.239> towards<00:00:57.929> yourself<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:01.170> then

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the entire lid towards yourself and then

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.690 
the entire lid towards yourself and then
you<00:01:02.159> just<00:01:02.309> need<00:01:02.519> to<00:01:02.670> fold<00:01:03.089> over<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.690> so

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
you just need to fold over like this so

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.190 
you just need to fold over like this so
then<00:01:05.700> always<00:01:05.909> made<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.180> very<00:01:06.420> very<00:01:06.659> simple<00:01:06.930> as

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
then always made it very very simple as

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.800 
then always made it very very simple as
you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.710> creating<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> hard<00:01:09.090> hard<00:01:09.570> drive

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
you can see creating the hard hard drive

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.800 
you can see creating the hard hard drive
or<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> RAM<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.649> cakewalk<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.479> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.659> see

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
or the RAM is a cakewalk and you can see

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
or the RAM is a cakewalk and you can see
the<00:01:12.960> cpu<00:01:13.380> fouls<00:01:13.680> over<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.640> clean<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the cpu fouls over here you can clean it

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.179 
the cpu fouls over here you can clean it
up<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.930> see<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> speakers<00:01:16.619> over<00:01:16.799> here

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
up you can see the speakers over here

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.789 
up you can see the speakers over here
and<00:01:17.580> over<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:17.789> if<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.600> scenario<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.289> goes<00:01:19.500> bad

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and over here if in scenario it goes bad

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.770 
and over here if in scenario it goes bad
it's<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.789> difficult<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.750> know

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
it's not all that difficult to you know

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
it's not all that difficult to you know
repair<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.439> Lenovo<00:01:22.710> y50<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.580> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
repair your Lenovo y50 so that is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
repair your Lenovo y50 so that is
another<00:01:24.060> good<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.330> about<00:01:25.190> z50<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.440> is

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
another good thing about z50 so this is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.999 
another good thing about z50 so this is
the<00:01:28.800> RAM<00:01:29.429> area<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.300> can<00:01:30.509> upgrade<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.679> RAM<00:01:31.799> up

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the RAM area you can upgrade the RAM up

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.630 
the RAM area you can upgrade the RAM up
to<00:01:32.159> 16gb<00:01:33.110> at<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.530> max<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.399> will<00:01:35.520> be

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
to 16gb at the max that you will be

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.600 
to 16gb at the max that you will be
processed<00:01:36.060> supports<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.920> just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
processed supports so you can just

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.930 
processed supports so you can just
remove<00:01:39.209> this<00:01:39.590> not<00:01:40.590> using<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.789> fingers

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
remove this not using these two fingers

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.749 
remove this not using these two fingers
and<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.080> remove<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> RAM<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.610> this

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and you can remove the RAM so this

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.830 
and you can remove the RAM so this
basically<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.240> 1<00:01:46.020> 6<00:01:46.319> 0<00:01:46.409> 0<00:01:46.649> ddr3l<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.659> low

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
basically a 1 6 0 0 ddr3l is the low

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.649 
basically a 1 6 0 0 ddr3l is the low
voltage<00:01:49.280> memory<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.880> need<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.179> buy<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
voltage memory that you need to buy and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.309 
voltage memory that you need to buy and
you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.360> insert<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.720> very<00:01:55.080> similar

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
you can just insert a very similar

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:01.580 
you can just insert a very similar
memory<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:56.159> any<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:59.729> other<00:01:59.820> slots<00:02:00.590> so

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
memory in any of the the other slots so

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.730 
memory in any of the the other slots so
it's<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:02.070> simple<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:02.579> that

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
it's as simple as that

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.840 
it's as simple as that
coming<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> hard<00:02:05.100> drive<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.670> these

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
coming to the hard drive you have these

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.349 
coming to the hard drive you have these
4<00:02:06.090> screws<00:02:06.270> 1<00:02:06.869> 2<00:02:07.500> 3<00:02:08.039> 4<00:02:08.700> which<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.209> to

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:09.359 
4 screws 1 2 3 4 which you have to

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:14.290 
4 screws 1 2 3 4 which you have to
remove

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.240 

you<00:02:15.170> need<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:16.120> slip<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.330> entire<00:02:17.990> address<00:02:18.650> on

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
you need to slip the entire address on

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.000 
you need to slip the entire address on
the<00:02:19.340> left<00:02:19.540> on<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.600> left

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.740 

the<00:02:24.580> heart<00:02:24.730> rate<00:02:24.940> comes<00:02:25.209> out<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:25.599> basically

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
the heart rate comes out it's basically

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.420 
the heart rate comes out it's basically
a<00:02:26.110> 2.5<00:02:27.040> inch<00:02:27.580> SATA<00:02:28.230> hard<00:02:29.230> drive<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.280> can

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
a 2.5 inch SATA hard drive so you can

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.699 
a 2.5 inch SATA hard drive so you can
upgrade<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.970> laptop<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.690> 2<00:02:31.840> terabyte<00:02:32.260> for<00:02:32.590> the

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
upgrade the laptop to 2 terabyte for the
