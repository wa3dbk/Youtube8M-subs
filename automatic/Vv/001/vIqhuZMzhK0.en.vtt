milkshake with a straw where the sounds
of<00:00:30.480> things<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.710> would<00:00:31.830> ignore<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
of things so we would ignore it and

column the delicious sauce that we must
find<00:00:46.440> possible<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.070> them<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.940> another

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
find possible of them here is another

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.410 
find possible of them here is another
one<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> ring<00:00:48.899> shaped<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.829> time<00:00:50.180> but<00:00:51.180> it's

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
one a ring shaped one this time but it's

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.459 
one a ring shaped one this time but it's
pretty<00:00:51.719> pointless<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:53.570> wait<00:00:54.570> once<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
pretty pointless because wait once to

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.590 
pretty pointless because wait once to
get<00:00:55.559> past<00:00:55.829> these<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.449> run

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
get past these and then you can just run

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.029 
get past these and then you can just run
around<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> continue<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.829> one

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
around and continue and here is one

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.290 
around and continue and here is one
another<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.640> an<00:00:59.760> wearing<00:00:59.940> shake<00:01:00.149> one

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
another one it's an wearing shake one

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.520 
another one it's an wearing shake one
but<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.629> time<00:01:00.899> there's<00:01:01.140> no<00:01:01.260> platform

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
but this time there's no platform

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.070 
but this time there's no platform
leading<00:01:02.010> out<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.660> eventually<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:04.019> gonna

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
leading out to it eventually we're gonna

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.390 
leading out to it eventually we're gonna
get<00:01:04.260> someone<00:01:04.500> we've<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.830> camera<00:01:05.129> shaped

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
get someone we've just camera shaped

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.890 
get someone we've just camera shaped
back<00:01:05.519> from<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:05.850> anything<00:01:06.150> leading<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.720> it

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
back from or anything leading up to it

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.690 
back from or anything leading up to it
at<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.140> rate<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.979> that's<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.490> take

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
at this rate but that's going to take

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.640 
at this rate but that's going to take
about<00:01:08.820> five<00:01:08.939> years<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.930> we<00:01:10.080> shouldn't<00:01:10.409> worry

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
about five years so we shouldn't worry

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.280 
about five years so we shouldn't worry
about<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.310> tell<00:01:11.549> me

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
about to tell me

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.320 
about to tell me
and<00:01:13.290> indeed<00:01:14.190> we<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.550> proceeded<00:01:15.180> into

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and indeed we have proceeded into

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.000 
and indeed we have proceeded into
another<00:01:15.660> one<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> these<00:01:16.050> areas<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.770> time

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
another one of these areas and this time

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.130 
another one of these areas and this time
this<00:01:17.190> is<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.550> very<00:01:18.090> last<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.990> these

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
this is the very last one of these

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.890 
this is the very last one of these
sections<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.980> main<00:01:20.190> room<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.810> will

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
sections in the main room and we will

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
sections in the main room and we will
find<00:01:22.230> that<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.530> tower<00:01:22.800> is<00:01:23.070> riddled<00:01:23.610> with

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
find that this tower is riddled with

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.930 
find that this tower is riddled with
invisible<00:01:24.540> platforms<00:01:25.470> now<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.790> all

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
invisible platforms now if this all

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.310 
invisible platforms now if this all
platforms<00:01:27.180> been<00:01:27.480> changed<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.870> little<00:01:27.990> bit<00:01:28.170> in

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
platforms been changed a little bit in

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.570 
platforms been changed a little bit in
the<00:01:28.440> legacy<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.770> darkness<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.280> time<00:01:29.460> they

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
the legacy of darkness this time they

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.090 
the legacy of darkness this time they
actually<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.940> walls<00:01:30.300> it<00:01:30.720> seems<00:01:31.050> and<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:31.980> is

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
actually have walls it seems and here is

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.040 
actually have walls it seems and here is
an<00:01:32.220> obvious<00:01:32.670> clue<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.150> an<00:01:33.240> invisible<00:01:33.630> platform

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
an obvious clue to an invisible platform

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.140 
an obvious clue to an invisible platform
for<00:01:34.230> look<00:01:34.440> there<00:01:34.860> are<00:01:34.980> two<00:01:35.100> things<00:01:35.310> signifying

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
for look there are two things signifying

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.420 
for look there are two things signifying
way<00:01:36.480> and<00:01:36.900> also<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> ray<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> light<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.190> we<00:01:38.310> can

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
way and also a ray of light so we can

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.980 
way and also a ray of light so we can
walk<00:01:38.550> down<00:01:38.580> to<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.090> collapsed<00:01:39.510> tower<00:01:39.690> and

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
walk down to the collapsed tower and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.810 
walk down to the collapsed tower and
find<00:01:40.200> ourselves<00:01:40.350> some<00:01:40.770> roast<00:01:41.040> beef<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.730> our

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
find ourselves some roast beef for our

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.470 
find ourselves some roast beef for our
troubles

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
troubles

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.660 
troubles
we<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.290> also<00:01:43.440> find<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.980> we<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> lot<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
we can also find that we have a lot of

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.010 
we can also find that we have a lot of
difficulty<00:01:45.120> in<00:01:45.210> getting<00:01:45.330> back<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.870> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
difficulty in getting back up on the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.900 
difficulty in getting back up on the
platform<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.410> has<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.490> can't<00:01:47.730> actually

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
platform that has it you can't actually

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.430 
platform that has it you can't actually
even<00:01:48.330> fall<00:01:48.540> off<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.810> top<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.200> tower

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
even fall off the top of this tower

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.020 
even fall off the top of this tower
there<00:01:49.650> is<00:01:49.860> walls<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.430> way<00:01:50.670> around<00:01:50.940> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
there is walls all the way around the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.030 
there is walls all the way around the
outside<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.720> two<00:01:51.900> grenadiers<00:01:52.440> skeletons

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
outside and two grenadiers skeletons

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.360 
outside and two grenadiers skeletons
have<00:01:53.370> spawned<00:01:54.180> trying<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.810> get<00:01:55.170> us<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:56.160> we

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
have spawned trying to get us but we

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.460 
have spawned trying to get us but we
knew<00:01:56.610> about<00:01:56.760> them<00:01:57.120> so<00:01:57.510> we<00:01:57.630> were<00:01:57.750> prepared<00:01:58.230> for

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
knew about them so we were prepared for

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.980 
knew about them so we were prepared for
their<00:01:58.770> ways<00:01:58.980> and<00:01:59.550> we<00:02:00.090> were<00:02:00.180> prepared<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.630> steal

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
their ways and we were prepared to steal

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
their ways and we were prepared to steal
them<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.470> hey<00:02:01.590> afterwards<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.310> there's

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
them and hey afterwards and there's

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.430 
them and hey afterwards and there's
another<00:02:02.700> invisible<00:02:03.270> platform<00:02:03.720> walkway<00:02:04.140> thing

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
another invisible platform walkway thing

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.990 
another invisible platform walkway thing
which<00:02:04.740> we<00:02:04.890> will<00:02:05.010> see<00:02:05.160> now<00:02:05.340> our<00:02:05.520> way<00:02:05.640> jumping

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
which we will see now our way jumping

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.840 
which we will see now our way jumping
off<00:02:06.090> here<00:02:06.300> here<00:02:06.810> we<00:02:06.900> go<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:08.340> will<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.640> us<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
off here here we go this will get us a

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.400 
off here here we go this will get us a
roast<00:02:09.090> chicken<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:09.899> must<00:02:10.140> once<00:02:10.320> again

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
roast chicken and we must once again

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.380 
roast chicken and we must once again
prepares<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.040> room<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.460> our<00:02:11.520> inventory<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.240> it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
prepares a room in our inventory for it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.930 
prepares a room in our inventory for it
so<00:02:12.570> let's<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.960> that<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.230> then<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.430> witness

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
so let's do that and then we can witness

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.990 
so let's do that and then we can witness
the<00:02:15.570> walls<00:02:15.840> which<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.709> can<00:02:16.890> find<00:02:17.220> us<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.880> this

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
the walls which you can find us to this

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.630 
the walls which you can find us to this
platform<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.870> only<00:02:19.320> allow<00:02:19.560> us<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.980> exit<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.430> in

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
platform and only allow us to exit it in

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:29.449 
platform and only allow us to exit it in
the<00:02:20.850> correct<00:02:21.120> pathway<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:22.230> we<00:02:22.320> go<00:02:28.340> yeah<00:02:29.340> they

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
the correct pathway here we go yeah they

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.920 
the correct pathway here we go yeah they
don't<00:02:29.580> even<00:02:29.730> intend<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.360> make<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.660> look<00:02:30.780> like

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
don't even intend to make you look like

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.570 
don't even intend to make you look like
something<00:02:31.590> was<00:02:31.680> here<00:02:31.830> already<00:02:32.100> is<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.280> try<00:02:32.520> to

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
something was here already is to try to

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.220 
something was here already is to try to
focus<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> eye<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.540> we<00:02:33.660> can't<00:02:33.840> see<00:02:34.050> that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
focus in the eye so we can't see that

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.620 
focus in the eye so we can't see that
but<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.890> see<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.400> steal<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> powerup<00:02:36.510> for

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
but we can see that steal a powerup for

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.040 
but we can see that steal a powerup for
it<00:02:36.930> as<00:02:37.050> well<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.770> we<00:02:38.430> will<00:02:38.910> proceed<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.360> here<00:02:39.780> we

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
it as well so we will proceed in here we

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.290 
it as well so we will proceed in here we
will<00:02:40.200> save<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.590> game

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
will save the game

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.140 
will save the game
then<00:02:41.480> we<00:02:41.930> will<00:02:42.080> die<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:43.100> we<00:02:43.310> will<00:02:43.430> not<00:02:43.760> be

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
then we will die and so we will not be

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.300 
then we will die and so we will not be
seeing<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.660> okay<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.800> that<00:02:45.860> bring<00:02:46.100> us<00:02:46.190> into

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
seeing that okay is that bring us into

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.920 
seeing that okay is that bring us into
the<00:02:46.460> homestretch<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.970> tower<00:02:47.270> of<00:02:47.390> execution

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
the homestretch of tower of execution

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.300 
the homestretch of tower of execution
there's<00:02:48.140> only<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.350> little<00:02:48.530> bit<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:48.800> go<00:02:48.950> so

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
there's only a little bit of it to go so

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.280 
there's only a little bit of it to go so
we<00:02:49.430> will<00:02:49.790> now<00:02:49.910> proceed<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.300> not<00:02:50.600> be<00:02:50.780> executed

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
we will now proceed to not be executed

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.080 
we will now proceed to not be executed
in<00:02:51.410> multiple<00:02:51.740> ways<00:02:51.890> firstly<00:02:52.370> not<00:02:52.610> killed<00:02:52.910> by

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
in multiple ways firstly not killed by

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.120 
in multiple ways firstly not killed by
sweepy<00:02:53.540> index<00:02:53.990> not<00:02:54.260> killed<00:02:54.500> by<00:02:54.710> bolognese

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
sweepy index not killed by bolognese

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.050 
sweepy index not killed by bolognese
sauce<00:02:55.720> easily<00:02:57.100> source<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.280> see<00:02:58.310> because<00:02:58.850> he

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
sauce easily source you see because he

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.900 
sauce easily source you see because he
prefers<00:02:59.480> lasagna<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.770> good<00:03:01.070> for<00:03:01.310> him<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.610> say

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
prefers lasagna and good for him I say

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.100 
prefers lasagna and good for him I say
so<00:03:02.840> we've<00:03:03.140> now<00:03:03.320> got<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:05.560> spike<00:03:07.960> see<00:03:08.960> how<00:03:09.050> the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
so we've now got a spike see how the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:42.370 
so we've now got a spike see how the
hell<00:03:35.770> it's<00:03:38.560> down<00:03:39.560> onto<00:03:39.920> it<00:03:40.100> yeah<00:03:41.080> I'm<00:03:42.080> not<00:03:42.230> sure

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
hell it's down onto it yeah I'm not sure

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.110 
hell it's down onto it yeah I'm not sure
how<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:42.560> supposed<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:42.950> find<00:03:43.160> these<00:03:43.490> things<00:03:43.670> do

how you supposed to find these things do

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.590 
how you supposed to find these things do
what<00:03:44.330> I<00:03:44.360> do

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
what I do

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.680 
what I do
various<00:03:45.350> alleges<00:03:46.250> death<00:03:46.670> but<00:03:47.360> fine

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:13.220 

thank<00:03:51.690> goodness<00:04:10.070> there's<00:04:11.070> one<00:04:11.220> over<00:04:12.230> the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
thank goodness there's one over the

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:52.340 
thank goodness there's one over the
other<00:04:40.370> now<00:04:41.370> we<00:04:41.430> can<00:04:41.700> exit<00:04:42.090> this<00:04:42.210> place<00:04:51.200> we<00:04:52.200> have

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
other now we can exit this place we have

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.490 
other now we can exit this place we have
multiple<00:04:52.890> slits<00:04:53.220> but<00:04:54.090> we<00:04:54.780> can<00:04:54.930> bypass<00:04:55.110> them

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
multiple slits but we can bypass them

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.140 
multiple slits but we can bypass them
using<00:04:55.770> our<00:04:55.860> skills<00:04:56.250> by<00:04:56.640> jumping<00:04:56.910> on<00:04:57.000> these

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
using our skills by jumping on these

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.210 
using our skills by jumping on these
quarks<00:04:57.600> which<00:04:57.870> then<00:04:58.050> sink<00:04:58.380> into<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.680> lava<00:04:58.710> I

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
quarks which then sink into the lava I

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.920 
quarks which then sink into the lava I
don't<00:04:59.730> know<00:04:59.820> how<00:04:59.970> they<00:05:00.090> survive<00:05:00.420> being<00:05:00.660> alive

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
don't know how they survive being alive

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.230
