00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it's still a jumpy focus compared to a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.260 
it's still a jumpy focus compared to a
video<00:01:12.600> camera<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> Sony<00:01:14.430> nex-5

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
video camera or like the Sony nex-5

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.260 
video camera or like the Sony nex-5
which<00:01:15.540> has<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> much<00:01:15.990> smoother<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:17.270> focusing

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
which has a much smoother on focusing

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.679 
which has a much smoother on focusing
more<00:01:18.960> gradual<00:01:19.560> fade<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.670> focus<00:01:21.240> instead<00:01:21.479> of

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
more gradual fade and focus instead of

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.390 
more gradual fade and focus instead of
going<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.470> way<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.890> all<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> way<00:01:23.189> out

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
with an external mic hooked up to it how

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.660 
with an external mic hooked up to it how
the<00:02:01.710> focusing<00:02:02.869> looks<00:02:03.869> when<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:05.009> hear

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the focusing looks when you don't hear

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.859 
the focusing looks when you don't hear
the<00:02:06.659> when<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.710> don't<00:02:07.890> actually<00:02:08.009> hear<00:02:08.399> it

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.869 
it's still not the best every time the
camera<00:02:14.290> moves<00:02:14.680> or<00:02:14.890> something<00:02:15.220> moves<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.730> it

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
camera moves or something moves in it it

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.009 
camera moves or something moves in it it
resets<00:02:16.420> its<00:02:16.569> focus<00:02:18.510> objects<00:02:19.510> moving<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:19.930> the

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
resets its focus objects moving in the

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.580 
resets its focus objects moving in the
foreground<00:02:20.670> will<00:02:21.670> cause<00:02:21.879> it<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.209> change

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
foreground will cause it to change

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:31.440 
foreground will cause it to change
obviously<00:02:28.860> yeah<00:02:29.860> if<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.730> just<00:02:30.760> move<00:02:31.090> my<00:02:31.120> hand

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
obviously yeah if I just move my hand

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.740 
obviously yeah if I just move my hand
around<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:33.060> hear<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.150> moving<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.569> have

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
around and hear it moving and but I have

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.300 
around and hear it moving and but I have
a<00:02:40.780> mic<00:02:41.019> on<00:02:41.200> now<00:02:41.470> I'm<00:02:41.590> going<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:41.799> pull<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.129> mic

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
a mic on now I'm going to pull the mic

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.949 
a mic on now I'm going to pull the mic
out<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.910> hopefully<00:02:43.329> it's<00:02:43.450> going<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.630> record

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
out and hopefully it's going to record

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.920 
out and hopefully it's going to record
that<00:02:44.260> audio<00:02:45.299> I'm<00:02:46.299> just<00:02:46.480> going<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.630> pull<00:02:46.840> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
that audio I'm just going to pull the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.360 
that audio I'm just going to pull the
mic<00:02:47.110> out<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.530> hopefully<00:02:47.799> I'll<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:48.099> start

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
mic out and hopefully I'll just start

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.430 
mic out and hopefully I'll just start
recording<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.849> audio<00:02:49.000> from<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.630> external

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
recording the audio from the external

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.800 
recording the audio from the external
mic<00:02:50.590> we're<00:02:51.040> going<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.220> try<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:54.420> okay<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.599> got<00:02:55.780> a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
mic we're going to try that okay I got a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.500 
mic we're going to try that okay I got a
red<00:02:56.019> flashing<00:02:56.530> light<00:02:56.819> I'm<00:02:57.819> not<00:02:58.090> sure<00:02:58.299> if<00:02:58.390> it's

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
red flashing light I'm not sure if it's

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.220 
red flashing light I'm not sure if it's
recording<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.989> audio<00:03:00.360> I'm<00:03:01.360> moving<00:03:01.810> around<00:03:02.019> a

recording the audio I'm moving around a

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.130 
recording the audio I'm moving around a
little<00:03:02.349> bit<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:04.450> case<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.079> did<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:06.989> if<00:03:07.989> it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
little bit in case it did and if it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.009 
little bit in case it did and if it
didn't<00:03:08.590> look<00:03:08.799> if<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.430> didn't<00:03:09.790> I'll<00:03:09.970> go<00:03:10.900> ahead

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
and reshoot this in fact let me just go

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.680 
and reshoot this in fact let me just go
ahead<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.670> reshoot<00:03:15.910> because<00:03:16.209> there's<00:03:16.359> I<00:03:16.510> got

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
ahead and reshoot because there's I got

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.170 
ahead and reshoot because there's I got
this<00:03:16.810> red<00:03:17.019> icon<00:03:18.060> okay<00:03:19.060> um<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.870> had<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> red<00:03:20.500> icon

you'll<00:03:32.500> be<00:03:32.620> able<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.889> hear<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:34.480> focus

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
you'll be able to hear the focus

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:57.390 
you'll be able to hear the focus
adjustment<00:03:36.940> on<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.239> lens

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.580 

and<00:03:58.400> while<00:03:59.030> somebody's<00:03:59.510> talking<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.260> it's

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
and while somebody's talking and it's

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.180 
and while somebody's talking and it's
going<00:04:00.920> on<00:04:01.510> they<00:04:02.510> can<00:04:02.540> be<00:04:02.720> rather<00:04:03.560> annoying<00:04:04.010> to

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
going on they can be rather annoying to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.570 
going on they can be rather annoying to
hear<00:04:04.340> that<00:04:04.550> one's<00:04:04.730> wrong<00:04:06.100> for<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.190> person

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
shooting the video me I can barely hear

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.970 
shooting the video me I can barely hear
that<00:04:09.830> lens<00:04:10.070> doing<00:04:10.490> it<00:04:10.610> but<00:04:10.760> since<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.120> body<00:04:11.360> is

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
that lens doing it but since the body is

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.780 
that lens doing it but since the body is
attached<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.280> lens

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
attached to the lens

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.849 
attached to the lens
it's<00:04:14.540> just<00:04:17.049> transferring<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.200> sound<00:04:18.530> into

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
it's just transferring the sound into

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.970 
it's just transferring the sound into
the<00:04:18.950> mic<00:04:19.160> so<00:04:19.519> much<00:04:19.730> easier<00:04:20.180> because<00:04:20.420> the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
the mic so much easier because the

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.210 
the mic so much easier because the
vibrations<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.280> and<00:04:23.470> so<00:04:24.470> on<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:24.800> forth<00:04:25.100> so

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
vibrations and and so on and so forth so

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.350 
vibrations and and so on and so forth so
you<00:04:25.250> can<00:04:25.520> see<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.850> difference<00:04:26.180> from<00:04:26.270> the

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
you can see the difference from the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.170 
you can see the difference from the
beginning<00:04:26.540> of<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.900> video<00:04:27.020> where<00:04:27.680> I'm<00:04:27.770> talking
