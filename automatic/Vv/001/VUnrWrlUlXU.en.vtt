00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.400 
using and then right here is the actual
setup<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.489> was<00:00:32.610> using<00:00:32.759> just<00:00:33.660> two<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.110> pink

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
setup I was using just two of the pink

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.020 
setup I was using just two of the pink
power<00:00:34.649> eggs<00:00:35.719> and<00:00:36.719> also<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.489> small<00:00:38.489> rig<00:00:38.790> would

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
power eggs and also the small rig would

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.900 
power eggs and also the small rig would
be<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> small<00:00:39.750> weight<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.590> I'd<00:00:41.160> say<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.670> leader

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
be a small weight and I'd say the leader

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.340 
be a small weight and I'd say the leader
was<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.360> 2<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> 3<00:00:43.110> feet<00:00:43.290> long<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:46.140> always

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
was about 2 to 3 feet long and as always

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:56.229 
was about 2 to 3 feet long and as always
my<00:00:46.739> father<00:00:47.100> catches<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.969> first<00:00:48.149> fish

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.260 

so<00:00:56.870> right<00:00:57.469> here<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:57.710> was<00:00:57.980> casting<00:00:58.730> about<00:00:58.850> maybe

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
so right here I was casting about maybe

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.479 
so right here I was casting about maybe
I'd<00:00:59.540> say<00:01:00.940> 15<00:01:01.940> 20<00:01:02.270> feet<00:01:02.629> out<00:01:03.040> these<00:01:04.040> fish<00:01:04.280> were

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
I'd say 15 20 feet out these fish were

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.670 
I'd say 15 20 feet out these fish were
liberties<00:01:05.000> like<00:01:05.420> almost<00:01:05.960> right<00:01:06.229> up<00:01:06.320> onto<00:01:06.500> the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
liberties like almost right up onto the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.980 
liberties like almost right up onto the
shore<00:01:06.740> actually<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.670> saw<00:01:08.150> one<00:01:08.330> actually<00:01:08.690> sort

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
of put right up to the shore and I could

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.940 
of put right up to the shore and I could
lead<00:01:10.970> grabbed<00:01:11.270> with<00:01:11.420> my<00:01:11.570> hands<00:01:11.960> but<00:01:12.200> that's
