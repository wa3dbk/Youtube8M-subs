00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.450
 the trains board over ancient tracks 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.080
 and are a lot louder than they are 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.790
 would 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.639
 tourism is fighting for its existence 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.400
 and the residents sleep every minute 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.719
 the houses are vibrating understand 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.520
 own word no more 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.320
 For many it is a short shock 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.779
 suddenly a freight train between the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.500
 you would have to build it through grass 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.890
 are used to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.420
 if that happens over 500 times a day 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.599
 drive through the middle Rhine Valley 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 currently more than 550 trains within 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.989
 24 hours and the train traffic will be in 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.879
 future increase by 68 percent 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.300
 according to the railway 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.100
 that is how we are damaged here islam 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.110
 trains in the rhine valley has always been 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.239
 in the past, there were a few and they 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.950
 were not heavy loaded therefore also 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.870
 it becomes much easier in people 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.170
 Freight trains we have no 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.449
 problems because these trains are quiet 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.550
 problematic is of course also next to 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.949
 Noise pollution is the shock 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.359
 the by the goods for 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.519
 especially traffic again 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.390
 is triggered 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.150
 this changes the situation 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.010
 here in the Rheintal so extreme that 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.130
 also an impairment of real estate 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 connected with them nowadays 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.640
 hardly a house at the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.009
 railway line can sell and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.080
 Thus, a dispossession of the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.340
 population is already taking place 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.630
 the inhabitants of the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.820
 Middle Rhine Valley to the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.689
 Unesco World Heritage Site is owned by 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.850
 snout full 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.920
 but the trains will be more and more 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.770
 because soon a new tunnel will be built in the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.909
 alpen opened and thus one 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.189
 freight route the goods were through 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.040
 transported across Europe and also exactly 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.810
 through this cultural landscape according to 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.820
 large quantities and in the middle of the valley 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.210
 in which each clank on both 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.369
 Part times his echo finds 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.320
 People can become heart and soul 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.110
 Circulatory problems have been for years 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.610
 proved by professionals 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.229
 50 percent of the population feel 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.300
 strong due to the burden of 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.860
 rail traffic restricted 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.200
 body never comes to rest even at night 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.670
 especially at night because if not 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.410
 Passenger traffic on the rails drives 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.930
 the track is free for the track 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.610
 freight between 22 and 6 o'clock 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.100
 much faster through the valley 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.080
 thunder noise protection has little here 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.430
 used to keep the noise protection goods 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.010
 so as brings next to nothing 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.470
 because they see that you are higher up 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.130
 and there's a bit of noise 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.830
 is held here in this cautioned 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.220
 phase 3 trial to us so we are so 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.000
 No problems at all 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.120
 to have 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.430
 through the windows we got 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.239
 partly a decision in part but 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.760
 self paid so you hear the in 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.380
 will be late but by the 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.310
 Shaking almost out of bed 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.530
 threw 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.360
 that the problem you do not hear the train 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.910
 more come but the shake 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.709
 take it all the harder then it was again 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.320
 train makes for a clink of the closets 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.519
 Residents are looking for solutions 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.769
 my wife's is 23 days a week 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.540
 busy at least 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.150
 to disassemble that glasses 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.280
 do not stand together there will be distance 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.489
 followed by one and a half centimeters 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.130
 and at the latest after one night they are 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.620
 we are all at PlÃ¤rrer again already 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.290
 something came broken broke 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.440
 who are too much more good glasses stable 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.830
 glasses and 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.930
 can the greed apple new york city 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.520
 an orchestra the mettmanner if you 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.470
 meet the save put in the 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.690
 Side already in this are quite 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.010
 other sounds numerous politicians 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.720
 take the concern of the neighbors 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.110
 increasingly serious since the 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.000
 citizen initiative rheintal 21 is in the 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.280
 signatures and speak 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.010
 for the sake of their help, how can 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.480
 The help looks a possibility and 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.560
 in noise protection here in the rhine valley 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.320
 counteract 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.980
 that's one 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.860
 speed reduction of 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.910
 Freight trains from now 110 to 50 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.210
 hours kilometer 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.620
 that would be a significant noise reduction 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.360
 cause 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.520
 in the long term, freight transport has to be here 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.780
 out of the rhine valley over a 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.540
 New construction route lead 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.269
 this is the only way the rheintal can benefit from the long term 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.940
 be relieved of this freight traffic and 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.070
 the rhine valley will become viable again 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.750
 the people here infrastructure minister 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.790
 lewentz is thinking aloud about a toll system 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.130
 according to the volume of the 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.140
 Targeted forwarding companies 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.390
 not just the German railways by far 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.700
 pay pass prices for the use 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.740
 the tracks if this after the 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.320
 noise levels are likely to be more 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.450
 Company ready to be judged 60 years 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.910
 replace old freight trains with new ones 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.090
 we have a much quieter technology 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.040
 around the world heritage the quality of life and 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.750
 the value of the houses will still be saved 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.030
 but in the long run, do not miss it 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.590
 Lead a way past the Rheintal 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.730
 to let 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.650
 a completely new curtain path 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.270
 outside the valley at the heights of 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.230
 hunsrÃ¼ck's a very expensive one 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.320
 venture 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.870
 it can take 30 years is one 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.790
 solution is implemented and, of course, was 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.440
 even on the heights, nobody does 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.980
 have to clarify in their neighborhood 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.710
 would like 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.180
 unlike the narrow rhine valley love 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.100
 but the sound spared 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.740
 bet between the rock back and forth 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.770
 Reflecting the route would be new 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.940
 on a contemporary background what up 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.260
 Nobody can replace it 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.680
 and the cracks are through the tracks 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.600
 stood to save the review 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.820
 that one can prove that he 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.590
 here in previous years house no we have there 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.890
 the negative made the chapel 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:48.240
 outdated and was through the club 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:51.040
 magical phase and there was the expected 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.440
 now he leafs is yes we would have more 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.640
 What does the farmer say or the bunch 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.670
 I'm responsible because there was a 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.040
 Student directly to the noise protection 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:06.520
 made measurements or said to ours 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.480
 guys around me struther fall my 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.960
 conclusion the kitchen is explained only the 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.319
 told 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.139
 as a teacher must be and you get so 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:20.509
 nothing replaces the success of 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.740
 short-term measures is in opinion 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.690
 by willi pusch open 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.240
 the chairman of the citizens' initiative 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.860
 calls for a night driving ban so that 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.960
 people from the middle Rhine at least 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.389
 to be able to rest at night and so on 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.889
 lead a healthier life 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.289
 to build an alternative railway line 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.180
 would be a gigantic project no matter where 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.039
 The human build always builds damage 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.199
 and the environment has to look it up 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.620
 we are curious if there is something swift 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.620
 happens
