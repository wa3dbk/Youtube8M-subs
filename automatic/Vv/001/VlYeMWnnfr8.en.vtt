00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900
 but 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.710
 taking into account the game played on the road 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.800
 made some conclusions a little 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.170
 today added three people who 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.920
 missed the game there to the best of their reasons 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.420
 there injuries cards a little bit 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.780
 tactical content of wine 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.970
 the content of the stress I was playing 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.730
 principle ok yes were again 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:01.670
 errors but generally in general in principle 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.330
 what we prepared for the game they are today 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.330
 fulfilled yes with certain some 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.400
 moments and it was heavier 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.950
 on quality bullet 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.410
 but tactically played correctly was 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.300
 the moment of use began was good 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.760
 standards could use somewhere not 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.980
 lucky but then there was an episode when 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.980
 a little bit of us grabbed to look at 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.060
 our two extreme defenders on purpose 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.370
 I had to urgently change the ending we already 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.320
 how would remove the moments from our gates we 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.840
 We have a lot of work to say so 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.270
 Equally hard principle is a team 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.459
 girl fourth-fifth year well 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.760
 about we loved in equal 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.130
 Now we are playing today's game over if 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.610
 less naturally hard to play 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:53.959
 on the road where they played the second 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:57.920
 year there 3 + and the main players 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.660
 there were added to them is difficult here 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.709
 how would she equal game on amazing 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.520
 so far with your peers on 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.720
 certain level they look on that 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.110
 certain level at which they 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.110
 should be the principle of comparing 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.480
 Now here is a young locomotive which 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.150
 you are the champion of Moscow and everything 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.900
 and 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.220
 in files russia champ and we looked 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.600
 worthy of their background 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.960
 given the fact that in principle we have 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.660
 the fourth fifth sixth year played on 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.910
 our level comparing we look 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.470
 worthy harder against us but our long 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.039
 I think next year will be easier 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.070
 there 2 will be gone from dance 3 of 4 will already be 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.070
 easier
