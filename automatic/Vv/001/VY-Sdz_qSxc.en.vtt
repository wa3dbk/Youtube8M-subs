00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:24.850 
here is the actual lens every Sigma lens
comes<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.010> its<00:01:11.130> own<00:01:11.250> pouch

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:50.969 

the<00:01:25.860> lens<00:01:26.280> hood

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.179 

is<00:01:51.979> quite<00:01:52.670> heavy

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
is quite heavy

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.499 
is quite heavy
I've<00:01:55.189> had<00:01:55.369> this<00:01:55.490> lens<00:01:55.670> for<00:01:55.729> about<00:01:55.970> half<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.330> day

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
I've had this lens for about half a day

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.330 
I've had this lens for about half a day
and<00:01:57.170> I've<00:01:57.289> got<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.470> bit<00:01:57.649> of<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:58.090> mixed<00:01:59.090> one<00:01:59.210> on<00:02:00.110> it

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
and I've got a bit of a mixed one on it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.289 
and I've got a bit of a mixed one on it
basically<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.729> build<00:02:01.970> quality<00:02:02.240> but<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:05.000> do<00:02:05.060> not

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
basically the build quality but I do not

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.120 
basically the build quality but I do not
like<00:02:05.509> some<00:02:05.959> of<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.170> able<00:02:06.319> to<00:02:06.409> focus<00:02:06.590> in<00:02:06.799> issues

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
like some of the able to focus in issues

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.680 
like some of the able to focus in issues
I<00:02:07.340> find<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:07.940> doesn't<00:02:08.179> make<00:02:08.269> quite<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.509> bit

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
I find and it doesn't make quite a bit

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.690 
I find and it doesn't make quite a bit
of<00:02:08.750> sound<00:02:08.989> when<00:02:09.649> focusing<00:02:10.220> them<00:02:10.399> when<00:02:10.549> it's

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
of sound when focusing them when it's

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.000 
of sound when focusing them when it's
hunting<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.780> find<00:02:11.810> focus<00:02:12.470> as<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.709> can<00:02:12.860> hear

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
hunting to find focus as you can hear

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.620 
hunting to find focus as you can hear
now<00:02:18.370> here's<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.430> comparison<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.269> 50

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
now here's a comparison to the 50

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.860 
now here's a comparison to the 50
millimeter<00:02:20.810> 1.4<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.310> can<00:02:22.720> see<00:02:23.720> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
millimeter 1.4 just so you can see the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.830 
millimeter 1.4 just so you can see the
size<00:02:24.080> difference<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:26.090> I'm<00:02:26.209> about<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.569> show

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
size difference and I'm about to show

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.809 
size difference and I'm about to show
you<00:02:26.900> some<00:02:27.260> photographs<00:02:27.620> I've<00:02:28.069> taken<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
you some photographs I've taken the

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.720 
you some photographs I've taken the
first<00:02:29.120> is<00:02:29.330> we've<00:02:29.480> autofocus<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:31.340> doesn't

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
first is we've autofocus and it doesn't

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.880 
first is we've autofocus and it doesn't
miss<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.599> focus<00:02:32.989> point<00:02:33.230> which<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.620> four

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
miss the focus point which is the four

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.720 
miss the focus point which is the four
and<00:02:34.069> a<00:02:34.130> shirt

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
and a shirt

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.910 
and a shirt
on<00:02:35.209> one<00:02:35.450> side<00:02:35.660> crop<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.959> picture<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.739> can<00:02:36.890> see

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
on one side crop the picture you can see

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.479 
on one side crop the picture you can see
it's<00:02:37.220> still<00:02:37.760> out<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:38.090> focus<00:02:38.890> but<00:02:39.890> in<00:02:40.100> some

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
it's still out of focus but in some

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.670 
it's still out of focus but in some
instances<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.329> very<00:02:41.750> sharp<00:02:41.989> as<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.530> with

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
instances it is very sharp as in with

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.300 
instances it is very sharp as in with
this<00:02:42.829> example<00:02:43.600> even<00:02:44.600> cropped<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.040> still

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
this example even cropped it is still

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.289 
this example even cropped it is still
very<00:02:46.519> sharp<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.970> clear<00:02:48.790> what<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.850> tend<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.150> do

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
very sharp and clear what I tend to do

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.380 
very sharp and clear what I tend to do
now<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.660> use<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.109> manually<00:02:51.760> focus<00:02:52.760> manually<00:02:53.239> as

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
now is use it manually focus manually as

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.840 
now is use it manually focus manually as
in<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:53.750> photograph<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.640> cropped

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
in this photograph and in the cropped

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.030 
in this photograph and in the cropped
version<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.600> can<00:02:56.750> see<00:02:56.900> it's<00:02:57.049> far<00:02:57.530> more<00:02:57.560> sharp

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
version you can see it's far more sharp

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.330 
version you can see it's far more sharp
than<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.790> previous<00:02:59.180> version<00:02:59.600> and<00:03:00.560> I'm<00:03:01.190> just

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
than the previous version and I'm just

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.819 
than the previous version and I'm just
showing<00:03:01.519> you<00:03:01.670> what<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.870> lens<00:03:03.049> looks<00:03:03.290> like<00:03:03.530> on

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
showing you what the lens looks like on

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.509 
showing you what the lens looks like on
my<00:03:04.640> camera

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
my camera

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.340 
my camera
overall<00:03:07.519> I'm<00:03:07.819> not<00:03:08.000> sure<00:03:08.209> how<00:03:08.569> I<00:03:08.600> if<00:03:09.079> I<00:03:09.170> could

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
overall I'm not sure how I if I could

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.280 
overall I'm not sure how I if I could
recommend<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:10.000> I'll<00:03:11.000> probably<00:03:11.660> have<00:03:12.079> to<00:03:12.260> use

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
recommend it I'll probably have to use

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.759 
recommend it I'll probably have to use
it<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.769> lot<00:03:13.010> more<00:03:14.950> which<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:16.100> intend<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.620> this

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
it a lot more which I intend to so this

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.229 
it a lot more which I intend to so this
is<00:03:18.859> my<00:03:18.980> 30<00:03:19.600> millimeter<00:03:20.600> Sigma<00:03:20.959> 1.4<00:03:22.239> digital

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
is my 30 millimeter Sigma 1.4 digital
