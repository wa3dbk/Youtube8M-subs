you need to see on tape that it's

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.850 
you need to see on tape that it's
actually<00:01:19.130> got<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.420> little<00:01:20.420> orange<00:01:20.619> that<00:01:21.619> makes

it a psycho and the other side in this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.949 
it a psycho and the other side in this
thing<00:01:25.039> is<00:01:25.280> actually<00:01:25.490> on<00:01:25.909> its<00:01:26.270> mother<00:01:26.899> so<00:01:28.959> in

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
thing is actually on its mother so in

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:34.840 
thing is actually on its mother so in
that<00:01:30.409> terms<00:01:30.709> like<00:01:30.979> both<00:01:31.399> both<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:33.850> juveniles

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
that terms like both both the juveniles

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.179 
that terms like both both the juveniles
they<00:01:35.209> should<00:01:35.390> resemble<00:01:35.689> their<00:01:36.020> parents<00:01:36.189> one

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
they should resemble their parents one

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.789 
they should resemble their parents one
day<00:01:37.219> far<00:01:37.579> then<00:01:37.789> another<00:01:38.119> mother<00:01:38.799> quite

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
day far then another mother quite

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.580 
day far then another mother quite
machine<00:01:40.310> out<00:01:40.549> of<00:01:40.579> coincidence<00:01:41.439> which<00:01:42.439> is

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
machine out of coincidence which is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.109 
machine out of coincidence which is
crazy<00:01:42.829> when<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.250> think<00:01:43.280> about<00:01:43.489> it<00:01:43.789> because

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
crazy when you think about it because

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.899 
crazy when you think about it because
out<00:01:44.299> of<00:01:44.360> all<00:01:44.599> the<00:01:44.840> permutations<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.759> the

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
out of all the permutations and in the

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.600 
out of all the permutations and in the
probability<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.659> that<00:01:48.110> things<00:01:49.099> can<00:01:49.700> happen

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
probability that that things can happen

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.179 
probability that that things can happen
these<00:01:52.610> two<00:01:52.909> baby<00:01:53.179> boys<00:01:53.509> many<00:01:54.229> parents

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.480 

the<00:01:58.729> reality<00:01:59.240> is<00:01:59.270> people<00:01:59.740> quotas<00:02:00.740> they<00:02:01.189> change

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
the reality is people quotas they change

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.649 
the reality is people quotas they change
over<00:02:01.670> time<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:03.820> it's<00:02:04.820> probably<00:02:05.090> highly

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
over time and it's probably highly

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.490 
over time and it's probably highly
likely<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.229> time<00:02:06.729> in<00:02:07.729> this<00:02:07.880> iteration<00:02:08.500> they

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
likely that time in this iteration they

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.580 
likely that time in this iteration they
come<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:11.840> Winston<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:15.160> change<00:02:17.230> more<00:02:18.230> than<00:02:18.290> you

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
come in Winston and change more than you

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.670 
come in Winston and change more than you
think<00:02:19.330> they<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.599> parents<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:21.110> there<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.500> men

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
think they the parents in there for men

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.170 
think they the parents in there for men
just<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:22.700> they<00:02:22.910> just<00:02:23.150> know<00:02:27.040> yeah<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:29.060> other

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
just so they just know yeah the other

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.500 
just so they just know yeah the other
one<00:02:29.360> being<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.890> Kohaku<00:02:31.489> which<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.299> father

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
one being the Kohaku which is the father

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.229 
one being the Kohaku which is the father
they<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.959> smaller<00:02:33.260> one<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.730> can<00:02:34.880> see<00:02:34.910> how

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
they the smaller one and you can see how

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.900 
they the smaller one and you can see how
big<00:02:35.660> they<00:02:35.840> are<00:02:36.220> giants<00:02:37.220> compared<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.730> them

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
big they are giants compared to them

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.320 
big they are giants compared to them
they're<00:02:38.690> juveniles

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.059
