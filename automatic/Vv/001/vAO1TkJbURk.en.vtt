straw here it's about a foot long it's
intended<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.579> to<00:00:17.669> put<00:00:17.849> the<00:00:17.970> antenna

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:18.329 
intended for you to put the antenna

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:19.759 
intended for you to put the antenna
through<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.839> then<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.109> antenna<00:00:19.470> comes

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:19.769 
through and then the antenna comes

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.159 
through and then the antenna comes
through<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> shell<00:00:20.460> up<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.839> because

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:22.169 
through the shell up like that because

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.149 
through the shell up like that because

length<00:00:32.539> however<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:34.829> don't<00:00:35.340> lose<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:36.269> much

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
length however you don't lose as much

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.569 
length however you don't lose as much
range<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.289> might<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:38.039> and<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.280> want

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
range as you might think and I just want

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.009 
range as you might think and I just want
to<00:00:38.640> show<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.719> initially

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
to show you that here I was initially

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.470 
to show you that here I was initially
afraid<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> I'd<00:00:40.710> lose<00:00:40.920> all<00:00:41.100> my<00:00:41.280> range<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
afraid that I'd lose all my range but in

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.240 
afraid that I'd lose all my range but in
fact<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.899> don't<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.469> I've<00:00:43.590> tried<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.039> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
fact you don't so I've tried this I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.189 
fact you don't so I've tried this I
don't<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.489> every<00:00:45.359> time<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.839> put<00:00:46.079> my

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
don't like every time I have to put my

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.400 
don't like every time I have to put my
shell<00:00:46.440> back<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.859> to<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.309> thread<00:00:48.179> that

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
shell back on to have to thread that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.560 
shell back on to have to thread that
straw<00:00:49.410> through<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> hole<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.640> shell<00:00:50.879> so

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
straw through the hole in the shell so

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.369 
straw through the hole in the shell so
what<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.929> did<00:00:52.019> was<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.670> where<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
what I did was you can see where the

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.720 
what I did was you can see where the
antenna<00:00:55.379> comes<00:00:55.679> out<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.980> black<00:00:56.190> box<00:00:56.219> here

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
antenna comes out of the black box here

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
antenna comes out of the black box here
I<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.629> pulled<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
I just pulled it out of there and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.479 
I just pulled it out of there and
wrapped<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.059> around<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.890> mounts<00:01:02.280> here

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
wrapped it around the the mounts here

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.930 
wrapped it around the the mounts here
the<00:01:02.879> shell<00:01:03.269> mounts<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:04.350> used<00:01:04.590> some<00:01:04.920> black<00:01:05.670> tape

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
the shell mounts we used some black tape

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.120 
the shell mounts we used some black tape
just<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> secure<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.410> here<00:01:07.620> I'll<00:01:07.740> probably<00:01:07.860> put

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
just to secure it here I'll probably put

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.780 
just to secure it here I'll probably put
another<00:01:08.370> piece<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.960> keep<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.320> up

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
another piece here just to keep that up

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.730 
another piece here just to keep that up
but<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:11.880> any<00:01:12.030> rate<00:01:12.090> now<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.320> throw<00:01:13.470> my

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
but at any rate now I can just throw my

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.610 
but at any rate now I can just throw my
shell<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:15.140> like<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.490> no<00:01:17.490> problems<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.620> let's

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
shell on like that no problems and let's

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.780 
shell on like that no problems and let's
go<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> field<00:01:20.280> I'll<00:01:20.430> give<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> an

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
go out to the field I'll give you an

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.610 
go out to the field I'll give you an
idea<00:01:20.910> what<00:01:21.300> kind<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.540> range<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.080> thing<00:01:22.320> still

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
idea what kind of range this thing still

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.580 
idea what kind of range this thing still
has<00:01:23.150> okay<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.630> I've<00:01:25.080> got<00:01:25.290> no

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
has okay so you can see I've got no

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.690 
has okay so you can see I've got no

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
protruding as it's all underneath like I

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.710 
protruding as it's all underneath like I
showed<00:01:31.800> you<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> last<00:01:32.190> clip<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.510> I'll<00:01:33.570> just

give you an idea how far it can go and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.010 
give you an idea how far it can go and
they<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.030> all<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> way<00:01:36.300> down<00:01:36.540> there<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> don't

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
they go all the way down there I don't

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.450 
they go all the way down there I don't
even<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.260> how<00:01:37.350> far<00:01:37.620> that<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.830> but<00:01:38.160> I<00:01:38.190> wouldn't

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
even know how far that is but I wouldn't

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.430 
even know how far that is but I wouldn't
want<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> operate<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.870> further<00:01:40.140> than<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
want to operate it further than that

00:01:40.440 --> 00:02:06.990 
want to operate it further than that
anyway<00:01:41.030> I'll<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.090> my<00:01:42.390> camera<00:01:42.630> over

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.360 
and all the way at the fence there like
I<00:02:10.840> said<00:02:11.080> I'm<00:02:11.260> not<00:02:11.590> sure<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.950> would<00:02:12.070> want<00:02:12.280> to
