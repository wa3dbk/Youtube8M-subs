to here then I'm just going to make a
triangle<00:01:29.610> shape<00:01:32.540> on<00:01:33.540> both<00:01:34.200> sides<00:01:34.619> just

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
triangle shape on both sides just

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
triangle shape on both sides just
then<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.860> rest<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> hair<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:39.320> pulled<00:01:40.320> back

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.539 
my bangs and then the rest of this here
I<00:01:54.460> just<00:01:55.290> pull<00:01:56.290> back<00:01:57.240> put<00:01:58.240> out<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.540> way<00:01:58.720> and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
I just pull back put out the way and

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.789 
I just pull back put out the way and
that's<00:02:00.549> what<00:02:00.759> we're<00:02:00.909> working<00:02:01.060> with<00:02:01.299> I<00:02:01.659> cut<00:02:02.649> my

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
that's what we're working with I cut my

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.310 
that's what we're working with I cut my
bangs<00:02:03.040> while<00:02:03.340> they're<00:02:03.520> dry<00:02:03.820> because<00:02:04.149> my<00:02:05.049> hair

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
bangs while they're dry because my hair

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.550 
bangs while they're dry because my hair
is<00:02:05.350> not<00:02:05.560> naturally<00:02:06.159> straight<00:02:06.490> it's<00:02:07.479> my<00:02:08.319> bangs

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
is not naturally straight it's my bangs

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.740 
is not naturally straight it's my bangs
will<00:02:08.800> curl<00:02:09.039> up<00:02:09.220> when<00:02:09.369> they're<00:02:09.520> wet<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.119> so

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
will curl up when they're wet so so

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.650 
will curl up when they're wet so so
start<00:02:11.170> by<00:02:11.410> taking<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:14.590> just<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.790> middle

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
start by taking like just a middle

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.220 
start by taking like just a middle
section<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.180> like<00:02:22.330> using<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.690> small<00:02:22.930> comb

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
section and I like using a small comb

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.710 
section and I like using a small comb
like<00:02:23.440> this<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.010> rat<00:02:24.459> difficult<00:02:25.360> because<00:02:25.510> it's

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
like this and rat difficult because it's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.240 
like this and rat difficult because it's
just<00:02:25.870> easier<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.380> like<00:02:26.940> part<00:02:27.940> your<00:02:28.170> yeah<00:02:29.170> ok<00:02:30.160> so

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
just easier to like part your yeah ok so

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.040 
just easier to like part your yeah ok so
I'm<00:02:30.430> actually<00:02:30.519> gonna<00:02:30.790> cut<00:02:31.120> start<00:02:31.660> with<00:02:31.840> just

out<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.430> short<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:16.000> start<00:03:16.299> by<00:03:16.359> cutting<00:03:16.690> off<00:03:16.840> a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
out to short I start by cutting off a

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.280 
out to short I start by cutting off a
little<00:03:17.260> bit<00:03:17.470> at<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.650> time<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.780> yeah<00:03:20.079> I'm<00:03:20.170> gonna

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
little bit at a time and yeah I'm gonna

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:36.850 
little bit at a time and yeah I'm gonna
cook<00:03:20.470> them<00:03:20.650> straight<00:03:21.040> across<00:03:21.250> like

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.240 

think<00:03:37.490> I'm<00:03:37.700> gonna<00:03:37.790> go<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:38.060> little<00:03:38.390> bit<00:03:38.690> lower

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
think I'm gonna go a little bit lower

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.920 
think I'm gonna go a little bit lower
see<00:03:40.250> that's<00:03:40.550> not<00:03:40.640> my<00:03:40.940> goal<00:03:41.120> too<00:03:41.390> low<00:03:41.570> either

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
see that's not my goal too low either

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.170 
see that's not my goal too low either
because<00:03:42.290> like<00:03:42.500> if<00:03:42.650> we're<00:03:42.830> going<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.180> earlier

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
because like if we're going to earlier

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.880 
because like if we're going to earlier
being<00:03:44.480> then<00:03:45.020> they're<00:03:45.290> going<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.620> probably

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
being then they're going to probably

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.010 
being then they're going to probably
look<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.250> little<00:03:46.370> bit<00:03:46.550> shorter<00:03:46.940> anyway<00:03:47.330> once<00:03:47.870> i
