00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:10.419 
we're going to take a look at jumping

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.619 
we're going to take a look at jumping
big<00:00:10.780> jumps<00:00:11.259> unlike<00:00:12.129> any<00:00:12.490> other<00:00:12.820> part<00:00:13.119> to<00:00:13.419> dirt

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
big jumps unlike any other part to dirt

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.989 
big jumps unlike any other part to dirt
biking<00:00:13.990> jumps<00:00:14.949> has<00:00:15.129> the<00:00:15.309> biggest<00:00:15.489> potential

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:15.999 
biking jumps has the biggest potential

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.540 
biking jumps has the biggest potential
danger<00:00:16.690> so<00:00:16.900> we<00:00:17.020> need<00:00:17.289> to<00:00:17.500> keep<00:00:17.740> safety<00:00:18.100> first

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
danger so we need to keep safety first

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.550 
danger so we need to keep safety first
now<00:00:19.150> what<00:00:19.330> we're<00:00:19.450> focusing<00:00:19.930> on<00:00:20.080> here<00:00:20.140> is

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
now what we're focusing on here is

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.650 
now what we're focusing on here is
making<00:00:20.950> sure<00:00:21.130> our<00:00:21.160> body<00:00:21.550> positions<00:00:22.090> right<00:00:22.300> our

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
making sure our body positions right our

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.470 
making sure our body positions right our
throttle<00:00:23.260> controls<00:00:23.920> right<00:00:24.250> and<00:00:24.580> starting<00:00:25.390> a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
throttle controls right and starting a

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.180 
throttle controls right and starting a
little<00:00:25.720> bit<00:00:25.840> smaller<00:00:26.290> as<00:00:26.650> we<00:00:26.830> get<00:00:27.010> more

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
little bit smaller as we get more

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.370 
little bit smaller as we get more
confident<00:00:27.760> we<00:00:28.150> start<00:00:28.450> to<00:00:28.600> go<00:00:28.780> bigger<00:00:29.050> with<00:00:29.260> the

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
confident we start to go bigger with the

with your takeoff ramp there's a few

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:43.259 
with your takeoff ramp there's a few
potential<00:00:41.440> dangers<00:00:42.010> you<00:00:42.339> can<00:00:42.519> get<00:00:42.730> ruts<00:00:42.999> on

potential dangers you can get ruts on
the<00:00:43.390> take-off<00:00:43.809> ramp<00:00:44.079> which<00:00:44.379> actually<00:00:44.890> kick

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
the take-off ramp which actually kick

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.279 
the take-off ramp which actually kick
your<00:00:45.280> bike<00:00:45.460> side<00:00:45.850> to<00:00:46.179> side<00:00:46.420> as<00:00:46.659> you<00:00:46.809> take<00:00:47.050> off

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.799 
your bike side to side as you take off
we<00:00:47.769> can<00:00:47.949> also<00:00:48.100> get<00:00:48.579> kicker<00:00:48.969> bumps<00:00:49.420> now<00:00:49.600> they

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
we can also get kicker bumps now they

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.020 
we can also get kicker bumps now they
kick<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.319> back<00:00:50.589> end<00:00:50.890> of<00:00:51.039> the<00:00:51.129> motorcycle<00:00:51.879> up

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
kick the back end of the motorcycle up

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.759 
kick the back end of the motorcycle up
and<00:00:52.239> try<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.479> kick<00:00:52.690> us<00:00:52.809> over<00:00:53.109> the<00:00:53.199> handlebars

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
and try to kick us over the handlebars

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.250 
and try to kick us over the handlebars
you<00:00:54.190> can<00:00:54.399> get<00:00:54.639> wet<00:00:55.059> spots<00:00:55.479> on<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.839> take-off

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
you can get wet spots on the take-off

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.770 
you can get wet spots on the take-off
ramp<00:00:56.530> which<00:00:56.739> obviously<00:00:57.519> cause<00:00:57.969> us<00:00:58.210> to<00:00:58.359> have<00:00:58.539> no

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
ramp which obviously cause us to have no

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.079 
ramp which obviously cause us to have no
traction<00:00:59.109> wheel<00:00:59.799> spin<00:01:00.190> can<00:01:00.460> also<00:01:00.639> make<00:01:01.059> a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
traction wheel spin can also make a

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.090 
traction wheel spin can also make a
scull<00:01:01.449> over<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.780> handlebars<00:01:02.289> so<00:01:02.799> what<00:01:02.979> we're

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
scull over the handlebars so what we're

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.280 
scull over the handlebars so what we're
looking<00:01:03.129> for<00:01:03.579> in<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.789> take-off<00:01:04.210> ramp<00:01:04.479> is<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.780> nice

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
looking for in a take-off ramp is a nice

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.860 
looking for in a take-off ramp is a nice
smooth<00:01:06.100> ramp<00:01:06.430> that<00:01:06.910> doesn't<00:01:07.330> have<00:01:07.420> any<00:01:07.570> bumps

doesn't have any ruts and has got lots
of<00:01:10.540> traction<00:01:10.870> now<00:01:11.470> once<00:01:11.710> we've<00:01:11.890> got<00:01:12.040> our

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
of traction now once we've got our

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.920 
of traction now once we've got our
take-off<00:01:12.610> sorted<00:01:13.060> we<00:01:13.210> need<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.480> go<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.720> have<00:01:13.870> a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
look at our landing area now there's a

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.550 
look at our landing area now there's a
few<00:01:15.970> things<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.360> can<00:01:16.600> cause<00:01:16.810> us<00:01:17.080> grief<00:01:17.350> on

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
few things that can cause us grief on

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.620 
few things that can cause us grief on
the<00:01:17.650> landing<00:01:18.130> if<00:01:18.280> it's<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.940> little<00:01:19.090> bit<00:01:19.330> higher

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
the landing if it's a little bit higher

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.140 
the landing if it's a little bit higher
on<00:01:19.660> one<00:01:20.050> side<00:01:20.590> than<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.010> other<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.790> need<00:01:21.970> to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
on one side than the other you need to

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.970 
on one side than the other you need to
jump<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.540> bit<00:01:22.660> further<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.530> get<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.890> your

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
jump a bit further to get to your

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.240 
jump a bit further to get to your
landing<00:01:24.400> ramp<00:01:24.810> bumps<00:01:25.810> ruts<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.620> of<00:01:26.950> course

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
landing ramp bumps ruts and of course

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.220 
landing ramp bumps ruts and of course
wet<00:01:27.580> spots<00:01:27.970> on<00:01:28.120> the<00:01:28.270> landing<00:01:28.690> ramp<00:01:28.810> are<00:01:29.050> all

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
wet spots on the landing ramp are all

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.590 
wet spots on the landing ramp are all
factors<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:29.950> will<00:01:30.580> affect<00:01:30.910> your<00:01:31.060> landing<00:01:31.480> as

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
factors that will affect your landing as

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.050 
factors that will affect your landing as
well<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.500> now<00:01:32.680> we've<00:01:32.920> assessed<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.520> truck<00:01:33.790> our

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
well so now we've assessed the truck our

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
crazy movements to the bike now if you

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.830 
crazy movements to the bike now if you
gas<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.370> very<00:01:51.670> very<00:01:51.940> hard<00:01:52.210> on<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.450> take-off
