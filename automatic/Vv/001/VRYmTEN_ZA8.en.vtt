side you see a back view start at my

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.690 
side you see a back view start at my
stomach<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.870> I'm<00:02:28.530> pulling<00:02:28.770> away<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.580> that's

in the last part of these four muscles
we've<00:02:49.410> covered<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.920> supraspinatus<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
we've covered the supraspinatus the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.790 
we've covered the supraspinatus the
infraspinatus<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.900> teres<00:02:52.200> minor<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.709> now

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
infraspinatus the teres minor and now

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.580 
infraspinatus the teres minor and now
we're<00:02:52.920> doing<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.100> subscapularis<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:54.590> dies

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
we're doing the subscapularis and dies

we're doing the subscapularis and dies
me<00:02:55.860> worked<00:02:56.580> when<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.060> pull<00:02:57.360> towards<00:02:58.019> me<00:02:58.200> so

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
me worked when I pull towards me so

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.770 
me worked when I pull towards me so
unlike<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.220> last<00:02:59.519> movement<00:03:00.120> where<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.420> started

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
unlike the last movement where I started

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.020 
unlike the last movement where I started
out<00:03:00.900> my<00:03:00.989> stomach<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.709> time<00:03:01.950> I'm<00:03:02.130> pulling<00:03:02.580> to

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
and that's going to be working the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.229 
and that's going to be working the
subscapularis<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.860> most<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.730> that's<00:03:09.030> when

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
subscapularis the most and that's when

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.170 
subscapularis the most and that's when

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.120 
you'll be dunzo here's the last exercise
in<00:03:33.390> my<00:03:33.510> rotator<00:03:33.959> cuff<00:03:34.049> arsenal<00:03:34.799> i<00:03:34.859> guess<00:03:35.010> you

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
in my rotator cuff arsenal i guess you

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.130 
in my rotator cuff arsenal i guess you
could<00:03:35.250> say<00:03:35.459> it's<00:03:36.030> um<00:03:36.269> called<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.660> Scarecrow

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
could say it's um called the Scarecrow

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.660 
could say it's um called the Scarecrow
you<00:03:37.500> most<00:03:37.829> of<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.040> probably<00:03:38.070> seen<00:03:38.489> Matthew

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
you most of you probably seen Matthew

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.340 
you most of you probably seen Matthew
August<00:03:39.150> do<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.420> he<00:03:39.600> does<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.870> lying<00:03:40.109> down<00:03:40.200> on

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
August do this he does it lying down on

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.420 
August do this he does it lying down on
a<00:03:40.440> bench<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.799> little<00:03:41.010> bit<00:03:41.100> different

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
a bench a little bit different

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.550 
a bench a little bit different
differently<00:03:41.820> than<00:03:41.970> myself<00:03:42.120> but<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:42.959> like<00:03:43.440> this

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
differently than myself but I like this

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.289 
differently than myself but I like this
move<00:03:43.769> it's<00:03:44.100> mainly<00:03:44.459> focuses<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.180> the

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
move it's mainly focuses on the

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.150 
move it's mainly focuses on the
infraspinatus<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.170> teres<00:03:46.440> minor<00:03:46.620> but<00:03:47.130> I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
infraspinatus and the teres minor but I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.370 
infraspinatus and the teres minor but I
think<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.609> works<00:03:47.820> on<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.239> whole<00:03:48.450> rotator<00:03:49.170> cuff

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
think it works on the whole rotator cuff

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.599 
think it works on the whole rotator cuff
pretty<00:03:49.620> well<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:50.130> helps<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.579> a

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
pretty well and helps with a

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.970 
pretty well and helps with a
stabilization<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.450> lot<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.200> thought<00:03:52.380> at<00:03:52.560> the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
stabilization a lot so I thought at the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.130 
stabilization a lot so I thought at the
end
