00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
they will thicken up a lot as well now

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.150 
they will thicken up a lot as well now
at<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.930> beginning<00:00:55.290> of<00:00:55.380> this<00:00:55.590> procedure<00:00:56.040> I

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
at the beginning of this procedure I

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.310 
at the beginning of this procedure I
should<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.550> added<00:00:56.700> a<00:00:57.030> half<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.600> teaspoon<00:00:57.780> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
should have added a half a teaspoon of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.310 
should have added a half a teaspoon of
lemon<00:00:58.410> zest<00:00:59.220> and<00:00:59.520> a<00:01:00.000> teaspoon<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.510> lemon<00:01:00.990> juice

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
lemon zest and a teaspoon of lemon juice

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.020 
lemon zest and a teaspoon of lemon juice
but<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> forgot<00:01:01.860> so<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.130> added<00:01:02.400> it<00:01:02.640> after<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
but I forgot so I added it after the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.189 
but I forgot so I added it after the
fact<00:01:03.150> but<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.540> still<00:01:03.750> worked<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.049> quite

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
fact but it still worked out quite

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.590 
fact but it still worked out quite
nicely<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.579> stirred<00:01:05.820> those<00:01:05.970> ingredients<00:01:06.180> in

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
nicely so I stirred those ingredients in

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.870 
nicely so I stirred those ingredients in
and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.619> put<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.130> egg<00:01:08.280> yolk<00:01:08.520> mixture

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and then I put the egg yolk mixture

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480 
and then I put the egg yolk mixture
aside<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.689> continue<00:01:10.079> on<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> recipe<00:01:10.560> now

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
aside to continue on with the recipe now

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
aside to continue on with the recipe now
in<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.790> large<00:01:12.030> bowl<00:01:12.390> place<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.960> five<00:01:13.439> egg

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
in a large bowl place the five egg

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.440 
in a large bowl place the five egg
whites<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.520> separated<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.210> at<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
whites that you separated out at the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.020 
whites that you separated out at the
beginning<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:17.009> beat<00:01:17.249> those<00:01:17.490> egg<00:01:17.700> whites

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
beginning and then beat those egg whites

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.450 
beginning and then beat those egg whites
with<00:01:18.270> an<00:01:18.390> electric<00:01:18.749> mixer<00:01:18.929> until<00:01:19.289> soft<00:01:20.189> peaks

with an electric mixer until soft peaks

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.819 
with an electric mixer until soft peaks
form<00:01:21.829> once<00:01:22.829> you<00:01:22.979> get<00:01:23.130> soft<00:01:23.520> peaks<00:01:24.030> add<00:01:24.679> 1/3<00:01:25.679> of

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
form once you get soft peaks add 1/3 of

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.010 
form once you get soft peaks add 1/3 of
a<00:01:25.950> cup<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.429> white<00:01:26.640> granulated<00:01:26.999> sugar<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.689> little

a cup of white granulated sugar a little
bit<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.289> a<00:01:28.319> time<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.950> continue<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> beat<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
bit at a time and continue to beat the

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.020 
bit at a time and continue to beat the
egg<00:01:30.270> whites<00:01:30.509> until<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:31.710> stiff<00:01:32.609> peaks

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
egg whites until you get stiff peaks

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.149 
egg whites until you get stiff peaks
these<00:01:33.569> are<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:33.929> stiff<00:01:34.289> peaks<00:01:34.619> look<00:01:34.889> like

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
these are what stiff peaks look like

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.889 
these are what stiff peaks look like
when<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.850> pull<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.149> beaters<00:01:36.450> out<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
when you pull the beaters out of the

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.169 
when you pull the beaters out of the
mixture<00:01:37.319> they<00:01:37.859> should<00:01:38.249> little<00:01:38.729> Peaks<00:01:38.969> should

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
mixture they should little Peaks should

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.029 
mixture they should little Peaks should
stick<00:01:39.450> straight<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.469> that<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.859> is

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
stick straight up just like that one is

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.160 
stick straight up just like that one is
right<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.780> hold<00:01:42.929> the<00:01:43.020> bowl

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
right there and if you hold the bowl

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
right there and if you hold the bowl
over<00:01:43.350> your<00:01:43.439> head<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.100> egg<00:01:44.249> whites<00:01:44.579> shouldn't

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
over your head the egg whites shouldn't

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.199 
over your head the egg whites shouldn't
fall<00:01:45.090> out

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
fall out

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.550 
fall out
now<00:01:48.209> take<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.659> egg<00:01:48.810> yolk<00:01:49.109> mixture<00:01:49.139> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
now take the egg yolk mixture and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
now take the egg yolk mixture and
incorporate<00:01:50.249> it<00:01:50.399> into<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.819> egg<00:01:50.969> whites<00:01:51.299> by

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
incorporate it into the egg whites by

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
incorporate it into the egg whites by
folding<00:01:52.109> them<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.469> and<00:01:52.740> folding<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.700> not

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
folding them in and folding is not

folding them in and folding is not
stirring<00:01:54.389> folding<00:01:55.109> is<00:01:55.289> a<00:01:55.319> just<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
stirring folding is a just like it

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.399 
stirring folding is a just like it
sounds<00:01:56.490> you're<00:01:57.119> taking<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.959> mixture<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
sounds you're taking that mixture and

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
about 12 inches wide by 15 inches long

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.280 
about 12 inches wide by 15 inches long
and<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.500> used<00:03:52.860> up<00:03:53.100> just<00:03:53.610> about<00:03:53.880> all<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.690> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
and that used up just about all of the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.420 
and that used up just about all of the
batter<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:55.950> had<00:03:56.220> in<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.430> piping<00:03:56.760> bags

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
batter that I had in the piping bags

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.490 
batter that I had in the piping bags
make<00:03:59.430> sure<00:03:59.580> all<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.880> colors<00:04:00.180> touch<00:04:00.510> then<00:04:01.230> and

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
make sure all the colors touch then and

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.949 
make sure all the colors touch then and
that<00:04:01.709> they<00:04:01.830> don't<00:04:02.040> overlap<00:04:02.340> too<00:04:02.670> much<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.239> I

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
that they don't overlap too much and I

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.140 
that they don't overlap too much and I
made<00:04:04.170> each<00:04:04.320> stripe<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:05.010> guess<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.940> was<00:04:06.030> about

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
made each stripe I guess it was about

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.449 
made each stripe I guess it was about
3/4<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.810> an<00:04:07.049> inch<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.440> then<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:07.830> bake<00:04:08.100> this<00:04:08.280> at

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
3/4 of an inch and then I bake this at

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.920 
3/4 of an inch and then I bake this at
375<00:04:09.060> degrees<00:04:09.840> for<00:04:10.799> about<00:04:10.860> 10<00:04:11.850> minutes<00:04:12.390> it

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
375 degrees for about 10 minutes it

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.380 
375 degrees for about 10 minutes it
cooks<00:04:13.230> very<00:04:13.350> quickly<00:04:13.880> you'll<00:04:14.880> know<00:04:15.030> it's<00:04:15.209> done

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
cooks very quickly you'll know it's done

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.630 
cooks very quickly you'll know it's done
when<00:04:15.600> it<00:04:15.720> gets<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:16.049> slightly<00:04:16.799> brown<00:04:17.370> on<00:04:17.549> the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
when it gets just slightly brown on the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.729 
when it gets just slightly brown on the
edges<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:18.060> when<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.510> touch<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:19.080> it's<00:04:19.260> firm

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
edges and when you touch it it's firm

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.259 
edges and when you touch it it's firm
and<00:04:19.769> when<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.250> stick<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.459> toothpick<00:04:20.820> in<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.090> it

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
and when you stick a toothpick in it it

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.600 
and when you stick a toothpick in it it
comes<00:04:21.450> out<00:04:21.600> clean<00:04:21.959> so<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:23.130> took<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.400> right<00:04:23.550> off

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610

until it was well incorporated and

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.080 
until it was well incorporated and
that's<00:05:47.650> all<00:05:47.920> there<00:05:48.190> is<00:05:48.220> to<00:05:48.580> it<00:05:48.700> for<00:05:48.940> this

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
that's all there is to it for this

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.960 
that's all there is to it for this
filling<00:05:49.480> and<00:05:49.630> it<00:05:49.720> is<00:05:49.810> delicious<00:05:50.940> now<00:05:51.940> I

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
filling and it is delicious now I

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.250 
filling and it is delicious now I
realize<00:05:52.390> that<00:05:52.420> I<00:05:52.600> could<00:05:52.750> probably<00:05:52.840> roll<00:05:53.140> this

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
realize that I could probably roll this

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.110 
realize that I could probably roll this
cake<00:05:53.500> up<00:05:53.650> two<00:05:53.830> ways<00:05:53.980> I<00:05:54.220> could<00:05:54.430> roll<00:05:54.640> it<00:05:54.790> this

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
cake up two ways I could roll it this

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.030 
cake up two ways I could roll it this
way<00:05:55.330> so<00:05:55.390> that<00:05:55.570> the<00:05:55.870> stripes<00:05:56.170> went<00:05:56.500> lengthways

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
way so that the stripes went lengthways

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.080 
way so that the stripes went lengthways
or<00:05:57.490> I<00:05:57.550> could<00:05:58.150> roll<00:05:58.390> it<00:05:58.510> up<00:05:58.660> on<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:58.990> long<00:05:59.200> end

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
or I could roll it up on the long end

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.410 
or I could roll it up on the long end
which<00:06:01.090> would<00:06:01.450> mean<00:06:01.690> you<00:06:01.900> would<00:06:01.930> have<00:06:03.420> stripes

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
which would mean you would have stripes

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.390 
which would mean you would have stripes
going<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.810> other<00:06:04.840> way<00:06:05.110> and<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:05.800> wasn't<00:06:06.190> sure

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
going the other way and I wasn't sure

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.770 
going the other way and I wasn't sure
which<00:06:06.670> way<00:06:06.850> I<00:06:06.880> liked<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.390> best

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
which way I liked the best

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.050 
which way I liked the best
so<00:06:08.140> what<00:06:08.350> I<00:06:08.380> did<00:06:08.620> was<00:06:08.830> I<00:06:09.040> cut<00:06:09.280> that<00:06:09.550> cake<00:06:09.820> right

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
so what I did was I cut that cake right

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.180 
so what I did was I cut that cake right
in<00:06:10.180> half<00:06:10.390> and<00:06:10.720> I<00:06:11.140> thought<00:06:11.320> I<00:06:11.380> would<00:06:11.530> try<00:06:11.740> one<00:06:12.070> of

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
in half and I thought I would try one of

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.220 
in half and I thought I would try one of
each<00:06:12.340> and<00:06:12.580> let<00:06:13.030> you<00:06:13.180> decide<00:06:13.300> which<00:06:13.720> one's<00:06:14.020> the

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
each and let you decide which one's the

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.100 
each and let you decide which one's the
nicest<00:06:14.790> so<00:06:15.790> place<00:06:16.030> some<00:06:16.300> of<00:06:16.450> the<00:06:16.510> filling<00:06:16.900> in

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
nicest so place some of the filling in

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.530 
nicest so place some of the filling in
the<00:06:17.230> center<00:06:17.470> of<00:06:17.860> your<00:06:18.430> cake<00:06:18.730> now<00:06:19.000> that<00:06:19.150> cake<00:06:19.360> is

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
the center of your cake now that cake is

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.050 
the center of your cake now that cake is
cooled<00:06:19.840> by<00:06:20.110> now<00:06:20.370> spread<00:06:21.370> the<00:06:21.400> filling<00:06:21.670> around

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
cooled by now spread the filling around

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.400 
cooled by now spread the filling around
and<00:06:22.360> there's<00:06:22.480> no<00:06:22.600> need<00:06:22.780> to<00:06:22.870> go<00:06:22.960> right<00:06:23.170> up<00:06:23.290> to

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
and there's no need to go right up to

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.050 
and there's no need to go right up to
the<00:06:23.500> edge<00:06:23.620> because<00:06:23.980> that<00:06:24.340> filling<00:06:24.730> is<00:06:24.820> going

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
the edge because that filling is going

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.720 
the edge because that filling is going
to<00:06:25.410> squish<00:06:26.410> out<00:06:26.650> when<00:06:26.890> you<00:06:27.010> when<00:06:27.370> you<00:06:27.460> roll<00:06:27.700> it

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
to squish out when you when you roll it

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.580 
to squish out when you when you roll it
and<00:06:28.030> you'll<00:06:28.240> see<00:06:28.450> here<00:06:28.690> when<00:06:28.900> I<00:06:28.930> start<00:06:29.230> to<00:06:29.380> roll

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
and you'll see here when I start to roll

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.460 
and you'll see here when I start to roll
the<00:06:30.250> filling<00:06:30.730> will<00:06:31.030> be<00:06:31.450> pushed<00:06:31.780> ahead<00:06:31.960> by<00:06:32.410> the

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
the filling will be pushed ahead by the

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.980 
the filling will be pushed ahead by the
cake<00:06:32.830> and<00:06:33.070> will<00:06:33.760> fill<00:06:34.000> in<00:06:34.150> any<00:06:34.360> gaps<00:06:34.450> that<00:06:34.780> you

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
cake and will fill in any gaps that you

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.480 
cake and will fill in any gaps that you
might<00:06:35.170> have<00:06:35.260> left<00:06:35.550> then<00:06:36.550> place<00:06:36.880> the<00:06:37.090> cake<00:06:37.330> on<00:06:37.540> a

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
might have left then place the cake on a

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.060 
might have left then place the cake on a
serving<00:06:39.490> platter<00:06:39.700> or<00:06:40.210> plate<00:06:40.830> put<00:06:41.830> it<00:06:41.920> in<00:06:42.010> the

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
serving platter or plate put it in the

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.310 
serving platter or plate put it in the
refrigerator<00:06:42.670> and<00:06:42.910> let<00:06:42.970> it<00:06:43.270> sit<00:06:43.870> there<00:06:44.050> for<00:06:44.110> a

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
refrigerator and let it sit there for a

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.320 
refrigerator and let it sit there for a
couple<00:06:44.560> of<00:06:44.770> hours<00:06:45.070> and<00:06:45.250> that<00:06:45.790> will<00:06:45.910> allow<00:06:46.120> that

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
couple of hours and that will allow that

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.540 
couple of hours and that will allow that
filling<00:06:46.690> to<00:06:46.810> set<00:06:46.990> up<00:06:47.140> nicely<00:06:47.380> and<00:06:47.800> there's<00:06:48.340> the

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
filling to set up nicely and there's the

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.130 
filling to set up nicely and there's the
second<00:06:48.970> cake<00:06:49.150> with<00:06:49.419> the<00:06:49.570> stripes<00:06:49.840> to<00:06:50.020> go

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
second cake with the stripes to go

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.760 
second cake with the stripes to go
lengthwise

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
lengthwise

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.439 
lengthwise
now<00:06:51.889> for<00:06:52.340> the<00:06:52.400> stripe<00:06:52.639> that<00:06:52.669> go<00:06:52.880> lengthways

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
now for the stripe that go lengthways

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.600 
now for the stripe that go lengthways
when<00:06:53.690> you<00:06:53.780> cut<00:06:54.020> a<00:06:54.319> piece<00:06:54.860> of<00:06:55.039> the<00:06:55.099> cake<00:06:55.310> each

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
when you cut a piece of the cake each

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.050 
when you cut a piece of the cake each
slice<00:06:56.300> of<00:06:56.479> cake<00:06:56.660> will<00:06:57.440> have<00:06:57.710> a<00:06:58.009> rainbow<00:06:58.460> color

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
slice of cake will have a rainbow color

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.520 
slice of cake will have a rainbow color
in<00:06:59.330> it<00:06:59.479> so<00:06:59.660> you'll<00:06:59.780> have<00:06:59.900> all<00:07:00.080> the<00:07:00.199> colors<00:07:00.500> of

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
in it so you'll have all the colors of

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.400 
in it so you'll have all the colors of
the<00:07:00.620> rainbow<00:07:00.740> in<00:07:01.069> each<00:07:01.190> slice<00:07:01.990> so<00:07:02.990> you'll<00:07:03.319> have

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
the rainbow in each slice so you'll have

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.189 
the rainbow in each slice so you'll have
to<00:07:03.530> tell<00:07:03.680> me<00:07:03.800> if<00:07:03.830> you<00:07:03.919> like<00:07:04.130> this<00:07:04.340> one<00:07:04.400> or<00:07:05.199> you

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 
to tell me if you like this one or you

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.050 
to tell me if you like this one or you
can<00:07:06.740> also<00:07:06.919> roll<00:07:07.190> it<00:07:07.310> the<00:07:07.400> other<00:07:07.550> way

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
can also roll it the other way

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.029 
can also roll it the other way
so<00:07:08.270> that<00:07:08.449> when<00:07:08.599> you<00:07:08.690> slice<00:07:09.020> it<00:07:09.289> you<00:07:09.500> get<00:07:10.009> a

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
so that when you slice it you get a

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:12.790 
so that when you slice it you get a
slice<00:07:10.430> of<00:07:10.460> each<00:07:10.910> color<00:07:11.300> so<00:07:11.479> everyone<00:07:12.470> get<00:07:12.650> it

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
slice of each color so everyone get it

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.230 
slice of each color so everyone get it
someone<00:07:13.310> can<00:07:13.400> get<00:07:13.490> a<00:07:13.550> slice<00:07:13.759> of<00:07:13.789> blue<00:07:14.060> or<00:07:14.210> a

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
someone can get a slice of blue or a

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.029 
someone can get a slice of blue or a
slice<00:07:14.419> of<00:07:14.449> red<00:07:14.690> a<00:07:14.750> slice<00:07:14.990> of<00:07:15.020> orange<00:07:15.289> that<00:07:15.770> kind

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 
slice of red a slice of orange that kind

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.129 
slice of red a slice of orange that kind
of<00:07:16.099> thing<00:07:16.419> Thanks<00:07:17.419> to<00:07:17.449> everyone<00:07:17.539> for<00:07:17.840> watching
