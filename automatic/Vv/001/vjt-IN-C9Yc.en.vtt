and depending on what shape you want to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.310 
and depending on what shape you want to
build<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.829> did<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.550> use<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.629> saw<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.260> I

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
build what I did is I use a saw and I

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.529 
build what I did is I use a saw and I
cut<00:00:55.620> these<00:00:55.770> down<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.640> regular<00:00:56.879> handsaw

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
cut these down just a regular handsaw

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.900 
cut these down just a regular handsaw
cut<00:00:58.140> them<00:00:58.289> takes<00:00:58.590> about<00:00:58.770> 30<00:00:59.070> seconds<00:00:59.550> aboard

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
cut them takes about 30 seconds aboard

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.890 
cut them takes about 30 seconds aboard
so<00:01:00.780> let's<00:01:01.170> go<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> remember<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
so let's go to it so remember this the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
so let's go to it so remember this the
state<00:01:10.170> doesn't<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.590> spike<00:01:10.920> into<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
state doesn't have a spike into it and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.390 
state doesn't have a spike into it and
it<00:01:11.909> comes<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.920> just<00:01:13.920> slide<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
it comes to you like that just slide it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
it comes to you like that just slide it
through<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> brackets<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.420 

make<00:01:32.229> sure<00:01:32.260> it's<00:01:32.560> all<00:01:32.680> square<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.220> it's<00:01:33.310> going

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
make sure it's all square and it's going

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.609 
make sure it's all square and it's going
to<00:01:33.490> square<00:01:33.850> off<00:01:33.909> itself<00:01:34.630> as<00:01:34.900> well<00:01:35.110> when<00:01:35.470> we're

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
to square off itself as well when we're

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.969 
to square off itself as well when we're
doing<00:01:35.799> our<00:01:36.070> second<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.760> third<00:01:37.570> level<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.590> now

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
down so we're making only a two foot

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.790 
down so we're making only a two foot
wide<00:02:27.150> garden<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.930> fabric<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.470> five<00:02:29.770> feet
