okay you know keep trying over and over
again<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:21.060> get<00:04:22.060> different<00:04:22.180> results<00:04:22.500> later

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
again and get different results later

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.310 
again and get different results later
and<00:04:23.770> Dan<00:04:23.919> Lyons<00:04:24.130> seem<00:04:24.729> to<00:04:24.820> be<00:04:24.910> like<00:04:25.150> dragon<00:04:25.930> not

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
trying they seem to be like the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.190 
trying they seem to be like the
foundation<00:04:29.620> of<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.950> lot<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.250> rares<00:04:30.760> for<00:04:31.600> me<00:04:31.720> at

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
foundation of a lot of rares for me at

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.050 
foundation of a lot of rares for me at
least<00:04:32.260> from<00:04:32.680> what<00:04:32.770> I've<00:04:32.890> heard<00:04:32.919> but<00:04:33.340> anyways

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
least from what I've heard but anyways

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:44.610 
least from what I've heard but anyways
ok<00:04:34.840> let's<00:04:35.050> try<00:04:35.260> earth<00:04:35.590> this<00:04:35.979> time<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:43.620> earth

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
ok let's try earth this time and earth

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.570 
ok let's try earth this time and earth
and<00:04:44.860> dark

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
and dark

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.459 
and dark

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:58.499 
i'm going to try another dragon that has

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:02.540 
i'm going to try another dragon that has
dark<00:04:59.179> it<00:05:00.179> has<00:05:00.330> a<00:05:00.360> dark<00:05:00.629> element<00:05:01.080> a<00:05:01.259> hybrid<00:05:01.769> you

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
dark it has a dark element a hybrid you

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.369 
dark it has a dark element a hybrid you
can<00:05:02.789> do<00:05:02.999> that<00:05:03.209> by<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.419> way<00:05:03.659> it<00:05:03.839> just<00:05:03.869> gives<00:05:04.229> you

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
can do that by the way it just gives you

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.040 
can do that by the way it just gives you
the<00:05:04.679> possibility<00:05:05.580> means<00:05:06.209> something<00:05:06.539> else<00:05:06.719> so

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
the possibility means something else so

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.759 
the possibility means something else so
like<00:05:07.379> vintage<00:05:07.649> is<00:05:08.309> part<00:05:08.639> dark<00:05:08.879> i<00:05:09.289> can<00:05:10.289> also<00:05:10.439> get

against<00:07:01.000> water<00:07:01.090> and<00:07:01.720> electricity<00:07:02.530> I<00:07:02.830> think

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.520

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
and I don't have water and I always

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.590 
and I don't have water and I always
switch<00:07:08.890> out<00:07:09.100> because<00:07:09.490> switching<00:07:10.270> out<00:07:10.420> it

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600 
switch out because switching out it

fire because fire is strong its water

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.369 
fire because fire is strong its water
and<00:07:33.520> vice<00:07:33.849> versa<00:07:34.180> as<00:07:34.449> I<00:07:34.599> have<00:07:34.719> said<00:07:34.930> so<00:07:35.199> made

00:07:35.369 --> 00:07:35.379 
and vice versa as I have said so made

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 
out the eyes who got broken up into

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.149 
out the eyes who got broken up into
crushed<00:07:38.860> ice<00:07:39.719> all<00:07:40.719> right<00:07:40.990> this<00:07:41.409> guy<00:07:41.620> has<00:07:41.889> water
