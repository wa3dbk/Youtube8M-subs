you<00:00:42.690> know<00:00:42.719> zooming<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> part<00:00:46.129> it's<00:00:47.129> just

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
you know zooming in on a part it's just

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
you know zooming in on a part it's just
you<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.440> a

you know and as you can see you know a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.430 
you know and as you can see you know a
lot<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.550> inches<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.050> pretty<00:00:52.230> big

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
lot of inches so it's a pretty big

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.439 
lot of inches so it's a pretty big
project<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.640> know<00:00:53.789> say<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.090> wanted<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
get into this it just it takes forever

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.709 
get into this it just it takes forever
and<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.699> want<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> see<00:01:00.239> if<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.539> you

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
know a joint connects right in like

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.080 
know a joint connects right in like
thousands<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:05.519> know<00:01:05.610> forget<00:01:06.000> about<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
thousands you know forget about it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.620 
thousands you know forget about it
but<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.570> hyper<00:01:09.810> scrolling<00:01:10.380> which<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.920> uh<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
but with hyper scrolling which is uh I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.090 
but with hyper scrolling which is uh I
don't<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:12.900> anybody<00:01:13.229> else<00:01:13.409> does<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.890> or

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
don't know if anybody else does it or

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.240 
don't know if anybody else does it or
whether<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.729> Logitech<00:01:15.420> or<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.250> but

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
whether it's just Logitech or not but

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.580 
whether it's just Logitech or not but
there's<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> little<00:01:17.759> button<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.350> mouse

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
there's a little button on the the mouse

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.539 
there's a little button on the the mouse
that<00:01:20.280> releases<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> wheel<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:23.220> allows

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that releases the wheel and it allows

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.899 
that releases the wheel and it allows
you<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.439> spin<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> wheel<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.100> it

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you to just spin the wheel and it

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.440 
you to just spin the wheel and it
continues<00:01:27.750> spinning<00:01:28.020> rather<00:01:28.530> than<00:01:29.450> rather

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
continues spinning rather than rather

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.219 
continues spinning rather than rather
than<00:01:30.570> holding<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.630> creates<00:01:34.049> an

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
than holding it so this creates an

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.030 
than holding it so this creates an
effect<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:36.240> allows<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.320> zoom<00:01:37.350> in

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
effect that allows you to zoom in

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.950 
effect that allows you to zoom in
extremely<00:01:39.030> quickly<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.750> mean<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.130> see

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
extremely quickly I mean as you can see

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
extremely quickly I mean as you can see
you<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.079> no<00:01:43.470> problem<00:01:43.909> whatsoever<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:46.640> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you know no problem whatsoever just and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.249 
you know no problem whatsoever just and
you<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.180> scroll<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.659> pretty<00:01:48.930> slow

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
you know you can scroll in pretty slow

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.999 
you know you can scroll in pretty slow
as<00:01:49.470> well<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.100> need<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.759> mean<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:52.770> gives

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
as well if you need to I mean it gives

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.039 
as well if you need to I mean it gives
it<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.490> gives<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.210> much<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:54.630> control

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
it just gives you so much more control

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.270 
it just gives you so much more control
on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
on

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.090 
on
and<00:01:56.940> then<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.720> know<00:01:57.810> no<00:01:58.110> problem<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.890> be

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and then you know no problem we can be

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.880 
and then you know no problem we can be
into<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.030> thousandth<00:02:00.720> in<00:02:00.870> like<00:02:01.050> no<00:02:01.320> time<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
into the thousandth in like no time and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.780 
into the thousandth in like no time and
then<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.230> definitely<00:02:04.740> recommend<00:02:05.100> this

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
then out so I definitely recommend this

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.580 
then out so I definitely recommend this
mouse<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.900> anybody<00:02:07.320> who<00:02:07.700> who<00:02:09.470> thinks<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
smooth scrolling that smooth scrolling

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.850 
smooth scrolling that smooth scrolling
is<00:02:42.390> like<00:02:42.600> garbage<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.650> messes

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
is like garbage and just messes

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.880 
is like garbage and just messes
everything<00:02:44.310> up<00:02:45.140> when<00:02:46.140> you're<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.290> master<00:02:46.709> cam

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
everything up when you're in master cam

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.390 
everything up when you're in master cam
and<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.070> go<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> scroll<00:02:48.290> with<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.530> enabled<00:02:50.070> it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
and you go to scroll with it enabled it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.690 
and you go to scroll with it enabled it
actually<00:02:51.320> sometimes<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.530> would<00:02:52.680> give<00:02:53.520> me<00:02:53.670> like

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
actually sometimes it would give me like

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.280 
actually sometimes it would give me like
a<00:02:53.850> negative<00:02:54.209> number<00:02:54.930> here<00:02:55.140> at<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.739> bottom<00:02:57.290> and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
a negative number here at the bottom and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.289 
a negative number here at the bottom and
it<00:02:58.680> seemed<00:02:59.280> like<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.550> was<00:02:59.700> looking<00:03:00.030> at<00:03:00.150> maybe

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
it seemed like I was looking at maybe

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.070 
it seemed like I was looking at maybe
the<00:03:00.780> back<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.970> drawing<00:03:03.420> or<00:03:03.540> something<00:03:03.720> I

it<00:03:06.000> was<00:03:06.120> nuts<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.989> didn't<00:03:07.560> feel<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:08.280> I

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
it was nuts and it didn't feel like I

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.320 
it was nuts and it didn't feel like I
had<00:03:09.209> as<00:03:09.510> much<00:03:09.750> control<00:03:10.140> but<00:03:10.470> if<00:03:10.590> if<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.459> you<00:03:12.180> go
