 if you do not buy makeup for six months 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.710
 but it is a price that is a color that combines 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.929
 about winter and my time he who 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.880
 buy from not telling the truth anymore 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.620

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.950
 September something like this 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.820

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.020

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.519
 I craved that two layers and stayed 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.159
 super uniform 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.650
 O lord wine like every one button 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.780
 them up in the air what I'm feeling 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.670
 in it a little more dry I do not know if 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.610
 I went through a very thick layer because I 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.350
 I spent simeon fast in the euphoria of 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.030
 want to see the color of the lipstick but it's the color 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.030
 Beautiful looks beautiful, beautiful, beautiful 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 You see, and yes, but there's a spine. 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.520
 or lower spine and stand just watching with 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.520
 button 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.370
 in my humble opinion I think it is 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.340
 a color that will match super with everyone 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.350

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.290

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.270
 button and the marketing of dailus foot not 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.220
 I can complain about any of them that 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.070
 They have a good time all interest 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.900

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.000
 will want the people who 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.430

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.340
 in the mouth I took the excess from good to 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:17.180
 do not mess up and cheering on it is very 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.420
 very good and usually the most 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.910
 dark tends not to let me do 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.220

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.260
 I believe you all know the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.420
 jéssica making but for those who do not know 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.300

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.720

 Jessica was inspired by the fear that 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.310
