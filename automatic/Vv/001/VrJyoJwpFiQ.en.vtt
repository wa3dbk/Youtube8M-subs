00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
and this is where you're going to store

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.090 
and this is where you're going to store
carbohydrates<00:01:02.900> in<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.290> form<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:03.829> term<00:01:04.070> that

going to show you right now three little

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.500 
going to show you right now three little
tricks<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:31.040> can<00:01:31.190> use<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.820> carb-load<00:01:32.180> for

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
tricks that you can use to carb-load for

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.210 
tricks that you can use to carb-load for
faster<00:01:32.840> fat<00:01:33.049> loss<00:01:33.290> if<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.500> want<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.799> carb<00:01:34.010> load

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
faster fat loss if you want to carb load

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.190 
faster fat loss if you want to carb load
for<00:01:34.430> faster<00:01:34.760> fat<00:01:34.940> loss<00:01:35.180> which<00:01:35.510> typically<00:01:36.020> is

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
for faster fat loss which typically is

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.080 
for faster fat loss which typically is
going<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.380> happen<00:01:36.650> on<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.340> weekends<00:01:37.790> because

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
going to happen on the weekends because

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.700 
going to happen on the weekends because
most<00:01:38.330> of<00:01:38.420> us<00:01:38.510> are<00:01:38.659> weekend<00:01:38.930> warriors<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:39.530> is

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
most of us are weekend warriors this is

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.280 
most of us are weekend warriors this is
when<00:01:39.860> we<00:01:39.979> tend<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.490> indulge<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.690> eat<00:01:42.140> more

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
when we tend to indulge and eat more

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.649 
when we tend to indulge and eat more
cheap<00:01:42.560> foods<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.460> during<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.820> week<00:01:43.940> you<00:01:44.450> have

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
cheap foods so during the week you have

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.480 
cheap foods so during the week you have
to<00:01:44.810> engage<00:01:44.960> in<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.290> process<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:45.799> Prime's<00:01:46.280> your

the right exercise strategy so while you

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.580 
the right exercise strategy so while you
carb<00:04:06.209> deplete<00:04:06.569> for<00:04:06.720> three<00:04:06.900> or<00:04:06.989> four<00:04:07.049> days<00:04:07.319> in<00:04:07.349> a

carb deplete for three or four days in a

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.379 
carb deplete for three or four days in a
row<00:04:07.620> there's<00:04:08.489> actually<00:04:09.000> an<00:04:09.090> exercise

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
row there's actually an exercise

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.240 
row there's actually an exercise
strategy<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.109> you<00:04:10.229> can<00:04:10.260> use<00:04:10.409> that<00:04:10.769> doubles

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
strategy that you can use that doubles

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.860 
strategy that you can use that doubles
the<00:04:11.430> fat<00:04:11.639> loss<00:04:11.849> effect<00:04:12.269> of<00:04:12.449> this<00:04:12.540> entire

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
the fat loss effect of this entire

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.689 
the fat loss effect of this entire
process<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.650> this<00:04:13.799> carb<00:04:14.040> load<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:14.519> by<00:04:14.639> doing

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
process of this carb load so by doing

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.060 
process of this carb load so by doing
this<00:04:15.000> three<00:04:15.239> or<00:04:15.269> four<00:04:15.389> days<00:04:15.739> during<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.859> week

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
this three or four days during the week

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.680 
this three or four days during the week
when<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.759> weekend<00:04:18.150> hits<00:04:18.449> now<00:04:18.840> right<00:04:19.709> after<00:04:20.310> a

when the weekend hits now right after a

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.969 
when the weekend hits now right after a
strategic<00:04:21.690> workout<00:04:22.229> is<00:04:22.440> when<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.740> want<00:04:22.919> to

strategic workout is when you want to
carb<00:04:23.310> load<00:04:23.460> because<00:04:24.090> now<00:04:24.360> your<00:04:25.229> energy<00:04:25.889> tank

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
carb load because now your energy tank

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.210 
carb load because now your energy tank
is<00:04:26.279> all<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.550> way<00:04:26.669> down<00:04:26.849> here<00:04:27.120> down<00:04:27.539> here<00:04:27.570> so

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
is all the way down here down here so

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.490 
is all the way down here down here so
have<00:04:28.430> all<00:04:28.640> this<00:04:29.030> room<00:04:29.180> in<00:04:29.660> your<00:04:29.840> tank<00:04:30.140> for<00:04:30.290> an

have all this room in your tank for an

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.260 
have all this room in your tank for an
extra<00:04:30.860> influx<00:04:31.490> of<00:04:31.840> carbs<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.900> come<00:04:33.230> in<00:04:33.470> and

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
extra influx of carbs to come in and

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.490 
extra influx of carbs to come in and
what<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.450> does<00:04:35.660> is<00:04:35.960> not<00:04:36.110> only<00:04:36.350> does<00:04:36.470> it

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
what this does is not only does it

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.410 
what this does is not only does it
replenish<00:04:37.070> your<00:04:37.190> glycogen<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:37.850> sparks<00:04:38.270> your
