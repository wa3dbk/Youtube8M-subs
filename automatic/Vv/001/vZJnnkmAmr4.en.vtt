00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
battery life so just to show you how

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.950 
battery life so just to show you how
that<00:01:32.460> slips<00:01:32.790> down<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.270> over<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> top<00:01:35.960> let's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that slips down in over the top let's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
that slips down in over the top let's
see<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.320> slip<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:40.460> snaps<00:01:41.460> in

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
see if I slip that in right snaps in

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.030 
see if I slip that in right snaps in
there<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.409> then<00:01:43.409> slides<00:01:45.560> across<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.829> top

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
there and then slides across the top

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.670 
there and then slides across the top
like<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.930> case<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.290> great<00:01:49.530> because

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
like so so this case is great because

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.170 
like so so this case is great because
you're<00:01:49.829> going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.100> battery<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.850> you're

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
