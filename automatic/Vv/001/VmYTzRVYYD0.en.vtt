00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:27.600
 he is an old man who has yielded a few 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.669
 emotional and I liked it is about 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:36.059
 shoot and roll I have already paid and I have 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.059
 liked with five stars and good 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.129
 I hope they play it and I do not know whether to leave 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.500
 the cycle to leave in the description does not 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.879
 I know very well but we're going to go there 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.330
 close your games but you will say 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.229
 which is very bad but I like to emerge is 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.629
 so everything arranged for what it does has 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.320
 to go killing zombies on the road 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.850
 you can use nitro you can use weapons 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.589
 then there are parts where you have to 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.700
 kill zombies with weapons there are zombies that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.700
 they go up there in it 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.250
 in the truck and we have to jump or 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.170
 you can also let them go 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.869
 it will be 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.730
 then I commented with cars and I do not wait 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.520
 that we like 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:32.810
 a few hours 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:35.109
 by the referee as a fighter as 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.109
 solar 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.810
 I do not expect to win 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.070
 I have to kill many of us 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.070
 make a myth 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.480
 for liter 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.100
 this has been my first gameplay of this 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.850
 game 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.090
 We have been a success and here they sent us 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.800
 another one I think it was this that you have to 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.830
 shoot everywhere also super 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.600
 cool the play and there I think it sends us 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.720
 To shoot 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.420
 it has cost me it cost me two I tell you 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.130
 that has also cost me true and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.569
 puts in other looks very complicated 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.120
 things 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.420
 this level I'm not going to play it so 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:30.590
 come on let me give it to pause you look at 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.590
 often you increase a great game 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.690
 let's give it back let's give it a story 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.480
 modes that is the way you have to 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.480
 start playing at level 11 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:52.360
 let's give it to show this seriously what 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:58.600
 I recommend 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:00.580
 then I am dying to say good 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.840
 you can install the zombies and it 's very 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.940
 cool 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.220
 for example the short I love it I like it 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.260
 for home then for the zombies though 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.620
 look like it makes all this a 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.620
 why 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.680
 the graphics have game and tops 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.050
 in charge 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:40.010
 for entertainment 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.900
 I have until the next hundred 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.900
 but only use on special occasions 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.040
 for example I want you can already these 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.200
 They are as ordered but up close 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.200
 love the chabÃ³n dies 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.550
 above I do not know if going up is being and about 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.830
 the game although I have already started it but 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:11.520
 good we start is the 1 the final 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.550
 the final round I played this map 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.550
 Y 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.390
 now 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.930
 and so it was 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.759
 then to put it 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.800
 I love to play if but it's just very 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.009
 beautiful 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.789
 me tie 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.789
 to the big one 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.280
 there are special zombies that are the ones 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.280
 more or more 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.460
 that is now the one that comes withered 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.830
 now he did not come but in a 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.340
 opportunity filled me three stars and 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.340
 aggregate
