series<00:00:18.740> made<00:00:19.280> by<00:00:19.310> odyssey<00:00:19.940> the<00:00:20.900> reason<00:00:21.200> we're

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
series made by odyssey the reason we're

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.560 
series made by odyssey the reason we're
changing<00:00:21.620> out<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.980> Optima<00:00:22.820> is<00:00:22.850> it's<00:00:23.240> leaking

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
changing out the Optima is it's leaking

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.480 
changing out the Optima is it's leaking
on<00:00:23.690> the<00:00:23.720> negative<00:00:24.110> terminal<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:24.710> all<00:00:25.340> the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
on the negative terminal and all the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.970 
on the negative terminal and all the
acids<00:00:25.850> coming<00:00:26.120> out<00:00:26.240> so<00:00:26.630> that's<00:00:27.200> not<00:00:27.410> good<00:00:27.710> and

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
acids coming out so that's not good and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.370 
acids coming out so that's not good and
so<00:00:28.910> we're<00:00:29.060> gonna<00:00:29.120> replace<00:00:29.330> it<00:00:29.690> with<00:00:29.870> hopefully

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
so we're gonna replace it with hopefully

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.710 
so we're gonna replace it with hopefully
a<00:00:30.410> battery<00:00:30.890> that<00:00:30.920> won't<00:00:31.220> leak<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.540> first

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
a battery that won't leak so the first

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.640 
a battery that won't leak so the first
thing<00:00:32.840> we're<00:00:32.960> going<00:00:33.050> to<00:00:33.110> do<00:00:33.230> is<00:00:33.380> take<00:00:33.530> the
