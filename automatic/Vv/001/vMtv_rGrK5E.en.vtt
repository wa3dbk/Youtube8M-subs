00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 You can really get the jo sprout once 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.310
 At the start I have you in my with 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.779
 about that actually knows that since topic 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.730
 I have something optimized for you 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.679
 you forgot here if he has his 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.469
 number executes when the voltage 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.660
 Simply here , cover and if 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.210
 you just support yourself is bank 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.199
 you can optimize the whole thing 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.609
 and exhausting make little kilo 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.529
 I 've got six kilometers 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.940
 short trade I make that happen 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.210
 you just sweat 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.740
 an elbow from now you go beautiful 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.770
 you already have the tensions in the 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.760
 Europe is comparatively 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.600
 and you already have a nice one 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.420
 idea 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.010
 in this position is nice and straight 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.170
 slowly up and down and ideal 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.450
 for the bernd stelter head so for 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.040
 middle middle schools distributed and 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.440
 Of course, ideally I could 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.239
 I now tell me if you forward the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.090
 head or isolate the rear would 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:07.180
 instead of trading okay now are once 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:08.770
 in front of a body could go up 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.630
 Of course now we are with I 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.810
 and of course he looks like he's coming 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:18.330
 something with the animal goes up and the hand 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.330
 Behind net body omitted 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.360
 and down the back 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.430
 just become 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.320
 you will be our most important pre-tension 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.460
 Remember it will be much more intense than if 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.580
 that's normal 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.050
 are the making and makes it easy 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.330
 really without swing with little 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.620
 weight just 45 degrees we can do that 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.840
 little at home the whole power falls 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.840
 Also simply rest on a ridge in 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.010
 the angle and my tip who does that 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.530
 just here the bias student 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.270
 then up and it will make a difference 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.860
 his for you realize that war better 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.190
 they can also be separated isolated three 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.729
 it really wants to be out 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.729
 on-line
