00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.560
 why jump dressage and jump best over a slower ride 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.279
 bump 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.710
 after the jump one turns the body rotated 180 degrees thereby shows the whole 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.619
 Time in the direction of travel before landing the court in the direction of publishers and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.419
 the view over the shoulder further in state hand 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.089
 visible 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.280
 when reversing, the idea is always slightly offset and 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.149
 Practiced twisting of the body when looking over the shoulder 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.940
 Drivers control the bloody act merely by shifting their weight 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.960
 they themselves were guilty 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.500
 At first, beginners are easier on each shoulder and shoulder 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.830
 Always put up to 6 cities have enough distance to 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.310
 Ground to be held otherwise there is a risk of emergence 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.900
 Injury lead is insignificant 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.750
 as seen when jumping but not succeed as well as over small bump 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.750
 in a kicker-interview everything is more 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.090
 The jump is therefore initiated only with the shoulder during the jump 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.030
 so that stays abroad all the time 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.100
 A central position over the snow is not necessary with too much 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.590
 Template too long 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.030
 make landing with China 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.230
 with regard to strengthening 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.890
 it is considered 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.530
 when approaching he is already before by means of speed is the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.320
 Look at the point it bounce 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.460
 since the purchase already 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.880
 Greece will be the largest since the active jump 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.930
 Companies 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.260
 Shoulder and hip follow in the flight phase a specialist direction the 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.220
 Rotation edge of the FDP thanked lands it will be difficult 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.200
 As all over Germany irritated Kaufmann showed bounce already in direction 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.750
 landing production is initiated by a shoulder 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.140
 during the slip so only the body turns the gaze stays on the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.690
 Directed landing 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.140
 So you look at the jump over the pure on landing over the other 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.110
 Track are 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.880
 Wifo and IHS the case before that starts like a mushroom 6 5 the introduced 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.640
 Bus by Kopfschulter- and arms at the jump is in addition 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.979
 required production but slightly stronger 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.279
 as soon as the landing is visible after the first full turn the 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.149
 Fixed landing point and only the body rotates another 180 degrees 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.949
 Overlooking the shoulder, landing is cushioned 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:24.839
 "There is a fight going on 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.119
 quite soon it will not be the first half turn like that sometimes 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:29.359
 made 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.139
 Planning is the whole newspaper 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.469
 Hand play of body upside down the whole screenplay 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.819
 how to be controlled at simple tricks 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.699
 the rotation 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.019
 Silvios may require a controlled 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.999
 Tailwind through the air 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.999
 a counter-movement of the hip to the direction of view 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:53.349
 Keep body tension
