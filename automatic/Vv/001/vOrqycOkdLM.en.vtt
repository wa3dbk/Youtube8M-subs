00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.100
 hello here is the achim again and the 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.590
 daniel and we explain today as on 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.560
 fastest to these 100 goldtalers 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.059
 comes and you have to ten pieces 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.190
 the number together 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.020
 whatever earth makes the lie 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.000
 scattered everywhere and if you have those 10 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.699
 Together then you will see on the map 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 as you already see below and how to 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.129
 here sees the reference to the yellow 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.780
 points are displayed where these goldtaler 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.880
 are hidden 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.970
 they are in the most impossible places 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.829
 So you really have to search properly 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.870
 I would say I'm just going 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.559
 and then we look after the first one 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.280
 part and then can actually each 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.280
 looking for yourself 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.869
 there comes just behind me 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.310
 never in the forest never never for the taler 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.259
 I have right now 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.259
 I want to lose myself 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:56.110
 here must be the player 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:30.030
 this is just what comes with the taler 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:30.030
 not here but he is there or not 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.549
 tells light up 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.620
 Since watching Dana has his things 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.920
 you have to search 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.680
 100 pieces in the number and then explain 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.610
 you exactly what one thus makes the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.750
 in the next video university out with 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.720
 the car is always there 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.930
 any levels from 25 to 50 and 100 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.000
 I think so, well, it's the success 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.810
 activation yes but if the unnaer 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.569
 invented 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.000
 there we have a video there is something in it 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.489
 you do it and what happens thank you 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.790
 I mean hat then to the next 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.790
 times
