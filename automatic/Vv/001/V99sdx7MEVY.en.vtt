00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
it again actually I think they're really

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.519

going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> run<00:00:18.359> into<00:00:18.539> some<00:00:18.630> matchup<00:00:19.140> problems

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
going to run into some matchup problems

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.590 
going to run into some matchup problems
with<00:00:19.710> Indiana<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.460> year<00:00:20.670> Indian<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.240> really

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
with Indiana this year Indian is really

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.240 
with Indiana this year Indian is really
big<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.470> think<00:00:22.500> that's<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> be<00:00:23.130> an

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
big and I think that's going to be an

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.830 
big and I think that's going to be an
issue<00:00:23.400> for<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.850> heat<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.180> kind<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.510> think<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
issue for the heat I kind of think that

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.689 
issue for the heat I kind of think that
makes<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.109> neat<00:00:25.260> pass<00:00:25.470> home<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.890> know<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> heats

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
makes a neat pass home I know the heats

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.210 
makes a neat pass home I know the heats
come<00:00:26.910> back<00:00:27.060> from<00:00:27.240> some<00:00:28.039> losing<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> first

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
come back from some losing the first

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.710 
come back from some losing the first
game<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> series<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> history

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
game of the series and I have a history

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
game of the series and I have a history
of<00:00:30.750> doing<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.320> Indiana<00:00:31.980> look<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.669> good

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
PhDs but here's where the funny thing

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.429 
PhDs but here's where the funny thing
with<00:01:47.220> LeBron<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> NBA

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
with LeBron is do you think that the NBA

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.109 
with LeBron is do you think that the NBA
would<00:01:49.680> ever<00:01:49.860> come<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.399> say<00:01:50.549> yeah<00:01:50.790> our

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
would ever come out and say yeah our

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.620 
would ever come out and say yeah our
star<00:01:51.570> player<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.170> using<00:01:52.740> PhDs<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.820> steroids

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
star player is using PhDs and steroids

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.590 
star player is using PhDs and steroids
and<00:01:55.130> there's<00:01:56.130> there's<00:01:56.549> no<00:01:56.759> way<00:01:56.790> LeBron<00:01:57.420> would

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and there's there's no way LeBron would

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.359 
and there's there's no way LeBron would
ever<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:57.960> suspended<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.740> anything<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
ever be suspended for anything like that

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.190 
ever be suspended for anything like that
because<00:01:59.840> LeBron<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
because LeBron is the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.990 
because LeBron is the
I mean<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.740> know<00:02:02.799> there's<00:02:03.100> each<00:02:03.250> franchise<00:02:03.520> in

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
I mean I know there's each franchise in

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.219 
I mean I know there's each franchise in
each<00:02:04.090> franchise<00:02:04.299> gotta<00:02:04.780> speak<00:02:05.049> native

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
each franchise gotta speak native

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.590 
each franchise gotta speak native
players<00:02:05.530> but<00:02:05.829> he<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.610> basically<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.149> face<00:02:07.390> of

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
players but he is basically the face of

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.290 
players but he is basically the face of
the<00:02:07.719> NBA<00:02:08.019> right<00:02:08.319> now<00:02:08.349> and<00:02:08.979> they<00:02:09.310> may<00:02:09.519> just<00:02:09.550> they

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
the NBA right now and they may just they

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.880 
the NBA right now and they may just they
couldn't<00:02:10.660> afford<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:11.019> so<00:02:11.290> even<00:02:11.530> if<00:02:11.590> he<00:02:11.680> did

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
couldn't afford that so even if he did

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.820 
couldn't afford that so even if he did
like<00:02:12.129> get<00:02:12.459> caught<00:02:13.170> taking<00:02:14.170> them<00:02:14.440> they<00:02:14.650> would

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
like get caught taking them they would

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.500 
like get caught taking them they would
sweep<00:02:15.129> it<00:02:15.280> under<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.489> rug<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.030> fast

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
sweep it under the rug so fast

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.780 
sweep it under the rug so fast
honestly<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.680> think<00:02:17.890> there's<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.489> good

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
honestly like I think there's a good

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.780 
honestly like I think there's a good
chance<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.330> he<00:02:19.540> maybe<00:02:20.220> had<00:02:21.220> taken<00:02:21.459> steroids

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
chance that he maybe had taken steroids

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.880 
chance that he maybe had taken steroids
or<00:02:22.239> some<00:02:22.420> other<00:02:22.569> something<00:02:22.840> else<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.260> that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
or some other something else to that

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.460 
or some other something else to that
some<00:02:24.819> bangin<00:02:25.239> substances<00:02:25.900> we'll<00:02:26.080> call<00:02:26.319> him
