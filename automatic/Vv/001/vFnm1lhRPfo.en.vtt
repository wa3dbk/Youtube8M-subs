saucepan than mine but click here but
the<00:00:10.889> saucepan<00:00:11.280> so<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.330> gonna<00:00:12.480> be<00:00:12.570> a

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the saucepan so this is gonna be a

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.400 
the saucepan so this is gonna be a
little<00:00:12.780> bit<00:00:13.099> different<00:00:14.099> okay<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:15.260> start<00:00:16.260> with

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
little bit different okay so start with

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.570 
little bit different okay so start with
her<00:00:16.590> ah<00:00:18.320> an<00:00:19.320> ellipse<00:00:19.740> like<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.460> it's

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
her ah an ellipse like that and it's

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.920 
her ah an ellipse like that and it's
gonna<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:21.439> you<00:00:22.439> know<00:00:22.470> want<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.859> feel<00:00:23.430> that

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
gonna be you know want to feel that

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.660 
gonna be you know want to feel that
bottom<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.109> frying<00:00:25.380> pan<00:00:25.619> inside<00:00:26.519> me

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
bottom of the frying pan inside me

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.820 
bottom of the frying pan inside me
brother<00:00:26.880> got<00:00:27.150> kinda<00:00:27.449> patterns<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.529> things<00:00:28.619> on

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
brother got kinda patterns and things on

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.999 
brother got kinda patterns and things on
ffensive<00:00:29.250> modern<00:00:29.580> frying<00:00:29.849> pans<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.269> um<00:00:31.140> now

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
ffensive modern frying pans and um now

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.569 
ffensive modern frying pans and um now
imagine<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.090> kind<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.480> square<00:00:34.579> like

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
imagine this is kind of a square like

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.190 
imagine this is kind of a square like
that<00:00:35.610> actually<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.300> does<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.719> fit<00:00:36.930> better

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
that actually that does that fit better

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.049 
that actually that does that fit better
right<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.590> don't<00:00:37.649> know<00:00:37.890> make<00:00:38.309> me<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.760> it'll<00:00:38.940> be

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
right I don't know make me and it'll be

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.400 
right I don't know make me and it'll be
coming<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.750> thinner<00:00:39.989> um<00:00:42.410> actually

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
coming out a bit thinner um actually

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.170 
coming out a bit thinner um actually
that<00:00:43.620> doesn't<00:00:44.010> feel<00:00:44.280> quite<00:00:44.730> right<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.090> think

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that doesn't feel quite right I think

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.930 
that doesn't feel quite right I think
you<00:00:45.390> need<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> different<00:00:46.050> angle<00:00:46.940> no

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you need to get a different angle no

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940 
you need to get a different angle no
that<00:00:48.270> doesn't<00:00:48.510> feel<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:49.079> either

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that doesn't feel right either

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189 
that doesn't feel right either
where's<00:00:50.100> my<00:00:50.309> eraser<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.660> very<00:00:51.960> rarely

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
where's my eraser see you very rarely

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.830 
where's my eraser see you very rarely
see<00:00:52.379> me<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.160> I'm<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.360> happy<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
see me do this I'm not happy with that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.010 
see me do this I'm not happy with that
right<00:00:55.649> that's<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.239> want<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
right that's there do you want this to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.389 
right that's there do you want this to
be<00:00:58.170> coming<00:00:59.149> out<00:01:00.260> about<00:01:01.260> an<00:01:01.469> angle<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.129> that

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
be coming out about an angle like that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.390 
be coming out about an angle like that
this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.660> kind<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.019> quite<00:01:04.949> trickier

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
this is this is kind of quite trickier

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.370 
this is this is kind of quite trickier
so<00:01:05.640> there<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.150> feels<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.689> bit<00:01:06.810> better<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
so there we go that feels a bit better I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.190 
so there we go that feels a bit better I
lost<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.549> line<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:09.150> gotta<00:01:09.600> put<00:01:09.840> my<00:01:09.990> back

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
lost that line there gotta put my back

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.620 
lost that line there gotta put my back
in<00:01:10.610> okay<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:11.850> gonna<00:01:11.970> go<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> way<00:01:12.540> around

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
in okay I'm gonna go all the way around

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.499 
in okay I'm gonna go all the way around
the<00:01:15.630> outside<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.180> I'm<00:01:18.390> gonna

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the outside like that and then I'm gonna

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.219 
the outside like that and then I'm gonna
come<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:20.270> like<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.049> will

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
come in here like that and that will

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.140 
come in here like that and that will
give<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.400> curve<00:01:23.640> round<00:01:23.970> here

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
give you this kind of curve round here

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.690 
give you this kind of curve round here
kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.479> gives<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> feel<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
kind of gives you a feel for the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.899 
kind of gives you a feel for the
thickness<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.450> material<00:01:28.490> then<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.640> come

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
thickness of the material then we come

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.039 
thickness of the material then we come
down<00:01:30.090> there<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:31.430> um<00:01:32.540> there's<00:01:33.540> wiggle<00:01:33.840> wiggle

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
down there then um there's wiggle wiggle

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.700 
down there then um there's wiggle wiggle
wiggle<00:01:34.380> around<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:36.140> came<00:01:37.140> well<00:01:37.439> can

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
wiggle around like that I came well can

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.130 
wiggle around like that I came well can
I<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.270> this<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.479> probably<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.259> abigai

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
I have this is probably like that abigai

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.550 
I have this is probably like that abigai
something<00:01:43.140> like<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:55.360 

kind<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.650> shading<00:01:49.790> something<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:51.120> that<00:01:51.540> and

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.700 

we<00:01:56.370> go<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:56.910> probably<00:01:57.120> got<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.570> sort<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.440> round

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
we go we probably got that sort of round

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.440 
we go we probably got that sort of round
dot<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.370> middle<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.030> something<00:02:00.300> like

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
dot in the middle of it something like

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.160 
dot in the middle of it something like
that<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.990> markings<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.800> so<00:02:04.760> you<00:02:05.760> want

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
that and markings and so you want

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.920 
that and markings and so you want
should've<00:02:07.170> shading<00:02:07.860> curves<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.729> around<00:02:09.390> there

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
should've shading curves in around there

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.200 
should've shading curves in around there
you<00:02:10.229> might<00:02:10.440> also<00:02:11.370> want<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.820> something

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
you might also want to have something

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.030 
you might also want to have something
around<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:13.050> something<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.800> that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
around there and something like that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.870 
around there and something like that
probably<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.600> shading<00:02:15.960> down<00:02:16.140> there<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.820> have<00:02:17.820> a

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
probably the shading down there I have a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.970 
probably the shading down there I have a
bit<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.090> shading<00:02:18.570> around<00:02:18.690> underneath<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.740> just

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
bit of shading around underneath it just
