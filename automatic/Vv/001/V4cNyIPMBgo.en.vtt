00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello and welcome to shares 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.080
 with head and we are in the summer 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.179
 arrived it is incredibly hot here 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.240
 in the forest and today there is one 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.360
 interesting topic in psychology 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.420
 the money row and who the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.510
 Pfennig does not honor the carla 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.660
 value and this idea to the video came 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.760
 not from me but from a member 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.380
 from our shares with head community 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.929
 group and he just has to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.899
 small video made while he 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.829
 somewhere in ukraine was and 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:01:02.059
 I will not do the video for you 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:01:12.450
 withheld from the Ukraine 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:14.630
 Motherland Park in Kiev and yesterday with 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.409
 the other something completely finished 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:31.590
 and yes I thought I had mine 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:32.340
 suggest what you could do 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.810
 come on it 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.270
 Above all, I'm here about the May Day 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.759
 Walks on the ground because quite a lot 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.110
 Let's see the coins 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:49.259
 bags so packed or smaller 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.350
 I think I have pieces and I think so 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.799
 wonder why someone 's money easy 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.799
 so on the floor 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.159
 hryvnia I think I do not know 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.189
 exactly 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.110
 anyway have a lot to 20 griffin 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:12.080
 I 've been there several times already 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.880
 noticed that it's weird 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.380
 reacts when you just enter 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.230
 have it a bit cool if some 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.860
 Higher cash flow is due to new ones 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.230
 looked at crookedly or even one 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.480
 bit is spilled directly if 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.430
 it is worth it to hum where 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.680
 One cent on the bus stop 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.330
 if you have 25 cent pfand bottles 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.890
 collects one can me so on the way 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.340
 to the supermarket is gone in returnable bottles 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.310
 bring to 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.420
 For example, I am always asked there 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.190
 no christopher why are you doing this 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.080
 because that's how much money it starts 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.720
 So many introduction to offer one 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.120
 relative and a question of contemplation 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.760
 but I personally think it's important 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.150
 just to have this mindset 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.030
 even small amounts to appreciate so yes 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.700
 I always try and everywhere somehow 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.530
 earn money or save money 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.150
 but without it at the same time 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.310
 restrict or somehow dislocate 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.829
 to have to work as a pilot though 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.970
 as an employee in the end my time 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.859
 and my time with my family 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.510
 could spend the and my hobbies 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.760
 I could spend against money 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.120
 I'm also fun, but I'm there 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.070
 in the sense of unfreezing I have to 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.140
 work independently and if now 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.049
 somewhere center is just then 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.540
 had to push me and tabs with one 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.790
 lower expenses basically earned 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.230
 which anyway degree freedom walk 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.019
 How should I not spend the money on everyone 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.269
 village or much more important to me 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:45.400
 Passive money to earn or money too 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.090
 I save my clearly etf dividend 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.600
 real estate investment so what is clear 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.700
 of course that for the royal league 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 passive income but also to 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.160
 For example, I have mine the other day 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.989
 car insurance had changed 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.400
 a little something just switched one 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.549
 a little less mileage because of me 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.080
 drive less now 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:10.030
 this investment small bit around 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.030
 screwed say 50 francs now 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.870
 and that has basically no work for me 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.870
 Just fill in the form 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:35.570
 the other ten say small 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.610
 Amounts actually totally unimportant or 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.870
 it is really about the mindset 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.750
 which basically is one more 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.610
 a bit further and the small change what 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.380
 I found earlier I did not know 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.510
 what I should buy from it I think 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.910
 I give it further on to a place 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.340
 old kari saleswoman if I have one 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:00.919
 if I always change too little 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:04.610
 and not about what's good as we have 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.630
 the opinion of chris seen and many 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.810
 Thanks again for that 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.300
 video and yes what is my opinion 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.449
 you should really pick up every cent 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.710
 which is on the street and should be 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:21.020
 really honoring every penny because then 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.449
 only then is the taler worth it 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.919
 my opinion is very clear indeed the 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.210
 who is not honored the penny 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.630
 not worth the talers 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.419
 but who the whole day just the penny 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.320
 he does not even honor that worth it 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.960
 is my opinion 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.389
 that means very simple and concrete yes 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.270
 I also have money on when I look up 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.370
 the street and yes I'm wasting too 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.810
 not unnecessary money and yes I have 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.159
 no problem at all even if 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.659
 I already have a bigger capacity 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.060
 Even if I have a set up 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:53.330
 higher income than many others 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.090
 save people anyway where I save 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.570
 and still just the money in the head too 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.690
 to have 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.760
 yes, but I'm not busy now 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.740
 the whole day with so I'm running now 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.419
 not around the forest all day long 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.940
 to look for 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.800
 that is when I happen to be money 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.260
 lie somewhere then I lift it 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.410
 because I honor the penny 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:18.200
 but I do not run around looking for 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.880
 enabled why not now because the one 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.770
 is a waste of time because I prefer to be in 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.510
 the time i do for myself personally 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:28.460
 creative rather have ideas spider there 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.160
 and work on projects 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.550
 they are not less and no more expensive 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.620
 but rinse gold lumps in the cash registers 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.000
 yes that means I am here so 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.690
 bit shared opinion on the one hand 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.650
 year 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.970
 you should honor the penny with it 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.790
 the taler is worth it 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.130
 but you should not make it out now 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.260
 Make hobby and the fun bottle collector 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.140
 because you will not stop 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.570
 wealthy by and wasted 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.140
 a lot of life with the money behind 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.320
 to run 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.180
 therefore very clear if by chance 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.660
 somewhere money from the song in any case 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.430
 but do not run through life 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.810
 look on the ground just because then 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.310
 you missed the nice things then too 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.930
 do not you see the sunset? 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.300
 then you do not see the possibilities 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.160
 in front of your eyes but only on 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.400
 floor and looks after the trendy 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.340
 and maybe hang on top of that 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.130
 beautiful talar trees just around the trees 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.200
 wait for them to be picked by you 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.360
 that was my opinion on each 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.910
 many thanks to chris for the video 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.690
 i'll chris also soon in the podcast as 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.120
 have a guest 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.950
 he has something I believe 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.510
 real estate tells me that he knows 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.470
 we have a bit of real estate 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.390
 then be a bit about it 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.120
 speak and I'm also very excited 

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.500
 on more private investors from the 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.340
 community with whom I podcast 

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.260
 can make 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.380
 that was first for this video what is 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.330
 your opinion yes that is your opinion 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.010
 but whoever does not honor the penny is 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.570
 not worth or to the complete 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.590
 nonsense writes it under this 

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.190
 video and then we will see each other 

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.590
 next time 

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.590
 purchasing shares with a head
