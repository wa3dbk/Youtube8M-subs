00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.440
 with the intensification of the sources 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.390
 radioactive from the first power lines 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.189
 to the modern apparatus for the 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.500
 telecommunications for dissemination 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.090
 broadcasting the possible relationship 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.310
 between exposure to fields 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.500
 electromagnetic in particular those 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.630
 of mobile phones and the increase of 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.669
 serious diseases and became the subject of 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.710
 study and comparison for the whole 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.170
 international scientific community 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.820
 however it has been found that many 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.980
 of the pathologies that afflict man 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.890
 depend mainly on radiation 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.989
 natural emitted from the underground and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.850
 this is the theme of the state of 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.679
 health of the environments of our life 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.809
 daily is a reason for 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.420
 interest in geobiology experts 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.239
 the science that allows us to search and 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.159
 find natural or artificial solutions 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.230
 to reclaim unhealthy dwellings or 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.210
 furnished with materials that can 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.219
 create nor occupancy dysfunctions 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.830
 particular systems exist 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.360
 protection are many uncertainties about 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.310
 potential risks of the fields 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.229
 electromagnetic especially on the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.630
 correlation between field exposure 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.939
 electromagnetic in particular those 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.320
 of mobile telephony and the emergence of 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.600
 pathologies in humans 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.990
 welcome to ulisse travel in ours 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.790
 time tonight is a welcome one 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.250
 return 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.380
 the return of professor nicola limardo 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.750
 environmental architect expert of 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.520
 biophysicist professor of environmental medicine 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.289
 at the university of brussels 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.909
 we at siena university thank you 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.829
 of course for 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.299
 having relied again in the 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.579
 capacity of this program of ours 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.020
 reach as many people as possible 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:53.390
 to inform them about some aspects of the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.369
 daily life that I am great 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.079
 interest in health what we 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.049
 we are going to deal specifically 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.000
 this evening will concern the interior more 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.200
 then the place where we live 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.590
 stationed more this is a table 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.530
 common house there are no 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.230
 areas and of the house that can be 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.900
 crossed by electromagnetic waves 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.970
 I'm radioactivity is take that 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.879
 however an electromagnetic field that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.489
 it is created natural but extremely 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.519
 important also harmful because of type 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.950
 ionizing ie are gamma and 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.810
 considered by the since by the iarc 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.209
 the international research agency 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.950
 on cancer that is the only one capable of 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.930
 determine if something does but I have it 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.269
 well to the tumor point of view o 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.950
 major class 1 diseases both 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.109
 definitely carcinogenic 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.680
 we also remember that the professor 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:50.660
 limardo and founder of the geo protex that 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.800
 it is a great reality that deals with 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.070
 own of the realization of 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.780
 apparatus tools that would prevent 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.310
 here are production systems that 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.470
 prevent electromagnetic waves 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.590
 to reach the man where the man is 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.210
 run it add that this oneself 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.620
 systems that were then patented in 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.840
 world and already used also for works 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.340
 public are not only able to 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.140
 protect from magnetic fields 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.060
 artificial that are things that obviously 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.670
 than other companies currently in the world 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.560
 I love but also to protect from 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.180
 natural radiation now more 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.650
 aggressive and more powerful than they are 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.390
 once the program has been completed, be careful 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.700
 gamma ray even more powerful than 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.350
 ray hicks therefore it is to be considered that 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.390
 until recently until not 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.340
 we had patented this product 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.740
 the only alternative we had e 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.510
 will apply was the application of 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.580
 at least one high lead layer 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.760
 at least seven centimeters of full lead 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.010
 if you are in a bar for 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.290
 say where you usually are not 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.020
 you have to fear nothing because of the exposure 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.320
 to an eventual 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.250
 gamma ray is kind of a few hours 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.569
 minimum and is not continuous and constant 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.939
 if instead 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:06.909
 slept for thirty years on the bed in the 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.409
 same room that maybe crossed by 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.829
 a gamma ray 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.810
 you run risks when a radiation 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.849
 those arrows come from underground 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.789
 it represents such radiation 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.009
 schematically the moment they go 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.050
 to break against this protection 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:26.199
 that you put under the mattress 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.940
 if it were absorbed then it would go into 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.370
 saturate the product immediately and then 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.960
 it would serve no purpose instead through 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.639
 a device we have 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.320
 through the production that is called 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.930
 plasma particle accelerator 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.750
 we can break up the radiation 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.030
 then to have it distributed over the whole 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.009
 perimeter and then creating precisely that 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.650
 effect ball ace radiation then you go to 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:51.240
 recompose and then the area where the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.190
 person stationed eco and protected not only 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.910
 that kind of bubble you see 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.380
 now it also manages to protect the 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.449
 person also from field 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.550
 artificial electromagnetic in high 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.099
 frequency I explain comes a wave from 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.380
 mobile phone or wifi that has its own 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:11.289
 Levogyrate scapular polarity than from a 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.509
 disturbance from the window arrived where 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.729
 there is the bubble is going to convert then 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:17.650
 does not go to disturb the sleep of the 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.199
 person or from that side 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.180
 so it works in three dimensions 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.849
 just to create this niche 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.639
 protective attests that later 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.470
 to use on some of my patients 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.259
 geo protec products if able to 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.750
 protect environmental pollution 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.710
 caused by natural radiation and 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.990
 then artificial electromagnetic 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.880
 also artificial have been obtained i 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.740
 improvements in their overall status 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.500
 of health without modifying in any way 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.460
 the clinical therapy proposed by the writer 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.340
 doctor anna villarini 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.509
 of the National Cancer Institute of Milan 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.460
 doctor anna villarini institute 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:57.070
 national tumors of milan that is also there 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.370
 the date 7 November 2007 so I want 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.020
 say it's all certified indeed is 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.870
 in short, it has been shown that 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:09.440
 this kind of work that 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:14.240
 she absolutely with her team 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:17.500
 takes place for several years produces gods 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.500
 truly extraordinary results
