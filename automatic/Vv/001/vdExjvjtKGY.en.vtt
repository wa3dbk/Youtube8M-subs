00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.620 

oh<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.220> by<00:00:24.460> looking<00:00:24.610> at<00:00:24.880> all<00:00:25.030> these<00:00:25.150> curves<00:00:25.420> and

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
oh so by looking at all these curves and

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.320 
oh so by looking at all these curves and
doing<00:00:26.369> excuse<00:00:27.369> me<00:00:27.490> I'm<00:00:27.610> comparing<00:00:27.939> with<00:00:28.210> other

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
doing excuse me I'm comparing with other

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.060 
doing excuse me I'm comparing with other
samples<00:00:28.869> are<00:00:28.990> that<00:00:29.380> are<00:00:29.500> understood<00:00:29.920> in

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
samples are that are understood in

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.950 
samples are that are understood in
knowing<00:00:30.369> we<00:00:31.000> can<00:00:31.150> start<00:00:31.360> getting<00:00:31.420> information

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
knowing we can start getting information

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.840 
knowing we can start getting information
about<00:00:32.349> cross-linking<00:00:33.100> that's<00:00:33.280> going<00:00:33.520> on<00:00:33.640> in

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
about cross-linking that's going on in

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.660 
about cross-linking that's going on in
the<00:00:33.910> system<00:00:34.300> fillers<00:00:35.190> possibly<00:00:36.190> molecular

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
the system fillers possibly molecular

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.479 
the system fillers possibly molecular
weight<00:00:36.879> gel<00:00:37.480> coins<00:00:37.780> here<00:00:38.200> ties<00:00:38.440> all<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.370> way

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
weight gel coins here ties all the way

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.010 
weight gel coins here ties all the way
so<00:00:39.640> these<00:00:39.820> are<00:00:40.000> some<00:00:40.150> ways<00:00:40.360> qualitative

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
so these are some ways qualitative

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.570 
so these are some ways qualitative
aspects<00:00:41.470> that<00:00:41.500> I<00:00:41.620> said<00:00:41.800> earlier<00:00:42.010> over<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:42.400> tip

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
aspects that I said earlier over the tip

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.850 
aspects that I said earlier over the tip
of<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.790> iceberg<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.870> can<00:00:44.050> get<00:00:44.199> that<00:00:44.230> by

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
of the iceberg you can get that by

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.530 
of the iceberg you can get that by
knowing<00:00:45.280> how<00:00:45.519> to<00:00:45.580> interpret<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.180> product

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
knowing how to interpret the product

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.950 
knowing how to interpret the product
occurs<00:00:46.900> in<00:00:47.080> chi<00:00:47.230> chi<00:00:47.440> migi<00:00:47.650> double<00:00:51.600> some<00:00:52.600> cases

occurs in chi chi migi double some cases
though<00:00:53.170> you<00:00:53.230> but<00:00:53.769> you<00:00:54.670> have<00:00:54.820> a<00:00:54.879> reactive

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
though you but you have a reactive

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.560 
though you but you have a reactive
material<00:00:55.570> you<00:00:55.960> can<00:00:56.110> also<00:00:56.260> use<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:57.040> DMA<00:00:58.000> to

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
material you can also use the DMA to

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.500 
material you can also use the DMA to
monitor<00:00:59.049> the<00:00:59.229> cure<00:00:59.530> of<00:00:59.799> the<00:01:00.070> reactive<00:01:00.519> or<00:01:00.970> from

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
monitor the cure of the reactive or from

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.180 
monitor the cure of the reactive or from

the right after material these are some

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.649 
the right after material these are some
boxes<00:01:03.670> that<00:01:03.850> were<00:01:03.940> here<00:01:04.150> two<00:01:04.330> different

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
boxes that were here two different

degree<00:01:11.020> see<00:01:11.290> as<00:01:11.770> we<00:01:11.950> expect<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.460> cures<00:01:12.880> a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030

often<00:01:14.020> flattened<00:01:14.440> out<00:01:14.530> that's<00:01:15.220> opera<00:01:15.700> glasses

often flattened out that's opera glasses

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.940 
often flattened out that's opera glasses
but<00:01:16.780> another<00:01:16.990> thing<00:01:17.170> of<00:01:17.290> all<00:01:17.440> is<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:17.920> that

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
but another thing of all is to is that

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.710 
but another thing of all is to is that
viscosity<00:01:18.340> at<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.940> very<00:01:19.150> beginning<00:01:19.299> was

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
viscosity at the very beginning was

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.230 
viscosity at the very beginning was
actually<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.140> holes<00:01:20.380> which<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.860> what<00:01:21.040> they

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
actually the holes which is what they

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.109 
actually the holes which is what they
expect<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:23.010> 150<00:01:24.010> at<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.700> highest

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
expect to 150 at that highest

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.790 
expect to 150 at that highest
temperature<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.689> initial<00:01:26.049> state<00:01:26.620> of<00:01:26.650> the

temperature the initial state of the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.700 
temperature the initial state of the
material<00:01:27.340> for<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:27.790> here's<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:29.290> going<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.590> be

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
material for it here's it's going to be

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.610 
material for it here's it's going to be
as<00:01:29.770> much<00:01:30.010> softer<00:01:30.580> much<00:01:30.790> funnier<00:01:31.560> than<00:01:32.560> the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
as much softer much funnier than the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.440 
as much softer much funnier than the
entry<00:01:33.010> of<00:01:33.070> materialism

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
entry of materialism

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.340 
entry of materialism
since<00:01:34.719> they<00:01:34.840> see<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.289> with<00:01:35.500> all<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:38.170> well

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
since they see that with all that well

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.889 
since they see that with all that well
setting<00:01:38.740> vices<00:01:39.219> cure<00:01:40.000> takes<00:01:40.210> longer<00:01:40.630> but<00:01:40.780> the

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
setting vices cure takes longer but the

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.609 
setting vices cure takes longer but the
initially<00:01:41.320> saw<00:01:41.500> see<00:01:41.770> also<00:01:42.130> ends<00:01:42.969> up<00:01:43.060> being

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
initially saw see also ends up being

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.780 
initially saw see also ends up being
hierarchy

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.250 

so<00:01:51.790> question<00:01:52.360> is<00:01:52.480> liking<00:01:52.870> to<00:01:53.020> get<00:01:53.140> this

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
so question is liking to get this

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.060 
so question is liking to get this
information<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.010> temporary<00:01:54.580> free<00:01:55.480> energy

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
information to the temporary free energy

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.880 
information to the temporary free energy

in Brooklyn most times that's because

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.230 
in Brooklyn most times that's because

can you manipulate that horny most

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.650 
can you manipulate that horny most
awesome

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.560 

now<00:02:28.200> sometimes<00:02:28.880> tma<00:02:29.880> really<00:02:30.240> can't<00:02:30.450> be

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
now sometimes tma really can't be

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.270 
now sometimes tma really can't be
overcome<00:02:30.870> sometimes<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.560> really<00:02:31.800> just<00:02:32.070> need

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
overcome sometimes it really just need

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.480 
overcome sometimes it really just need
to<00:02:32.310> discuss<00:02:32.930> that's<00:02:33.930> fine<00:02:34.200> nothing<00:02:34.770> wrong

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
to discuss that's fine nothing wrong

works<00:05:06.200> you<00:05:06.650> know<00:05:07.750> putting<00:05:08.750> a<00:05:08.930> fascist<00:05:09.500> with<00:05:09.650> it

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
works you know putting a fascist with it

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.620 
works you know putting a fascist with it
just<00:05:11.220> because<00:05:11.460> of<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.580> melt<00:05:11.760> index<00:05:11.940> is<00:05:12.389> wet

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
just because of the melt index is wet

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.879 
just because of the melt index is wet
it's<00:05:12.780> supposed<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.050> be<00:05:13.200> doesn't<00:05:13.590> mean<00:05:13.710> that

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
it's supposed to be doesn't mean that

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:20.600 
it's supposed to be doesn't mean that
your<00:05:14.220> digital<00:05:15.120> phone<00:05:15.720> free<00:05:19.160> so<00:05:20.160> if<00:05:20.310> I<00:05:20.430> thought

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
your digital phone free so if I thought

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.030 
your digital phone free so if I thought
this

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
this

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.450 
this
thought<00:05:24.040> Emily<00:05:24.520> was<00:05:24.550> not<00:05:24.910> very<00:05:25.060> Jeff<00:05:25.570> you<00:05:25.870> have

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
thought Emily was not very Jeff you have

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.820 
thought Emily was not very Jeff you have
it's<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.670> diet<00:05:27.910> minister<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:29.440> so<00:05:29.680> you're

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
it's a diet minister and so you're

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.250 
it's a diet minister and so you're
running<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.220> material<00:05:30.700> through<00:05:31.260> capillary

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
running the material through capillary

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.370 
running the material through capillary
or<00:05:32.470> slack<00:05:32.830> usually<00:05:33.820> have<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.180> measure<00:05:34.570> naps<00:05:34.930> to

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
or slack usually have to measure naps to

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.530 
or slack usually have to measure naps to
endure<00:05:35.620> pressure<00:05:35.950> drop<00:05:36.510> mass<00:05:37.510> flow<00:05:37.750> rate<00:05:37.960> and

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
endure pressure drop mass flow rate and

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:48.380 
endure pressure drop mass flow rate and
then<00:05:40.540> there's<00:05:40.720> a<00:05:40.960> equation

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.030 

you<00:05:48.840> can<00:05:48.990> very<00:05:49.200> sheer<00:05:49.560> right

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
you can very sheer right

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.510 
you can very sheer right
so<00:05:51.220> you<00:05:51.340> can't<00:05:51.580> get<00:05:51.990> but<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.250> thing<00:05:54.250> with<00:05:54.400> the

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
so you can't get but the thing with the

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.510 
so you can't get but the thing with the
capillaries<00:05:55.090> as<00:05:55.960> I<00:05:56.290> mentioned<00:05:56.320> most<00:05:57.040> event

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
capillaries as I mentioned most event

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.130 
capillaries as I mentioned most event
you<00:05:57.610> can<00:05:57.760> only<00:05:57.850> in<00:05:58.000> very<00:05:58.150> two<00:05:58.570> three<00:05:58.780> decades

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
you can only in very two three decades

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.559 
you can only in very two three decades
of<00:05:59.350> it<00:05:59.740> because<00:06:00.580> you're<00:06:00.700> not<00:06:00.850> working<00:06:01.330> at<00:06:01.450> g

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
of it because you're not working at g

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:03.939 
of it because you're not working at g
you<00:06:02.719> take<00:06:02.929> you<00:06:03.080> time<00:06:03.259> temperatures<00:06:03.770> as<00:06:03.919> a

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
you take you time temperatures as a

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.419 
you take you time temperatures as a
position<00:06:04.429> so<00:06:04.849> you're<00:06:05.059> limited<00:06:05.539> with<00:06:06.429> that

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:07.429 
position so you're limited with that

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:10.899 
position so you're limited with that
Deborah<00:06:08.089> sure<00:06:08.960> that<00:06:09.469> happens<00:06:09.619> to<00:06:09.919> be<00:06:09.949> what<00:06:10.789> you

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909 
Deborah sure that happens to be what you

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:18.320 
Deborah sure that happens to be what you
need<00:06:10.969> great<00:06:12.999> depth

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.659 

though<00:06:18.930> it<00:06:19.139> works<00:06:19.319> with<00:06:19.530> multi<00:06:20.250> polymers

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669
