00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.139
 Tell me guys, nobody's bringing it. 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:12.389
 another video and today I wanted 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.470
 bring this electric barbecue cnee 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.810
 she is more decorative than 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.179
 that's functional because she can only do it 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.970
 only in creative mode can not 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:28.740
 I do not serve because you're going to need it. 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.859
 of a set of people then this is it is 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.900
 leaving that button in the button is fine 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.540
 simple even he left narrowly 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.920
 then the lava appears and burns it 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.730
 until it dies and the bacon will come out here is the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.580
 sardine 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.790
 Let me see, with the beaks, it's God. 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.770
 six vehicles pretty white then to 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.400
 We make this our barbecue. 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.190
 electrical 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.350
 We're going to have to dig a 5-per-hole. 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.790
 four and four deep 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.190
 we will see in one of the fields of 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.920
 put two blocks in this second here 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.829
 It will change if our button is to 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.409
 who does not know the button it gets a short 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.020
 good 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.119
 short term links to the stone network 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.219
 So we'll have to extend this 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.259
 time we tasted at that time people 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.049
 will stop being here from below and 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.649
 increase or decrease the level of 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.119
 low 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.520
 Let's have to focus is that these blocks 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.679
 uniting as if it were a circle then 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.020
 this side here we get a 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:33.890
 repeater standard level and here we 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.920
 get 272 each on level 4 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.229
 then we'll call all those 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.409
 with a net stone being from here people 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.030
 Never again a block and a tony here 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.849
 in that corner a torch and the redstone here 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.119
 so being on the side of there never again 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:56.239
 repeater level 4 in white now this 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:02.929
 request said that the kennel 41 with a block 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:04.819
 at the time it's 12 being from here wait leaves 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.569
 I see this one still from here we put 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:11.750
 but a repeater we 'll put is 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:16.970
 repeated until leaving here forming six is 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.940
 level 4, this level 4 left verifies that 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.050
 when the competitors so far have been 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:27.900
 here a repeater 234 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.190
 6 Then those are right. 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.680
 repeaters that we will have to 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.770
 put out of here will leave another one 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.420
 block and a tony network here will stay in 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.370
 contact then we put a block 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.850
 to separate to stay 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.890
 is this online network alone there then 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.350
 here we put a block a network 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.410
 stone prouni I'm going to leave a block that 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.660
 It is easier then here where people 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.720
 of rain in this doni nets 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.700
 We 're going to put a block by block. 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.080
 are left leaving the skin that they think 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.210
 I misplaced it 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.780
 Bye, we'll have to leave. 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:10.110
 right here it was right it was not right 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.190
 oh god let the leaves break 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.860
 kia 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.730
 sorry that things happen and 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.710
 people will have to leave 22 questions and 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.340
 People have to leave this space here. 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.740
 between the floor and the piston that it will 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.420
 stay activated so here we go 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.000
 leave the block now here we go 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.810
 cover and put there go to the body was 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.370
 burned 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.500
 so we'll have to have one to 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.780
 This part here for who in the tooth 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.450
 contact her for now 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.000
 and here exactly here we will have 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.630
 to leave a dispenser a dispenser 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.600
 It's true here and we're going to put the pig is 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.209
 the pig not a deal stayed by then 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.090
 is basically ready to top up the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.660
 rest here to check if everything is 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.950
 Okay, I'll get the glass as well. 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.590
 fast 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.450
 I need more of the local tv button. 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.110
 he presses the button 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.450
 There I left 2 pigs and that's when I came there. 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.160
 a certain time there it will burn and 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.200
 Our bacon is going to be grilled so it's 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.180
 For those who do not know why it came out two 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.550
 Sometimes it 's because when we 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.310
 button he'll be there once with 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.950
 this energetic tonic underneath it goes 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.419
 send energy to this next block 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.000
 Energize this one again 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.240
 so either it will come out twice as much 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.850
 Bacon, it 's very good, our 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.370
 if our barbecue then here the 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.010
 people can cover modified everything 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.860
 Right, it takes up a little bit more 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.010
 space is just that in this other 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.940
 singing will not make much difference 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.889
 so this is it 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.840
 This is ours. This is ours. 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.729
 our electric barbecue is very easy 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.340
 even if you want to do it 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.380
 put on your map whether or not it will go 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.120
 have to switch to the creative and then 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.550
 brought a new lease because as 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.940
 said you can not find 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.919
 these pork eggs so this is it personal 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.050
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.930
 video do not forget to leave your lay the 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.310
 favorite to help spread the word 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.690
 So stay with God. 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.690
 a hug and I went
