00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.850
 UFOs a global problem that has even been analyzed in the United Nations 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.650
 at the initiative of Granada, special sessions will be organized in 1978 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.030
 and 1979 attended by world UFO research leaders 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:21.199
 After the deliberations, the United Nations urged the member countries to 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.619
 study UFO cases 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 and report the results global organizations 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.899
 remains a subject treated with great discretion 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.009
 In addition, desert organizations have been formed in many countries 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.240
 systematically deny the existence of all kinds of men 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.460
 his septic way of seeing can be very useful in the field of men 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.630
 fortunately, with those of us who deal in many cases with the square 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.250
 lesseps there is no more than two and two hours tried to prove things little time 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.060
 we are dealing with people who want to discredit guti seems to have little to 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.170
 offer as they are the true believers know that it does not have much to 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.260
 say about eating but we do not pay attention toscazo only 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.010
 they do programs and charges skepticism is seeing there but discredit not 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.840
 is nothing useful to hold the most negative is philip glass the former editor of 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.390
 daily sowetan technological guests many times I criticize all that 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.140
 today they continue to make the same senseless charges over and over again and that these 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.230
 you will run out of fundamentals you will not be able to hold those songs true but 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.750
 I would be happy if they will pay me a thousand to prove they are wrong and for 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.770
 provide more than ten documents with the same typography as the one used 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.920
 in the white house 1953 diego she concentrate on nine documents of the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.070
 251 gioja this material in the library that change is not fair does not constitute 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.460
 a solid foundation that is going to make conclusions putting nine of the 250 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.630
 a thousand is not serious 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.270
 that's why in his opinion of dogma 5 and skeptics that in France 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.730
 women the Andean security a skeptic of the eyes looks not only 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.750
 wants to discredit and knows practically nothing about mushrooms 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.410
 and says stupidities hites analyzes large spatial walks connected with dots 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.080
 low prices that reaches erroneous conclusions because he played with different type 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.260
 of septic rest and cheek cadets we were classmates in the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.730
 University of Chicago would not have to continue to draw points conclusions 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.810
 about fake flying saucers one of the most recent is that every time you 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.150
 carefully analyze a UFO sighting percent you reach the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.209
 conclusion that it is a fraud there was an error this statement in itself is a 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.630
 quetzalteca scientific study fraud provides a large amount of 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.760
 observations that are not what he says but are obviously evidence of the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.030
 extraterrestrial intelligence to think to control photos russian space ships 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.030
 country 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.739
 people who have seen UFOs are not only peasants with low levels of 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.639
 education 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.579
 we have also seen very prestigious people 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.509
 the former president of the United States jimmy carter in the company of another 20 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:02.790
 people saw a UFO on January 6, 1969 by that time it was compared to 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.790
 28 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:11.529
 On November 17, 1986 a plane of a Japanese airline followed three 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.329
 men for half an hour 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.329
 the pilot 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.569
 ken ritter here one of the most experienced japanese pilots said that 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.569
 the biggest of the UFOs was five times bigger than me moche 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.089
 changed the speed surprisingly and quickly 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.299
 and the captain also stated that the UFOs were coming from outer space 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.889
 there are hundreds of photographs 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.619
 a pioneer of UFO research this espadán sky who photographed 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:44.019
 UFOs in the 50s with the help of a telescope 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.909
 adams who also claimed to have seen humanoids and flown into space 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.789
 outside with them 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:53.579
 the skeptics have offered dozens of explanations about the photography of the 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.359
 flying dish of atamisqui suggested that it could be the top of a 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.359
 vacuum cleaner or ashtray 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:04.719
 a photograph alone can never be the final test since the 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.719
 Photographic tricks allow hundreds of possibilities 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:14.489
 the last days in the life of poplars that were tragic was qualified as 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.009
 a liar 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.829
 the photographs were taken by a North American couple the problems the 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.900
 May 11, 1950 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.729
 the researchers consider them as some of the most reliable 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.830
 photographs of men 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.650
 the target of that frenzy at least on an equal scale compared to the case 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.300
 the mosque was in the cornellá of switzerland 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.360
 for the result his photographs and for manifesting with pacts with um to notimex 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.530
 even before investigating his statements he was considered the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.699
 deceased century UFOs 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.090
 Mayer said he had been in contact with humanoids who said 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.650
 be replaced at 11-year intervals 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.999
 the same rate of change that occurs in the activity of sunspots 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.719
 the creatures of other galaxies told him to be careful when he 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:58.210
 they were approaching humans 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.580
 because they did not want to start a new religion 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.919
 The larger photographs show five different types of UFOs 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.889
 the investigation into the mayer case was carried out by the lieutenant 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.029
 Colonel when the pilots of the American Air Force 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.210
 who studied UFOs since 1940 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.210
 I had a file of three thousand photographs of men 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.170
 the question 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.000
 because I think that the cases of the Swiss media or is that they are true 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.309
 contacts with men 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:33.479
 and the same and why he accepted as true such amazing images 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.550
 UFO photographs 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.469
 I must also admit that during the investigation that 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:45.059
 we do not find a photographer but not five different photographers 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:48.080
 of all related to this case 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.080
 all took pictures of spacecraft 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.570
 it may never be four photographers simultaneously from different points 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.449
 strategic took pictures of the same ship at the same time 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.340
 the images but they were taken with four different cameras four rolls 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.379
 of different film were processed in four different laboratories in 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.830
 four different countries and all showed the same object 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:23.889
 we also take 4 of the best photographs 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.240
 fit each of the four cases 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.990
 and in the United States is submitting looks for a meticulous control 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:38.330
 in which they invested more than 60 thousand dollars in equipment destroy thanks 

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:41.329
 I sell modern high technology 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:47.089
 during the investigation of these photographs of reilly men 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:52.300
 we discovered that we could continually have to eliminate it a peace process 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.169
 now that we could always rule out processes that are more familiar in the art 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.169
 photographic for photographing 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:08.159
 pekin for a lot of success we were able to eliminate all known processes 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:12.639
 technically used after presents to produce false images 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:16.869
 there we arrived something unknown 

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:20.709
 We did not know how these photographs were achieved unless they had 

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:25.749
 taken in real time to true spacecraft as arguing nick 

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:29.589
 before his innocence but he opined on why only a few friends 

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:32.589
 they manifest chords the whole record is worse 

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:37.839
 only a few reports on the observation of UFOs 

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:42.399
 although they do not visualize frequently goal because in our country 

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:46.519
 outside the cup the commercial pilot who reports a visualization 

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:53.199
 a photograph from the polite line plane chased by talking outside 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.199
 the terminal of the airline l 

00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:00.009
 this tragedy all that happens in ee
