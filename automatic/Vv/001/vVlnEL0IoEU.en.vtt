00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.130
 in Spanish human humans were 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.369
 non-playable characters 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.619
 n &amp; p cs that adapt the form of clones of 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.080
 the default skin could be 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.750
 created by pressing g in creative mode but 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.269
 this function was removed later if the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.740
 player had a custom skin those 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.470
 humans would continue to respawn 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.870
 I walk with the skin by default humans 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.300
 they could not create or delete blocks just 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.460
 move around the map aimlessly walking 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.710
 in imperfect circles and jumping from 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.990
 once in a while the humans looked 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.730
 affected by the solid blocks but 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.830
 strangely not for liquids 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.020
 walking through them as if 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.330
 were air when spawn e avant 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.250
 they chased and attacked the player although 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.320
 they had no animation when attacking 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.210
 they simply limited themselves to approaching and 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.190
 hit him like zombies 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.230
 this is all I hope you have clarified 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.230
