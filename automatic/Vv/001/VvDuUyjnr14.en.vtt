00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.760
 and then youtube me I'm linux brs 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.210
 I'm here again on the various website 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.500
 Where are you going to show it to you guys? 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.030
 get in the br br personal who gets better né 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.420
 versus puntocom bar br 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.840
 I'm here with the launch of samsung o 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.930
 s4 mini comparing with f 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:30.430
 3000 I already did it on the channel through the site 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:33.159
 gsm arena comparative but it's just me 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.019
 I spoke of one and the other but I did not say 

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:37.809
 of the reasons this site is very cool 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.129
 because he talks about the reasons 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.179
 are you going to buy one and what are the reasons 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.019
 that you would take to buy the other then 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:48.549
 you see here 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:51.190
 in the picture the four mini ss is what is 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:54.129
 here to the left it is a little more straight 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.039
 and the rounded corners while the s3 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:01.690
 me it's more bend side on up here 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:06.000
 and the curve is much more pronounced than 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.370
 the 4 mini has a small difference of 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.400
 design is a little more straight and four 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:17.560
 he has been with us for more or less 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.120
 not the right style line note the mini s3 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.660
 but as I told you but the curve 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.870
 side and come on the f4000 has 18 reasons 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.540
 for you buy it and s3 has me six 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.420
 motives then means between one and 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.470
 another obviously the s4 corn would be better 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.000
 choice 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.040
 the s4 mini today it's around a thousand 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.820
 180 thousand four hundred reais is 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.010
 folks 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:50.470
 s3 mini it comes out of 850 which is a price 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:53.550
 basics now is 999 but you are more 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.900
 easy you find now is the price of 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.450
 850 reais and the military str4 fell from a thousand 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.210
 and 300 thousand and 400 thousand three hundred and ninety 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.340
 nine thousand four hundred reais and has 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.399
 is approaching its 1200 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.129
 real but 1,180 the cheaper price than 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.660
 I already saw on my personal cell phone. 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.450
 so come on c'mon 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.990
 know the 18 reasons you would take 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.810
 you buy the s4 mini let's go there 18 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.780
 significant reason significantly 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.910
 more megapixels it has 8 megapixels 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.390
 against 5 megapixels, right? 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.830
 clear and more megapixels by camera 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.990
 1.9 s3 front mini s3 mini 0.3 it 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.340
 has much more battery power of 1,900 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.740
 thousand companies could be a little bit 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.800
 the stronger the battery in my opinion 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.800
 is a little narrower 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.650
 he has more ram memory has a point 5 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.810
 against 1 1 GB of RAM 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.250
 he's a little thinner 88 points 94 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.830
 millimeters against 9.9 s3 mgf in the west 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.030
 4 thousand can be thinner and s4 more 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.180
 fine yet personal 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.640
 it is lighter and obviously volume 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.860
 width and height it stays if 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.100
 it is has a smaller volume 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.030
 the screen is slightly larger is 4.3 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.620
 inches is a 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.500
 I think the size four inches 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.320
 jorge jardim del 4.3 is already over or 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.830
 except there he is in business 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.490
 cool for me, it's in my opinion 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.680
 folks 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.000
 the pixel density is slightly higher 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.630
 from 56 against 233 the download he speaks 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.730
 which has 42 megabits versus 21 megabits is 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.340
 or twice the speed 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.459
 the semiconductor is clearly smaller if the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.830
 driver is the size of the trails in the 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.540
 on the cell phone is 28 nanometer innominate 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.100
 against 32 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.830
 there is the clock it is one of the 1.7 accord against 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.530
 one of the alcohol of 1 ghz or is once a 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.590
 point seven times faster still 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.800
 In other words, it is a good personal 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.550
 good processor 3071 west processor 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.610
 very good but dodô s4 he is very good 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.160
 personnel has manual adjustment of 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.400
 white has manual adjustment of the elderly 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.530
 that already has to do with camera 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.880
 and the resolution it is slightly higher is 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.650
 person 35% higher 960 by 540 vs. 800 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.020
 by 480 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.690
 Manual adjustment clearly opening 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.680
 best video recording quality 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:40.360
 it records in full hd at 30fps versus 720p 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.810
 at 30 fps personal ie the west four 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.900
 mini it seems to be is he is a brother 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:51.370
 s 4 but it is a version 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:54.160
 much better than the s3 mini it has 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.400
 so the hardware set much better 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.000
 than the s3 mini and its reasons 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.919
 would take you to buy the s3 mini 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.139
 flash I do not know if I ran the 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.949
 my it does not run adobe flash has 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:13.330
 rear illumination sensor is has a 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:17.050
 monitor corning glass is that you and talks 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.060
 gorilla glass here I do not know if it's not 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.669
 he has anti-scratch protection he talks 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.550
 gorilla glass more nuns otherwise I do not 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:27.580
 I saw no place talking that is super 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:31.479
 amoled but is not goianésia now I do not know 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.810
 where they took this information memory 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.940
 it has 16 gigs not mine has 8 gb of 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.220
 memory I think you did too 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.449
 it gets you another 16 gigabyte model that 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.349
 it's sold out 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.560
 loading much faster 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:50.139
 loading would be 5.8 upload against 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:54.220
 5.76 does not change much and it is a 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:58.990
 a little more is thinner in what is said 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.840
 so the length is 121 versus 124 is 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.150
 Obviously the 4 mm is a little larger 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.260
 because it has 4.3 screen against 4 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.940
 inches 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.039
 okay so it's my record is kind of like it 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.889
 There are two things here that are 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.560
 in the middle of this discussion gorilla glass 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:20.020
 which I do not think has three gorilla 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.360
 adobe flash glass and 16 gb of memory 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.060
 because my view with eight gigs of 16 is 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.580
 selling personal 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.650
 so that's what I decided to do here 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.280
 because I already did by gsm still like 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.889
 I spoke to you there is much more is much 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.960
 more technical, the thing here gives us 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:40.150
 talk a little more open because the 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.660
 terms are better goes to the 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.900
 people 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.670
 lay right people who want to have is a 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.230
 understanding better than a cell phone 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.690
 is related to the other 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.790
 the gcm is more technical is that it has 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.190
 this has what it works this way 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.410
 if understood then that it is a more 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:59.230
 clear and you'll see 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.730
 it's like it's a device and the other 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.010
 make the comparison 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.380
 personal touch then this is it if you 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.800
 Did you personally like oceania? 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:11.850
 Leave the message there on the personal touch channel 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.850
 Thank you and see you
