00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.100
 there is a subtle all big hi I'm glad 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.290
 greet you on your channel 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:16.010
 Today there will be a video of empty jars 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.869
 which ended in my month of june 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.759
 I wanted to shoot this video 1 2 place to us 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.939
 It does not work because the package is already 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.950
 filled with empty cans heap you can 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.020
 very soon will not throw out the package 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.880
 for empty jars and a bag for empty 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.009
 jars so let's get started 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.320
 I will quickly tell them my opinion about 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.880
 each of product 1 is humane and such 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.640
 hair spray from the brand charm 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.640
 superstrong fixing effect 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.129
 memory a good varnish does not glue the hair 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.480
 Well, more precisely not quite strongly sticks them together 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.089
 no smell 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.219
 budget but basically what else can 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.649
 demand from varnish is not over 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.070
 sea ​​buckthorn hair spray from grandmother 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.739
 Agafi easy combing smells strongly 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.960
 Sea buckthorn jar is not very convenient for you 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.579
 very quickly the chair is the cover 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.680
 after the third use to me 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.960
 broke pump I had to pour out 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.400
 I didn't notice anything special 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.890
 properties from this spray 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.000
 we kind of comb as well as after 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.710
 air conditioner 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.280
 and since I use not only 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.140
 shampoo but also always conditioner not mask 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.969
 of some kind of such effect from 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.219
 I did not notice this spray 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.799
 useless from my point of view thing 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.750
 don't advise anyone I don't know at all for 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.640
 what is it next product which 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.680
 I ended long ago in favorites 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.380
 This is a Tuscan hair mask from 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.210
 planeta organica smells very nice 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.000
 just awesome flavor 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.820
 cool moisturizes your hair super shiny 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.619
 easy to comb after and generally this 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.600
 I advise the mask to everyone because she 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.549
 really very cool working on 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.350
 hair following empty jar from 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.960
 brand garnier micellar water 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.509
 I think not worth nothing to say 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.890
 because she's just awesome 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.320
 now i use micellar water 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.479
 The light is not entirely wrong 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.250
 the effect is because here if it is valid 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.619
 cleans from 2 cotton pads completely 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.550
 make-up then 1 light is not necessary 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.290
 use 4 cotton pad 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.390
 I like this one for 1 year 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.480
 that she removes her makeup very well 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.670
 also does not irritate the eyelid skin does not cause 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.370
 no rash if eyes fall 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.330
 eyes do not pinch in general super tool 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.190
 I will take more 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.470
 next time I will not take any 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.330
 others but I will be true only this 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.130
 micellar water I go further 2 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.890
 bird shampoo marsilla 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.900
 and from grandmother agafya shampoo from leptin 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.210
 make wars of green dry hair with mine 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.850
 hair just dandelion so no one 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.550
 his advice never buy it from 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.820
 Agafya's grandmothers good shampoo for everyone 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.340
 hair types based on soap root 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.920
 good clean hair very budget not 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.200
 for your chase it bought for 36 rubles 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.180
 I like much more than this 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.410
 the best in line I have empty jars 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.660
 shower gels 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.660
 first most favorite of this brand is ive roshe 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.270
 India's cotton flower is just insane it 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.400
 I love the feeling of purity the smell of freshness 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.380
 very very soft cream not 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.570
 skin irritates skin after use 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.830
 this shower gels are very soft 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.420
 moisturized don't even need to use 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.459
 some kind of body cream 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.200
 the next shower gel that's neve effect 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.330
 bath with the scent of pine 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.130
 if the wife smells and with the bike keeps 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.290
 some kind of cleansing granules which 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.690
 engagement process with this shower gel 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.120
 I don't feel it at all 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.280
 such a visual effect principle me 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.650
 I liked it possible I will take it again 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.860
 last year, I ’m from the brand myself 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.200
 vitox effect with grapefruit scent tubes 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.390
 nice but when you use it in 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.850
 the smell of the soul becomes so very 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.830
 strongly chemical unpleasant quickly him 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.900
 spent because it used 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.910
 as a foam bath no one 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.100
 I advise you not to buy ended 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.140
 organic cedar conditioner 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.390
 from planeta organica I had a series 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.670
 shampoo and balm usual balm 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.290
 I didn't notice any special effect 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.550
 the only negative in this balm is 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.830
 that it is very strong in 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.700
 that is really hard for him to squeeze out 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.160
 this tube 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.130
 so hardly take this series again 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.870
 since there are some pluses special i'm not 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.030
 noticed on ran out of me four 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.310
 bag of Crimean pink bath salts 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.680
 anti-cellulite here is not only salt for 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.690
 bath inside and another bag with active 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.459
 anti-cellulite complex do not know how 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.560
 what about cellulite is fighting on with it or 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.170
 no but very cool tightens the skin 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.450
 after bathing with this salt skin 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.310
 very elastic i like this salt i take 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.550
 not the first time using this salt 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.960
 course 1 sachet one bath each you 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.360
 I accept every other day 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.010
 using 10 sachets ended with me 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.480
 face cream from planets organics 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.000
 youth activator based on 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.530
 organic seaweed plain cream for 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.870
 faces 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.880
 cheap to experience it 80 rubles in Auchan 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.860
 didn't notice from using this cream 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.320
 of some special action he's not 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.080
 just clogged pores on the face did not jump out 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.870
 acne and in the end I used to 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.370
 for relationships and cleavage smell he 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.620
 a little odd he doesn't smell 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.660
 air freshener therefore unlikely 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.640
 ever look even in the direction of this 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.050
 cream the next cream i just adore 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.760
 Generally johnson's brand after 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.040

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.930
 I'm 24 hours moisturizing hand cream 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.419
 it smells really good 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.000
 absorbs moisturizes the skin does not leave 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.630
 sticky layer in general I'm in love with this 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.820
 series 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.040
 I advise everyone and I will take the products myself 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.169
 Johns future left me completely 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.300
 slightly over cream from avon foot 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.980
 works cream natopysh 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.510
 such a bit strange product has 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.760
 gel thick texture 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.020
 not bad absorbed well softens 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.850
 skin on must pass quite 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.230
 extended amount of time to 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.990
 he was completely absorbed 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.750
 for the summer I do not like this cream 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.270
 near we may well take more 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.330
 Once over the skin of the planets of organics with 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.000
 snowdrop good n 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.250
 the face cleans well 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.080
 but not bad coming out really for 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.199
 any skin type as indicated on the package 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.240

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.219
 irritations and has a very nice 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.710
 working the last two products is spray 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:04.289

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.919
 I only feel about them from this series 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.169
 sweet refreshing fruit floral 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.780

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.550
 I don't know, but I always insist at home 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.199
 on the dressing table it is this fragrance 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.180
