00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you how our network works yeah but yes

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.940 
you how our network works yeah but yes
Mona<00:01:35.640> yep<00:01:36.119> right<00:01:36.630> through<00:01:36.900> principle<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.740> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
Mona yep right through principle that is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560 
Mona yep right through principle that is
thats<00:01:38.400> monitoring<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> air<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.300> we<00:01:39.540> breathe

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
thats monitoring the air that we breathe

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.320 
thats monitoring the air that we breathe
okay<00:01:40.440> we<00:01:40.979> starts<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.640> off<00:01:41.729> beeping

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
okay we starts going off beeping

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.180 
okay we starts going off beeping
dramatically<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.170> flashing<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.740> lights<00:01:43.860> at

that gia has by using the sewer system
is<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.819> we<00:02:59.909> can<00:03:00.060> drastically<00:03:00.359> reduce<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
is that we can drastically reduce the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.750 
is that we can drastically reduce the
amount<00:03:01.469> of<00:03:01.620> digging<00:03:01.980> that's<00:03:02.129> required<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.730> the
