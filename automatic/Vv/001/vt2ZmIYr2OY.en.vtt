that's what this workout supposed to do

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.839 
that's what this workout supposed to do
but<00:00:27.330> what<00:00:27.390> has<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.410> happen<00:00:28.439> afterwards<00:00:29.429> in

but what has to happen afterwards in

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.360 
but what has to happen afterwards in
order<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:31.920> get<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.250> muscles<00:00:32.790> more<00:00:34.340> like<00:00:35.340> a

order to get your muscles more like a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.299 
order to get your muscles more like a
better<00:00:35.670> quality<00:00:35.969> muscles<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.160> you

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
better quality muscles you know and you

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.549 
better quality muscles you know and you
have<00:00:38.489> those<00:00:38.940> muscles<00:00:39.360> need<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:40.020> recovered

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
have those muscles need to be recovered

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.830 
have those muscles need to be recovered
you<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.250> help<00:00:41.550> better<00:00:42.030> recovery<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
you have to help better recovery you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.889 
you have to help better recovery you
have<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.079> help<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.500> nutrition<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:45.660> have

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
have to help with nutrition and you have

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.580 
have to help with nutrition and you have
to<00:00:46.170> help<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.829> stretching<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.969> cooldown<00:00:48.570> so

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.220 

so<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.940> post-workout<00:00:53.940> nutrition<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.870> very

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
so the post-workout nutrition is very

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
so the post-workout nutrition is very
more<00:00:55.469> important<00:00:55.920> than<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> pre-workout

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
more important than the pre-workout

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.639 
more important than the pre-workout
nutrition<00:00:56.820> however<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.109> talk<00:00:58.320> about<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
nutrition however we can talk about the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.349 
nutrition however we can talk about the
pre-workout<00:00:59.100> nutrition<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.699> important<00:01:00.210> as

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
pre-workout nutrition it's important as

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.219 
pre-workout nutrition it's important as
well<00:01:01.670> what<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> should<00:01:03.030> eat<00:01:03.300> first<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.080> all

if you are like really starving and it's
making<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.520> nauseous<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.450> obvious

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
making you nauseous then it's obvious

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929 
making you nauseous then it's obvious
that<00:01:28.439> you're<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.130> gonna<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.400> working<00:01:29.820> out

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that you're not gonna be working out

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.210 
that you're not gonna be working out
because<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.659> faint<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.159> you

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
because you can faint you know so you

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.440 
because you can faint you know so you
don't<00:01:32.369> want<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.030> either

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
don't want to do that either

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.060 
don't want to do that either
but<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.430> snack<00:01:36.380> an<00:01:37.380> hour

but you can have a little snack an hour

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.760 
but you can have a little snack an hour
before<00:01:38.369> workout<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.509> suggest<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.590> you

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
before workout and I suggest that you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.999 
before workout and I suggest that you
stick<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.460> protein<00:01:42.420> lean<00:01:43.290> protein<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
stick with protein lean protein and

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.690 
stick with protein lean protein and
healthy<00:01:44.670> fats<00:01:45.049> because<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:47.009> that's<00:01:47.399> your

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
healthy fats because if if that's your

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.819 
healthy fats because if if that's your
last<00:01:48.030> meal<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.600> ate<00:01:48.780> before<00:01:48.960> your

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
last meal that you ate before your

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.389 
last meal that you ate before your
workout<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:51.420> during<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> workout<00:01:52.950> you're

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
workout then during the workout you're

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.880 
workout then during the workout you're
gonna<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.850> burning<00:01:54.060> actually<00:01:54.720> more<00:01:55.409> calories

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
gonna be burning actually more calories

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.569 
gonna be burning actually more calories
from<00:01:56.219> fat<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.490> suggest<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:01.579> things

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579

from fat so I suggest that you things
like<00:02:02.729> raw<00:02:03.450> almonds<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.009> great

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
major goal is weight loss and fat loss

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.490 
major goal is weight loss and fat loss
you<00:04:44.490> know<00:04:44.640> you<00:04:45.090> have<00:04:45.300> your<00:04:45.570> obviously<00:04:46.140> going

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
you know you have your obviously going

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.820 
you know you have your obviously going
for<00:04:47.390> expending<00:04:48.390> more<00:04:48.750> energy<00:04:48.810> than<00:04:49.680> you're

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
for expending more energy than you're

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.770 
for expending more energy than you're
taking<00:04:50.040> in<00:04:50.400> because<00:04:50.790> you<00:04:51.090> know<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.480> it's

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
taking in because you know that it's

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.490 
taking in because you know that it's
calories<00:04:52.560> in<00:04:52.830> calories<00:04:53.160> out<00:04:54.200> when<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:55.290> comes

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
calories in calories out when it comes

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.050 
calories in calories out when it comes
to<00:04:55.710> weight<00:04:55.830> loss<00:04:55.890> so<00:04:56.490> if<00:04:56.610> you're<00:04:56.760> going<00:04:56.910> after

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
to weight loss so if you're going after

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.130 
to weight loss so if you're going after
weight<00:04:57.360> loss<00:04:57.950> have<00:04:58.950> this<00:04:59.550> type<00:05:00.480> of<00:05:00.750> recovery

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
weight loss have this type of recovery

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.510 
weight loss have this type of recovery
training<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.420> then<00:05:03.420> you<00:05:03.510> just<00:05:03.720> have<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:04.050> watch

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
training and then you just have to watch

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.740 
training and then you just have to watch
obviously<00:05:05.520> what<00:05:05.700> you<00:05:05.820> eat<00:05:06.030> for<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.360> rest<00:05:06.630> of

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
obviously what you eat for the rest of

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.140 
obviously what you eat for the rest of
the<00:05:06.930> day<00:05:07.110> but<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.770> protein<00:05:08.040> right<00:05:08.670> after<00:05:09.030> we

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
the day but the protein right after we

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.740 
the day but the protein right after we
workout<00:05:09.540> it's<00:05:09.810> super<00:05:10.290> important<00:05:10.890> and<00:05:11.690> in<00:05:12.690> a

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
workout it's super important and in a

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.460 
workout it's super important and in a
liquid<00:05:13.350> form<00:05:13.380> like<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:14.630> it's<00:05:15.630> even<00:05:16.230> better

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
liquid form like this it's even better

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.260 
liquid form like this it's even better
because<00:05:16.650> it<00:05:17.130> absorbs<00:05:17.630> by<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:18.690> body<00:05:19.130> because

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
because it absorbs by the body because

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.510 
because it absorbs by the body because
directly<00:05:21.270> shoots<00:05:21.810> directly<00:05:22.560> in<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:23.340> your

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
directly shoots directly in to your

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.340 
directly shoots directly in to your
system<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.210> into<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.600> muscles<00:05:25.140> that<00:05:25.290> need

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
system and into the muscles that need

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.130 
system and into the muscles that need
recovery<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:26.460> it's<00:05:26.610> important<00:05:27.150> so<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:27.930> do

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
recovery and it's important so I do

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.280 
recovery and it's important so I do
suggest<00:05:28.500> this<00:05:29.330> recovery<00:05:30.330> because<00:05:31.140> they're

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
suggest this recovery because they're

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.760 
suggest this recovery because they're
really<00:05:31.560> good<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:33.050> when<00:05:34.050> it<00:05:34.140> comes<00:05:34.350> to<00:05:34.530> real

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
really good and when it comes to real

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.880
