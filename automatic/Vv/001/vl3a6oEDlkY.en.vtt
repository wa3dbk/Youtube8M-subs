00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
know I mean and of course they do today

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.210 
know I mean and of course they do today
but<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.390> as<00:02:14.600> you<00:02:15.350> know<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.860> taking

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
but it's just as you know that taking

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.180 
but it's just as you know that taking
tourists<00:02:16.760> up<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:16.970> down<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.210> river<00:02:17.330> um<00:02:18.190> it's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
tourists up and down the river um it's

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.440 
tourists up and down the river um it's
true<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:19.610> yeah<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.820> think<00:02:19.910> with<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.360> the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
true so yeah I think with that in the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.230 
true so yeah I think with that in the
50s<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.830> know<00:02:21.980> your<00:02:22.220> parents<00:02:22.760> might<00:02:23.120> have

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
50s you know your parents might have

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.660 
50s you know your parents might have
remembered<00:02:23.360> Main<00:02:23.780> Street<00:02:24.080> but<00:02:24.320> their<00:02:25.040> parents

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
remembered Main Street but their parents

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.820 
remembered Main Street but their parents
probably<00:02:26.390> remembered<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.200> frontier<00:02:27.650> because

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
probably remembered the frontier because

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.830 
probably remembered the frontier because
if<00:02:28.820> your<00:02:28.940> parents<00:02:29.300> were<00:02:29.360> let's<00:02:29.540> say<00:02:29.600> in<00:02:29.750> their

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
if your parents were let's say in their

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.410 
if your parents were let's say in their
40s<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.500> means<00:02:30.680> they<00:02:30.830> were<00:02:30.920> bit<00:02:31.160> there<00:02:31.700> they

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
40s that means they were bit there they

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.180 
40s that means they were bit there they
were<00:02:32.540> born<00:02:32.780> in<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.990> teens<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.800> means<00:02:34.010> their

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
were born in the teens that means their

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.600 
were born in the teens that means their
parents<00:02:34.670> were<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:35.840> know<00:02:35.990> likely<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.830> late

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
parents were you know likely in the late

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.120 
parents were you know likely in the late
1800s<00:02:38.270> were<00:02:38.450> kids<00:02:38.630> in<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.780> late<00:02:38.900> 1800s<00:02:39.560> and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
1800s were kids in the late 1800s and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.980 
1800s were kids in the late 1800s and
conceivably<00:02:40.580> that<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.030> know<00:02:41.150> that's<00:02:41.630> before

your extended family people could have

entirely impossible and and now I mean
you<00:02:53.630> know<00:02:53.750> face<00:02:53.960> it<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.380> they're<00:02:54.560> kind<00:02:54.860> of

you know face it that they're kind of

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.720 
you know face it that they're kind of
these<00:02:56.960> exercises<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.950> nostalgia<00:02:58.520> that

these exercises and nostalgia that

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.310 
these exercises and nostalgia that

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
doesn't resonate with people coming
