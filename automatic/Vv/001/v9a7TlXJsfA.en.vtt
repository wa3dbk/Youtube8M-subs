00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.609 
the Morse taper or the Jacobs taper will
simply<00:02:00.170> slide<00:02:00.410> in<00:02:00.530> right<00:02:00.680> inside<00:02:00.979> here<00:02:02.619> using

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
simply slide in right inside here using

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.219 
simply slide in right inside here using
the<00:02:03.680> calpro<00:02:04.009> again<00:02:04.899> you<00:02:05.899> look<00:02:06.020> at<00:02:06.110> that

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
the calpro again you look at that

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.749 
the calpro again you look at that
dimension<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:08.950> now<00:02:09.950> you'll<00:02:10.160> see<00:02:10.190> on<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.489> PDF

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
dimension so now you'll see on the PDF

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.930 
dimension so now you'll see on the PDF
began<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.150> see<00:02:11.330> dimension<00:02:12.220> which<00:02:13.220> I'm<00:02:13.370> width

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940

of<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.120> quill<00:02:14.769> right<00:02:15.769> here<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.640> isn't<00:02:16.820> funny

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
of the quill right here this isn't funny

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.780 
of the quill right here this isn't funny
because<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:17.810> gauges<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.800> depth<00:02:19.070> that<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.990 
purposes but if your drill press happens
to<00:02:38.209> have<00:02:38.330> one<00:02:38.390> just<00:02:38.630> simply<00:02:38.870> loosen<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.320> a

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
to have one just simply loosen it a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.910 
to have one just simply loosen it a
little<00:02:41.000> bit<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.540> clamp<00:02:42.320> want<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.620> hear<00:02:42.829> at

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
little bit and clamp want to hear at

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.280 
little bit and clamp want to hear at
some<00:02:43.070> times<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:43.489> if<00:02:44.239> your<00:02:44.570> total<00:02:44.810> press<00:02:45.049> has<00:02:45.260> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
some times so if your total press has a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.750 
some times so if your total press has a
depth<00:02:45.560> gauge<00:02:45.590> however<00:02:46.130> it's<00:02:46.250> got<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.370> normal

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
depth gauge however it's got a normal

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.310 
depth gauge however it's got a normal
lip<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.090> might<00:02:47.269> be<00:02:47.390> able<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.570> slide<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:48.019> up<00:02:48.110> and

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
lip you might be able to slide it up and

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.990 
lip you might be able to slide it up and
still<00:02:48.650> be<00:02:48.739> able<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:48.950> clamp<00:02:49.130> on<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.519> with<00:02:49.790> a

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
still be able to clamp on to with a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.069 
still be able to clamp on to with a
simple<00:02:50.720> head

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
simple head

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.619 
simple head
the<00:02:53.079> D<00:02:54.069> dimension<00:02:54.640> which<00:02:55.180> you'll<00:02:55.329> see<00:02:55.359> on<00:02:55.569> the

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
the D dimension which you'll see on the

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.649 
the D dimension which you'll see on the
PDF<00:02:55.900> for<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.920> Morse<00:02:57.670> taper<00:02:57.849> represents<00:02:58.569> the

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
PDF for the Morse taper represents the

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.949 
PDF for the Morse taper represents the
deaths<00:02:58.870> here<00:02:59.200> which<00:02:59.799> will<00:03:00.069> simply<00:03:00.489> gauge<00:03:00.959> like

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
deaths here which will simply gauge like

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.410 
deaths here which will simply gauge like
so<00:03:02.170> if<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.159> have<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> jacobs<00:03:03.730> taper<00:03:03.909> it<00:03:04.120> just

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
so if you have a jacobs taper it just

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.059 
so if you have a jacobs taper it just
measures<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.780> depth<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.379> Jacob's<00:03:05.890> paper

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
measures the depth of that Jacob's paper

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.449 
measures the depth of that Jacob's paper
which<00:03:06.670> you'll<00:03:06.819> see<00:03:06.849> here<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.840> drawing

under D the eat dimension here is the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.039

Morse taper opening which is are very

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.839 
Morse taper opening which is are very
important<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.859> mention<00:03:15.010> you'll<00:03:15.340> also<00:03:15.489> see<00:03:15.819> a

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
dimensions for Morse tapers so simply

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:37.949 
dimensions for Morse tapers so simply
does<00:03:21.909> use<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.060> caliper<00:03:23.489> underneath<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:37.000> that

does use a caliper underneath and that

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.250 
does use a caliper underneath and that
is<00:03:38.379> how<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.680> dimension<00:03:39.959> your<00:03:40.959> drill<00:03:41.230> press
