00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
like it's literally called favela so so

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.350

it's kind of cool like it's like they
kind<00:01:44.539> of<00:01:44.600> copy<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:44.990> paste<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.350> map<00:01:45.500> into<00:01:46.069> the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
kind of copy and paste the map into the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.710 
kind of copy and paste the map into the
game<00:01:46.310> updated<00:01:46.819> a<00:01:46.850> little<00:01:47.030> bit<00:01:47.149> but<00:01:47.479> kind<00:01:47.660> of

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
game updated a little bit but kind of

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.419 
game updated a little bit but kind of
kept<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.170> feel<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.590> same<00:01:48.800> which<00:01:49.069> is<00:01:49.190> really

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
kept the feel the same which is really

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.669 
kept the feel the same which is really
really<00:01:49.550> cool<00:01:49.819> so<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:50.690> know<00:01:50.810> technically<00:01:51.200> it

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
really cool so you know technically it

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.770 
really cool so you know technically it
actually<00:01:52.039> is<00:01:52.160> favela<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.759> few<00:01:53.119> years<00:01:53.360> down<00:01:53.569> the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
actually is favela a few years down the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.350 
actually is favela a few years down the
line<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.679> you<00:01:54.920> know<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.039> like<00:01:55.700> for<00:01:55.819> example<00:01:55.940> the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
line so you know a like for example the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.850 
line so you know a like for example the
construction<00:01:56.630> building<00:01:57.259> it's<00:01:57.440> over<00:01:57.619> on<00:01:57.740> the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
construction building it's over on the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.320 
construction building it's over on the
left<00:01:58.069> long<00:01:58.399> street<00:01:58.789> if<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:58.910> guys<00:01:59.090> remember

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
left long street if you guys remember

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.630 
left long street if you guys remember
that<00:01:59.479> that<00:02:00.229> thing<00:02:00.470> is<00:02:00.500> now<00:02:00.740> finished<00:02:01.220> it's<00:02:01.429> no

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
that that thing is now finished it's no

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.130 
that that thing is now finished it's no
longer<00:02:01.970> under<00:02:02.209> construction<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:02.929> there<00:02:03.050> are

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
longer under construction so there are

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.930 
longer under construction so there are
tiny<00:02:03.410> little<00:02:03.619> changes<00:02:04.250> like<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.459> throughout

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
tiny little changes like that throughout

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.699 
tiny little changes like that throughout
the<00:02:05.090> map<00:02:05.240> but<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.020> for<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.200> most<00:02:06.319> part<00:02:06.440> it

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
the map but so for the most part it

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.949 
the map but so for the most part it
still<00:02:06.950> looks<00:02:07.220> feels<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:07.759> plays<00:02:08.000> exactly<00:02:08.630> like

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
still looks feels and plays exactly like

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.719 
still looks feels and plays exactly like
favela<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.410> there<00:02:09.740> are<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:09.890> few<00:02:10.009> other<00:02:10.310> updates

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
favela and there are a few other updates

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.070 
favela and there are a few other updates
like<00:02:10.850> it's<00:02:11.090> kind<00:02:11.240> of<00:02:11.270> World<00:02:11.540> Cup<00:02:11.780> themes

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
like it's kind of World Cup themes

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.449 
like it's kind of World Cup themes
because<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.410> World<00:02:12.590> Cup<00:02:12.800> is<00:02:12.950> coming<00:02:12.980> up<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.430> I

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
because the World Cup is coming up so I

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.860 
because the World Cup is coming up so I
think<00:02:13.550> it's<00:02:13.730> cool<00:02:13.880> how<00:02:13.910> they<00:02:14.090> did<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.360> but

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
think it's cool how they did that but

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.870 
think it's cool how they did that but
say<00:02:15.110> yeah<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:15.350> mean<00:02:15.740> for<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.980> most<00:02:16.099> part<00:02:16.400> it's

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
say yeah I mean for the most part it's

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.300 
say yeah I mean for the most part it's
exactly<00:02:17.569> what<00:02:18.020> we<00:02:18.170> played<00:02:18.500> in<00:02:18.800> modern<00:02:19.160> warfare

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310

2 which is amazing because that's one of

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.180 
2 which is amazing because that's one of
the<00:02:20.840> best<00:02:20.959> cold<00:02:21.200> 3<00:02:21.349> maps<00:02:21.500> out<00:02:21.650> all-time<00:02:22.069> at

anything<00:03:58.650> else<00:03:58.889> like<00:03:59.099> that<00:03:59.129> you've<00:03:59.909> got<00:04:00.060> to

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
anything else like that you've got to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.699

get the care package marker and then I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.809 
get the care package marker and then I
think<00:04:03.269> it's<00:04:03.419> like<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.540> 40%<00:04:04.500> chance<00:04:04.739> that<00:04:05.370> that

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
think it's like a 40% chance that that

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.670 
think it's like a 40% chance that that
you'll<00:04:05.970> get<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.359> Y<00:04:06.540> 8<00:04:06.810> gunship<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.530> this

you'll get the Y 8 gunship and this

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.649 
you'll get the Y 8 gunship and this
thing<00:04:07.919> so<00:04:08.189> hopefully<00:04:09.030> some<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.329> guys<00:04:09.419> get
