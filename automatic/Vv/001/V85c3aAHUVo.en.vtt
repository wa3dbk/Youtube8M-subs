00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
or two sides after I've washed it here

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.630 
or two sides after I've washed it here
and<00:05:34.780> I'm<00:05:35.110> letting<00:05:35.650> it<00:05:35.770> air<00:05:35.950> dry<00:05:36.130> something<00:05:36.490> I

and I'm letting it air dry something I

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.550 
and I'm letting it air dry something I
run<00:05:37.000> my<00:05:37.180> fingers<00:05:37.570> to<00:05:37.600> it<00:05:37.900> i<00:05:38.050> would<00:05:38.200> get<00:05:38.320> one<00:05:38.470> or

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
run my fingers to it i would get one or

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.130 
run my fingers to it i would get one or
two<00:05:38.590> showers<00:05:38.890> coming<00:05:39.190> up<00:05:39.370> but<00:05:39.490> no<00:05:40.860> nothing

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
two showers coming up but no nothing

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:50.180 
two showers coming up but no nothing
nothing

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.330 

nothing<00:05:51.030> so<00:05:52.020> the<00:05:52.380> hair<00:05:52.530> doesn't<00:05:52.860> really<00:05:53.010> shed

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
nothing so the hair doesn't really shed

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.780 
nothing so the hair doesn't really shed
I<00:05:54.320> guess<00:05:55.320> minimal<00:05:55.890> shutting<00:05:56.250> is<00:05:56.400> one<00:05:56.550> or<00:05:56.670> two

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
I guess minimal shutting is one or two

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.360 
I guess minimal shutting is one or two
shots<00:05:57.060> and<00:05:57.420> if<00:05:57.690> thats<00:05:57.930> minimal<00:05:58.500> yes<00:05:59.160> that's

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
shots and if thats minimal yes that's

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.140 
shots and if thats minimal yes that's
what<00:05:59.610> I<00:05:59.640> get<00:05:59.990> after<00:06:00.990> I<00:06:01.050> cool<00:06:01.350> wash<00:06:01.530> in<00:06:01.710> here

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
what I get after I cool wash in here

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.480 
what I get after I cool wash in here
that's<00:06:03.150> what<00:06:03.360> I<00:06:03.390> get<00:06:03.540> minimal<00:06:03.990> shedding<00:06:04.490> but

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
that's what I get minimal shedding but

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.840 
that's what I get minimal shedding but
other<00:06:05.640> than<00:06:05.850> that<00:06:07.400> they<00:06:08.400> come<00:06:08.580> in<00:06:08.700> low<00:06:10.220> um<00:06:11.220> so

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
other than that they come in low um so

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.030
