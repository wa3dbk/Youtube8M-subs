00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 what are you ready to do 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.440
 okay I think we have them in the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.280
 common sense that's what is madness 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.769
 and yes I have them in the good sense louf y 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.509
 have believed reka tech we know it has been 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.020
 sent in loser bracket precisely by 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.810
 kusanagi which is a set and will have to 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.539
 face a second in 2 sets that makes 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.160
 a second set in two sets 2-6 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.279
 I do not understand anything of what I say 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.380
 but it's crazy louf and who will have to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.660
 hold on and rekha tech really needs to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.360
 tight his red out of the movie would be a 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.550
 real performance for him him 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.680
 perhaps offering room for the top 8 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.059
 of the tournament a very nice 10 to 30 dance 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.530
 to relocate this shop where figure 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.149
 still late energy me that has 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.739
 the habit anyway to start 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.420
 generally late saw you a 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.230
 slip to 10 years passes the age bac who 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.789
 is there to prevent it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.280
 it's a close-up let go of it by digging 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.260
 it 's not big points often when 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.879
 even fights big tip via harm to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.649
 use it as they call 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.799
 to finally apply not spiral way and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.270
 going back to the yard and his had 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.740
 created caquineau teleport not finally 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.720
 it is pink to stand up quietly 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.729
 this is a good distance he will not 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.380
 most corner we finally he goes 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.340
 just make spiral the medium style that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.299
 touched a myth and attention to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.760
 dragons picked it up and ended it's 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.950
 a death here 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.260
 these rhine is very hard to put 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.090
 the bunny behind the loris 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.610
 covers in twenty-one frames and louf and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.250
 who serves the fist 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 the motivation is more respect me I 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.320
 you say they are too high damage 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.000
 that was fine i 'm going to attempt 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.370
 the former course is received through the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.140
 soul spiral soul park pardon on 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.400
 was still too far away 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.170
 shop with a good focus not 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.460
 no no you are serious the start up of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.600
 the vacuum that escaped and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.130
 the office of content one beats means 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.050
 spiral it's better they're not way to 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.370
 the strain not like this fight by train 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.510
 to take everything he is not alone but 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.950
 the difficulty category of the blow 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.880
 europe but lots of great 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.390
 then follow pushed far enough to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.270
 hundred 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.830
 he's never the one of anything at all and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.660
 we daughter who is in the process of re string 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.619
 that they are adversaries with a 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.619
 disconcerting ease 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.070
 for the moment the cat that in difficulty 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.959
 will come well the crotone phase this 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.790
 said it must be said more with an average wind 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.930
 paid by captains big points even 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.600
 if we look for the max damage 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.300
 there is too much opportunity to go out to 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.790
 distance lighthouse that is the distance claude 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.200
 cros learns very well that's not leaving the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.180
 power in middle by the yard at two 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.950
 under but no it's not a tele ports 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.050
 sas is a dragon gate and mistakes 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.540
 execution that may be expensive to pay 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.590
 by ray case here in full tournament because 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.330
 that you absolutely must not miss this kind 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.980
 of things there it is now you very 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.120
 mortara light energy the Malagasy 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.650
 beats a quick enough deloupy the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.250
 loosen the attention to the ultra-bottom this 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.660
 that lucian 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.340
 he's waiting for that an opportunity from the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.209
 place on a flight attempt job or 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.470
 something like that even if you 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.510
 were doing very aggressive and that is done 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.100
 suck his tray dash y'a that it will be done 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.269
 too much not even used can not 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.500
 anyway in this situation in 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.910
 What is this time I could be 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.610
 remember again the kata who 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.470
 are looking for normal pressings a 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.390
 little strange and we fix a good 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.670
 guard for the moment even though he waits 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.290
 just the opportunity to make a come 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.920
 back room and can not scratch anymore 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.110
 it's over 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.610
 the sonic boom have solved well played a 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.750
 little challans to find the 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.070
 distance 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.280
 big point and the finish of all of this 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:25.170
 park that is the 1 0 the leaking stream 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.340
 of a desolate so it is not fast 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.390
 is that you are at free it's 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.660
 horrible weekend 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.830
 kroll at the double shop eide tried to 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.870
 put a third still eh 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.250
 it's telling you the word as initiator 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.900
 it's called the movie anyway 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.330
 true a lot of users 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.590
 it's played well this tactic with 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.920
 the ipod ball that finds the opening of 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.630
 keep 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.190
 you must have read your first and last name 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.900
 passed by I cut you will have to fast 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.920
 its just limits with standards to 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.060
 wolves final just to put the war 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.380
 shopping business to get out of the corner 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.730
 he was going perfectly out or what 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.410
 but here unfortunately lost 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.530
 his aerial combat 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.370
 while he was in anticipation of 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.239
 sailing jump up and he was rather on the 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.860
 good trajectory 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.810
 this morning dad had to take back dragon 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.890
 he no gold sheet to grab and to dragon 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.870
 there is no rigor you never know them 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.190
 two can be chained and it's either 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.810
 Either you choose jack and 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.480
 fun and lost three quarters of the time 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.220
 uncertain August 5 without listening to himself 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.750
 do not feel like saying it festive listening 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.359
 new technologies they are there 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.810
 screaming at the stride it hurts that to 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.190
 listen to the nudges 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.860
 the technologies of elbowing 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.940
 this is old-fashioned of course 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.800
 did not exist before 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.540
 it was invented by golf players 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.430
 quite simple eric obviously attack who 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.020
 is waiting for me completely stone mental after 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.400
 taken that phase there they try to 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.100
 waele jump the valley is annexed by his 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.020
 match but it's now a 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.640
 perspective quite difficult for him 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.050
 was no way with these spirals with 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.180
 the water they loved sauvy chop chop 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.780
 the epareca tech fighters have very very 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.330
 heavy difficulties in this match and a 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.120
 little blue key found by the ofii is 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.650
 the victory of the latter quietly 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.760
 sincerely at sight as soon as he took 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.940
 the psychological ascendancy on his 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.950
 opponent immediately he continued to 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.950
 attack and slam
