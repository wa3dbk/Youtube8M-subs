00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
look so much better like the enhancer

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.420 
look so much better like the enhancer
rings<00:03:39.720> like<00:03:40.019> beyond<00:03:40.680> realistic<00:03:41.160> it's<00:03:41.310> like

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
rings like beyond realistic it's like

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.830 
rings like beyond realistic it's like
wow<00:03:41.579> this<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.910> what<00:03:42.060> rain<00:03:42.299> would<00:03:42.480> really<00:03:42.720> look

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
wow this is what rain would really look

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.900 
wow this is what rain would really look
like<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.650> Hanse<00:03:43.829> rain<00:03:44.040> off<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.730> can

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
like but the Hanse rain off you can

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.190 
like but the Hanse rain off you can
definitely<00:03:45.299> get<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.420> better<00:03:45.630> look<00:03:45.750> at<00:03:46.049> what

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
definitely get a better look at what

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.319 
definitely get a better look at what
like<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.470> city<00:03:46.709> is<00:03:46.890> when<00:03:47.100> you're<00:03:47.190> riding<00:03:47.430> but

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
like the city is when you're riding but

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.650 
like the city is when you're riding but
just<00:03:48.750> like<00:03:48.900> I'm<00:03:49.709> going<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.860> keep<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.070> on

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
just like I'm going to keep it on

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.660 
just like I'm going to keep it on
I<00:03:50.750> feel<00:03:51.650> like<00:03:51.710> but<00:03:51.830> once<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.070> really<00:03:52.340> get<00:03:52.460> into

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
I feel like but once I really get into

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.580 
I feel like but once I really get into
the<00:03:52.760> game<00:03:52.940> but<00:03:53.000> probably<00:03:53.390> turn<00:03:53.570> it<00:03:53.660> off<00:03:53.840> but<00:03:54.560> I

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
the game but probably turn it off but I

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.500 
the game but probably turn it off but I
feel<00:03:55.160> like<00:03:55.280> when<00:03:55.700> I'm<00:03:55.820> playing<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.150> game<00:03:56.330> it's

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
feel like when I'm playing the game it's

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.640 
feel like when I'm playing the game it's
not<00:03:56.630> really<00:03:56.840> going<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.020> matter<00:03:57.170> like<00:03:57.440> I'm<00:03:57.530> not

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
not really going to matter like I'm not

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.350 
not really going to matter like I'm not
gonna<00:03:57.800> really<00:03:58.010> notice<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.640> rain<00:03:58.820> Olander<00:03:59.210> all

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
gonna really notice the rain Olander all

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.240 
gonna really notice the rain Olander all
so<00:03:59.660> I<00:03:59.690> guess<00:03:59.840> it<00:03:59.990> really<00:04:00.050> doesn't<00:04:00.230> matter<00:04:00.500> but

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
so I guess it really doesn't matter but

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.650 
so I guess it really doesn't matter but
that's<00:04:01.490> everything<00:04:01.820> we<00:04:01.850> got<00:04:02.060> with<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:02.360> nevada
