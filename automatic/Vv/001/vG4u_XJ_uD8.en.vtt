00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
pool pump sand filter and we got a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:13.150 
pool pump sand filter and we got a
hayward<00:01:07.210> each<00:01:08.210> 100<00:01:10.150> it's<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.270> nice<00:01:11.450> heater<00:01:12.160> it's

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
hayward each 100 it's a nice heater it's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.460 
hayward each 100 it's a nice heater it's
supposedly<00:01:14.000> for<00:01:14.450> above<00:01:14.840> ground<00:01:14.870> pools

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
supposedly for above ground pools

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.760 
supposedly for above ground pools
there's<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.340> inlet<00:01:16.930> rate<00:01:17.930> one<00:01:18.170> side<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:18.680> then

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
there's the inlet rate one side and then

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.190 
there's the inlet rate one side and then
outlet<00:01:19.190> out<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.460> other<00:01:19.580> side<00:01:20.050> but<00:01:21.050> it's

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
outlet out the other side but it's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.040 
outlet out the other side but it's
working<00:01:21.470> great<00:01:21.620> for<00:01:22.070> heating<00:01:23.060> our<00:01:23.240> in-ground

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
working great for heating our in-ground

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.620

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
live somewhere colder or at higher

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.080 
live somewhere colder or at higher
elevation<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.400> might<00:01:46.520> want<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.700> get<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> bigger

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
elevation you might want to get a bigger

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.899 
elevation you might want to get a bigger
heater<00:01:47.360> it's<00:01:47.540> 100,000<00:01:48.200> BTU<00:01:48.520> our<00:01:49.520> old<00:01:49.700> heater

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
heater it's 100,000 BTU our old heater

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.149 
heater it's 100,000 BTU our old heater
was<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.180> hundred<00:01:51.049> seventy<00:01:51.350> five<00:01:51.470> thousand<00:01:52.270> Lars

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
was a hundred seventy five thousand Lars

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.270 
was a hundred seventy five thousand Lars
heater<00:01:55.159> natural<00:01:55.880> gas<00:01:56.140> but<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.290> just<00:01:57.500> cracked

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
heater natural gas but it just cracked

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.130 
heater natural gas but it just cracked
up<00:01:58.490> internally<00:01:59.360> so<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.630> wasn't<00:02:00.080> worth

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
up internally so it wasn't worth

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.050 
up internally so it wasn't worth
repairing

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
repairing

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.700 
repairing
anyways<00:02:02.060> keeping<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.450> pool<00:02:02.630> warm<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.350> just

anyways keeping a pool warm I just

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.789 
anyways keeping a pool warm I just
turned<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:03.920> on<00:02:04.010> now<00:02:04.220> house<00:02:05.150> will<00:02:05.540> be<00:02:05.690> hot<00:02:06.590> by

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799

tomorrow

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.770 
tomorrow
so<00:02:07.520> usually<00:02:07.760> after<00:02:07.850> one<00:02:08.149> day<00:02:08.330> it'll<00:02:08.509> raise

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
so usually after one day it'll raise

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.710 
so usually after one day it'll raise
about<00:02:08.959> five<00:02:09.170> degrees<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:10.000> then<00:02:11.000> you're<00:02:11.569> ready

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
about five degrees and then you're ready

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.250 
about five degrees and then you're ready
