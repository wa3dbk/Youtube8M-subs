this<00:02:11.370> was<00:02:11.550> from<00:02:11.730> head<00:02:12.000> office<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.450> assume<00:02:12.780> that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
this was from head office I assume that

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.050 
this was from head office I assume that
the<00:02:13.620> problem<00:02:13.980> with<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.130> original<00:02:14.670> was<00:02:14.880> that

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the problem with the original was that

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.230 
the problem with the original was that
they<00:02:15.270> last<00:02:15.570> forever<00:02:15.840> which<00:02:16.410> they<00:02:16.740> do<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.250> they

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
they last forever which they do and they

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.540 
they last forever which they do and they
tend<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.630> spoil<00:02:19.620> before<00:02:19.740> you've<00:02:20.130> reached<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
tend to spoil before you've reached the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.610 
tend to spoil before you've reached the
end<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.240> completely<00:02:21.870> understand<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.350> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
end so I completely understand that and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.790 
end so I completely understand that and
I<00:02:22.710> actually<00:02:22.890> believe<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.750> however<00:02:24.800> you're

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
I actually believe that however you're

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.980 
I actually believe that however you're
still<00:02:26.070> getting<00:02:26.190> half<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.700> product<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.720> it

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
still getting half the product so it

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.300 
still getting half the product so it
would<00:02:28.170> be<00:02:28.260> better<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.620> half<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.070> price

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
would be better to half the price

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.800 
would be better to half the price
because<00:02:29.700> it's<00:02:29.820> half<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.090> product<00:02:30.390> or<00:02:30.720> at

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
because it's half the product or at

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.840 
because it's half the product or at
least<00:02:30.990> reduce<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.830> price<00:02:32.100> because<00:02:32.550> it's<00:02:32.700> half

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
least reduce the price because it's half

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.300 
least reduce the price because it's half
the<00:02:33.060> product<00:02:33.270> but<00:02:34.230> I'm<00:02:34.440> just<00:02:34.860> saying<00:02:35.160> I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the product but I'm just saying I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.100 
the product but I'm just saying I
wouldn't<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:36.030> surprised<00:02:36.450> if<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.990> future

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
wouldn't be surprised if in the future

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.750 
wouldn't be surprised if in the future
you<00:02:37.470> find<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> original<00:02:38.340> multiples

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
you find that the original multiples

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.210 
you find that the original multiples
will<00:02:39.150> also<00:02:39.600> shrink<00:02:39.960> in<00:02:40.110> size<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:40.590> well<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:41.040> don't

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
will also shrink in size as well I don't

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.430 
will also shrink in size as well I don't
