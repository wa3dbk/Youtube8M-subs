00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.469 
see how this works I imagine it will
come<00:03:55.669> in<00:03:55.849> either<00:03:56.060> way<00:03:57.400> so<00:03:58.400> we'll<00:03:58.579> try<00:03:58.849> you

00:03:59.469 --> 00:03:59.479 
come in either way so we'll try you

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.250 
come in either way so we'll try you
should<00:03:59.810> try<00:03:59.989> this<00:04:00.049> way<00:04:00.379> first<00:04:01.000> because

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
should try this way first because

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.559 
should try this way first because
there's<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:04.720> circle<00:04:05.720> there<00:04:06.019> at<00:04:06.109> the<00:04:06.229> top<00:04:06.470> and

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
there's this circle there at the top and

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.550 
there's this circle there at the top and
maybe<00:04:09.519> it's<00:04:10.519> not<00:04:10.609> supposed<00:04:10.849> to<00:04:11.060> go<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.359> way

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
maybe it's not supposed to go that way

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.580 
maybe it's not supposed to go that way
it's<00:04:12.560> pretty<00:04:12.620> tight<00:04:13.040> for<00:04:13.549> this<00:04:13.699> samsung

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
it's pretty tight for this samsung

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.979 
it's pretty tight for this samsung
galaxy<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:15.799> think<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:16.190> we<00:04:16.310> have<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.519> kind<00:04:16.729> of<00:04:16.989> RAM

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
galaxy I think so we have to kind of RAM

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.839 
galaxy I think so we have to kind of RAM
it<00:04:18.199> in<00:04:18.320> there<00:04:18.530> shove<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.400> in<00:04:19.519> there

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
it in there shove it in there

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.180 
it in there shove it in there
maybe<00:04:20.359> it's<00:04:20.479> new<00:04:20.919> probably<00:04:21.919> should<00:04:22.099> have

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
maybe it's new probably should have

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.180 
maybe it's new probably should have
maybe<00:04:22.310> done<00:04:22.639> that<00:04:23.210> cord<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.870> other<00:04:23.990> way<00:04:24.190> it

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
maybe done that cord the other way it

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.219 
maybe done that cord the other way it
doesn't<00:04:25.520> quite<00:04:25.610> close<00:04:26.000> Oh<00:04:26.360> would<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:26.960> look<00:04:27.110> at

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
doesn't quite close Oh would you look at

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.980 
doesn't quite close Oh would you look at
that<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.090> think<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.389> have<00:04:29.570> it<00:04:29.659> all<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.810> way

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
that and I think I have it all the way

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.070 
that and I think I have it all the way
in<00:04:30.259> there<00:04:30.530> let's<00:04:31.099> go<00:04:31.310> ahead<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.699> do<00:04:31.759> this

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
in there let's go ahead and do this

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.469 
in there let's go ahead and do this
maybe<00:04:33.080> it's<00:04:33.259> my<00:04:33.470> bad<00:04:33.710> maybe<00:04:34.460> maybe<00:04:34.849> that<00:04:34.940> upper

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
maybe it's my bad maybe maybe that upper

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.330 
maybe it's my bad maybe maybe that upper
lip<00:04:35.659> is<00:04:35.870> supposed<00:04:36.169> to<00:04:36.260> be<00:04:36.440> worthy

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
lip is supposed to be worthy

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.140 
lip is supposed to be worthy
housing<00:04:37.910> goes<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:39.020> makes<00:04:39.230> it<00:04:39.470> easier<00:04:39.970> go<00:04:40.970> in

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
housing goes it makes it easier go in

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.700 
housing goes it makes it easier go in
there<00:04:43.150> okay<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:45.050> I'm<00:04:45.110> go<00:04:45.320> ahead<00:04:45.380> and<00:04:45.560> try<00:04:45.680> that

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
there okay so I'm go ahead and try that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.090 
there okay so I'm go ahead and try that
well<00:04:46.430> that<00:04:46.760> does<00:04:47.000> work<00:04:47.240> it<00:04:47.630> locked<00:04:47.950> locked<00:04:48.950> in

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
well that does work it locked locked in

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.250 
well that does work it locked locked in
the<00:04:49.160> right<00:04:49.310> place<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:49.850> I<00:04:50.240> guess<00:04:50.720> that<00:04:50.930> curve

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
the right place so I guess that curve

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.960 
the right place so I guess that curve
that<00:04:51.890> you<00:04:52.040> have<00:04:52.250> there<00:04:52.520> it's<00:04:52.700> really

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
that you have there it's really

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.550 
that you have there it's really
important<00:04:53.480> to<00:04:53.630> this<00:04:53.750> feature<00:04:53.990> of<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.320> phone

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
important to this feature of the phone

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.470 
important to this feature of the phone
so<00:04:55.310> definitely<00:04:55.670> it's<00:04:55.820> kind<00:04:55.940> of<00:04:55.970> going<00:04:56.120> lens

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
so definitely it's kind of going lens

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.390 
so definitely it's kind of going lens
first<00:04:56.900> because<00:04:57.200> more<00:04:57.470> square<00:04:57.800> down<00:04:57.980> here<00:04:58.280> and

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
first because more square down here and

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.090 
first because more square down here and
this<00:04:58.490> is<00:04:58.670> the<00:04:58.760> curve<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.210> it<00:04:59.500> fits<00:05:00.500> perfectly

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
this is the curve and it fits perfectly

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.890 
this is the curve and it fits perfectly
there<00:05:01.340> it's<00:05:01.670> kind<00:05:01.850> of<00:05:01.910> a<00:05:02.090> little<00:05:02.360> bit<00:05:02.540> exposed

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
there it's kind of a little bit exposed

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.700 
there it's kind of a little bit exposed
but<00:05:03.260> you<00:05:03.800> know<00:05:03.890> if<00:05:03.950> you<00:05:04.010> drop<00:05:04.220> it<00:05:04.280> or<00:05:04.550> something

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
but you know if you drop it or something

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.420 
but you know if you drop it or something
gives<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.830> few<00:05:07.040> hits

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.710 

it's<00:05:10.430> gonna<00:05:10.580> it's<00:05:10.910> gonna<00:05:11.000> definitely<00:05:11.300> take<00:05:11.660> a

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
it's gonna it's gonna definitely take a

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.840 
it's gonna it's gonna definitely take a
few<00:05:11.990> drops<00:05:12.200> for<00:05:12.590> you<00:05:12.770> it's<00:05:13.250> got<00:05:13.400> these<00:05:13.550> raised

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
few drops for you it's got these raised

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.100 
few drops for you it's got these raised
edges<00:05:14.240> on<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.960> corners<00:05:15.790> and<00:05:16.790> so<00:05:17.120> with<00:05:17.870> those

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
edges on the corners and so with those

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.260 
edges on the corners and so with those
corners<00:05:19.070> it's<00:05:19.340> definitely<00:05:19.730> going<00:05:19.880> to<00:05:19.940> survive

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
corners it's definitely going to survive

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.110 
corners it's definitely going to survive
a<00:05:20.330> few<00:05:20.690> drops<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.170> hits<00:05:21.550> not<00:05:22.550> like<00:05:22.940> you'd<00:05:23.090> want

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
a few drops and hits not like you'd want

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.880 
a few drops and hits not like you'd want
to<00:05:23.360> throw<00:05:23.570> it<00:05:23.690> down<00:05:23.870> but<00:05:24.170> I<00:05:24.200> like<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.530> idea

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
to throw it down but I like the idea

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.100 
to throw it down but I like the idea
that<00:05:24.950> there's<00:05:25.280> these<00:05:25.430> raised<00:05:25.760> corners<00:05:26.300> on<00:05:26.720> the

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
that there's these raised corners on the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.960 
that there's these raised corners on the
edges<00:05:27.530> so<00:05:27.560> that<00:05:27.950> when<00:05:28.040> it<00:05:28.160> does<00:05:28.190> draw<00:05:28.640> those

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
edges so that when it does draw those

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.540 
edges so that when it does draw those
corners<00:05:29.420> are<00:05:29.570> gonna<00:05:29.660> take<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.170> the<00:05:30.980> brunt<00:05:31.340> of

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
corners are gonna take the the brunt of

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.030 
corners are gonna take the the brunt of
the<00:05:31.700> fall<00:05:32.000> I<00:05:32.360> like<00:05:33.020> to<00:05:33.200> see<00:05:33.380> if<00:05:33.470> I<00:05:33.560> can<00:05:33.740> destroy

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
the fall I like to see if I can destroy

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.030 
the fall I like to see if I can destroy
things<00:05:34.280> sometimes<00:05:35.020> this<00:05:36.020> is<00:05:36.200> what<00:05:36.350> we<00:05:36.440> do<00:05:36.620> we

things sometimes this is what we do we

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.070 
things sometimes this is what we do we
have<00:05:37.130> this<00:05:37.250> wire<00:05:37.490> review<00:05:37.790> products<00:05:38.120> so<00:05:38.750> be

sure to check it out it's the samsung
galaxy<00:05:41.140> pouch<00:05:42.140> and<00:05:42.560> it's<00:05:42.800> probably<00:05:43.190> look<00:05:43.340> good

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
galaxy pouch and it's probably look good

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.960 
galaxy pouch and it's probably look good
if<00:05:43.700> you<00:05:43.820> have<00:05:44.000> a<00:05:44.030> white<00:05:44.270> one<00:05:44.450> or<00:05:45.050> a<00:05:45.730> black<00:05:46.730> one

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
if you have a white one or a black one

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.030 
if you have a white one or a black one
definitely<00:05:47.810> does<00:05:47.930> it<00:05:48.020> complement<00:05:48.410> recolor<00:05:48.860> to

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
definitely does it complement recolor to

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.100 
definitely does it complement recolor to
go<00:05:49.160> with<00:05:49.340> it<00:05:49.550> settle<00:05:50.210> you<00:05:50.330> tight<00:05:50.540> fit<00:05:50.810> so<00:05:50.840> it's

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
go with it settle you tight fit so it's

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.360 
go with it settle you tight fit so it's
not<00:05:51.230> gonna<00:05:51.350> be<00:05:51.440> shaking<00:05:51.740> around<00:05:51.980> getting

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
not gonna be shaking around getting
