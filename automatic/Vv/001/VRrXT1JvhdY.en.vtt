00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.509
 Hello everyone and today we will analyze you 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.820
 one more song the gas sector is called by 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.500
 PTS 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.559
 the song of course is better 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.100
 disassemble it would be under the minus but minus 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.400
 youtube forbids 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.859
 so we will disassemble it so a minus 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.609
 later you will find it yourself or you will 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:32.130
 play under the original song the song is very 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.969
 simple out just three chords and like 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.969
 she is like this 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440
 but 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.550
 that's all and the whole song is like this 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.480
 whole rhythm guitar part 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.200
 well now most rhythm slowly I don't know 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:14.200
 how it will turn out but we look how it will turn out 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.390
 I specifically hold this mediator 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.870
 clumsy so you can see how he 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.870
 moves 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.290
 uncomfortable so media ottoman keep 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 play 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.790
 but 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.120
 fly 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.120
 not 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:12.030
 that's all nothing is not complicated yet 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.030
 for once 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.700
 well that's the whole song good luck for now 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.610
 find yourself a backing track or play by 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.319
 gift of the original song throwing it in the guitar 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.549
 rig top deck 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.549
 as a drum loop anyway and all 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.549
 until
