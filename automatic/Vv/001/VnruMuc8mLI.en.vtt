00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.130
 epistolary narrative 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.680
 following the summit of the land of suippes

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540
 it's victory 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.530
 it's almost done 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.870
 I am someone who is good 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.870
 yes the drifts that it is already posed 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.930
 what it meant for my screen 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930
 for a stroller 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.559
 and also to others find themselves to be convinced 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:14.779
 we started by studying on the tracks 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.779
 so we had an agreement since August 3rd 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.909
 656 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.999
 like this 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.719
 by then the criteria to allow for illegal contact spice 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.859

 so all his duties as director 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.239
 the current was no longer 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.089

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.089
 it is necessary to position later patrice carteron 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.469
 phm 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.929
 in which she asks for a track 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.929
 it's a little more delicate 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:05.459
 if you have a party 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.079

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.829
 torches 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.829
 it's a track 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.119
 after many 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.119
 friends from the issuing institute 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.459
 that's what I hope I will send great nancy time I know 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.989
 very stressful collectors and pimples 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.989
 which would tend to this current 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:51.219
 nine people six months 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.809
 I do not know anymore patriquin 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.089

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:00.209
 all places are limited pistons this leaflet 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.479
 we are all tastes 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.819

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.830
 a detector to allow all the substantive marrow 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.869
 What are we doing for a dog show? 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.949
 because we will have more 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.550
 the system works very well 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.069
 is very soon in a next life
