00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 so the person is arranged that taking 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.720
 some solution we especially giving n-th 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.040
 the amount for this decision we are constantly looking for 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.970
 excuse for this decision especially this 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.610
 concerns cars 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.150
 After all, the Caliphs cherish the dream I will give for this 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.030
 a dream 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.600
 n-th large amount of money, we again 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.240
 deep down sometimes we begin to doubt 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.119
 But did we make the right decision? 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.599
 we bought a car because this is not for us 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.789
 like it could be better and everything 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.980
 the above fully applies to 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.530
 cars for example type lexus rx 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.290
 which on the streets of our city to shoot 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.980
 men and yet the automotive world is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.230
 cars 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.149
 much more interesting than the same 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.090
 most lexus rx and interesting and not 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.870
 only in terms of ride quality but even 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.680
 externally and one of these cars 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.070
 today we have a test drive 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.070
 this infinite fx series 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.699
 however with this car we 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.559
 We are not meeting for the first time at the end of winter. 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.750
 put on it hooligan pokatushki on 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.820
 the remains of thin ice from one of the reservoirs 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.680
 Novosibirsk and our enthusiasm was not 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.750
 the limit is clear that we could not wait 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.210
 find out how this car drives 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.750
 yourself on asphalt but you need some more 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.000
 to suffer 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.530
 because according to the laws of the genre is necessary 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.479
 talk first about design 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.100
 there is a big suspicion that when 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.440
 designers painted the look of it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.000
 car then they took a lot of risk before 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.750
 they certainly had a task to do 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.350
 its unusual and they got it 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.200
 frankly healthy car strongly 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.360
 stands out from the competition and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.860
 stands out very much even for the better 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.960
 zosima ranting end and 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.819
 getting down to the most important thing for what 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.280
 we actually brought this device to 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.490
 potentially cramped for him but 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.929
 for starters about the potential here under 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.429
 hood true we won't you 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.350
 show because you are very dirty 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.710
 engine is hidden using liter 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 volume of 284 horsepower would not 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.940
 favorable tax because the amount 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.399
 it turns out decent however this 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.810
 modaram enough to overclock 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.750
 it's quite a heavy carcass to such 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.220
 acceptable dynamic quantities but other than 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.440
 vigorous motor here is very 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.120
 remarkable powertrain constant 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.830
 rear-wheel drive with front end 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.870
 via electronic manifest coupling 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.950
 This transmission first appeared in 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.690
 back in 1989 on gta4 skyline 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.129
 and it works in contrast to the front 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.870
 clutch actuator 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.870
 the rear is much more interesting 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.020
 but how helpfully the machine takes me to 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.200
 your hugs 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.920
 interior really our very sadko 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:54.000
 builds looks but he is not strict 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.740
 fanciful and you can even say nice but 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.790
 not for this they took this very abundantly 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:06.000
 test drive because there is hidden almost 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.970
 highway from the skyline so vigorous razgonechik 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.520
 even despite three and a half and 200 8 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.100
 4 forces 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.070
 apparently stabilization system need 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.550
 immediately turned off to become so well 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.230
 playfully interferes with the management process 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.130
 but it is mixed enough 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.130
 softly 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.670
 and for an inexperienced driver rather plus 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.550
 than a minus but is it worth the unsophisticated 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.560
 driver buy this car 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.560
 inexperienced should think lexus rx 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.280
 Now we will turn off the system, I stand linux and 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.040
 I hope that further due 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.040
 much interest 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.850
 You are of course an extremely unusual feeling 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.130
 when such a healthy huge heavy 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.200
 high sitting car is so but 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.940
 Nick on a passenger of course but extremely 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.310
 gambling great passes as it turned out 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.320
 as well as expected infiniti fx on 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.210
 Asphalt is not less passionate than on ice 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.490
 instant response to steering 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.350
 at first they even scare very quickly 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.630
 come to life and begin to savor 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.220
 every turn 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.310
 very interesting exit behavior 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.080
 garage like rear-wheel drive us 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.330
 sends by the nose but connects 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.700
 gear and since the warrior all 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.800
 pulled out hands like all-wheel drive 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.039
 skyline 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.710
 corrected course on the weight of the 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.659
 the center of gravity is high though and mass 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.610
 high center of gravity in this case 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.319
 work in plus for the reason that 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.710
 experienced you are not necessarily experienced 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.599
 driver 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.889
 it feels extremely positive 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.349
 affects active safety 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.449
 after all get carried away gambling at taxiing 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:53.699
 go too far and be on the ears of such 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.740
 car is pretty simple if of course 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.780
 head not include yes and minor flaws in 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.699
 handling here for example 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.949
 the car is not very reluctant to extinguish the demolition 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.449
 front axle when gas discharge is interesting 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.099
 what's moving box which 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.629
 quite easy to predict 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.940
 practically does not affect 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.569
 stability car behavior in 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.530
 turnaround 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.860
 here matches passed the garage at the exit of 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.389
 him 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.800
 I switched 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:21.320
 something continues to creak with us 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.720
 stabilization system not fully answer 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.410
 so the box under the garages switched 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.680
 and somehow it didn't really affect 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.530
 the nature of the car's behavior is also 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.610
 big plus well of course you need everything 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.919
 pay and pay for this here that's almost 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.700
 passenger and gambling controllability here 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.740
 enough such an unpleasant smoothness 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.930
 of the course because but all the bumps are going 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.720
 and fossa they are surely extinguished 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.140
 high strength tires and suspension but 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.150
 I'd like to be softer in this 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.830
 class full-size crossovers are not so 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.020
 too many cars that are sharpened 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.360
 under the pleasure of driving but he 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.700
 only bmw x5 comes but we take 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.080
 argue that infiniti fx is more interesting 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:11.419
 I think that fx is more interesting 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.880
 its year is not the perfect accuracy of it 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:19.570
 people minor flaws manageability 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:22.870
 I had not actually Zelenka such 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.420
 make shed on the car while doing so 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.470
 perceived not as a gloomy product 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.690
 technocratic genius who knows 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:33.480
 better how he needs to go as well as his 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:36.580
 kind of a living organism like winter date does not 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.170
 disappointed rides onwardly cool 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.290
 lets enjoy the process 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.880
 controls with those undeniable 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.470
 virtues that we should have 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.270
 car high ground clearance 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.460
 four-wheel drive are present here 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.550
 fully and probably the only one 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.700
 some such significant or noticeable 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.850
 his lack of it is smoothness 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.450
 but it is an absolute payment for such 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.250
 gambling 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.250
 and fun handling
