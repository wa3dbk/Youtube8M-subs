00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello everyone welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.759
 my name is Sasha today with minifigur 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.890
 just horses 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.150
 we start with this black schottky 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.240
 if you like minifigures or 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 the horse is most likely you or did 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.690
 starting from black because I don't know 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 start to know so where are you who are me 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.359
 I will like you and probably finish 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.090
 embroidered which is me the most 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.789
 like that very much wanted well and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.529
 ideals still made up the size 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.539
 sites are very space creativity 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.849
 their parts first the torso with hoofs 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.800
 and the tail and the second part is the head and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.440
 the ears are all kind of solid 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.329
 ears made here and so there is also a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.000
 the disadvantage is this right here 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.140
 little white too poor there square 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.910
 for sticking head 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.520
 such a self on the head but it is not visible 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 and it turns out although there is no visible and so 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.969
 It turns out that she is a little bit 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.890
 but you know I think it should be completely 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.079
 perimeter stick it up he will answer 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.719
 sticks out if completely sticking out like 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.789
 stick a piece of dripped such a speck 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.820
 small and stuck her head so up 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.440
 little white there know how not to report also 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 if you're interested and I'm not the hoof 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.979
 cut but i thought so i was 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.650
 figurines recognize them which I cut 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.140
 kapitan decided not to untie so guys i 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.060
 agreed with the first over black we 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 let's build here 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.540
 follow the horse I like 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.549
 much more brown we have exactly 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.590
 only brown but it seems to me 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.960
 Look nice though I know what 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.520
 here here are drying problems well and so in 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.650
 whole marks I really like her 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.020
 polish well somehow it really is she 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.140
 just sympathetic to him so simpotnaya us 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.000
 your daughter number 2 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.100
 our next horse is super long 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.560
 squeeze i think you saw such a size 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 windows drink this pretrovki feeling quite 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.420
 I came out badly, I do not know Che's 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 Especially the head here see how here 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.140
 badly accustomed to a bad head 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.750
 her mesh was probably therefore very 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.210
 inconvenient to stick these very ears and yes 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.040
 so it came out so here ugly just so 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.189
 also the head is white and so look 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.290
 what a long what tail rancid from 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.390
 something like a dachshund or a sausage 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.969
 you know what is that by the way 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.329
 speaking better looks like this 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.369
 us horse number 3 4 joke it here 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.660
 so green I do not remember puma 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.340
 horse zombie shift 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.520
 just honestly i don’t ask much 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.050
 Sasha told me she came out that's how much 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.240
 she came out long well here 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.280
 just look how we let it go 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.410
 this gas came out even the most it came out 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.210
 that is, it went very well but I have 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.420
 the matter is already after these you are scarborough she 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.000
 horses fought it minifigures and here 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.190
 she came out really very, very 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.550
 well why are such problems with tricks not 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.560
 understand here look how good they are 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.230
 made by china everything is well done 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.270
 all basically rovnenko here and so 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.240
 here is our zombie square 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.180
 but also our last 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.070
 the horse is a lošicki yo i'm so much 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.630
 wanted to make a big embroidered skeleton but 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.090
 unfortunately there is no sweep and the corpse is not 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.340
 Subscribers throw such a size 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.590
 studied the wheelbarrow thought to take it except rk from 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.410
 Subscriber then think no it's my dream 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.810
 Well, of course I’m mini, but still a dream and 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.640
 i made a boy and she is fine i 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.140
 here for a long time you are red but you know what 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.120
 minifigure all markup made 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.700
 red regret so they are very 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.620
 stand out right here so he 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.030
 hooves are made here all by cut out then 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.600
 here so here it turns out here behind 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.030
 points 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.310
 that is, everything is very , very cool no 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.230
 note 3 means ribs like this 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.330

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.550
 wears glued separately detail 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.430
 cast darts it turns out that even 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.910
 can check our town bar a little bit 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.130
 although it seems to me the output is not a mouth though 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.500
 Aries can and there will be a pound or 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.959

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.380
 This horse here they are the most 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.590
 the grate well I think that there will be a release on 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.150
 armor for horses I was typing but to 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.340
 Unfortunately I do not know, she will do 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.860
 horses and will not fit purely for in such 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.280
 here's a mini if the sheets fit so 3 4 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.620
 armor 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.630
 then I will do if they do not fit, then maybe 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.789
 be skins of photos in the VKontakte group 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.009
