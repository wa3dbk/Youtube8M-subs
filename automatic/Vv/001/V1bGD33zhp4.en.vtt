00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
the qad ultra rest I think this was the

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.799 
the qad ultra rest I think this was the
LD<00:00:10.690> right<00:00:11.020> hand<00:00:11.289> model<00:00:11.740> I<00:00:12.420> was<00:00:13.420> having

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
LD right hand model I was having

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:22.640

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.299 
hitting the rest didn't notice it I just
thought<00:00:28.899> it<00:00:29.079> was<00:00:29.140> me<00:00:29.349> because<00:00:29.649> I<00:00:29.769> hadn't<00:00:30.160> shot

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:30.309
