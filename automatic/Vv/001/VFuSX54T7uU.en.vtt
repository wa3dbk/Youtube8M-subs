that<00:02:19.020> way<00:02:19.140> said<00:02:20.010> L<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:21.030> R<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.600> R<00:02:23.420> okay<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.810> I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
that way said L that R and R okay so I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.320 
that way said L that R and R okay so I
presume<00:02:25.140> then<00:02:25.650> once<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.190> actually<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.940> you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
presume then once it's actually in you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.620 
presume then once it's actually in you
still<00:02:27.570> have<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.080> L<00:02:28.260> button<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:29.190> use<00:02:29.940> which<00:02:30.450> is

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
still have the L button in use which is

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.220 
still have the L button in use which is
on<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.050> actual<00:02:31.490> 3ds<00:02:32.490> itself<00:02:34.460> so<00:02:36.230> it's

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
on the actual 3ds itself so it's

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.290 
on the actual 3ds itself so it's
actually<00:02:38.540> reasonably<00:02:39.540> heavy<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:40.080> well<00:02:40.290> feels

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
actually reasonably heavy as well feels

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.000 
actually reasonably heavy as well feels
quite<00:02:42.300> solid<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:43.380> know<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.530> doesn't<00:02:43.860> feel

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
quite solid you know it doesn't feel

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.050 
quite solid you know it doesn't feel
like<00:02:44.100> it's<00:02:44.280> bending<00:02:44.670> or<00:02:44.760> anything<00:02:44.940> you're

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
like it's bending or anything you're

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.260 
like it's bending or anything you're
shifting<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.450> your<00:02:45.540> hand<00:02:45.720> too<00:02:45.900> much<00:02:47.270> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
shifting in your hand too much the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.730 
shifting in your hand too much the
battery<00:02:48.660> has<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.080> go<00:02:49.320> in<00:02:49.740> here<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.530> takes

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
battery has to go in here so it takes

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.360 
battery has to go in here so it takes
one<00:02:52.950> triple<00:02:53.550> AAA<00:02:53.850> battery<00:02:54.710> which<00:02:55.710> according

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
one triple AAA battery which according

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.490 
one triple AAA battery which according
to<00:02:56.430> Nintendo<00:02:56.640> you'll<00:02:57.210> get<00:02:57.480> many<00:02:57.990> hundreds<00:02:58.440> of

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
to Nintendo you'll get many hundreds of

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.870 
to Nintendo you'll get many hundreds of
hours<00:02:58.620> out<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.220> can't<00:02:59.430> remember<00:02:59.550> exactly

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
hours out of I can't remember exactly

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.600 
hours out of I can't remember exactly
what<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.570> is<00:03:00.830> as<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.980> can<00:03:02.100> see<00:03:02.220> when<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.490> lid

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
what that is as you can see when the lid

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.810 
what that is as you can see when the lid
is<00:03:02.640> taken<00:03:03.060> off<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.710> battery<00:03:04.710> slides<00:03:05.520> into<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
is taken off a battery slides into the

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:19.370 
is taken off a battery slides into the
center<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:18.180> can<00:03:18.270> see<00:03:18.330> if<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.110> can<00:03:19.230> probably

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
center you can see if you can probably

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.750 
center you can see if you can probably
make<00:03:19.620> out<00:03:19.710> in<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:19.950> video<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.370> can<00:03:20.490> see<00:03:20.670> up

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
make out in this video you can see up

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.990 
make out in this video you can see up
here<00:03:20.790> there's<00:03:21.150> some<00:03:21.270> like<00:03:21.840> rubber<00:03:22.730> seals<00:03:23.730> on

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
here there's some like rubber seals on

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.800 
here there's some like rubber seals on
the<00:03:24.090> side<00:03:24.390> which<00:03:24.750> are<00:03:25.110> used<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.710> help<00:03:25.890> position

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
the side which are used to help position

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.870 
the side which are used to help position
the<00:03:27.810> 3d<00:03:28.050> s<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.560> place<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.100> keep<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.460> in<00:03:29.610> place

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
the 3d s in place and keep it in place

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.300 
the 3d s in place and keep it in place
so<00:03:30.270> not<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.410> would<00:03:31.560> advocate<00:03:31.740> doing<00:03:32.190> this

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
so not that I would advocate doing this

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.820 
so not that I would advocate doing this
a<00:03:32.370> lot<00:03:32.580> as<00:03:33.240> you<00:03:33.390> can<00:03:33.510> see<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.750> does<00:03:33.930> provide

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
a lot as you can see it does provide

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.350 
a lot as you can see it does provide
enough<00:03:35.100> grip<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.490> actually<00:03:35.760> hold<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.030> console

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
enough grip to actually hold the console

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
enough grip to actually hold the console
in<00:03:36.510> when<00:03:36.720> it's<00:03:36.840> upside<00:03:37.140> down<00:03:39.020> so<00:03:40.020> yeah<00:03:40.200> there

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
in when it's upside down so yeah there

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.050 
in when it's upside down so yeah there
you<00:03:40.500> go<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.800> actually<00:03:41.100> when<00:03:41.460> it's<00:03:41.580> actually<00:03:41.730> in

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
you go so actually when it's actually in

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.030 
you go so actually when it's actually in
you<00:03:42.900> can<00:03:43.140> see<00:03:43.350> what's<00:03:43.500> what<00:03:43.770> is<00:03:43.890> quite

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
you can see what's what is quite

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.830 
you can see what's what is quite
annoying<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.760> unit<00:03:45.090> itself<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.660> back

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
annoying is the unit itself and the back

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.410 
annoying is the unit itself and the back
blocks<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.530> cartridge<00:03:47.120> slot<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.390> you

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
blocks the cartridge slot so you

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.840 
blocks the cartridge slot so you
actually<00:03:48.690> have<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.080> keep<00:03:49.860> taking<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.400> console

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
actually have to keep taking the console

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.080 
actually have to keep taking the console
out<00:03:51.270> of<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:52.280> first<00:03:53.280> light<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:53.760> Circle<00:03:54.030> Pad

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
out of the first light the Circle Pad

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.780 
out of the first light the Circle Pad
Pro<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.660> actually<00:03:55.020> change<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.610> cartridge<00:03:56.610> for

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
Pro to actually change the cartridge for

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.300 
Pro to actually change the cartridge for
each<00:03:56.850> game<00:03:57.380> so<00:03:58.380> as<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.590> can<00:03:58.680> see<00:03:58.890> there<00:03:59.100> then

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
each game so as you can see there then

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.960 
each game so as you can see there then
you've<00:03:59.580> got

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
you've got

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.540 
you've got
there's<00:04:00.150> your<00:04:00.390> Zed<00:04:01.290> L<00:04:01.440> I'll<00:04:02.070> turn<00:04:02.250> upside<00:04:02.520> down

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
there's your Zed L I'll turn upside down

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.240 
there's your Zed L I'll turn upside down
again<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.450> there's<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.810> L<00:04:03.959> button<00:04:04.230> as<00:04:04.890> ed<00:04:05.130> L

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
again so there's the L button as ed L

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.510 
again so there's the L button as ed L
button<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.780> r<00:04:06.990> button<00:04:07.020> which<00:04:07.709> was<00:04:08.100> there

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
button and the r button which was there

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.610 
button and the r button which was there
I<00:04:08.760> suppose<00:04:09.270> I'd<00:04:09.540> probably<00:04:09.990> still<00:04:10.260> be<00:04:10.410> in<00:04:10.470> use

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
I suppose I'd probably still be in use

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.160 
I suppose I'd probably still be in use
but<00:04:10.890> who<00:04:11.190> knows<00:04:11.400> we<00:04:12.209> have<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.540> here<00:04:12.720> now<00:04:12.900> and

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
but who knows we have it here now and

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.390 
but who knows we have it here now and
the<00:04:13.560> Z<00:04:14.070> or<00:04:16.340> console<00:04:17.340> open<00:04:19.070> we've<00:04:20.070> got<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
the Z or console open we've got the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.970 
the Z or console open we've got the
usual

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
usual

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.260 
usual
you<00:04:22.980> do<00:04:23.130> have<00:04:23.310> access<00:04:23.460> on<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:23.940> site<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.240> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
you do have access on the site to the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.170 
you do have access on the site to the
volume<00:04:24.740> which<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.890> can<00:04:26.040> make<00:04:26.190> out<00:04:26.340> there<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:26.940> I

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
volume which you can make out there so I

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.570 
volume which you can make out there so I
can<00:04:27.450> turn<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.530> volume<00:04:28.560> down<00:04:28.800> turn<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.370> back<00:04:29.490> up

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
can turn the volume down turn it back up

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.370 
can turn the volume down turn it back up
again<00:04:30.290> which<00:04:31.290> is<00:04:31.500> good<00:04:32.960> holding<00:04:33.960> it's<00:04:34.140> quite

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
again which is good holding it's quite

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.130 
again which is good holding it's quite
heavy<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:35.070> feels<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.640> lot<00:04:35.820> heavier<00:04:36.570> than<00:04:36.780> just

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
heavy it feels a lot heavier than just

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.160 
heavy it feels a lot heavier than just

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
obviously just with the 3ds it feels

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.800 
obviously just with the 3ds it feels
better<00:04:40.470> in<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:41.130> my<00:04:41.340> hands<00:04:41.580> in<00:04:41.790> more<00:04:42.540> adult

better in in my hands in more adult

3ds having this radius in adult hands I

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.780 
3ds having this radius in adult hands I
find<00:04:49.050> for<00:04:49.230> myself<00:04:49.350> anyway<00:04:49.770> gives<00:04:50.040> me<00:04:50.220> krump

quite<00:04:51.240> easily<00:04:51.390> quite<00:04:51.720> quickly<00:04:51.930> so<00:04:52.140> hopefully

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
quite easily quite quickly so hopefully

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.910 
quite easily quite quickly so hopefully
after<00:04:53.190> couple<00:04:53.880> of<00:04:54.000> hours<00:04:54.180> of<00:04:54.240> use<00:04:54.480> with<00:04:54.690> this

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
after couple of hours of use with this

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.720 
after couple of hours of use with this
it<00:04:55.920> won't<00:04:56.130> be<00:04:56.430> too<00:04:56.640> bad<00:04:58.130> one<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.340> worries<00:04:59.520> I

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
it won't be too bad one of the worries I

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.310 
it won't be too bad one of the worries I
had<00:04:59.880> about<00:05:00.120> this<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.360> actually<00:05:00.780> haven't<00:05:01.050> seen

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
had about this I actually haven't seen

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.510 
had about this I actually haven't seen
it<00:05:01.500> what<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.740> intend<00:05:01.980> oh<00:05:02.070> we're<00:05:02.190> doing<00:05:02.310> with

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
it what the intend oh we're doing with

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.330 
it what the intend oh we're doing with
this<00:05:02.640> was<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.680> when<00:05:04.680> you're<00:05:04.800> holding<00:05:04.980> it<00:05:05.190> in

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
this was that when you're holding it in

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.360 
this was that when you're holding it in
place<00:05:05.600> typically<00:05:06.600> you'd<00:05:06.990> have<00:05:07.370> everything

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
place typically you'd have everything

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.700 
place typically you'd have everything
centered<00:05:08.850> to<00:05:08.940> your<00:05:09.060> face<00:05:09.270> obviously<00:05:09.900> you<00:05:10.590> know

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
centered to your face obviously you know

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.200 
centered to your face obviously you know
your<00:05:10.830> left<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:11.190> right<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.670> would<00:05:12.120> be

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
your left and right and you would be

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.580 
your left and right and you would be
looking<00:05:12.330> straight<00:05:12.600> down<00:05:12.780> the<00:05:12.930> middle<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.260> the

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
looking straight down the middle and the

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.680 
looking straight down the middle and the
screen<00:05:13.830> is<00:05:13.980> offset<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.490> left<00:05:14.760> hand<00:05:15.480> side

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
screen is offset to the left hand side

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.710 
screen is offset to the left hand side
which<00:05:16.020> is<00:05:16.200> quite<00:05:16.830> annoying<00:05:17.300> but<00:05:18.300> actually

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
which is quite annoying but actually

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.830 
which is quite annoying but actually
having<00:05:18.990> it<00:05:19.080> in<00:05:19.230> my<00:05:19.290> hands<00:05:19.830> it's<00:05:20.490> not<00:05:20.970> too<00:05:21.480> bad<00:05:21.780> I

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
having it in my hands it's not too bad I

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.390 
having it in my hands it's not too bad I
think<00:05:22.140> I<00:05:22.200> can<00:05:22.350> get<00:05:22.500> used<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:23.600> so<00:05:24.600> it's

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
think I can get used to that so it's

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.180 
think I can get used to that so it's
let's<00:05:26.400> just<00:05:26.669> try<00:05:27.380> some<00:05:28.380> Resident<00:05:28.770> Evil<00:05:29.010> quite

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
let's just try some Resident Evil quite

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:36.830 
let's just try some Resident Evil quite
quickly

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:46.290

three<00:05:46.990> days<00:05:47.169> off

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.120 

let's<00:05:50.719> turn<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:50.960> volume<00:05:50.990> up

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:03.390 

I<00:06:01.110> played<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.230> demo<00:06:02.410> over<00:06:02.650> of<00:06:02.950> this<00:06:03.160> game

excellent game what I found quite

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.020 
excellent game what I found quite
awkward

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
awkward

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.810 
awkward

how actually communicates with the
circle<00:07:12.040> pad<00:07:12.160> pro<00:07:12.190> it's<00:07:12.700> done<00:07:12.970> at<00:07:13.240> the<00:07:13.360> back<00:07:13.540> of

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
circle pad pro it's done at the back of

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.260 
circle pad pro it's done at the back of
the<00:07:13.840> device<00:07:14.110> at<00:07:14.320> the<00:07:14.380> back<00:07:14.500> of<00:07:14.620> the<00:07:14.680> 3d<00:07:14.890> yes<00:07:15.270> you

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
the device at the back of the 3d yes you

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.490 
the device at the back of the 3d yes you
can<00:07:16.450> see<00:07:16.630> that<00:07:16.780> there<00:07:16.960> is<00:07:16.990> an<00:07:17.170> infrared<00:07:17.380> port

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
can see that there is an infrared port

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.790 
can see that there is an infrared port
here<00:07:17.920> and<00:07:17.950> on<00:07:18.820> the<00:07:19.510> Circle<00:07:19.870> Pad<00:07:19.900> Pro<00:07:20.050> if<00:07:20.350> I<00:07:20.560> try

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
here and on the Circle Pad Pro if I try

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.290 
here and on the Circle Pad Pro if I try
an<00:07:20.860> angle<00:07:21.130> this<00:07:21.220> correctly<00:07:21.670> you<00:07:21.790> might<00:07:22.180> be

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
an angle this correctly you might be

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.250 
an angle this correctly you might be
able<00:07:22.390> to<00:07:22.450> make<00:07:22.630> out<00:07:22.750> that<00:07:22.780> there<00:07:23.080> is<00:07:23.110> an

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:23.260 
able to make out that there is an

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.900 
able to make out that there is an
infrared<00:07:23.530> port<00:07:23.620> in<00:07:24.100> here<00:07:24.430> as<00:07:24.550> well

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.910 
infrared port in here as well

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.960 
infrared port in here as well
so<00:07:25.720> that's<00:07:25.930> how<00:07:26.140> it's<00:07:26.290> actually

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
so that's how it's actually

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.820 
so that's how it's actually
understanding<00:07:27.970> that<00:07:28.210> yes<00:07:29.080> okay<00:07:29.590> I'm

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.830 
understanding that yes okay I'm

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.110 
understanding that yes okay I'm
connected<00:07:30.250> to<00:07:30.340> this<00:07:30.430> external<00:07:30.880> device<00:07:31.090> and

connected to this external device and

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.140 
connected to this external device and
this<00:07:31.450> is<00:07:31.570> how<00:07:31.660> it<00:07:31.780> work<00:07:32.190> so<00:07:33.190> there<00:07:33.700> you<00:07:33.790> go<00:07:33.940> it's
