00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.209
 stroke of genius 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.100

 Ivorians can do things like that 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.789
 it's not just a film for 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.080
 children but it's a clip that concerns 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.680
 also adults because we talk about 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.139
