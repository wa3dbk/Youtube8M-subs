00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.260 
comfortable jumping into the pool might
be<00:02:04.740> cold<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.579> what<00:02:05.759> when<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.030> swim

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
be cold but you know what when you swim

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.419 
be cold but you know what when you swim
for<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> couple<00:02:06.780> minutes<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.290> get<00:02:07.439> warm<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
for a couple minutes you get warm you

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.740 
for a couple minutes you get warm you
know<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.819> almost<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.420> kind<00:02:09.690> of

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
know it's almost like that kind of

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.360 
know it's almost like that kind of
energy<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.440> think<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> day

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
energy like I think that this is a day

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.280 
energy like I think that this is a day
to<00:02:11.400> not<00:02:11.790> let<00:02:12.060> your

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
to not let your

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.899 
to not let your
motions<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:14.159> know<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.640> important

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
motions you know I think it's important

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.309 
motions you know I think it's important
to<00:02:14.939> pay<00:02:15.060> attention<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.599> them<00:02:15.750> don't<00:02:16.079> get<00:02:16.200> me

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
to pay attention to them don't get me

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.869 
to pay attention to them don't get me
wrong<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.860> also<00:02:17.010> think<00:02:17.099> it's<00:02:17.370> important<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
wrong but I also think it's important to

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.910 
wrong but I also think it's important to
take<00:02:18.030> action<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.629> think<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:18.959> important

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
take action I think it's important

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.589 
take action I think it's important
especially<00:02:20.010> because<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.819> Sun<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.239> starting

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
especially because the Sun is starting

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.009 
especially because the Sun is starting
to<00:02:21.780> try<00:02:22.109> and<00:02:22.230> Jupiter<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.340> out<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.879> nowhere<00:02:24.090> I

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
to try and Jupiter and out of nowhere I

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.720 
to try and Jupiter and out of nowhere I
always<00:02:25.530> give<00:02:25.709> Jupiter<00:02:26.129> about<00:02:26.310> five<00:02:26.519> degrees

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
always give Jupiter about five degrees

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.750 
always give Jupiter about five degrees
in<00:02:27.540> an<00:02:27.840> orb<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.799> know<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.219> don't<00:02:29.459> know

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
in an orb and you know I don't know

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.630 
in an orb and you know I don't know
where<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.299> this<00:02:30.540> really<00:02:31.349> positive<00:02:32.189> no

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
where it is this really positive no

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.670 
where it is this really positive no
matter<00:02:32.700> what<00:02:33.180> happens<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.900> all<00:02:33.930> gonna<00:02:34.290> go<00:02:34.530> in

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
matter what happens is all gonna go in

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.949 
matter what happens is all gonna go in
the<00:02:34.739> right<00:02:34.890> way<00:02:35.129> energy<00:02:35.670> coming<00:02:35.939> in<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.810> like

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
the right way energy coming in it's like

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.289 
the right way energy coming in it's like
a<00:02:36.989> song<00:02:37.379> in<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.920> back<00:02:38.129> of<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.579> universe<00:02:39.030> like
