good morning youtubers it's it's raining

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.890 
good morning youtubers it's it's raining
ready<00:00:13.429> for<00:00:13.700> the<00:00:13.789> first<00:00:13.969> test<00:00:14.389> I<00:00:14.809> like<00:00:15.379> to<00:00:15.849> burn

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
ready for the first test I like to burn

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.620 
ready for the first test I like to burn
the<00:00:17.900> oil<00:00:18.230> heater<00:00:18.860> with<00:00:19.480> vegetable<00:00:20.480> oil

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
the oil heater with vegetable oil

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.210 
the oil heater with vegetable oil
sunflower<00:00:21.529> oil<00:00:22.009> and<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:24.470> difference<00:00:24.859> with

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
sunflower oil and the difference with

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.160 
sunflower oil and the difference with
kerosene<00:00:26.119> is<00:00:26.359> that<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:27.470> flame<00:00:28.160> point<00:00:28.460> is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
kerosene is that the flame point is

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.130 
kerosene is that the flame point is
twice<00:00:30.170> as<00:00:30.439> high<00:00:30.730> calcium<00:00:31.730> is<00:00:32.119> 60<00:00:32.750> degrees

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
twice as high calcium is 60 degrees

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.310 
twice as high calcium is 60 degrees
Celsius<00:00:33.710> then<00:00:34.610> it<00:00:34.820> will<00:00:35.000> burn<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.510> this<00:00:35.960> oil

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
Celsius then it will burn and this oil

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.100 
Celsius then it will burn and this oil
should<00:00:37.040> be<00:00:37.180> 120<00:00:38.769> 125<00:00:39.769> 100<00:00:40.519> 250<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.629> I<00:00:41.660> have<00:00:41.930> to

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
should be 120 125 100 250 so I have to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.400 
should be 120 125 100 250 so I have to
preheat<00:00:42.670> very<00:00:44.289> low<00:00:45.289> and<00:00:46.539> perhaps<00:00:47.539> it<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:48.170> won't

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
preheat very low and perhaps it it won't

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
preheat very low and perhaps it it won't
burn<00:00:48.730> we<00:00:49.730> will<00:00:49.850> see<00:00:50.059> now<00:00:50.660> it's<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.079> same<00:00:51.289> setup

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.810 

or<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.120> at<00:00:57.330> night<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:58.380> Nate<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.980> alcohol<00:00:59.580> is

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
or will at night if Nate the alcohol is

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.410 
or will at night if Nate the alcohol is
burning<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.620> then<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:04.309> normally<00:01:05.420> in

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
burning chamber over it and it's direct

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.140 
burning chamber over it and it's direct
fairly<00:01:23.340> hot<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.130> hear<00:01:29.369> his<00:01:29.520> burning<00:01:30.000> but

fairly hot you can hear his burning but

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150 
fairly hot you can hear his burning but
that<00:01:30.300> that's<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.690> alcohol<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.350> come<00:01:31.740> back<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.040> a

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
that that's the alcohol I come back in a

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.880 
that that's the alcohol I come back in a
few<00:01:32.369> minutes<00:01:33.110> after<00:01:34.110> about<00:01:34.320> 10<00:01:34.860> minutes

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
few minutes after about 10 minutes

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.520 
few minutes after about 10 minutes
they'll<00:01:35.550> almost<00:01:35.910> golf<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.930> are<00:01:37.140> still

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
they'll almost golf and I are still

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.840 
they'll almost golf and I are still
there<00:01:37.770> didn't<00:01:38.190> burn<00:01:40.550> it<00:01:41.550> was<00:01:41.790> not<00:01:42.110> hot<00:01:43.110> enough

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
there didn't burn it was not hot enough

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.630 
there didn't burn it was not hot enough
it<00:01:44.850> was<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.270> boiling<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.500> try<00:01:47.160> another

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
it was not boiling now I try another

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.969 
it was not boiling now I try another
concept<00:01:48.950> put<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.250> nuts<00:01:51.090> over<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
concept put some nuts over here so the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.550 
concept put some nuts over here so the
tin<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.750> bit<00:01:54.900> higher<00:01:55.200> in

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
tin can is a little bit higher in

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.300 
tin can is a little bit higher in
alcohol<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:57.240> did<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.750> some<00:01:58.110> holes<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
alcohol and I did make some holes in the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.690 
alcohol and I did make some holes in the
burning<00:01:59.759> camera<00:02:00.330> because<00:02:01.050> I<00:02:01.230> did<00:02:01.470> have<00:02:01.700> three

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
burning camera because I did have three

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.840 
burning camera because I did have three
flames<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.990> heat<00:02:04.830> this<00:02:04.980> up<00:02:05.190> and<00:02:05.460> that's<00:02:05.610> not

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
flames to heat this up and that's not

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.100 
flames to heat this up and that's not
enough<00:02:06.120> no<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.680> tried<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:09.739> do<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.860> better

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
enough no I like I tried to do it better

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.650 
enough no I like I tried to do it better
actually<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:14.040> oil<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.760> should<00:02:15.269> never

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
actually this is oil what should never

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.710 
actually this is oil what should never
burn<00:02:16.050> from<00:02:16.380> his<00:02:16.560> own<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:17.220> need<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:18.030> lit<00:02:18.450> or<00:02:18.690> a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
burn from his own you need a lit or a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.360 
burn from his own you need a lit or a
wick<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.269> I<00:02:22.790> just<00:02:23.790> try<00:02:24.330> if<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.260> let<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.040> burn

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
wick and I just try if I can let it burn

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.560 
wick and I just try if I can let it burn
without<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.380> wick<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:29.120> actually<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.330> should

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
without a wick and actually you should

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.330 
without a wick and actually you should
you<00:02:31.110> should<00:02:31.610> drip<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.790> or<00:02:33.000> make<00:02:33.750> little<00:02:34.410> drops

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
you should drip it or make little drops

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.090 
you should drip it or make little drops
and<00:02:35.700> then<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.600> pull<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.170> in<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.920> then

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
and then it pull it in the can and then

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.840 
and then it pull it in the can and then
it<00:02:38.280> will<00:02:38.489> burn<00:02:39.239> while<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.900> preheated<00:02:40.850> so

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
it will burn while it is preheated so

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:50.449 
it will burn while it is preheated so
sunflower<00:02:42.600> heating<00:02:43.200> take<00:02:43.560> three

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.160 

I'll<00:02:50.969> call<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.390> burning<00:02:53.810> now<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.870> fire

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
I'll call this burning now the fire

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.110 
I'll call this burning now the fire
chamber<00:02:55.469> goes<00:02:55.799> up

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.170 

now<00:03:00.690> we<00:03:00.840> have<00:03:00.959> Toit

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.349 

he's<00:03:06.180> burning<00:03:08.569> furry<00:03:09.569> gold<00:03:10.400> perhaps<00:03:11.400> he's

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
he's burning furry gold perhaps he's

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.250 
he's burning furry gold perhaps he's
cooling<00:03:12.629> down<00:03:12.870> too<00:03:13.200> quick<00:03:13.549> to<00:03:14.549> keep<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.260> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
cooling down too quick to keep the the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.209 
cooling down too quick to keep the the
oil<00:03:16.469> on<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.920> right<00:03:17.549> temperature<00:03:18.269> we<00:03:19.219> will

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:20.219 
oil on the right temperature we will

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.160 
oil on the right temperature we will
know<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.849> about<00:03:21.090> five<00:03:21.480> minutes<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.930> is

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
know that in about five minutes this is

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.649 
know that in about five minutes this is
the<00:03:22.349> situation<00:03:22.950> after<00:03:23.099> about<00:03:23.700> one<00:03:24.030> minute<00:03:24.239> it

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
the situation after about one minute it

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:30.890 
the situation after about one minute it
is<00:03:24.959> surprising<00:03:25.620> me<00:03:25.769> because<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:27.420> have<00:03:29.900> orange

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
is surprising me because I have orange

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.170 
is surprising me because I have orange
flames<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.530> means<00:03:31.859> that<00:03:32.159> there<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.430> already

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
flames that means that there is already

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.949 
flames that means that there is already
burning<00:03:33.750> oil<00:03:35.000> is<00:03:36.000> very<00:03:36.060> hot

about one meter away and I can feel him

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:07.879 
about one meter away and I can feel him
you<00:07:01.939> see<00:07:02.939> it's<00:07:03.150> a<00:07:03.330> little<00:07:03.599> bit<00:07:03.919> back<00:07:04.919> smoke<00:07:06.889> but
