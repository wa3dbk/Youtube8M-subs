and we're gonna pull our yarn through

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.270 
and we're gonna pull our yarn through
once<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.880> this<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.290> tangle<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.040> yarn

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
once and this is just a tangle of yarn

pieces of fabric and I'm gonna pull it

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.370 
pieces of fabric and I'm gonna pull it
tight<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.209> just<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.600> little<00:03:12.630> bit<00:03:13.020> but<00:03:13.230> let's

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
tight in just a little bit but let's

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.430 
tight in just a little bit but let's
work<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.250> few<00:03:14.489> more<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.850> stitches<00:03:15.300> all<00:03:16.110> right<00:03:16.290> so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
work a few more of stitches all right so

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.440 
work a few more of stitches all right so
on<00:03:16.620> this<00:03:16.830> piece<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.549> fabric<00:03:17.730> we're<00:03:18.060> gonna<00:03:18.150> go

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
on this piece of fabric we're gonna go

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.130 
on this piece of fabric we're gonna go
up<00:03:18.690> again<00:03:19.640> up<00:03:20.640> one<00:03:20.970> row<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.360> found<00:03:21.690> that<00:03:21.870> bar

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
up again up one row we found that bar

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.840 
up again up one row we found that bar
and<00:03:22.470> we're<00:03:23.040> gonna<00:03:23.130> pull<00:03:23.640> our<00:03:23.970> yarn<00:03:24.030> through

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
and we're gonna pull our yarn through

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.020 
and we're gonna pull our yarn through
perfect<00:03:26.850> okay<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.860> we're<00:03:29.070> gonna<00:03:29.130> go<00:03:29.400> over<00:03:29.430> to

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
perfect okay and we're gonna go over to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.440 
perfect okay and we're gonna go over to
this<00:03:30.630> side<00:03:30.690> find<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.769> bar<00:03:32.160> here<00:03:32.790> we<00:03:32.910> go<00:03:33.090> here

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
this side find that bar here we go here

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.490 
this side find that bar here we go here
it<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.019> pull<00:03:34.739> our<00:03:34.890> yarn<00:03:34.920> through<00:03:36.500> perfect

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
it is and pull our yarn through perfect

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.370 
it is and pull our yarn through perfect
so<00:03:38.310> now<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.549> can<00:03:38.850> see<00:03:39.090> we've<00:03:39.299> got<00:03:39.510> seaming

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
so now you can see we've got seaming

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.340 
so now you can see we've got seaming
done<00:03:40.830> between<00:03:41.100> our<00:03:41.640> two<00:03:42.030> pieces<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.570> fabric<00:03:42.959> so

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
done between our two pieces of fabric so

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.650 
done between our two pieces of fabric so
now<00:03:43.530> let's<00:03:43.769> just<00:03:43.860> pull<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.400> tight<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.970> see

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
now let's just pull it tight and see

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.860 
now let's just pull it tight and see
what<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.140> looks<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:46.470> okay<00:03:47.070> so<00:03:47.570> you<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.840> use
