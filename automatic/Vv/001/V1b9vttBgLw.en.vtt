00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.500
 Hi everyone, how are you? I'm registered. 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
 comes back with another episode of what you play 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.969
 the minecraft and in today's episode galera 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.770
 I decided to upgrade here in the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.380
 space of our friends villagers 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.289
 I decided that I'm going to build some more 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.210
 houses here to see if they are scattered 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.189
 a little there from that big house that I 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.429
 I made them because they are already in 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.369
 large number to the large number of gomes 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.719
 But they're just here in the house. 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.800
 so I'll do some more 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.950
 buildings 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.780
 I'm going to build here three more houses 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.550
 I'm going to build here in this space a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.300
 little tower 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.829
 I'm going to build here a kind of 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.469
 where I'll put an anvil 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.180
 Any more other things 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.829
 and here I am going to build another house 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.170
 relatively large 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.989
 not as big as that one but it will be 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.820
 a large house maybe they too that 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.590
 they will live there 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.890
 Good, I'll leave you there with the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.750
 images of me building so I do not 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.000
 Be boring too for you summer 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.210
 building real-time 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.380
 good, this is it people stay there with 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.380
 construction images 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.560
 good 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.200
 good guys until they were ok 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.600
 friendly here the new dependencies 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.940
 of our small village here 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.100
 little friends villagers was really cool 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.050
 even though I did a good house 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.600
 little girl who's going to be here 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.150
 kind of blacksmith's and locksmith's shop 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.030
 Where I'm going to put here is a 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.900
 anvil and also a cauldron here I 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.580
 I made a small tower we already have two 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.200
 boys here a small tower 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.690
 today we can observe in the distance and also 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.760
 we have a big house there guys 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.980
 They're still a little shy. 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.650
 they do not know if they can occupy the new 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.470
 home last good but the house was well 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.080
 Pretty cool, really, it's all suddenly 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.750
 We're going to do some more things in 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.300
 matter of decoration more forward 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.870
 but for now it will stay anyway 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.640
 For now I'm going to make anvil there. 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.060
 show you who do not know how 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.359
 make and also to give a decked 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.830
 here in our our environment is good 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.390
 In order to wait, we need three 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.250
 ambrogi iron cross I will not do 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.990
 because I already have them here but we need 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.919
 of three iron blocks to make the 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.220
 iron block 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.380
 here we have nine iron bars 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.690
 People, as I already have, I'm not going to do it. 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.669
 and to make the guard we put three 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:47.160
 blocks of iron and three bars of 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.310
 moreover iron to four iron bars 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.250
 here one of this way there we have the 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:58.080
 Famous anvil, guys, I'm going too. 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:01.620
 do there for our our house will 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.479
 make line 11 a cauldron one 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.010
 cauldron in the future I 'll put there 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.979
 inside that cauldron but I do not have 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.020
 wash here now and then I'll take love 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.640
 Good, let's put it here instead of 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.130
 Spotlight 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:18.300
 Let's put it next to the little table. 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.150
 Maybe I think it'll be cool. 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.470
 Do not worry, we'll change later. 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.530
 Let's put here our anvil and 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.770
 Let's put it on top of this block 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.870
 of glass 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.669
 our cauldron z is interesting I 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.199
 I do not know, I could stay a little taller 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.250
 I do not know if block due here was a 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.530
 very good idea 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.669
 removing this block of glass and let's 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.009
 redo 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.590
 let's put it right there on the ground let's go 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:55.479
 see if it gets cooler 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:06:00.370
 look here force the cauldron is put 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:02.380
 I'll put it in the cauldron now. 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.849
 because I do not have lava here but 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.789
 I'll bring some of the 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:09.520
 which will make a very good appearance and 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:12.569
 Geez, I think it's for today. 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.139
 People, I did a good increase here. 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.580
 visible here in the small village of our 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.889
 little friends wilders 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.360
 as I said there is some other detail to 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.330
 People are going to do it, then go. 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.810
 and then the important thing is that 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.210
 We work here today. 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.650
 here we also have an encore that 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.500
 they are disturbing me 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.330
 They are taking my concentration looks 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.180
 here a villa john d 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.229
 I do not have a potion that can not cure a cure. 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.120

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:46.029

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.159

 village like I said they are still here 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:55.930
 I still think they do not know if they can 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:58.029
 occupy the rest of the premises 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.789

 hard to understand
