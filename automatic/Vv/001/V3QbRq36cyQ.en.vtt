00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.990
 this is brilliant day with berries 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.090
 wolfberry that can also be replaced by 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.619
 raisins as usual this is a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.930
 recipes that remain simple to do 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.359
 all the steps in video and one 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.270
 start by putting flour with the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.370
 remains a regret dion for the dough 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.960
 so dry yeast if you use of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.559
 the fresh yeast will have to double the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.890
 amount 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.989
 you add the sugar a spoon to 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.320
 coffee of salt softened butter 1.9 and the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.320
 warm milk 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.160
 we will mix all these elements 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.410
 be by hand or roubaud using 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.870
 the hook there I kneaded until 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.060
 that the dough is smooth and elastic 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.400
 after that it will have to be covered and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.910
 let doubling in volume about one 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.040
 hour and a half for people who 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.020
 do not know goji berries this 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.600
 are dried berries that comes from 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.479
 tibet and found in stores 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.850
 to the bio ray and that have the texture and the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.590
 taste of raisins as they are 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.350
 pretty dry and so I put them in 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.810
 hot water to moisturize them between 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.940
 time the dough has risen well so I'm going 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.649
 the state is on a work plan 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.630
 floured and I'm going to cut out a square of 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:48.050
 30 cm we will brush with melted butter 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.810
 sprinkle with brown sugar and then go 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.990
 indispose small red berries to 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.990
 above 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.439
 when you see I roll the dough for 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.280
 form a group of a tale will cut 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.280
 in two pieces 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.530
 once we cut out the pieces of 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.920
 paste they are placed on a plate 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.100
 pastry measurements coming in on 22 cm 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.930
 and we will let them rise about 40 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.460
 minutes 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.010
 so in the meantime we preheat the 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.420
 oven at 200 Â° and you bake them 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.680
 buns for 20 to 25 minutes 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.050
