and<00:01:32.870> also<00:01:33.200> let's<00:01:33.380> be<00:01:33.500> honest<00:01:33.800> javi's

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
and also let's be honest javi's

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.680 
and also let's be honest javi's
expressed<00:01:34.610> an<00:01:34.700> interest<00:01:34.850> in<00:01:35.000> coaching<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:35.600> I'm

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
expressed an interest in coaching so I'm

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.390 
expressed an interest in coaching so I'm
pretty<00:01:35.990> sure<00:01:36.200> he<00:01:36.650> could<00:01:36.770> be<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:36.980> player<00:01:37.159> coach

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
pretty sure he could be the player coach

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.470 
pretty sure he could be the player coach
of<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.610> team<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:37.970> they<00:01:38.030> would<00:01:38.150> do<00:01:38.240> just<00:01:38.420> fine

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
of the team and they would do just fine

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.820 
of the team and they would do just fine
I'm<00:01:38.870> pretty<00:01:39.200> sure<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.350> lot<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.530> those<00:01:39.620> players

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
I'm pretty sure a lot of those players

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.560 
I'm pretty sure a lot of those players
would<00:01:39.980> be<00:01:40.070> just<00:01:40.280> fine<00:01:40.460> yeah<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.420> also

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
would be just fine yeah and it also

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.180 
would be just fine yeah and it also
helps<00:01:41.870> it<00:01:41.960> Moran<00:01:42.200> aren't<00:01:42.470> very<00:01:42.620> good<00:01:42.770> at<00:01:43.040> it

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
helps it Moran aren't very good at it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.520 
helps it Moran aren't very good at it
