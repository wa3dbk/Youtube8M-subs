00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
top of the hill we wound up with all of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.180 
top of the hill we wound up with all of
these<00:00:49.280> Round<00:00:49.640> Rock's<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:51.050> just<00:00:51.380> it's

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
these Round Rock's it just it's

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.240 
these Round Rock's it just it's
something<00:00:52.579> I<00:00:52.670> don't<00:00:52.880> understand<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.920> looks

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
something I don't understand it looks

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.220 
something I don't understand it looks
certainly<00:00:55.670> like<00:00:55.850> there<00:00:56.059> was<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.510> lot<00:00:56.840> of<00:00:56.870> water

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
certainly like there was a lot of water

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.049 
certainly like there was a lot of water
here<00:00:57.590> at<00:00:57.739> one<00:00:57.920> point<00:00:58.190> where<00:00:58.670> there<00:00:58.850> was<00:00:59.030> a

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
here at one point where there was a

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.299 
here at one point where there was a
glacier<00:00:59.660> here<00:00:59.930> at<00:01:00.079> some<00:01:00.350> point<00:01:00.649> I<00:01:00.920> mean<00:01:01.039> just

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
glacier here at some point I mean just

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.459 
glacier here at some point I mean just
all<00:01:01.520> of<00:01:01.700> this<00:01:01.850> cobblestone<00:01:02.570> at<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.899> top<00:01:03.110> of<00:01:03.140> a

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
all of this cobblestone at the top of a

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.749 
all of this cobblestone at the top of a
of<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:04.550> hill<00:01:05.470> really<00:01:06.470> fairly<00:01:06.710> far<00:01:07.100> away<00:01:07.369> from

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
of a hill really fairly far away from

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.930 
of a hill really fairly far away from
from<00:01:08.300> any<00:01:08.960> current<00:01:09.500> river<00:01:09.830> flows<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.520> has

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
from any current river flows it has

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.670 
from any current river flows it has
always<00:01:11.119> been<00:01:11.240> an<00:01:11.509> interesting<00:01:11.810> thing<00:01:12.320> this

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
always been an interesting thing this

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.130 
always been an interesting thing this
site<00:01:12.979> really<00:01:13.459> had<00:01:13.640> something<00:01:14.479> pretty<00:01:14.750> special

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
site really had something pretty special

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.430

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
the elevation of the rise over the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.309 
the elevation of the rise over the
surrounding<00:01:18.679> area<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.610> rocks<00:01:20.330> of<00:01:20.569> course<00:01:21.190> and

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
all those instincts came true and we

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.270 
all those instincts came true and we
made<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.509> first<00:01:26.539> wine<00:01:27.020> really<00:01:27.770> excited<00:01:28.160> about
