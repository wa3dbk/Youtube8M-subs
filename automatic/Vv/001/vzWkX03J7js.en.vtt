00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
what would you think if we did atomic as

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.740 
what would you think if we did atomic as
a<00:00:30.420> tanking<00:00:31.320> power<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.070> did<00:00:32.820> water<00:00:33.239> as<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
a tanking power and did water as a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.459 
a tanking power and did water as a
healing<00:00:34.320> power<00:00:34.829> instead<00:00:36.079> retweet<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.320> i'd

healing power instead retweet for i'd

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.709 
healing power instead retweet for i'd
love<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.640> see<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.149> got<00:00:39.450> a

atomic<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.510> supposed<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> healing

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
atomic was supposed to be the healing

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.779 
atomic was supposed to be the healing
power<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.370> new<00:00:56.520> healing<00:00:56.879> power<00:00:57.090> coming<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
power the new healing power coming and

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.130 
power the new healing power coming and
experimental<00:00:59.789> serums<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.960> the

experimental serums was going to be the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.299 
experimental serums was going to be the
tanking<00:01:01.590> power<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:03.570> me<00:01:03.750> i<00:01:03.960> wasn't<00:01:04.530> overly

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
tanking power now for me i wasn't overly

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.550 
tanking power now for me i wasn't overly
key<00:01:05.729> because<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.060> play<00:01:06.299> tank<00:01:06.630> right<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> mean

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
key because I play tank right so I mean

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.399 
key because I play tank right so I mean
I'm<00:01:07.920> always<00:01:08.450> looking<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> next<00:01:10.080> tank

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I'm always looking for the next tank

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.080 
I'm always looking for the next tank
power<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.369> guys<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.729> you're<00:01:11.880> he

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
power just like you guys if you're he

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.240 
power just like you guys if you're he
layer<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.689> interested<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> new

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
layer is interested in what the new

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.210 
layer is interested in what the new
healing<00:01:14.760> power<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.740> same<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:16.890> control

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
healing power is and same with control

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370 
healing power is and same with control
right<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.450> wasn't<00:01:18.659> really<00:01:18.960> looking

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
right and that wasn't really looking

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
right and that wasn't really looking
forward<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> experimental<00:01:20.750> experimental

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
forward to experimental experimental

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.450 
forward to experimental experimental
serum<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.560> imagine<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.040> being<00:01:23.070> like

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
serum so I can imagine it being like

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.270 
serum so I can imagine it being like
Bane<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.479> kind<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.780> stuff<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
Bane and that kind of stuff as we as so

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.510 
Bane and that kind of stuff as we as so
I'm<00:01:26.369> sure<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.790> all<00:01:26.909> kind<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.560> that<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.860> our

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
I'm sure we all kind of have that in our

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.859 
I'm sure we all kind of have that in our
heads<00:01:29.790> something<00:01:30.360> along<00:01:30.689> those<00:01:30.840> lines<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
heads something along those lines and

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.080 
heads something along those lines and
atomic<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.320> sound<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.640> lot

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
atomic is just sound is just a lot

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
atomic is just sound is just a lot
cooler<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:36.810> opinion<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.439> don't<00:01:37.619> know

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
cooler in my opinion I don't know

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.380 
cooler in my opinion I don't know
whether<00:01:38.250> they're<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.729> scrap

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
whether they're going to scrap

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.810 
whether they're going to scrap
experimental<00:01:40.290> cinemas<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.770> together<00:01:41.159> or

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
experimental cinemas all together or

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.520 
experimental cinemas all together or
whether<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.600> even<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.290> happen

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
whether this is even going to happen

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.109 
whether this is even going to happen
because<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> nothing's<00:01:44.909> confirmed

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
because this is a nothing's confirmed

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.480 
because this is a nothing's confirmed
yet<00:01:46.640> but<00:01:47.640> judging<00:01:48.360> by<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> positive<00:01:49.490> feedback

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
yet but judging by the positive feedback

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.279 
yet but judging by the positive feedback
that<00:01:50.520> yen's<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.869> devs<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.259> gang

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
that yen's is going the devs of gang

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.730 
that yen's is going the devs of gang
and<00:01:54.420> hopefully<00:01:55.420> this<00:01:55.780> this<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.320> gonna<00:01:56.530> happen

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
and hopefully this this is gonna happen

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.670 
and hopefully this this is gonna happen
because<00:01:57.210> atomic<00:01:58.210> tanking<00:01:58.719> sounds<00:01:59.500> awesome

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
because atomic tanking sounds awesome

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.279 
because atomic tanking sounds awesome
