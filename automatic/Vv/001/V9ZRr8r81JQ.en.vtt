the inner padding of the helmet is

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.789 
the inner padding of the helmet is
already<00:00:10.520> made<00:00:10.879> in<00:00:11.120> the<00:00:11.270> design<00:00:11.420> phase<00:00:11.959> because

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
already made in the design phase because

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.379 
already made in the design phase because
at<00:00:12.950> that<00:00:13.160> stage<00:00:13.490> we<00:00:13.760> determine<00:00:14.269> which

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
at that stage we determine which

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.210 
at that stage we determine which
components<00:00:15.080> will<00:00:15.200> be<00:00:15.230> used<00:00:15.559> in<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:15.889> helmet<00:00:18.220> we

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
components will be used in the helmet we

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.150 
components will be used in the helmet we
basically<00:00:19.640> have<00:00:19.970> three<00:00:20.240> goals<00:00:20.689> to<00:00:20.900> aim<00:00:21.080> for

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
basically have three goals to aim for

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.400 
basically have three goals to aim for
the<00:00:22.160> first<00:00:22.400> one<00:00:22.670> is<00:00:22.970> safety<00:00:23.420> which<00:00:24.140> is<00:00:24.170> the

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
the first one is safety which is the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.769 
the first one is safety which is the
approval<00:00:24.800> goal<00:00:25.189> because<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.119> straps<00:00:26.480> and

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
approval goal because the straps and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.200 
approval goal because the straps and
chin<00:00:27.050> straps<00:00:27.439> are<00:00:27.680> studied<00:00:28.100> by<00:00:28.130> us<00:00:28.519> and<00:00:28.730> are

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
chin straps are studied by us and are

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.179 
chin straps are studied by us and are
