00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.260
 these dear friends today 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.520
 we prepared not 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.170
 our robot has 2 series here we are 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.100
 made a couple of enhancements added 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:33.780
 webcam here it is she connects to 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.879
 sort on yusbi further to camera 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.360
 rotated use stepper 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:47.010
 motor with integrated step reducer 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.720
 the divider is powered by such scarves it 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.449
 drive stepper motor which 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.659
 connected to us to the expansion card to 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.300
 one of the port 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:01.589
 here we have connected 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.640
 ultrasonic distance sensor all 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:10.010
 This we have collected in our firmware 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.010
 controller from mega 128 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.229
 made another small radiator to our 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.690
 the driver did not overheat 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.180
 so about the disassemble we hooked up 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.630
 Wi-Fi device that is Wi-Fi 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:34.200
 adapter that is, it goes with us to our 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:39.050
 network here is norris take we set up online 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.860
 transmission of video pictures with our camera and 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:47.900
 also simple control forward backward 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:54.060
 for our driver, let's turn on 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:59.390
 our fee and see how the robot 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.680
 moving here we connect the battery and 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.550
 through the converter goes to us 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.310
 power on disassemble and expansion card 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:13.920
 now you can figure it out here 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:18.209
 see how it burns goes before boot after 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.730
 turn on our disassemble it automatically 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.870
 goes through the adapter to our wifi 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.190
 The subnet on this computer was 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.360
 access point turned on 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.640
 which it automatically connects 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.000
 that is, no need to live extra 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.490
 no functions I made a conclusion 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.910
 video cleanse ordinary 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.550
 http server that is when opening 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.480
 Browser in our and pi address with us 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.460
 is such a picture on 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.780
 the image twitches on 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.390
 slows down all this is solved 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.450
 by replacing the camera the camera is pretty 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.290
 still old here in parallel I 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.290
 turned on 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:08.600
 our our command line and opened there 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.830
 mini mini com terminal that is, I have 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.470
 access to our expansion card 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.470
 here you can ask a few commands forward 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.810
 back to the left also the firmware was 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.530
 implemented shima function for our 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.720
 engines left-right 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:31.070
 there is a management team here 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.070
 by turning the stepper motor and measuring 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.430
 distances let's take a measurement 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:43.120
 distance to give the command of R. e. 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.769
 and here we give out 14 meters to the arm 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.010
 hand away 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.000
 we spend the same team 38 centimeters 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.260
 that is, the sensor we have quite working 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.350
 here also lizun turn protocol 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.820
 This camera is a stepper motor 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.780
 typing command st 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:10.030
 45 degree rotation angle 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.940
 left and speed here is the camera we have 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:20.440
 turns turns left from 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:24.919
 front and back 45 degrees 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.880
 right turn and speed here's the camera 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.880
 turn back 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:52.890
 so clearance seriously left straight became 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:55.170
 foot stop such movement in subject condition 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.850
 that we are moving batteries like 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.850
 we have never charged 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.790
 there's nothing scary here we can 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.400
 mark the distance also now on 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.880
 state equals infinity so 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.220
 how the beep itself is reflected from 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.930
 surfaces incomprehensible when turning 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.830
 to the right we will see the wall before changeable yes 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.570
 not a distance of 80 centimeters that is 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.390
 There are several drawbacks to this. 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:31.050
 constructions that we use cod 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.930
 sensor here is well a webcam application in 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:38.270
 this case can solve everything with 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:44.700
 pattern recognition so let's 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:48.320
 let's see what's right to the left yes so here 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:51.320
 there we see the picture as she 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.320
 is changing 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.110
 then you can go somewhere meters god
