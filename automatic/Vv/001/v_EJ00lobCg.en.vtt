00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:09.200
 It is a gun plastic that will post a gun plastic production video 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:11.769
 This time, this Assault pack follows from the last time, I will continue the production of this here 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.769
 I think 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:25.610
 Last time this is part of the body part of the assault pack 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:29.600
 It has become such a feeling that we have assembled so this time should be connected to here 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:35.060
 That's a part of it. 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.130
 Large beam saber large beam saber is made to ape likely not appeared in cut 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.190
 I will 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.850
 And this side is a large beam canon 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.730
 Well it is the main equipment of this assault pack 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:52.050
 It has become the largest beam canon of the most important equipment 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:57.060
 So is pasted already seal will Amo in the same way here party the previous 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.050
 Well this blue part is this blue part is the seal and this 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.050
 The big part is this 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:10.440
 It is here here portion is also here. It is part of the blue also put a a seal 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.440
 Then I think that I want to assemble 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.800

 voodoo 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.370
 Hmm 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.900
 Large beam saber and large yun caro 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.900
 It was assembled complete 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.629
 Yup 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.360
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.330
 I thought 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:30.760
 In the part of this assault pack body assembled last time 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.760
 I want to add this lie 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.640
 4 minutes 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.760
 Hmm 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.099
 Hmm 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.099
 Hmm 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.620
 Hmm 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.069
 Huh was fully assembled 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.610
 I am 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.080
 Yup 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:05.360
 It looks cool little key 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.360
 I feel I mean honest word Tsu cool 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:27.330
 After all the length of this update is good- 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.180
 I do also estuary What is when only this that the last assault pack body 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.820
 I wonder how 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:39.140
 It's a whole great impression or a little school 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.550
 In other words there is a little mischief, but it seems that it seems to be a little after toy 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:48.220
 There was such an impression, but this 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:52.580
 After this or a large beam saber if that of the large beam character over the top It is the upper part of this 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.400
 I mean curve on the part of has improved a little balance and clothes 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.060
 Also added a sharp impression softening 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.060
 Quite 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.110
 It's pretty good 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:08.980
 So in such a feel or say that came out when I somehow way of the original assault pack fermentation 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.340
 It became 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.380
 I hope from the way the parentheses above 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.660
 Big 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:23.950
 This after all these two beam sabers 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:28.480
 There is a kind of emperor-like impression, so it's a heavily armed part like that somehow 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.910
 It seems that something that has mobility is also expressed as a good atmosphere 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.630
 think 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.630
 I think that I want to do the assembly here of Assault pack also continue next time 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.530
 Good I
