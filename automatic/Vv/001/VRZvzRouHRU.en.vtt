00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.160
 yet not all greetings a word with you and and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.720
 just the movie that they asked me for 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.880
 of course hair care 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.260
 man will make a reservation right away as probably 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.210
 there will be a lot of questions i don't 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.310
 showing old products because you 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.200
 all this is already seen, I did not show you 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.640
 shampoo natura siberica not showing 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.440
 masks do not mean that they are bad 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.180
 just need a moment did not want a change 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.860
 just by the way it 's all over 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.780
 procedures that you actually now and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.579
 see the result I really like and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.070
 factory what hair is of course an opinion in 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.640
 in fact we would like a state 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.590
 thicker you have in length naturally but that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.180
 what was there a couple of years ago and now it 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.430
 heaven and earth are what you can observe 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.370
 on my head actually it is only 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.309
 the fruit of my labors say such a case 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.210
 I hope that what colors you like and 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.210
 they are interesting 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.630
 sleep my hair needs double 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.430
 nutrition so i will start right from the roots 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.409
 hair for this i will use my 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.900
 favorite jojoba oil 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.000
 from planeta organica 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:23.240
 can be replaced with burdock castor or 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.009
 like olive oil why am I 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.900
 I start rather the bottom of the interrogation tips 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.390
 because it is rather the whole that feeds 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.250
 hair length I put literally small 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.160
 amount evenly distributing it 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.890
 massage the entire head like 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.090
 front and back and then proceed 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.090
 hair tips 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.940
 after all 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.120
 then I start to practice hair length 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.100
 for this I use my bima 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.620
 argan oil from the film doctor 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.510
 organic and very glad that you finally did 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.710
 brought to Norway I love him very much 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.090
 I use for both hair and body 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.130
 I think that you will be interested to know 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.790
 that argan oil is very very him 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.580
 a pistol 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.550
 used by berber women they 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.200
 you used as a moisturizer 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.640
 rejuvenating and restoring 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.770
 means to have won the hearts of women in 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.090
 worldwide for their healing properties from 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.360
 she applied oil to treat 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.220
 sunburn us and other skin 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.739
 diseases curious what modern 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.989
 Studies confirm this opinion 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.330
 the most interesting thing is that argan oil 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.890
 Each has its own kits 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.260
 Moroccan after I applied 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.720
 oil and leave it for an hour and then 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.180
 wash off using shampoo i have in 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.310
 shampoo my two pets 1 shampoo 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.530
 which I really love unfortunately not 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.340
 lighten norway with shampoo activator 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.130
 hair growth 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.350
 thank you so much for sharpening tanya 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.080
 From Moldova further which shampoo it 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.220
 doctor organic is also a series with 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.890
 argan oil 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.830
 this shampoo is more moisturizing and foams 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.690
 he unfortunately does not wash well 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.930
 hair oil is difficult enough 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.739
 I definitely do it in two or even in 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.530
 three stages 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.250
 then wipe my hair with 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.620
 using towels and applying a balm or 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.970
 air conditioning and in other words also from this 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.650
 same company conditioner with argan oil 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.860
 Smell of course he is not the most pleasant 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.329
 but it works well and here it is 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.280
 Means 2 I think that you too 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.100
 unknown 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.440
 there is a thick emerald mask from the planet 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.890
 organics unfortunately this mask is not very 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.090
 effective but for a change I think that 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.090
 Basically he is an Afghan 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.900
 a game 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.439
 I distribute the conditioner over the entire length 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.420
 hair starting somewhere in the middle of course 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.560
 roots I will not touch so original 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.099
 already applied on them 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.920
 oil if i make a mask or wear this 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.689
 air conditioner then this i try not 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.930
 to bring in the mass of the last to recreate 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:16.060
 hair will be very greasy or other 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.440
 the way you can just put very 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.850
 small amount of oil in order 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.280
 so that you do not stick together 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.400
 hair because oil has such 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.550
 property of course reno those further 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:35.740
 full of hair comb distribute 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:38.320
 the balm is washed away and I continue to dry 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.180
 sometimes I will do my hair with a seamstress 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.090
 on but if i felt it like a corpse in kiev 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.660
 claim on tidying up the cold 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.639
 a special nozzle 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.930
 here is my winter hair care and 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.270
