 reduced version of the htc one e mail from 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.189
 which mostly resumes 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.740
 we find aesthetic features 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.439
 in fact the same characterized design 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.330
 from this aluminum body 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.179
 slightly curved brushed aluminum 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.040
 this is the gun metal gray version will be 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.309
 the will also be available 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.050
 blatche silver version were 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.210
 instead obviously reduced 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 hardware features we do not find 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.530
 the hardware present on the htc one and meta 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.480
 but we still find a hardware in 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.180
 able to place this device in the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 We do not have a mid-range market 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.960
 our provision in the packaging of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.030
 original sale but the content will be 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.570
 this we have a charger with 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.520
 usb port a micro usb usb data cable 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.329
 then we have this headset 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.280
 stereo in ear type with the key of 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.229
 answer is obviously also with i 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.200
 interchangeable and then rubber pads 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.560
 the inevitable spillino pin that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.159
 will be used to extract the drawers for the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.380
 micro sd that expands the 16 GB of 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.560
 integrated memory and the one for the sim 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.299
 who is informed nano on the right side 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.180
 let's first turn on the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.710
 telephone via the traviata especially 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.820
 of the place on the upper part where 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.439
 we also find the 3.5 mm audio jack 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.000
 I said on the right side we find the keys 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.590
 for volume adjustment on 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.079
 lower part is the jack il 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.240
 micro usb connector on the left side 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.729
 the only caffettino for the nano yes but 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.130
 while on the back we find 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.200
 the main camera which is from 13 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.570
 megapixel with sensor of it ed 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.149
 f 2.2 aperture able to record 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.340
 video in full hd maximum resolution 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.579
 on the front we find instead 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.590
 a 5 megapixel camera always with 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.689
 bsi sensor capable of recording of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.700
 video also in full hd 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.740
 then we have the two amplified speakers 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.630
 boom sound the brightness sensors e 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.170
 proximity keys function keys are 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.560
 integrated in the integrated display also the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.330
 battery that from 2,100 milliamps 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.970
 we also find on this mini two le 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.630
 classic settings that allow you to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.790
 increase the autonomy we have the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.380
 classic energy savings is present 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.570
 also the savings mode 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.580
 extreme energy that we have 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.220
 also seen on other devices 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.640
 latest htc device allows 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.560
 definitely extend the autonomy 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.620
 going to exclude certain 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.170
 functionality in this in this preview 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.270
 obviously we will briefly look at those 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.430
 which are the characteristics of this 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.100
 phone of course we'll come back with one 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.780
 much more in- depth review 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.350
 coming days 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.370
 let's talk about the display is a 4.5 inches of 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.930
 diagonal with hd resolution then 1280 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.430
 x 720 pixels 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.340
 the dimensions are 130 7.43 for 60 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.380
 5.04 x 10.6 mm thick and the weight is 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.150
 of 137 grams 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.330
 at first glance ergonomics really is 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.370
 very good is good on a htc one e 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.160
 merit obviously more dimensions 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.380
 compact of the mini one make it 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.960
 very comfortable to use with one 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.400
 single hand also the fact that the how 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.860
 rear is made of aluminum 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.370
 so much more slippery makes 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.460
 however the phone is very solid from 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.560
 keep these too in your hands 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.510
 slightly rounded leotards facilitate 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.550
 definitely the grip 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.360
 let's talk a little bit about hardware we have 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:53.320
 a snapdragon processor 400 a quad 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.120
 1.2 gigahertz core with a gigabyte of 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.820
 ram memory while regarding 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.580
 the integrated memory we have as said 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.610
 16gb we can go to expand by 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.880
 an additional 128 gigabytes of these 16 gigabytes 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.100
 about 10.77 are available to us 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.560
 gb so definitely a great one 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.690
 quantity as regards instead 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.930
 the networks we have support at four 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.840
 gsm gprs bands and four-band edge 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.180
 regarding the mps h spa plus 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.479
 with a maximum download speed of 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.070
 42 megabits per second and in upload of 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.190
 5.76 and we also have support for 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.770
 four bands regarding 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.729
 instead the connectivity we have the nfc the 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:40.870
 bluetooth 4.0 the dualband wifi abgne 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.410
 with dlna and htc connect and the micro port 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.350
 usb 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.150
 supports both the mtp protocol and the usb 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.070
 bottom so we could go 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.699
 quietly to attack the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.289
 There is also a GPS antenna 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.849
 assisted with the glonass we also have 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.570
 fm radio 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.949
 regarding the operating system 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.710
 we obviously have Android we go 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:06.280
 right away to see the version it comes 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.759

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.789
 htc sense interface in version 6.0 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:16.150
 we do n't have the ignition gestures 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:18.520
 as provided on the htc one e mail e 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.229
 let's go see the possibilities anyway 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.110
 offers regarding the 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.510
 customization we can of course 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.370
 go and change the theme then 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.780
 choosing from these that are set to 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.849
 our provision 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.889
 the interface we can go to 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.470
 customize with regards to i 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.560
 panels of the screens we can 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.870
 go to enrich with widgets while 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.120
 as for the drawer we have the 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.940
 possibility to order the icons in 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.770

 display the most recent ones first 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.190
 or we can also go to vary 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.340

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.970
 directly via this menu 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.880
