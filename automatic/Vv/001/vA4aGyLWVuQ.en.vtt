would tell it again it comes actually in

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.130 
would tell it again it comes actually in
the<00:03:08.010> article<00:03:08.400> itself<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:09.330> special<00:03:09.990> ability

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
the article itself a special ability

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.530 
the article itself a special ability
bonus<00:03:10.710> boost<00:03:11.010> will<00:03:11.760> basically<00:03:11.940> mean<00:03:12.240> you<00:03:12.390> can

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
bonus boost will basically mean you can

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.600 
bonus boost will basically mean you can
use<00:03:12.870> your<00:03:13.020> basically<00:03:13.860> without<00:03:13.950> regenerate

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
use your basically without regenerate

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.180 
use your basically without regenerate
20%<00:03:15.510> faster<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.710> have<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:16.950> special

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
20% faster if you have the special

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.160 
20% faster if you have the special
edition<00:03:17.610> or<00:03:18.090> Colette's<00:03:18.360> edition<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.960> game

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
edition or Colette's edition of the game

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.560 
edition or Colette's edition of the game
so<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:20.340> base<00:03:20.520> is<00:03:20.550> making<00:03:20.940> single-player<00:03:21.420> a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
so the base is making single-player a

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.840 
so the base is making single-player a
little<00:03:21.780> bit<00:03:21.870> more<00:03:22.050> easier<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.550> special

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
little bit more easier so the special

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.130 
little bit more easier so the special
abilities<00:03:24.210> are<00:03:24.240> basically<00:03:24.690> I'll<00:03:24.930> give<00:03:25.080> an

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
abilities are basically I'll give an

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.610 
abilities are basically I'll give an
example

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
example

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.670

michael is a experts marksman so he's

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.140 
michael is a experts marksman so he's
very<00:03:28.800> good<00:03:29.010> at<00:03:29.130> basically<00:03:29.700> not<00:03:29.820> slow<00:03:30.120> down

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
very good at basically not slow down

this<00:03:47.310> will<00:03:47.490> be<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.790> game<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.270> just<00:03:48.990> a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
this will be in the game so just a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.840 
this will be in the game so just a
features<00:03:49.590> but<00:03:49.740> additional<00:03:50.220> five<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.730> it's
