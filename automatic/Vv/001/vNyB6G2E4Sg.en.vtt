00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.360
 budget smartphone from rim 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.680
 smartphone is made in the best traditions 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.199
 companies look similar to the previous one 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 models on the side we see the familiar keys 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.590
 rewind and pause 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.210
 as well as a shortcut key to 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.940
 camera on the other hand 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.379
 accommodate micro usb connector and familiar 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.410
 many key of which we will talk 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.559
 LED is located behind the back later 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.970
 flash and 3 megapixel camera snapshots 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.829
 which is enough 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.070
 quite good and bright and colorful 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.600
 below the speaker is located above 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.729
 standard headphone jack 35 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.729
 millimeters and screen lock key 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.990
 the name of the course model speaks for 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.420
 the smartphone itself has a slightly curved 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.600
 the form thanks to what easily lays down in 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.600
 a hand 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.140
 if you compare previous 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.190
 or 9360 can be seen as similar and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.590
 various features 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.440
 general view kept back cover true 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.330
 9320 it has a more curved shape for 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.920
 account that the smartphone turned out a little bit 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.160
 thicker than previous model 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.800
 If you look at the width and length 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.540
 smartphones are the same as for 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.030
 controls they are practically 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.960
 identical volume keys 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.930
 and the camera is the same only 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.820
 the difference is having a baby key which 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.820
 in 9360 is missing 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.149
 the key 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.709
 developers lessons slightly modified 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.209
 qwerty keyboard has exactly the same 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.040
 form the only difference is 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.800
 functional 4 keys which 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.500
 located on the side of the trackpad they 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.410
 remind bold 9790 on which we 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.640

 saw three and two megapixels which 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.280
 enough for doing more 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.690
 lower quality video shooting function 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.130
