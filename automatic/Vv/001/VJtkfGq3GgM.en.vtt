okay<00:00:05.830> here<00:00:06.100> i<00:00:06.130> am<00:00:06.340> outside<00:00:06.819> with<00:00:07.060> my<00:00:07.380> rocket

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:08.380 
okay here i am outside with my rocket

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.680 
okay here i am outside with my rocket
stove<00:00:08.710> and<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:10.799> got<00:00:11.799> to<00:00:11.919> tell<00:00:12.070> you<00:00:12.190> this<00:00:12.370> is<00:00:12.580> a<00:00:12.690> at

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
stove and I got to tell you this is a at

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.089 
stove and I got to tell you this is a at
the<00:00:13.839> very<00:00:14.049> least<00:00:14.259> this<00:00:14.559> is<00:00:14.740> a<00:00:14.769> learning

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
the very least this is a learning

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.900 
the very least this is a learning
experience<00:00:17.070> how<00:00:18.070> good<00:00:18.280> a<00:00:18.310> lot<00:00:18.490> to<00:00:18.700> learn<00:00:18.730> about

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
experience how good a lot to learn about

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.540 
experience how good a lot to learn about
this<00:00:19.360> I<00:00:19.660> think<00:00:20.500> it<00:00:20.650> has<00:00:20.769> a<00:00:20.830> lot<00:00:20.949> of<00:00:21.099> potential

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
this I think it has a lot of potential

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.669 
this I think it has a lot of potential
but<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:25.420> can<00:00:25.630> see<00:00:25.810> it<00:00:25.929> full<00:00:26.080> of<00:00:26.140> water<00:00:26.259> pretty

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
but you can see it full of water pretty

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.329 
but you can see it full of water pretty
easy<00:00:26.949> I<00:00:27.390> put<00:00:28.390> this<00:00:28.539> caller<00:00:28.900> around<00:00:29.410> here<00:00:29.740> which

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.339 
easy I put this caller around here which

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.390 
easy I put this caller around here which
is<00:00:30.550> said<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.849> do<00:00:31.150> and<00:00:31.449> that<00:00:32.349> like<00:00:32.830> triple<00:00:33.370> the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
is said to do and that like triple the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.260 
is said to do and that like triple the
boil<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:36.610> really<00:00:36.850> made<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.030> big<00:00:37.120> difference

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
boil it really made a big difference

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.000 
boil it really made a big difference
because<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.870> heat<00:00:38.020> is<00:00:38.200> coming<00:00:38.350> up<00:00:38.620> around<00:00:38.800> the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
because the heat is coming up around the

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.800 
because the heat is coming up around the
pot<00:00:39.280> what<00:00:39.670> was<00:00:39.850> just<00:00:40.030> kind<00:00:40.210> of<00:00:40.270> coming<00:00:40.570> up<00:00:40.660> on

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
pot what was just kind of coming up on

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.630 
pot what was just kind of coming up on
the<00:00:40.900> wind<00:00:41.110> as<00:00:41.650> you<00:00:41.830> can<00:00:41.980> see<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.220> pretty<00:00:42.490> good

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
the wind as you can see the pretty good

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.700 
the wind as you can see the pretty good
wind<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.690> wind<00:00:43.900> was<00:00:44.050> carrying<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.560> heat

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
wind the wind was carrying the heat

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.550 
wind the wind was carrying the heat
right<00:00:44.920> off<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.510> second<00:00:46.900> thing<00:00:47.050> i<00:00:47.140> found<00:00:47.350> out

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
right off the second thing i found out

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.230 
right off the second thing i found out
that<00:00:47.620> this<00:00:47.920> doesn't<00:00:48.220> really<00:00:48.580> perform<00:00:49.060> that

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
that this doesn't really perform that

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.550 
that this doesn't really perform that
great<00:00:49.540> until<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:51.040> inner<00:00:51.310> chimney<00:00:51.820> gets<00:00:52.090> hot

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
great until the inner chimney gets hot

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.470 
great until the inner chimney gets hot
and<00:00:53.560> then<00:00:53.950> once<00:00:54.280> that<00:00:54.400> gets<00:00:54.670> hot<00:00:54.940> it<00:00:55.210> seems

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
and then once that gets hot it seems

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.460 
and then once that gets hot it seems
that<00:00:55.690> draw<00:00:56.470> a<00:00:56.500> lot<00:00:56.800> better<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:58.320> produce<00:00:59.320> a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
that draw a lot better and I produce a

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.030 
that draw a lot better and I produce a
lot<00:00:59.650> more<00:00:59.680> heat<00:01:00.450> so<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.260> pretty<00:01:05.379> frugal<00:01:05.770> on

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
lot more heat so it's a pretty frugal on

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.730 
lot more heat so it's a pretty frugal on
fuel<00:01:06.340> once<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:06.760> figure<00:01:07.090> it<00:01:07.240> out<00:01:07.390> but<00:01:07.750> it's<00:01:08.679> a

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
fuel once you figure it out but it's a

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.760 
fuel once you figure it out but it's a
little<00:01:08.920> finicky<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.549> get<00:01:09.700> started<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.770> get

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
little finicky to get started and get

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.789 
little finicky to get started and get
going<00:01:12.539> it's<00:01:13.539> this<00:01:13.689> obvious<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.409> can<00:01:14.590> see

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
going it's this obvious so you can see

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:22.289 
going it's this obvious so you can see
we're<00:01:14.979> up<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.340> man<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.939> uh<00:01:20.310> still<00:01:21.310> not<00:01:21.579> and

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
we're up to man it's uh still not and

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.819 
we're up to man it's uh still not and
I'm<00:01:22.450> sure<00:01:22.749> that<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:23.020> haven't<00:01:23.289> got<00:01:23.439> to<00:01:23.619> built

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
I'm sure that I haven't got to built

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.950 
I'm sure that I haven't got to built
exactly<00:01:24.070> right<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.850> still<00:01:28.149> not<00:01:28.329> performing

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
exactly right it's still not performing

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.590 
exactly right it's still not performing
like<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.320> one<00:01:29.499> in<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.770> program<00:01:30.490> but<00:01:30.759> on

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
like the one in the program but on

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.819 
like the one in the program but on
youtube<00:01:32.200> but<00:01:33.359> i'm<00:01:34.359> pretty<00:01:34.689> sure<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.590> air

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
youtube but i'm pretty sure that the air

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.800 
youtube but i'm pretty sure that the air
temperature<00:01:36.219> how<00:01:36.819> much<00:01:36.999> wind<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.390> have<00:01:37.569> and

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
temperature how much wind you have and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.230 
temperature how much wind you have and
more<00:01:38.499> than<00:01:38.799> anything<00:01:39.039> the<00:01:39.340> quality<00:01:39.939> of<00:01:39.969> your

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
more than anything the quality of your

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.260 
more than anything the quality of your
wood<00:01:40.539> has<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:40.869> big<00:01:41.319> thing<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.219> do<00:01:42.369> with<00:01:42.520> us<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:42.969> i

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
wood has a big thing to do with us and i

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.870 
wood has a big thing to do with us and i
don't<00:01:43.479> have<00:01:43.539> very<00:01:43.840> good<00:01:43.960> wood<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.670> wood<00:01:45.700> i

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
don't have very good wood the wood i

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.730 
don't have very good wood the wood i
have<00:01:46.149> here<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.539> kind<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.869> crappy<00:01:47.079> and<00:01:47.439> it's<00:01:47.560> not

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
have here is kind of crappy and it's not

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.980 
have here is kind of crappy and it's not
real<00:01:47.979> high<00:01:48.189> and<00:01:48.219> BTW<00:01:48.670> use<00:01:48.909> and<00:01:49.270> everything

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
real high and BTW use and everything

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.330 
real high and BTW use and everything
around<00:01:50.109> me<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.409> wet<00:01:50.679> because<00:01:51.009> it's<00:01:51.189> been

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
around me is wet because it's been

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.700 
around me is wet because it's been
raining<00:01:51.609> for<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.999> last<00:01:52.210> couple<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.659> days<00:01:52.840> but

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
raining for the last couple of days but

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.669 
raining for the last couple of days but
for<00:01:54.520> an<00:01:54.609> initial<00:01:54.880> test<00:01:55.389> just<00:01:55.719> trying<00:01:56.049> it<00:01:56.200> out<00:01:56.350> I

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
for an initial test just trying it out I

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.249 
for an initial test just trying it out I
think<00:01:59.679> it's<00:01:59.799> pretty<00:01:59.979> good<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:01.659> once<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:02.020> take

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
think it's pretty good see once I take

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.069 
think it's pretty good see once I take
that<00:02:02.409> screen<00:02:02.799> off<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:04.149> windscreen<00:02:04.450> off<00:02:04.780> it's

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
that screen off the windscreen off it's

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.990 
that screen off the windscreen off it's
not<00:02:05.439> that<00:02:05.709> good<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.130> oil<00:02:06.399> but

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.280 

you<00:02:11.000> can<00:02:11.150> see<00:02:11.360> once<00:02:11.569> I<00:02:11.720> put<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.930> screen

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
you can see once I put the screen

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.839 
you can see once I put the screen
background<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.040> boil<00:02:13.220> comes<00:02:13.489> right<00:02:13.670> back

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
background it to boil comes right back

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.940 
background it to boil comes right back
up<00:02:13.910> again<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.200> don't<00:02:15.349> even<00:02:15.410> have<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:15.800> much

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
up again and I don't even have that much

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.920 
up again and I don't even have that much

half as big again and we'll give that a

another thing i've discovered is i don't
have<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:06.380> built<00:03:06.680> quite<00:03:06.920> right<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.490> should<00:03:07.760> go

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
have this built quite right it should go

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.260 
have this built quite right it should go
right<00:03:08.360> straight<00:03:09.320> in<00:03:09.770> and<00:03:10.010> then<00:03:10.460> make<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.700> sharp

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
right straight in and then make a sharp

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.320 
right straight in and then make a sharp
90-degree<00:03:12.050> time<00:03:12.350> unfortunately<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.880> elbow

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
90-degree time unfortunately this elbow

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.270 
90-degree time unfortunately this elbow
that<00:03:14.510> i<00:03:14.660> have<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.020> stove<00:03:15.290> three-inch<00:03:16.010> stove

pipe elbow makes a long smooth sweep and

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.010 
pipe elbow makes a long smooth sweep and
i<00:03:19.550> found<00:03:19.880> my<00:03:20.000> playing<00:03:20.300> around<00:03:20.540> here<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:20.930> if

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
i found my playing around here that if

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.080 
i found my playing around here that if
they<00:03:21.110> went<00:03:21.290> right<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.650> like<00:03:22.340> they<00:03:22.520> told<00:03:22.790> me<00:03:22.970> on

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
they went right in like they told me on

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.820 
they went right in like they told me on
the<00:03:23.209> video<00:03:23.480> i<00:03:23.540> went<00:03:23.810> right<00:03:24.080> straight<00:03:24.110> in<00:03:24.620> and

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
the video i went right straight in and

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.910 
the video i went right straight in and
then<00:03:24.920> made<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.130> square<00:03:25.550> 90-degree<00:03:25.820> turn<00:03:26.920> it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
then made a square 90-degree turn it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.370 
then made a square 90-degree turn it
would<00:03:28.100> burn<00:03:28.280> much<00:03:28.580> better<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.180> i<00:03:29.780> also<00:03:29.959> need

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
would burn much better and i also need

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.100 
would burn much better and i also need
to<00:03:30.650> extend<00:03:31.520> this<00:03:31.790> played<00:03:32.150> out<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.630> i<00:03:32.720> can<00:03:32.870> set

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
to extend this played out so i can set

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.750 
to extend this played out so i can set
the<00:03:33.260> wood<00:03:33.410> here<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.709> slide<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.340> if

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
the wood here and slide it in if

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.490 
the wood here and slide it in if
anything<00:03:35.209> has<00:03:35.360> a<00:03:35.390> plate<00:03:35.660> up<00:03:35.900> on<00:03:36.080> a<00:03:36.110> little<00:03:36.320> bit

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
anything has a plate up on a little bit

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.740 
anything has a plate up on a little bit
of<00:03:36.590> an<00:03:36.680> angle<00:03:36.860> so<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.520> wood<00:03:37.880> can't<00:03:38.150> slide<00:03:38.480> back

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
of an angle so the wood can't slide back

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.960 
of an angle so the wood can't slide back

on it for now after about an hour of
tweaking<00:03:48.709> things<00:03:49.100> I've<00:03:49.940> got<00:03:50.209> basically<00:03:50.930> no

damp maple and beach limbs that I broke

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.670 
damp maple and beach limbs that I broke
off<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:04.030> I'm<00:04:05.030> not<00:04:05.209> very<00:04:05.450> good<00:04:05.570> at<00:04:05.780> all<00:04:06.049> but

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
off that I'm not very good at all but

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.500 
off that I'm not very good at all but
once<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:07.070> get<00:04:07.190> this<00:04:07.370> thing<00:04:07.610> figured<00:04:07.880> out<00:04:08.150> get

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
once you get this thing figured out get

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.250 
once you get this thing figured out get
it<00:04:08.600> up<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.750> speed<00:04:09.070> it's<00:04:10.570> unbelievably<00:04:11.570> frugal

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
it up to speed it's unbelievably frugal

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.690 
it up to speed it's unbelievably frugal
it's<00:04:12.860> just<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:15.110> takes<00:04:15.530> almost<00:04:15.799> nothing<00:04:16.400> to

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
it's just it takes almost nothing to

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.820 
it's just it takes almost nothing to
boil<00:04:16.910> water<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.570> these<00:04:18.140> sticks<00:04:18.440> right<00:04:18.620> here

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
boil water and these sticks right here

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.400 
boil water and these sticks right here
were<00:04:18.890> probably<00:04:19.130> last<00:04:19.700> oh<00:04:20.030> cool<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.140> an<00:04:21.260> hour

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
were probably last oh cool so an hour

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.770 
were probably last oh cool so an hour
just<00:04:21.650> these<00:04:22.340> sticks<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:22.970> have<00:04:23.150> stuffed<00:04:23.570> in

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
just these sticks that I have stuffed in

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.900 
just these sticks that I have stuffed in
here<00:04:24.760> is<00:04:25.760> just<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.090> handful<00:04:26.450> of<00:04:26.510> sticks

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
here is just a handful of sticks

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.480 
here is just a handful of sticks
amazingly<00:04:28.910> efficient<00:04:32.260> so<00:04:33.260> that's<00:04:34.160> where<00:04:34.370> I<00:04:34.400> am

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
amazingly efficient so that's where I am

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.420 
amazingly efficient so that's where I am
right<00:04:34.640> now<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.800> far<00:04:36.830> I'm<00:04:37.190> pretty

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
right now and so far I'm pretty

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.650
