00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:01.519
 Everson 

00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:04.519
 Angolans and in the media where today the subject is 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.390
 gift buti 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.810
 I want to do an adult machine operating system installation or 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.159
 either it already has a machine with windows vista 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.169
 and that tension increased by 7 in that machine too 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.859
 and the moment I start the one that gives you option in the menu until choosing 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.449
 between the previous operating system or new operating system 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.640
 this last one 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.660
 two systems appeals in the machine possibility to choose between one of them 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.540
 The moment I switch on the computer 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.570
 I have here today 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.960
 death to pc 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.500
 or going to the system 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.800
 this machine 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.640
 it's 2 o'clock 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.880
 I'll go in here 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.630
 right on the computer 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.630
 to manage 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 want to measure says 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.240
 I'm with two records here, where are you? 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.940
 the english said elbaradei 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 another note is running windows 7 this procedure too 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.450
 can be assembled with hds pride has a partition if two points with view to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.320
 another part is almost that Libyan would say 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.180
 to convene a second operating system 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.800
 whenever you went run this visit grandson 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.280
 it is interesting that you first have an older operating system 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.370
 after a new pressure 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.000
 as an example, 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.860
 You can do what we want. 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.490
 and I'll be studying 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.450
 the view today has a goal the system is 2003 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.920
 being the first older operating system and can have a high price 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 one more stocking 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.390
 I'm going to put the windows 7 server on the machine and I'm going to start the computer 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.440
 account that has already been seen in the machine 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.630
 restart the computer 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 Little triggered that until the police officer followed dvds 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.199
 he is missing out here the windows 7 installer 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.720
 the dream of a distortion that in the Portuguese case 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.949
 I will not leave 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:29.219
 he asks me if I want repaired that he has caused something is just the idol 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.219
 I chose to install now 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.109
 in the defensive sector 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.299
 until then the procedure is the same 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.079
 of the installation of a Hindu kush 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.409
 I'm a machine 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.409
 custom score move forward 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.709
 and this moment is a critical moment 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.799
 because in this disk 0 was found in one of the texts of view 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.399
 I want to be there in the new windows according to bbc 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.770
 in the case of childbirth are those who have the option between the two factions here 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.770
 the country can search and speeches 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.189
 advance 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.329
 and I will wait while this installation procedure concludes 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.289
 so stop after the windows installation process 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:33.279
 was created a menu with but that windows 7 and nor of the visas 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.009
 at other times less well 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.569
 the elder is type older version of windows but 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.569
 the inhospitable automatic teaching 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.950
 so it's along with the website 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.249
 this shows that consumption in the middle now 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.509
 to close 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.829
 I took it from my computer 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.829
 property 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.829
 the chosen and advanced system settings 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.440
 and started here in relation to the recovery 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.979
 I'll then go to Settings 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.719
 and you have the one who chose this is a standard operation 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:25.849
 this system ocb 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.509
 in my case I have windows 7 and windows vista is a system that we call 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.139
 the santinha does not choose any system that will rise with the standard 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.610
 and here I like about the time it's really going to stay is that after running 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.129
 the system or the father 30 seconds 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.889
 I will have here in the configuration of the cocada and seconds as the pattern of use of the 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:44.809
 system 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:47.809
 - I spoke with the standard windows 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.080
 had no choice the standard and sobis 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.400
 I'm going to stop 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.900
 to manipulate the machine for you to change this configuration the menu 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.979
 and that is also if another operating system vista was already in the machine 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.839
 still working normally without any problem 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:08.839
 then they will start machine 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.430
 it's the machine called again 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.770
 hehe the cubist note menu mostly time now has 7 6 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.180
 This is a Chinese I had here I can 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.529
 use 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.119
 choose the option or windows 7 that the new installed calculations are on 

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:34.159
 looking at that pillow 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.159
 I did not lose any information about the toronto system 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:53.600
 so stop 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.699
 abidjan where new riot 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.050
 ie with a computer with only two systems operates with operations of all 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.070
 the insight 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.710
 river - said 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.539
 I hope you like 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.220
 and this and another 20 years 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.360
 you'll see on the website 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.719
 teacher years 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:10.269
