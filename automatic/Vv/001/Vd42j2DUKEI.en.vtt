00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.759
 Y 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.439
 Now I'm shouting from engadget and I'm in 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.290
 direct from new york to teach you 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.719
 the new galaxy s 4 finally we have it 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.740
 in our hands before moving on to 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.320
 show you some of the benefits 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.360
 new that brings interface level I'll 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 to talk a little about design as 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.429
 you can see his drawing is pretty 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.570
 similar to the galaxy s3 in fact they have it 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.420
 here next to us so we can 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.750
 compare how you see are very very very 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.110
 obviously similar in this case the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.539
 something bigger screen of the s 4 and the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.670
 Back skirt is more straight than in the s 3 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.940
 that is noticeable as it is more is curved by 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.760
 the back part 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.890
 its thickness is 79 mm we are talking 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.219
 of a 130 gram terminal is more 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.289
 light that the s 3 so and as I said 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.329
 its screen is 5 inches with 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:58.699
 full resolution hd its density is 441 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.910
 pixels per inch the truth that you see 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:06.280
 very well the contrast 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.280
 and the vividness of colors is very good 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.570
 we have the level screen right now 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.729
 medium brightness so you can 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.110
 appreciate better in the camera and in 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.110
 photos that I will also be shown 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.509
 here at the bottom has its 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.149
 already traditional physical button in the center 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.619
 and with two touch buttons that 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.679
 illuminate by touching them also with 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.899
 arctic feedback and from 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.230
 options and the return 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.450
 necessarily on that subject 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.880
 in the back his camera that like 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.740
 you know now it's 13 megapixels with 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.100
 flash included in your part in your area 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.850
 bottom and the company logo here 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.680
 down a speaker here on the side 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.760
 we meet again with the button 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.760
 ignition or blocking 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.430
 and at the top we have the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.820
 3.5 mm connector and the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.760
 microphone 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.410
 its lower tone the usb port 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.710
 and in the left area we have the 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.850
 volume controls 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.850
 I will teach it 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.520
 and you can see the button for example 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.160
 Ignition of the galaxy s3 in the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.590
 galaxy s 4 case is more elongated and 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.400
 something more discreet hides much better 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.349
 in the profile of the terminal 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.970
 as for the technical characteristics 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.769
 Well, we are talking about a terminal that 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.010
 it is depending on the market it will take 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:39.560
 qualcomm quad core processor is at one 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:44.329
 with 9 or you will vote for the samsung exynos 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.329
 auto core carries 2 gigs of ram 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.400
 and as you can see, it answers really well and it 's 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.930
 very good screen and the menus go very 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.280
 fluid takes android driving and its 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.920
 front camera that we have told you is from 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.260
 2 megapixels also has support for 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.880
 networks and then well all the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.140
 connectivities that we already expect in this 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.770
 kind of smartphone like wifi nfc 40 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.770
 etc 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.020
 in terms of its memory capabilities 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.180
 also carries 16 32 or 64 gigas capable 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.300
 to be expanded through cards 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.300
 micro SD 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.340
 as for the new features 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.030
 that incorporates for example I'm going to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.750
 teach 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.750
 then here 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.180
 let's go to the image gallery we just 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.530
 to take a few pictures because no 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.530
 there was none loaded in the terminal 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.320
 if we leave the finger on the envelope 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.040
 gallery we see that we can have a 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:56.260
 preview of the contents of 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.260
 again there you can see how it opens 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.900
 and here would be all the photos that 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.879
 are contained in this folder 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.349
 Another benefit rather 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.709
 curious when reproducing a 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.299
 video as you know now the phone is 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.040
 able to detect when we are looking 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.439
 towards the screen or when we remove the 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.670
 view so that it can be 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.680
 playing the video at the moment in 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.199
 that we remove the view the video stops 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.609
 you will not be able to see me doing this 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.800
 obviously active because I'm behind 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.810
 from the camera but we have tested it and the 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.289
 truth that works quite well 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.449
 answer is a second would say second 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.220
 and medium and effectively at the time 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.350
 that we turn our heads or look towards 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.789
 another site but to the screen the 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.789
 playback of the video stops 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.729
 Let's try to see if we come out with 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.730
 the camera through 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.260
 but why 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.260
 Right now I'm looking at the screen 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.990
 and if you look the other way as you can 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.390
 see the image has stopped 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.630
 I return to remove the screen and now 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.580
 should be reinitiated effectively 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.630
 reproduction of the video the truth that 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.630
 it works really well 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.379
 I have looked back down 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:21.999
 and now again 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:23.159
 and already finishing as you know the function 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:27.209
 camera have also been introduced 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:29.919
 enough changes and curious news 

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:31.929
 we can obviously teach all 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.929
 but for example if I can you here 

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:37.059
 show here you can see me the function 

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:39.099
 dual camera with which we can use 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:40.959
 at the same time both the rear camera 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.679
 like the front camera so that 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:47.439
 we have a view of both captures here 

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:50.259
 you can see me in the small box 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:53.519
 while what is recorded is recorded 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.519
 in front of me right now 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.870
 you already know what to bring the interface 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.370
 own touchwiz of the house so do not you 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.080
 you will carry great surprises and you are already 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.539
 We samsung terminal users will 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.229
 see how we always do the version of 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.229
 android wearing 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:20.909
 here you can see the version exactly 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:23.099
 the 4.2.2 really stress has always 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.409
 gone pretty fluid so there's already the 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.050
 height is difficult to notice a difference 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:30.750
 important regarding the fluidity between 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.060
 a terminal and another but good the truth 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.199
 that the s4 respond really well and to 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.930
 less in this first contact 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:39.599
 the feeling is very very very positive 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.879
 it is also very very light very manageable 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:45.090
 and even though it has a screen of 5 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:47.009
 inch is not especially great 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.080
 in the hand or uncomfortable to grab but 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.000
 quite the opposite perhaps also for their 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.860
 corners that are very rounded and that 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.860
 It helps a lot that the grip is more 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.439
 comfortable 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.889
 so well then this would be a first 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:04.569
 look at the new galaxy s 4 from samsung and 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.569
 greetings from new york
