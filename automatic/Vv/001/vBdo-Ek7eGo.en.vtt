00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.840
 and we have to go up and move on 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.840
 full speed ahead 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.879
 Uncle Kuzya 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:49.949
 I do not believe my eyes for us fish lich 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:49.949 --> 00:01:00.660
 no wonder this flying fish well 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:03.239
 does it happen it happens these fish have chosen 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.550
 imagine such a way of salvation from predators 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.820
 when underwater they begin to pursue 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.160
 enemy they swim surface work 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.860
 tail like a propeller jump out of 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.210
 waters spread long fins like 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.380
 wings and fly can rise above the water 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.080
 on 67 meters 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.470
 fly forward fifty meters and 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.039
 fair wind and more I want 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.039
 look at them from the top we take off fly off 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.570
 Well, the fish are small birds before you jump to us 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.900
 wow you jumped alone 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.409
 almost grabbed her and birds of prey 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.150
 very often the same frigates 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.530
 do not mind to fly a fly 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.360
 it comes from underwater hunters 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.490
 saved and the surface gets there and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.049
 so uncle kuzi 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:10.259
 I'm talking about these fishes, because compose a poem 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:15.329
 listen to life anything happens 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.380
 it's true I do not sleep over the shafts of fish 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:22.010
 a flock of pipe waving flying 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.010
 flippers ship
