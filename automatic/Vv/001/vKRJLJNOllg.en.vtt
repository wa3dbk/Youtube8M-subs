00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:05.150
 what is it so crop in fact 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.670
 is an add-on that allows you to see 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.830
 when you are in a real or what 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.920
 it's a nadal that allows you to 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:18.920
 provide the statistics of it 2 of 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.049
 dps gains is from play that's why 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.640
 and here is to share with you 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.240
 players what they did as 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.250
 case so here it is very is enough 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:36.140
 practice we will say so here I am 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.140
 do it download 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.380
 here I download so I hope 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.580
 frankly that's okay the market because 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:57.840
 that I'm not sure the was not on the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:02:01.830
 version 53.20 in fact here is crytek 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:07.110
 have extracted so yes it will take to 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.520
 beforehand it will be necessary yes the var where its 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:16.590
 came ending in August is a 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:19.110
 extraction software and that's so who 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.390
 the largades so then you go 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:27.030
 in your game folder for me c 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.820
 r quick I want a status meets you 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.440
 go in add-on interface and you 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.300
 simply drag the file to 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.930
 inside haddon not in a 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.480
 folder in adonent 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.110
 once you've done it 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.350
 just have to start the game and is 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.370
 so that's it so I'll start the game 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.030
 I hope in any case that you will see 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.690
 I normally mine windowed mode 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.810
 so yes you will be able to see 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.989
 logically 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.100
 finally if it works what because I 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.100
 problems with karkwa and that 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.880
 moment I do not know what's going on 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.500
 luckily I want to do it once 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.500
 so that's the right lens 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.130
 here and launch you little world of 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.130
 warcraft 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.610
 I just do not want to do it myself 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:45.310
 mean I want to pause but in 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:49.080
 do not here I connect it the little 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.630
 bug because I'm filming here after 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.860
 when you go to your screen of 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.650
 character you go in to dulles 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.600
 and there if it is outdated you if you 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.850
 check laden launched if the mark is 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.170
 expired you click on launch the 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:11.470
 old calls click ok and after 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.280
 normally low it's good here it is 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.000

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.670
 what I want to do what I do a 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.160
 every little pause in the video and I 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.450
 found when the load is 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.680
 finished because it takes a little bit of 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.680
 time since I filmed it at he said 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:38.969
 so here it is afterwards when we see 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.180

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:49.909
