00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.349
 I'm here to teach to taste a pisco 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.900
 how to appreciate all the 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.900
 characteristics that has a good pisco 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.759
 and equally good to know how to differentiate it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.670
 of a pisco that is not well prepared 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:32.210
 let's start with a pure character 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.150
 we have eight fishing grapes 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.570
 crushes black creole sea ​​bass 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.000
 italy during the villa and muscat and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.700
 when we make a record with only one 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.610
 grape is called pure pisco then we have 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.100
 the wide sides that are the mixture of 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.640
 two up or more here we have a chulada 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 quebranta italy and toronto este pisco 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.990
 it also has the other category of being 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.240
 one green chola or musts which is the 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.180
 third type of pisco which is the one that 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.379
 made with musts that did not finish 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.570
 fermentation 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.700
 the main difference is that if for 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.189
 this pisco I need for a 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.310

 It must be absolutely colorless 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.170
 transparent and bright the pisco is a 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.270
 liquid diamond what are we going to 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.970

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.430
 typical of this grape which is what 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.260
 big we take in the nose 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.350
 the first one that comes out is the presence of 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.450
 alcohol that must be so but also already 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.810
