00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.010
 hello how about a Thursday more than I'm with 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.889
 you many thanks for mexicana 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.070
 released today in today's life I'm going to 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.100
 show how to make some easy and more 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.439
 bars that are going to energy and not 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.570
 you have to go buying bars that 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.669
 you do not know how they know or what they are 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.369
 good or if they are very hard or very soft 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.040
 because we do not do our own 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.410
 own energy bars and thanks to 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.590
 have one of our subscribers by 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.770
 It's a great idea if you want to see how 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:47.830
 we make these delicious bars 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.830
 of sesame that accessing this video 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:57.190
 bear blood and the ingredients that 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.860
 we are going to need are a cup of 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.720
 sesame seeds one teaspoon cinnamon 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.920
 grind a little salt and half a cup 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.860
 of honey 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.189
 The first thing we are going to do is all 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.610
 our sesame seeds on fire 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.610
 medium 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.220
 and when you see that they are starting to get 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.590
 a little coffee 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.400
 and they start like when the thunder and 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.560
 to give them away from the fire now what 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.020
 We put in another container because 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.409
 we need the pan to heat the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.359
 honey 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:53.670
 now let's warm our honey 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.670
 We heat our honey to very low heat 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.170
 and we add the little bit of salt is 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.450
 almost nothing just a little 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.900
 and now we are going to add a 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.420
 teaspoon ground cinnamon here I do not 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.770
 I am using the measure but more or less 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.770
 I'm calculating 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.950
 and now that we're already mixing cinnamon and 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.800
 salt and our honey has already started to come out 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.130
 you are little bubbles now we add the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.130
 sesame 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.469
 and we mix very very well 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.950
 and we're going to continue stirring until 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.129
 that we see that our honey and our 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.819
 sesame seeds have already been incorporated very well and 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:52.340
 they are already very friendly another option that you 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.180
 you can do is add seeds of 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.549
 chia or peeled pumpkin seeds 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.549
 clear or flaxseed 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.890
 would be terrific okay 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.080
 Now we have already removed it from the fire because 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.830
 does a little head and honey 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.410
 sesame everything is already well incorporated 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.550
 we 're going to let it cool down like 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.650
 five or seven minutes so that it is not 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.780
 very cold but there is a temperature 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.110
 that we will be able to roll it in 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.830
 our little papers of these and so we do not 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.080
 let's burn 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.940
 but we can not leave much 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.250
 time because then we are made 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.040
 hard 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.250
 we're going to need some little squares of 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.090
 waxed paper and let's start putting 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.489
 the sesame on paper 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:53.239
 since we have it on paper we're going to 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.239
 roll up as if it were a sweet 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.290
 another option that we can do is what 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:21.420
 you can do as well in taquitos like this or 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:25.310
 little balls or in sweeties this other option 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.710
 it's super easy we wait for it to cool 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.690
 so as not to burn us as I told you and 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.790
 let's start to mold our 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.790
 sesame seeds in a 4 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.710
 and now that it's already cold we cut it with 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.710
 a knife 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.729
 and that's how easy it is and our 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.599
 bars 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.599
 of sesame 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.250
 bars apart from the high energy 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.639
 will help you fight stress 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.240
 depression and fatigue 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.190
 I think I need a britta bar 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.830
 so if you need a little push 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.129
 to go to the gym to go jogging at 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.189
 park then to eat them a bar 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:37.470
 when we finished doing them if not 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:39.720
 we have seen them on paper 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.820
 I prefer to keep them in a container 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.820
 as well as glass like this 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.660
 and we cover 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.320
 of the email 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.199
 very good 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:08.930
 it's like this the avenue of I hope that you 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.080
