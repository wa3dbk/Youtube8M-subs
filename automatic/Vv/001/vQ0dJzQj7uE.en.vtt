to the D string the second string it's
the<00:04:36.240> same<00:04:36.479> mapping<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.139> notes<00:04:37.380> but<00:04:37.620> it's<00:04:37.740> just

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
the same mapping of notes but it's just

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.010 
the same mapping of notes but it's just
been<00:04:38.039> shifted<00:04:38.490> up<00:04:38.610> two<00:04:38.850> frets<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.449> means

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
been shifted up two frets that means

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.200 
been shifted up two frets that means
it's<00:04:40.229> an<00:04:40.350> octave<00:04:40.770> higher<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:41.280> now<00:04:42.000> we're<00:04:42.120> going

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
it's an octave higher so now we're going

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.490 
it's an octave higher so now we're going
to<00:04:42.270> quickly<00:04:42.539> show<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:42.870> something<00:04:43.289> else<00:04:43.440> you

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500

to quickly show you something else you
can<00:04:43.680> do<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:43.919> it'll<00:04:44.070> create<00:04:44.370> a<00:04:44.460> little<00:04:44.639> more

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729
