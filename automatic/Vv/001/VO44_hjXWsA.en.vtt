00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
and the print X machine has evolved

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.330 
and the print X machine has evolved
rather<00:00:33.540> nicely<00:00:33.870> there<00:00:34.530> were<00:00:34.649> four<00:00:34.890> engineers

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
rather nicely there were four engineers

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.760 
rather nicely there were four engineers
that<00:00:35.700> started<00:00:36.239> print<00:00:36.540> x<00:00:36.780> after<00:00:37.530> leaving

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that started print x after leaving

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.490 
that started print x after leaving
Anatol<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.760> these<00:00:39.540> four<00:00:39.780> engineers<00:00:40.260> got

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
Anatol and these four engineers got

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.990 
Anatol and these four engineers got
together<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.129> they<00:00:41.340> didn't<00:00:41.550> want<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> just

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
together and they didn't want to just

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
together and they didn't want to just
produce<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.480> blue<00:00:42.750> Anatol<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.010> their

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
produce a blue Anatol so there their

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.869 
produce a blue Anatol so there their
thought<00:00:44.610> pattern<00:00:45.000> were<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.809> develop<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
thought pattern were to develop a

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.190 
thought pattern were to develop a
printhead<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.690> more<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.989> an

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
printhead that would be more of an

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.680 
printhead that would be more of an
American<00:00:49.860> style<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.210> their<00:00:51.449> words

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
American style and that's their words

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.439 
American style and that's their words
American<00:00:52.050> style<00:00:52.620> printhead<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.520> not<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
American style printhead so not just the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.810 
American style printhead so not just the
printhead<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.170> also<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.620> pallet<00:00:55.980> system<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
printhead but also the pallet system so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
printhead but also the pallet system so
