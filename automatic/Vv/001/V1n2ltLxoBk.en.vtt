00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
rise came out it could be fake it could

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.140 
rise came out it could be fake it could
be<00:00:38.960> real<00:00:39.430> again<00:00:40.430> there's<00:00:40.610> no<00:00:40.670> way<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.940> prove<00:00:41.090> it

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
be real again there's no way to prove it

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.610 
be real again there's no way to prove it
unless<00:00:41.420> there's<00:00:41.660> actual<00:00:41.990> gameplay<00:00:42.230> being

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
unless there's actual gameplay being

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.200 
unless there's actual gameplay being
shown<00:00:42.890> which<00:00:43.100> nobody<00:00:43.430> wants<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.910> do<00:00:44.030> the

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
shown which nobody wants to do the

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.730 
shown which nobody wants to do the
people<00:00:44.330> who<00:00:44.630> actually<00:00:44.870> have<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.380> gameplay

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
people who actually have the gameplay

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.800 
people who actually have the gameplay
because<00:00:46.700> they<00:00:47.240> don't<00:00:47.420> want<00:00:47.540> to<00:00:47.600> get<00:00:47.690> their

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
because they don't want to get their

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.090 
because they don't want to get their
channel<00:00:48.110> band<00:00:48.320> or<00:00:48.530> their<00:00:48.680> channel<00:00:48.980> get<00:00:49.070> a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
channel band or their channel get a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.740 
channel band or their channel get a
strike<00:00:49.370> stuff<00:00:49.610> like<00:00:49.730> that<00:00:49.760> etc<00:00:50.030> a<00:00:50.330> lot<00:00:50.660> of

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
strike stuff like that etc a lot of

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.690 
strike stuff like that etc a lot of
reasons<00:00:51.050> but<00:00:51.110> basically<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.220> reason<00:00:52.400> I<00:00:52.550> think

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
reasons but basically the reason I think

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.580 
reasons but basically the reason I think
this<00:00:52.880> has<00:00:53.060> some<00:00:53.270> credibility<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:54.020> because<00:00:54.350> the

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
this has some credibility is because the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.460 
this has some credibility is because the
person<00:00:54.800> who<00:00:55.220> uploaded<00:00:55.460> this<00:00:56.260> this<00:00:57.260> particular
