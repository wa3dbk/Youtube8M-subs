00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.430 

it's<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.530> bad<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:47.960> when<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.079> does<00:00:49.260> get

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it's not that bad here when it does get

it's not that bad here when it does get
really<00:00:49.860> bad<00:00:50.039> though<00:00:50.309> those<00:00:50.579> images<00:00:50.910> will

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
really bad though those images will

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.610 
really bad though those images will
completely<00:00:51.570> cross<00:00:51.809> from<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.050> side<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.440> the

this video so I can show the effect in
general<00:02:27.830> I'm<00:02:28.830> gonna<00:02:29.040> try<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.340> splice<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.850> some

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
general I'm gonna try to splice in some

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.370

images<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:31.370> tangled<00:02:32.480> which<00:02:33.480> had<00:02:33.720> some<00:02:34.050> real

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
images of tangled which had some real

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.790 
images of tangled which had some real
horrific<00:02:35.930> back-and-forth<00:02:36.930> kind<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.410> 3d

horrific back-and-forth kind of 3d

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.510 
horrific back-and-forth kind of 3d
effects<00:02:38.130> which<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.270> made<00:02:39.810> me<00:02:39.989> nauseous<00:02:40.520> I'll

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
effects which just made me nauseous I'll

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.020 
effects which just made me nauseous I'll
also<00:02:41.700> try<00:02:42.510> displacing<00:02:43.110> something<00:02:43.530> from<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
also try displacing something from the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.670 
also try displacing something from the
Avengers<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:46.680> had<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:48.690> 3d<00:02:49.020> was<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.320> bad<00:02:49.530> on

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
Avengers that had the 3d was so bad on

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.740 
Avengers that had the 3d was so bad on
that<00:02:49.709> one<00:02:49.860> from<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.459> effect<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.270> back<00:02:51.540> and

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that one from this effect this back and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.660 
that one from this effect this back and
forth<00:02:52.130> shuddering<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.160> fact<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.640> I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
forth shuddering the fact that I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:04:11.130 
forth shuddering the fact that I
couldn't<00:02:54.090> even<00:02:54.209> watch<00:02:54.330> it

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.400 

so<00:04:12.140> if<00:04:12.260> got<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.530> Avengers<00:04:12.950> loaded<00:04:13.280> up<00:04:14.410> watch

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
so if got the Avengers loaded up watch

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.180 
so if got the Avengers loaded up watch
this<00:04:15.650> logo<00:04:15.920> for<00:04:16.280> Paramount<00:04:16.669> up<00:04:16.880> at<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.090> top

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
badly things are going fast movements a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.130 
badly things are going fast movements a
little<00:04:34.120> harder<00:04:35.120> to<00:04:35.330> discern<00:04:35.660> because

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
little harder to discern because

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.230 
little harder to discern because
obviously<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:37.280> 3d<00:04:37.610> effects<00:04:37.880> going<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.120> be

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
obviously the 3d effects going to be

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.040 
obviously the 3d effects going to be
shifting<00:04:38.630> anyway<00:04:39.280> but<00:04:40.780> one<00:04:41.780> of<00:04:41.810> the

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
shifting anyway but one of the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.140 
shifting anyway but one of the
indicators<00:04:42.650> is<00:04:43.070> once<00:04:43.729> it<00:04:43.880> gets<00:04:44.000> on<00:04:44.090> our

off<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.200> side<00:04:48.440> where<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:50.680> 3d<00:04:51.680> has<00:04:51.860> shifted

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
off to the side where the 3d has shifted

a<00:04:56.150> frame<00:04:56.540> I<00:04:56.570> think<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.080> way<00:04:57.169> that's<00:04:57.410> not

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.290 
as far as I know they suggested just
returning<00:05:32.290> the<00:05:32.380> TV<00:05:32.680> so<00:05:33.010> I<00:05:33.250> thought<00:05:34.120> before

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
returning the TV so I thought before

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.370 
returning the TV so I thought before
returning<00:05:34.960> I<00:05:35.110> would<00:05:35.290> document<00:05:35.530> this<00:05:35.919> because

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
returning I would document this because

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.360 
returning I would document this because
apparently<00:05:38.380> this<00:05:38.680> is<00:05:38.800> pretty<00:05:39.010> rare<00:05:41.130> so<00:05:42.130> if

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
apparently this is pretty rare so if

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.770 
apparently this is pretty rare so if
