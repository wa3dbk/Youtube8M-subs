00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.700
 Ford does not want to give even space 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.450
 when the subject is an echo. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.120
 sport 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.639
 beyond radical change has now come 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.700
 version that brings more news to 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.340
 powerchip it comes equipped with exchange 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.140
 robotic double-clutch manual with 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.420
 six gears that make exchanges 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.279
 automatically is the first car 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.630
 with this type of exchange that has already 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.369
 It is common in several to cut snitch 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.769
 replace old box with advantages 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.840
 Automatic eco sport without prejudice to the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.300
 performance or consumption in relation to 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.190
 conventional manual transmission and how has 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.200
 two clutches one for the gears 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.000
 pairs and another for the marches and impose 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.489
 this makes the changes in fractions of a second 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.789
 since the next public pre- march 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.489
 in a beautiful sports or 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.129
 sequential manual changes only 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.050
 made a very bland little button 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.780
 would be more consistent with the level of 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.160
 car if they could be made in the lever 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.170
 or letters behind the wheel 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.090
 For this it is only joy the exchanges are 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.830
 practically imperceptible. 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.390
 increases comfort and provides a 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.549
 quiet driving 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.460
 the only engine available for the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.290
 power shift is the 2.0 as it was 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.439
 modified to provide an answer 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.110
 more suitable to the automated exchange it 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.939
 has a bit of power and torque 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.909
 worsening the accelerations but nothing that 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.920
 consumption to compensate for 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.110
 kept the same achieved with exchange 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.659
 manual and much better than when it was 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.640
 equipped with automatic off the exchange 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.750
 the eco sport powershift is equal to the other 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.390
 versions 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.759
 although good materials used should 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.439
 still improve on the hurdles 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.640
 room for four adults and one 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.649
 the 362-liter trunk 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.470
 should be greater for a car with 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.810
 family tensions and the highest height of 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.240
 only allows light incursions from outside the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.250
 Safety on the road that have the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.409
 This one we tested is complete. 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.430
 three-point head support belts 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.190
 for all front and side air bags 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.390
 ABS brakes and electronic controls 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.390
 traction and stability 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.260
 besides equipped with pampering with direction 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.629
 electric multimedia system as well 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.060
 Button ignition on panel 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.290
 It is not cheap but it is a good option for 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.409
 who wants a sports utility 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.299
 compact with everything you have right without 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.989
 worry about the cost of maintaining 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.989
 imported 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.220
 so let's go to the notes check the numbers
