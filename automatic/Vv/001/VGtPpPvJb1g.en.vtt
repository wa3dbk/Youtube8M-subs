questions<00:00:17.850> about<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:19.230> two<00:00:19.789> carbon-fibre

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
questions about the two carbon-fibre

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.279 
questions about the two carbon-fibre
booths<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.210> are<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.480> right<00:00:21.660> now<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.840> got<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
booths that are out right now we got the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.960 
booths that are out right now we got the
follow<00:00:22.710> carbons<00:00:23.250> right<00:00:23.430> here<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.850> ball

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
follow carbons right here the ball

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.269 
follow carbons right here the ball
lights<00:00:24.330> if<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.750> will<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.859> also<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
lights if you will and we also have the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.849 
lights if you will and we also have the
USD<00:00:26.640> carbons<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.720> was<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.590> gonna<00:00:28.710> do<00:00:28.830> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
USD carbons so I was just gonna do a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.950 
USD carbons so I was just gonna do a
little<00:00:28.980> comparison<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.609> got<00:00:29.760> both<00:00:30.000> size<00:00:30.359> 10<00:00:30.750> in

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
little comparison I got both size 10 in

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.620 
little comparison I got both size 10 in
each<00:00:31.109> boot<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.820> we're<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:32.880> gonna<00:00:33.059> check

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
each boot and we're just gonna check

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.030 
each boot and we're just gonna check
them<00:00:33.780> both<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.469> course<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
them both out here of course we have the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.770 
them both out here of course we have the
vol<00:00:35.219> oh<00:00:35.250> right<00:00:35.820> there<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.120> legit<00:00:36.450> eight<00:00:36.570> lights

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
vol oh right there is legit eight lights

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.860 
vol oh right there is legit eight lights
and<00:00:37.620> then<00:00:38.070> we're<00:00:38.190> gonna<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.300> got<00:00:39.690> some

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
and then we're gonna have the I got some

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.819 
and then we're gonna have the I got some
of<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.989> black<00:00:40.140> carbons<00:00:40.559> right<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:41.360> and

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
of the black carbons right here and

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.260 
of the black carbons right here and
there<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.700> we're<00:00:45.000> gonna<00:00:45.090> take<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
there they are so we're gonna take a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.209 
there they are so we're gonna take a
look<00:00:45.390> at<00:00:45.480> both<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.629> them<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> kind

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
look at both of them see what the kind

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.279 
look at both of them see what the kind
of<00:00:47.250> differences<00:00:47.670> are<00:00:47.789> between<00:00:47.910> them<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.450> how

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
of differences are between them and how

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.389 
of differences are between them and how
they<00:00:49.469> kind<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.710> square<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.219> each<00:00:50.309> other

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
they kind of square up with each other

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.810 
they kind of square up with each other
so<00:00:51.230> here<00:00:52.230> they<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:53.340> might<00:00:53.489> even<00:00:53.610> notice

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
so here they are you might even notice

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.900 
so here they are you might even notice
right<00:00:54.000> off<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> bat<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.870> valo<00:00:55.910> lights

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
right off the bat that the valo lights

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
right off the bat that the valo lights
are<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:57.870> bit<00:00:57.989> bigger<00:00:58.500> than<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
are just a little bit bigger than the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.119 
are just a little bit bigger than the
USD<00:01:00.149> carbons<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.600> they're<00:01:00.809> taller<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:02.010> can

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
USD carbons are they're taller you can

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.319 
USD carbons are they're taller you can
see<00:01:02.219> they're<00:01:02.340> kind<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> sitting<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.059> that

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
see they're kind of sitting up like that

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
see they're kind of sitting up like that
and<00:01:03.589> just<00:01:04.589> looking<00:01:04.799> down<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.159> them<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.309> this

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and just looking down on them like this

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
and just looking down on them like this
it<00:01:05.670> might<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.790> hard<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> video<00:01:06.450> or

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it might be hard to see in the video or

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.830 
it might be hard to see in the video or
on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> camera<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:09.420> Vols<00:01:09.600> are

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
on the camera there but the Vols are

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.170 
on the camera there but the Vols are
also<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.140> little<00:01:10.229> bit<00:01:10.350> wider<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:11.070> well<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.970> maybe

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
also a little bit wider as well so maybe

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
also a little bit wider as well so maybe
if<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> bigger<00:01:12.750> foot<00:01:13.100> you're<00:01:14.100> gonna

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
if you have a bigger foot you're gonna

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.490 
if you have a bigger foot you're gonna
go<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.330> toward<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> toward<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
go a little bit toward the toward the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.249 
go a little bit toward the toward the
vol<00:01:16.650> O's<00:01:17.060> they<00:01:18.060> don't<00:01:18.240> fit<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.080> did

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
vol O's they don't fit at all like I did

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.200 
vol O's they don't fit at all like I did
with<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> old<00:01:19.680> ball<00:01:20.100> O's<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.430> these<00:01:20.909> set<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
with the old ball O's like these set the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.120 
with the old ball O's like these set the
size<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:21.659> wallows<00:01:21.990> now<00:01:22.710> they're<00:01:22.920> true<00:01:23.040> to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
size up with wallows now they're true to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.550 
size up with wallows now they're true to
the<00:01:23.189> size<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:24.720> fitting<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.409> see

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the size and very fitting as you can see

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.710 
the size and very fitting as you can see
it's<00:01:25.680> got<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> nice<00:01:25.950> squishy<00:01:26.159> toe<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:26.729> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
it's got a nice squishy toe there so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380 
it's got a nice squishy toe there so
it's<00:01:28.500> good<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:29.549> opposed<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> carbons<00:01:30.329> but

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
it's good as opposed to the carbons but

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.719 
it's good as opposed to the carbons but
you'll<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> squishy<00:01:30.840> tail<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
you'll have the squishy tail they have a

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.749 
you'll have the squishy tail they have a
molded<00:01:32.729> toe<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:34.610> other<00:01:35.610> than

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
molded toe right there but other than

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.660 
molded toe right there but other than
that<00:01:35.820> holding<00:01:36.750> both<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> them<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.680> would<00:01:38.640> say

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that holding both of them up I would say

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.120 
that holding both of them up I would say
they're<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.229> same<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.590> weight<00:01:40.829> maybe

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
they're about the same in weight maybe

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.789 
they're about the same in weight maybe
the<00:01:41.340> carbon<00:01:41.729> USD<00:01:42.450> carbons<00:01:42.810> are<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> little<00:01:43.320> bit

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the carbon USD carbons are a little bit

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.039 
the carbon USD carbons are a little bit
lighter<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.790> about<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> same<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.540> weight<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
lighter but about the same in weight and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.420 
lighter but about the same in weight and
I<00:01:46.409> would<00:01:46.530> say<00:01:46.649> most<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.920> that's<00:01:47.070> probably<00:01:47.310> in

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
I would say most of that's probably in

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.530 
I would say most of that's probably in
the<00:01:47.520> soleplate<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.240> probably<00:01:48.479> low

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the soleplate so it's probably low

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.380 
the soleplate so it's probably low
bottom<00:01:48.720> heavy<00:01:48.960> they're<00:01:49.729> also<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.090> pledged<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
bottom heavy they're also so pledged a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.490 
bottom heavy they're also so pledged a
little<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.659> difference<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> ball

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
little bit difference I like the ball

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.780 
little bit difference I like the ball
low<00:01:52.649> ones<00:01:52.829> are<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.159> bit<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.340> because

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
low ones are a little bit more because

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.889 
low ones are a little bit more because
they<00:01:53.939> wrap<00:01:54.180> around<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> side<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> boot

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
they wrap around the side of the boot

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.190 
they wrap around the side of the boot
right<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:57.270> u.s.<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> still<00:01:57.960> kind<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
right here the u.s. do you still kind of

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.810 
right here the u.s. do you still kind of
do<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.649> could<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.040> could<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.340> them<00:01:59.490> kind<00:01:59.759> of

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
do but I could I could see them kind of

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.340 
do but I could I could see them kind of
wearing<00:01:59.969> down<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.450> come<00:02:00.570> F<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.899> able<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
wearing down and you come F be able to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.300 
wearing down and you come F be able to
grind<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> side<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> boot<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
grind on the side of the boot there a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.469 
grind on the side of the boot there a
little<00:02:02.430> bit<00:02:02.579> when<00:02:02.700> you're<00:02:02.790> doing<00:02:02.969> Royales

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
little bit when you're doing Royales

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.760 
little bit when you're doing Royales
especially<00:02:04.110> we're<00:02:04.229> getting<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.469> top<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
especially we're getting on top of a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.289 
especially we're getting on top of a
Ledge<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.520> then<00:02:05.610> you're<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.210> know

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
Ledge like this and then you're you know

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.839 
Ledge like this and then you're you know
getting<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.600> top<00:02:06.810> with<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.200> toe<00:02:07.530> area<00:02:07.849> and

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
getting on top with the toe area and

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.940 
getting on top with the toe area and
that's<00:02:09.060> not<00:02:09.259> that's<00:02:10.259> worn<00:02:10.500> down<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.679> while<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
that's not that's worn down a while you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.530 
that's not that's worn down a while you
might<00:02:11.069> actually<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.459> onto<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.819> boot<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.270> I

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
might actually get onto the boot so I

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.890 
might actually get onto the boot so I
might<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.349> these

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
might go for these

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.430 
might go for these
in<00:02:14.349> terms<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.709> soleplate<00:02:16.050> look<00:02:17.050> at<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> width

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
in terms of soleplate look at the width

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.050 
in terms of soleplate look at the width
of<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.739> sole<00:02:17.920> plates<00:02:18.190> they're<00:02:18.580> about<00:02:18.819> the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
of the sole plates they're about the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.500 
of the sole plates they're about the
same<00:02:20.099> maybe<00:02:21.099> a<00:02:21.280> little<00:02:21.880> bit<00:02:22.000> wider<00:02:22.209> in<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
same maybe a little bit wider in the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.240 
same maybe a little bit wider in the
ball<00:02:22.690> outside<00:02:23.110> but<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.500> mean<00:02:23.650> they're<00:02:23.800> really

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
ball outside but I mean they're really

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.420 
ball outside but I mean they're really
pretty<00:02:25.180> comparable<00:02:25.599> in<00:02:25.930> terms<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.319> size<00:02:27.310> of

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
pretty comparable in terms of size of

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.610 
pretty comparable in terms of size of
the<00:02:27.489> sole<00:02:27.670> plates<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.030> everything<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.620> I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
the sole plates and everything and I

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.470 
the sole plates and everything and I
like<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.640> memory<00:02:30.880> buckle<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.300> ball<00:02:31.450> a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
like the memory buckle on the ball a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.750 
like the memory buckle on the ball a
little<00:02:31.690> bit<00:02:31.810> more<00:02:31.900> also<00:02:32.550> because<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.640> just

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
little bit more also because you just

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.150 
little bit more also because you just
have<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.970> set<00:02:34.209> this<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:35.530> wherever<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.860> want<00:02:36.069> it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
have to set this to wherever you want it

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.370 
have to set this to wherever you want it
and<00:02:36.250> then<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.459> just<00:02:36.700> click<00:02:36.849> it<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.290> at

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
and then you just click it in so it's at

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.600 
and then you just click it in so it's at
the<00:02:38.470> same<00:02:38.620> spot<00:02:38.950> every<00:02:39.190> time<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.430> come<00:02:39.580> to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
the same spot every time you come to

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.970 
the same spot every time you come to
skate<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:40.000> just<00:02:40.410> undo<00:02:41.410> them<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.769> then<00:02:41.920> you

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
skate you just undo them and then you

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.949 
skate you just undo them and then you
come<00:02:42.130> back<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.910> you'll<00:02:43.030> have<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.239> be<00:02:43.330> messing

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
come back and you'll have to be messing

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.089 
come back and you'll have to be messing
with<00:02:43.989> your<00:02:44.170> buckle<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.530> try<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.739> get<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:44.950> you

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
with your buckle to try to get it you

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.520 
with your buckle to try to get it you
know<00:02:45.160> click<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.550> then<00:02:45.640> one<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:45.940> way<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
know click and then one this way and to

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.229 
know click and then one this way and to
back<00:02:47.799> that<00:02:47.980> way<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.220> keep<00:02:48.790> trying<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.090> click

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
back that way and keep trying to click

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.570 
back that way and keep trying to click
it<00:02:49.360> to<00:02:49.450> try<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.630> get<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.040> where<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.250> every

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
it to try to get it to where it is every

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.670 
it to try to get it to where it is every
time<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.390> like<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.080> memory<00:02:53.260> block<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.500> little

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
time so I like the memory block a little

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.479 
time so I like the memory block a little
bit<00:02:53.769> more<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.760> other<00:02:55.030> than<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.569> think<00:02:56.489> if

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
bit more but other than that I think if

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.009 
bit more but other than that I think if
you're<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.700> guy<00:02:57.850> who<00:02:57.910> likes<00:02:58.209> your<00:02:58.660> skates<00:02:58.900> to

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
you're a guy who likes your skates to

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.199 
you're a guy who likes your skates to
feel<00:02:59.170> really<00:02:59.620> close<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.040> your<00:03:00.220> foot<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:01.060> like

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
feel really close to your foot you like

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.199 
feel really close to your foot you like
that<00:03:01.330> really<00:03:01.480> form<00:03:01.870> fit<00:03:02.110> kind<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.410> skate<00:03:03.209> if

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
that really form fit kind of skate if

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.789 
that really form fit kind of skate if
you<00:03:04.330> like<00:03:04.510> when<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.930> know<00:03:05.019> when<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.170> grind<00:03:05.500> I

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
you like when you know when you grind I

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.380 
you like when you know when you grind I
think<00:03:06.040> one<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:06.910> main<00:03:07.000> things<00:03:07.209> with<00:03:07.299> the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
think one of the main things with the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.699 
think one of the main things with the
carbons<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.840> when<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.049> grind<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.380> can<00:03:08.500> really

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
carbons is when you grind you can really

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.410 
carbons is when you grind you can really
feel<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.010> grinds<00:03:09.370> under<00:03:09.549> your<00:03:09.670> foot<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.390> know

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
feel the grinds under your foot you know

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.059 
feel the grinds under your foot you know
you<00:03:10.599> can<00:03:10.720> feel<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.080> Royales<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:11.739> can<00:03:11.860> feel

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
you can feel the Royales you can feel

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.890 
you can feel the Royales you can feel
the<00:03:12.220> top<00:03:12.940> soles<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.330> stuff<00:03:13.569> because<00:03:13.660> it's

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
the top soles and stuff because it's

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.620 
the top soles and stuff because it's
your<00:03:14.170> your<00:03:14.410> foots<00:03:14.590> really<00:03:14.680> close<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
your your foots really close to the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.090 
your your foots really close to the
ledge<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:16.870> there's<00:03:17.170> not<00:03:17.260> much<00:03:17.380> material<00:03:17.560> in

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
ledge and there's not much material in

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.620 
ledge and there's not much material in
between<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:20.380> know<00:03:20.579> your<00:03:21.579> foot<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.269> the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
between the you know your foot and the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.940 
between the you know your foot and the
obstacle<00:03:23.079> you<00:03:23.109> know<00:03:23.290> there's<00:03:23.440> it's<00:03:23.709> pretty

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
obstacle you know there's it's pretty

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.259 
obstacle you know there's it's pretty
thin<00:03:24.160> right<00:03:24.190> here<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:24.640> that's<00:03:24.730> good<00:03:24.880> that's

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
thin right here so that's good that's

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.360 
thin right here so that's good that's
what<00:03:25.359> you<00:03:25.450> want<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.780> think<00:03:26.049> so<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:27.250> the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
what you want I think so I like the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.490 
what you want I think so I like the
carbons<00:03:27.700> for<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.000> ball<00:03:28.750> those<00:03:28.900> are<00:03:29.200> still<00:03:29.440> a

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
carbons for that ball those are still a

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.530 
carbons for that ball those are still a
little<00:03:29.560> bit<00:03:29.739> more<00:03:29.859> bulkier<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.819> sense

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
little bit more bulkier in that sense

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.300 
little bit more bulkier in that sense
so<00:03:32.500> probably<00:03:32.739> gonna<00:03:32.890> still<00:03:33.040> have<00:03:33.100> that

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
so probably gonna still have that

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.380 
so probably gonna still have that
feeling<00:03:33.549> like<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.850> have<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> big<00:03:34.150> chunk<00:03:34.269> of

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
feeling like you have a big chunk of

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.150 
feeling like you have a big chunk of
plastic<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.840> between<00:03:34.870> your<00:03:35.170> foot<00:03:35.290> but<00:03:35.560> if<00:03:36.069> you

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
plastic in between your foot but if you

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.530 
plastic in between your foot but if you
don't<00:03:36.310> mind<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.519> then<00:03:36.760> it's<00:03:36.910> fine

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
don't mind that then it's fine

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.900 
don't mind that then it's fine
other<00:03:38.079> than<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.380> mean<00:03:38.590> really<00:03:39.459> comparable

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
other than that I mean really comparable

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.400 
other than that I mean really comparable
skates<00:03:40.209> carbon<00:03:40.569> fiber<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.930> gonna<00:03:41.079> be<00:03:41.140> really

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
skates carbon fiber is gonna be really

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.590 
skates carbon fiber is gonna be really
strong<00:03:41.650> both<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.190> them<00:03:42.310> like<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.269> said<00:03:43.359> both

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
strong both of them like I said both

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.330 
strong both of them like I said both
pretty<00:03:44.079> similar<00:03:44.440> in<00:03:44.530> weight<00:03:44.709> maybe<00:03:45.010> these<00:03:45.190> are

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
pretty similar in weight maybe these are

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.610 
pretty similar in weight maybe these are
a<00:03:45.370> little<00:03:45.489> bit<00:03:45.579> lighter<00:03:45.819> I'd<00:03:46.030> say<00:03:46.389> but<00:03:47.109> other

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
a little bit lighter I'd say but other

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.960 
a little bit lighter I'd say but other
than<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:47.829> you<00:03:48.459> know<00:03:48.549> if<00:03:48.639> you'd<00:03:48.760> like<00:03:48.850> to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
than that you know if you'd like to

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.590 
than that you know if you'd like to
follow

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
follow

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.629 
follow
I<00:03:49.630> would<00:03:49.989> just<00:03:50.109> stick<00:03:50.290> with<00:03:50.380> these<00:03:50.560> like<00:03:51.549> the

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
I would just stick with these like the

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.099 
I would just stick with these like the
older<00:03:51.850> balos<00:03:52.180> because<00:03:52.720> you're<00:03:52.810> getting<00:03:52.930> a

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
older balos because you're getting a

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.379 
older balos because you're getting a
stronger<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.069> lighter<00:03:54.250> version<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.819> it<00:03:54.970> with

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
stronger and lighter version of it with

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.059 
stronger and lighter version of it with
a<00:03:55.420> new<00:03:55.750> soleplate<00:03:56.109> so<00:03:56.350> that's<00:03:56.470> pretty<00:03:56.680> cool<00:03:56.799> so

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
a new soleplate so that's pretty cool so

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.379 
a new soleplate so that's pretty cool so
if<00:03:57.160> your<00:03:57.280> Volvo<00:03:57.549> fan<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.880> can<00:03:57.970> party<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.239> stick

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
if your Volvo fan you can party to stick

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:59.729 
if your Volvo fan you can party to stick
with<00:03:58.510> these<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:59.139> wanna<00:03:59.590> try<00:03:59.709> something

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
with these I wanna try something

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.009 
with these I wanna try something
different<00:04:00.310> if<00:04:00.400> you<00:04:00.430> like<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:00.810> kind<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.870> a

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
different if you like the kind of a

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.599 
different if you like the kind of a
lower<00:04:02.319> cut<00:04:02.590> feel<00:04:02.859> these<00:04:03.040> also<00:04:03.190> have<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.400> v<00:04:03.579> cut

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
lower cut feel these also have a v cut

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.800 
lower cut feel these also have a v cut
cuff<00:04:03.970> in<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.180> back

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
cuff in the back

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.599 
cuff in the back
the<00:04:05.079> ebolas<00:04:05.500> do<00:04:05.650> not<00:04:05.829> they're<00:04:06.130> pretty<00:04:06.340> flat

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
the ebolas do not they're pretty flat

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.280 
the ebolas do not they're pretty flat
right<00:04:06.639> across<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.180> back<00:04:07.299> of<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.569> so<00:04:08.109> if<00:04:08.200> you

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
right across the back of it so if you

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.319 
right across the back of it so if you
like<00:04:08.350> a<00:04:08.410> little<00:04:08.500> v<00:04:08.709> cut<00:04:08.920> go<00:04:09.760> for<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:09.970> carbons

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
like a little v cut go for the carbons

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.090 
like a little v cut go for the carbons
these<00:04:10.780> are<00:04:10.900> definitely<00:04:11.139> a<00:04:11.290> lot<00:04:11.470> lower<00:04:11.650> cut<00:04:11.980> as

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
these are definitely a lot lower cut as

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.160 
these are definitely a lot lower cut as
you<00:04:12.220> can<00:04:12.310> see<00:04:12.459> they<00:04:12.579> even<00:04:12.819> sit<00:04:13.060> lower<00:04:13.269> gonna

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
you can see they even sit lower gonna

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.840 
you can see they even sit lower gonna
have<00:04:14.319> less<00:04:14.560> ankle<00:04:14.889> support<00:04:14.980> more<00:04:15.370> flex<00:04:15.700> so

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
have less ankle support more flex so

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.490 
have less ankle support more flex so
you're<00:04:15.970> gonna<00:04:16.120> have<00:04:16.269> more<00:04:17.049> ankle<00:04:17.410> support

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
you're gonna have more ankle support

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.190 
you're gonna have more ankle support
less<00:04:17.950> flex<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:19.000> just<00:04:19.750> all<00:04:19.870> personal

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
less flex so just all personal

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.899 
less flex so just all personal
preference<00:04:20.530> on<00:04:20.590> what<00:04:20.739> you'd<00:04:20.859> like

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
preference on what you'd like

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:25.890 
preference on what you'd like
both<00:04:22.570> great<00:04:22.870> boots<00:04:23.140> but<00:04:24.539> less<00:04:25.539> ankle<00:04:25.810> support

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
both great boots but less ankle support

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.880 
both great boots but less ankle support
flex<00:04:26.470> here

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
flex here

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.450 
flex here
kind<00:04:27.280> of

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
kind of

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.460 
kind of
more<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.639> like<00:04:27.759> a<00:04:27.789> shoe<00:04:28.120> this<00:04:28.990> is<00:04:29.080> gonna<00:04:29.259> feel

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
more of like a shoe this is gonna feel

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.219 
more of like a shoe this is gonna feel
more<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:29.889> an<00:04:30.069> actual<00:04:30.220> boot<00:04:30.610> but<00:04:31.509> what's

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
more like an actual boot but what's

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.469 
more like an actual boot but what's
still<00:04:32.500> with<00:04:32.650> that<00:04:32.680> carbon<00:04:33.190> fiber<00:04:33.789> feel<00:04:34.120> so

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
still with that carbon fiber feel so
