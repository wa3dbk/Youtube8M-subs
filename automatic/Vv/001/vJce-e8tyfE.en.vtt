00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.840
 and on the street zadanu topics guy 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.439
 m-fix 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.309
 hello you ruslan and this review 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.250
 on the movie new spiderman 2 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.900
 high voltage in my anus from 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.800
 localizer in Russia 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.870
 riveted localizers but let's not about 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.840
 sad and let's talk about the movie 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.670
 one of the most anticipated but also a movie in 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.340
 this year finally came out on big 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.750
 screens and I have something to say about him but 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.300
 I want to speak at the beginning of these 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.600
 endless debates about what a spider 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.729
 rays spider sam raimy or t shirt in b i'm here 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.860
 I think that the web is better undermined the actors on 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.830
 the roles and the candy itself is better suited to the role 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.380
 Peter Parker still for me Maguire 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.540
 does not associate with the regiment and yes 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.020
 any superhero role at all 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.500
 and emma stone will be nicer kingston 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.270
 dance not as an actress but just outwardly yes 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.670
 and generally I think that some people do not 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.700
 may take a new person while stupid 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.409
 because of feelings of nostalgia but this is mine 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.340
 personal opinion and let's go to 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.219
 the movie itself 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.250
 the second regiment did not like more than 1 and 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.600
 I liked him very much 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.850
 what do you want to do this job 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.130
 artists and operator flying spider 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.380
 just mesmerizing the camera happens before 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.179
 just fantastic perspective and many 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.670
 complain that in some places the graphics look like 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.310
 too cartoony but remember the graphics 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.109
 just awesome is very difficult now 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.450
 surprise someone with special effects but this 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.999
 the film may he surprise you and 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.740
 sometimes even goosebumps 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:02:00.020
 as for the villains, the main villain 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.630
 electro who played Jamie Fox 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.490
 the villain though turned out to be Lena's clichÃ© but 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.920
 he has at least some motivation 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.810
 say that it is strongly written but at least 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.789
 something last with a villain in the second 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.220
 tour whose goal was just 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.120
 seize the land as for the rest 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.850
 two villains 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.610
 rhino and goblin green screen in 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.500
 time he is too little rhino 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.810
 could not even include and give 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.150
 time to the other two villains for a term 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.220
 appears only in the prologue and epilogue and 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.890
 with him all the action scenes we saw in 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.959
 trailers and generally sony did too 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.150
 tough advertising policy showed 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.720
 too many moments from the movie in 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.300
 trailers 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.920
 which was quite a lot separately 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.980
 I want to praise the soundtrack 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.120
 holsey the world has tried gathered still around 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.950
 stars like Farrell and Alisha Kis 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.960
 flirting with dubstep just got in 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.900
 favor and looks pretty fresh 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.700
 Electro theme is very suitable villains and myself 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.670
 hundred years does not fly out of my head after 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.520
 of course you probably heard about 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.980
 the most important dream of a third of you you are so 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.020
 here he reassured he plays the very ends of the credits 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.710
 and you still have time to see the scene after 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.320
 credits 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.880
 so many will not have to suffer 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.720
 scolded plot and illogic 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.300
 happening 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.040
 but you should understand this movie pop comic 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.230
 and all that is worth it to demand 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.870
 this is a first-class fascinating to 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.150
 special effects and will have with the plot I'm 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.580
 I think it's not worth it because the film is shot style 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.430
 ordinary comics so just forget 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.270
 about everything and enjoy the spectacle with you 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.380
 Ruslan was also 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.380
 see you soon
