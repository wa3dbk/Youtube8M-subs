breakfast<00:04:47.770> sausage<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.080> love<00:04:56.230> the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
breakfast sausage and and I love the

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.830 
breakfast sausage and and I love the
size<00:04:56.590> of<00:04:56.740> this<00:04:56.830> is<00:04:57.010> almost<00:04:57.250> almost<00:04:57.580> like<00:04:57.670> a

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
size of this is almost almost like a

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.510 
size of this is almost almost like a
slider<00:04:58.840> but<00:04:59.260> on<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.440> little<00:04:59.650> bit<00:04:59.800> larger<00:05:00.190> scale

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
slider but on a little bit larger scale

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.510 
slider but on a little bit larger scale
and<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.810> think<00:05:01.840> that<00:05:02.170> this<00:05:02.380> actually<00:05:02.650> makes<00:05:03.280> the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
and I think that this actually makes the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.770 
and I think that this actually makes the
whole<00:05:03.700> meal<00:05:03.970> seem<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.270> little<00:05:04.420> bit<00:05:04.630> more

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
whole meal seem a little bit more

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.900 
whole meal seem a little bit more
manageable<00:05:05.100> rather<00:05:06.100> than<00:05:06.280> taking<00:05:06.550> a<00:05:06.610> giant

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
manageable rather than taking a giant

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.640 
manageable rather than taking a giant
donkey<00:05:07.480> log<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:08.020> even<00:05:08.260> s<00:05:09.060> I<00:05:10.060> think<00:05:10.650> Wendy's

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
donkey log and even s I think Wendy's

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.140 
donkey log and even s I think Wendy's
needs<00:05:11.890> to<00:05:12.010> take<00:05:12.190> notes<00:05:12.460> because<00:05:12.700> this<00:05:12.820> is<00:05:13.030> the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
needs to take notes because this is the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.840 
needs to take notes because this is the
true<00:05:13.330> Baconator<00:05:13.840> yes<00:05:14.380> in<00:05:14.590> my<00:05:14.710> opinion<00:05:14.740> this<00:05:15.640> is

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
true Baconator yes in my opinion this is

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.690 
true Baconator yes in my opinion this is
