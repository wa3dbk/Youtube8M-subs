have<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.789> hard<00:01:17.999> time<00:01:18.119> getting<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.719> out<00:01:19.350> of

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
have a hard time getting out of out of

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.849 
have a hard time getting out of out of
the<00:01:19.499> shell<00:01:20.179> but<00:01:21.560> when<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:24.439> think<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.499> for<00:01:25.740> this

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
the shell but when I think this for this

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.029 
the shell but when I think this for this
is<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.520> thin<00:01:26.789> case<00:01:27.060> actually<00:01:27.389> um

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
is a really thin case actually um

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.949 
is a really thin case actually um
reminds<00:01:29.039> me<00:01:29.039> a<00:01:29.249> lot<00:01:29.399> of<00:01:29.459> one<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.359> nano<00:01:30.600> came
