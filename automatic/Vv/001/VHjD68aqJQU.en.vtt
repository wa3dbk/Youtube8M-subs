they upgraded me but as you guys know
this<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> picture<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> demo<00:01:18.360> so

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this is the picture of the demo so

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.420 
this is the picture of the demo so
obviously<00:01:18.990> these<00:01:19.200> verses<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.950> defined<00:01:20.310> on

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
obviously these verses not defined on

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.249 
obviously these verses not defined on
some<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> these<00:01:20.850> player<00:01:21.180> ratings<00:01:21.840> might<00:01:22.110> be

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
some of these player ratings might be

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.539 
some of these player ratings might be
changed<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> pretty<00:01:23.280> much<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
changed but this is pretty much the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
changed but this is pretty much the
rough<00:01:24.060> idea<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> ratings<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
rough idea of what the ratings in the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.109 
rough idea of what the ratings in the
Real<00:01:25.799> Madrid<00:01:26.130> Scott<00:01:26.369> are<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
Real Madrid Scott are going to be and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.460 
Real Madrid Scott are going to be and
I'm<00:01:27.240> not<00:01:27.270> exactly<00:01:27.570> sure<00:01:27.869> who<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> roid

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
I'm not exactly sure who the roid

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410 
I'm not exactly sure who the roid
selling<00:01:28.799> back<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.340> could<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.790> Pepe<00:01:30.210> or

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
selling back is that could be Pepe or

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
selling back is that could be Pepe or
fear<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:31.829> take<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.369> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
fear on you can really take that as you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.950 
fear on you can really take that as you
want<00:01:32.790> because<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.329> can't<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
want because you can't really see the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.719 
want because you can't really see the
name<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> i'm<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.829> sure<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.159> pepe

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
name of it i'm pretty sure that's pepe

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.980 
name of it i'm pretty sure that's pepe
maybe<00:01:35.939> i'm<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.329> exactly<00:01:36.600> sure<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
maybe i'm not exactly sure a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.840 
maybe i'm not exactly sure a
deteriorated<00:01:37.740> anyway<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> obviously

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
deteriorated anyway and obviously

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.580 
deteriorated anyway and obviously
Castilla's<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.689> Hernandez<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.259> obviously

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
Castilla's and Hernandez are obviously

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
Castilla's and Hernandez are obviously
moving<00:01:40.829> away<00:01:41.009> from<00:01:41.130> Madrid<00:01:41.700> I'm<00:01:41.820> pretty<00:01:42.090> sure

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
moving away from Madrid I'm pretty sure

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.490 
moving away from Madrid I'm pretty sure
so<00:01:42.570> they're<00:01:42.720> not<00:01:42.810> gonna<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> team

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
so they're not gonna be on the team

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.109 
so they're not gonna be on the team
anyway<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.159> guys<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> rough<00:01:44.700> idea<00:01:44.850> of

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
anyway but you guys have a rough idea of

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.520 
anyway but you guys have a rough idea of
