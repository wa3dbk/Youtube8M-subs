00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.970
 again with you dear 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.920
 chess players a live match index 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.879
 already started playing with the white pieces 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.879
 lady pawn 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.210
 to a lady gambit 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.710
 it could have been a badge but it 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.620
 makes a lady's field the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.990
 change variant 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:30.090
 and the game sometimes h 6 night 6 is not the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.439
 everything right is better to keep the pawn 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.350
 in h 7 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.140
 because in some variants it is loose 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.660
 pin 6 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.140
 well this way of playing I do not like 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.960
 much in rivals 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.820
 good teacher fide let's see how it 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.480
 develop f 3 you are to avoid in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.420
 some 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.770
 horse variants of 4 and also for 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.810
 move forward in the center with the 4 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.180
 well we have completed the development 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.410
 I'm going to bring the tower to the center to 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.380
 defend the pawn of 4 when I advance 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.450
 with 4 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.900
 it's important good here he changed 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.430
 and I already believe that I can advance 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.490
 in the middle 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.230
 he could also laugh one but hey no 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.060
 I see that danger right now 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.080
 well he plays very fast but I think that 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.280
 is playing loose is 5 now I have 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.280
 attack with efe 4 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.070
 I recommend you leave the center when 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.520
 play your games 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.780
 and leave total control to the adversary 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.870
 well the judge sees you and is playing 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.040
 very fast but I really do not think 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.920
 is playing right 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.340
 well here I can make bishop f5 or f5 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.220
 even 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.180
 efe 5 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.520
 Isaac and I give him my white bishop but he is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.950
 In return 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.659
 of very dangerous pawns and there's no 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.789
 initiative 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.789
 dangerous on the kingside 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.590
 well I prepare for if they eat 3 and 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.209
 well now I could retire to the play 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.209
 next my king king h1 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.930
 and well I have a good position 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.970
 I won the center I have an attack with 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.970
 plays as is 66 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.680
 horse centralized in 4 good now 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.670
 I take off quickly I do not like that the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.630
 horse is nailed 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.819
 to 69 and it's making moves I think that 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.360
 without much sense let's see now that 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:53.459
 could I play tower f 4 is an idea 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.459
 interesting because I defend the horse 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.410
 and my lady is released to go to efe three 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.770
 g3 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.069
 I find it interesting 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.260
 I have ideas like f 6 ie6 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:13.200
 but the salt in its time 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.480
 and I like the play 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.930
 because he passed the tower saying the horse 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.580
 in the three towers four could be 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.190
 some ideas 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.230
 you see how I have total control here 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.810
 from the center 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.080
 I think blacks have not played very 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.500
 fine 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.300
 ladies c4 and they are I think that is not correct 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.130
 because I retire my lady 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.550
 ag 30 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.650
 yes 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.700
 and I defend the tower of f4 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.099
 it is a breakthrough 4 has been very bad already 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.819
 you see that it does not have the pieces are the 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.620
 it has all not very well placed the king 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.430
 in danger all for having yielded the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.359
 central control 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.420
 remember when I did 5 f 5 well this I 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:07.610
 I think it's a top 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.610
 serious a horse is 6 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.810
 and at least I gain material because 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.220
 horse 6 threat kill g7 and the lady of 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.350
 c4 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.660
 I think I see it I'm going to do it I do not know if 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.300
 I have some better but this one 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.940
 it gains material and I maintain I keep 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.070
 attack that is important not only win 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.270
 good stuff here like and I'm going to do 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.270
 efe 6 I think yes 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.030
 6 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.560
 I do not know here I think it 's already could 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.640
 abandon the game plays fast but in 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.640
 I actually leave some plays 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.760
 not 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.230
 although they are fast it is understandable because 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.230
 it's a five-minute game but 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:58.419
 you have to maintain a balance between 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:58.419
 Game quality and speed 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.500
 in this case I think that here I could not 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.969
 I have games as a lady f4 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.849
 4 damache could even be stronger 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:14.289
 touching the skin of h 6 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:18.490
 they threaten f-7 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:21.840
 well I also have a horse of 6 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:26.139
 Well this is a slow game 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:30.190
 it would be immediate and good abandonment in this 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:34.660
 position has arrived because I believe 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.910
 because the center has neglected it 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:43.660
 and if you remember , progress has been made in 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:47.300
 center with efe 345 f 4 f 5 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.449
 and we must try not to let 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.550
 he wins us in the center so easy 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.120
 is thinking I suppose yes abandon or 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.120
 do not keep playing 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:04.560
 Well, what I told you 4 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:08.040
 to do efe 7 16 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.350
 and good and you see or threatened by h6 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.760
 first clear 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.780
 5 unique 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.780
 or abandon 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.729
 and well, I want you to see that the 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.330
 conclusion of this game is 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:30.770
 that has been won in the central battle 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:33.409
 well here efe 79 sub tower I'll 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.680
 draw that I'm going to do horse 5 check 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.680
 I think 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.750
 this is close mate 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.750
 check 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.980
 yes and I defend my horse for example 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.090
 and well, I do not see any moves 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.150
 reasonable 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.060
 I want you to stay with the concept the 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.510
 piece to silence locked a horse 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.510
 on f8 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:06.490
 and leaving the center and that brings 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.710
 consequence to fall into an attack 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.440
 well in a mate attack like in this 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.320
 case 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.720
 does not play not good either no 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.600
 no reasonable play 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.300
 leave good then it's over I hope 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.240
 that you liked it and took note 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:26.220
 of the concepts that have been given in this 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.520
 departure fermín gonzález for all 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.520
 you
