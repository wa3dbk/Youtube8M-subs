00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:13.470

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.450
 The cell phone 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.430
 the battery charger and the manuals do not 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.650
 comes headphone on this model here is 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.750
 Nice and he has the option for you to change 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.040
 that the covers in various models for the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.399
 green orange and white colors and everything else 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.630
 I'm going to open it here, the box is to see the 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.850
 what's inside that cell phone 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.579
 it's not that big of a 4 screen 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.530
 inches just one size larger than 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.710
 for many people is the ideal and I think 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.380
 She is very big and he is a cell phone . 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.629
 yes it 's cute and it 's a bit thick 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.550
 It gives a little bit and that goes 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.680
 to work 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.450
 much but it is a beautiful scenery here has 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.660
 a new name for the soft as I said no 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.970
 It's more nokia now it's microsoft on top 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.350
 earphone for usb bass 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.770

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.170
 the volume here for you to turn it off 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.830
 it the quick technique to look at you 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.800
 see the nokia logo now appears 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.320
 appears soon from microsoft while linking 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.340
 Here I am going to get the box for you to come. 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.320
 inside his box a nice box 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.420
 inside is simple is not much 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.070
 the charger that is not that face 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.770
 charger that is equal for example 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:59.270
 samsung other brands that you plug 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:01.830
 here and then the power outlet is not only 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.780
 drink wine or that player who does not 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.260
 for you to charge the phone in your 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:13.650
 notebook on your pc is a shame really 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:17.570
 and here his simple manual manual is 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.870
 great is the texts are purple in color 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.340
 purple but in Portuguese 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.470
 the other legal lines for you 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.440
 to understand a nice body 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.720
 the great advantage of this cell phone for whom 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.090
 have an interest in buying is that he is the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.890
 mobile phone that has a very affordable price 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.300
 You'll find it on the internet with more 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.690
 or 370 to 450 reais depends on the 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.980
 You're entering the store and he's got a 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.780
 nice setup that I told 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.270
 before you have a processor 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.520
 quadcore 1 gb of ram and 1gb of ram for 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.920
 who does not know neither smartphone is much 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.209
 thing is a lot even if the system 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.640
 operating windows phone is very light 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.690
 on a frog day work and live here 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.670
 then you will get a performance one 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.020
 great if you file a litigation for 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.730
 android example you will not get one 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.709
 performance so good so it will crash 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.040
 a little depending on what you're going to use 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.440
 and in the case of today we err, that's how it is 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.510
 reasonable you can run everything smoothly 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.950
 without much stress and even they 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.870
 want to put 2 gb of ram now in 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.540
 next iPhone but joel team this 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.400
 Quiet too and what more than 8 gb of 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.650
 internal storage so you have a 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.150
 space to install apps and also 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.940
 option will produce the sd card 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.169
 if I'm not mistaken until 128 comes or is 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.000
 little less than this 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.350
 I do not remember now another review, I'm going 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.270
 give you detailed information 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.080
 and another great advantage is that 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.000
 smartphone will receive ai windows 10 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.160
 that will soon arrive 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.300
 then that's boxing idol 1532 soon 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.419
 an analysis 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:58.590
 I stay here a big hug and 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:05:02.070

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.610

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.280
 minimum payment of $ 1 or whatever 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.400

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.289
