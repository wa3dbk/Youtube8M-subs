put themselves through the paces with

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.890 
put themselves through the paces with
college<00:00:19.680> coaches<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.369> hand<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.480> all<00:00:21.630> as

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
college coaches on hand to see it all as

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.500 
college coaches on hand to see it all as
a<00:00:22.109> former<00:00:22.619> college<00:00:23.039> coach<00:00:23.480> definitely<00:00:24.480> I

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
a former college coach definitely I

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.390 
a former college coach definitely I
didn't<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> very<00:00:25.439> big<00:00:25.560> recruiting<00:00:25.949> budget

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
didn't have a very big recruiting budget

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.009 
didn't have a very big recruiting budget
so<00:00:26.609> wasn't<00:00:27.150> easier<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.599> me<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.720> get<00:00:27.840> around

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
so wasn't easier for me to get around

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.109 
so wasn't easier for me to get around
the<00:00:28.140> country<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.680> find<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.789> great

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the country and find that one great

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.640 
the country and find that one great
player<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.929> was<00:00:31.170> looking<00:00:31.410> forward<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
player that I was looking forward to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.500 
player that I was looking forward to
kind<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.890> fill<00:00:32.070> out<00:00:32.099> my<00:00:32.279> program<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.180> think

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
kind of fill out my program so I think

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.389 
kind of fill out my program so I think
the<00:00:33.660> combine<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> fabulous<00:00:34.590> opportunity

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
the combine is a fabulous opportunity

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.209 
the combine is a fabulous opportunity
for<00:00:36.120> some<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.390> these<00:00:36.450> schools<00:00:36.829> if<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.100> open

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
for some of these schools if we can open

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.670 
for some of these schools if we can open
more<00:00:38.489> doors<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.879> invite<00:00:39.809> more<00:00:39.989> players<00:00:40.260> into

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
more doors and invite more players into

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
more doors and invite more players into
it<00:00:40.800> they<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.370> only<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.790> better<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.149> players

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it they will only get better as players

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.119 
it they will only get better as players
and<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> same<00:00:43.590> time<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:43.980> they're

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
and you know at the same time if they're

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.920 
and you know at the same time if they're
given<00:00:44.340> an<00:00:44.430> opportunity<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.059> an<00:00:45.180> education

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
given an opportunity to get an education

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.869 
given an opportunity to get an education
then<00:00:46.289> we've<00:00:46.530> we've<00:00:46.860> done<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.430> were<00:00:47.700> meant

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
then we've we've done what we were meant

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
then we've we've done what we were meant
to<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.180> bowlers<00:00:48.989> will<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.320> tested<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.920> their

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
to do bowlers will be tested on their

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.240 
to do bowlers will be tested on their
overall<00:00:50.309> athleticism<00:00:51.239> their<00:00:51.930> bowling<00:00:52.199> IQ<00:00:52.920> and

their physical skills out on the lanes
one<00:00:56.129> three<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.489> five<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.699> really<00:00:57.000> good<00:00:57.149> shot

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
one three and five a really good shot

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.490 
one three and five a really good shot
this<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> bad<00:00:57.930> shot

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
this is a bad shot

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.979 
this is a bad shot
things<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:58.890> shot<00:00:59.250> repeatability<00:00:59.940> loft<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
things like shot repeatability loft and

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.260 
things like shot repeatability loft and

obviously<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> means<00:01:07.860> something<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
obviously it means something but you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.130 
obviously it means something but you
know<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.270> talked<00:01:09.450> about<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.810> different

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
know we talked about the different

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.780 
know we talked about the different
centers<00:01:10.409> across<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> country<00:01:11.280> they<00:01:11.400> all<00:01:11.520> play

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
centers across the country they all play

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.070 
centers across the country they all play
a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:12.030> bit<00:01:12.210> differently<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.810> there's

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
a little bit differently and there's

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
a little bit differently and there's
really<00:01:13.560> has<00:01:13.680> never<00:01:13.830> been<00:01:14.070> an<00:01:14.250> objective<00:01:14.909> view

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
really has never been an objective view

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.060 
really has never been an objective view
as<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.350> know<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.619> makes<00:01:16.830> somebody

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
as to you know what makes somebody

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
as to you know what makes somebody
better<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.549> know<00:01:17.640> these<00:01:17.790> are<00:01:18.000> different

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
better you know these are different

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
better you know these are different
objective<00:01:19.170> variables<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.400> measure

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
objective variables that we can measure

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.429 
objective variables that we can measure
that<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.330> never<00:01:21.479> really<00:01:21.570> been<00:01:21.750> measured<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that have never really been measured and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.560 
that have never really been measured and
in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> process<00:01:23.220> some<00:01:23.490> top<00:01:23.759> young<00:01:24.060> bowlers

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
in the process some top young bowlers

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.940 
in the process some top young bowlers
will<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> chance<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.470> learn<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
will get a chance to learn about the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
junior go that's really hard to see

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.730 
junior go that's really hard to see
where<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> elite<00:01:35.130> players<00:01:35.400> are<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.960> we
