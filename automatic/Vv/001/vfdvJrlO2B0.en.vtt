00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.960
 Stefan this is a totally different summer 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.900
 than the year ago for me partly 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.320
 but we are just doing very well 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.670
 plow 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.530
 we have and of course a whole different one 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.759
 composition of the team with three your 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.529
 fears 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.510
 and he had to play at Sprint is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.439
 we have and are a beautiful plug 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.230
 very tasty and two 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.119
 and goes beautiful but the show first summer 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.710
 absolute champion 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.269
 is true but there still has to be 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.550
 keep training and so do that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.040
 always and I am nice and busy 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.020
 And yes that just continues 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.420
 but of course it's hard on 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.250
 This way it is to go but rincon 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.149
 you are also a part-time employee with you 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.910
 video 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.649
 what about that is true I said 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.090
 after the season I really want to continue 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.090
 she goes super cool with a skating bike 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.550
 and competitions super beautiful but I miss me 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.629
 sometimes some other things to the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.750
 to do 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.540
 and yes full-time study and that saw that 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.160
 I 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.400
 that was an option but did not see it now 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.900
 sit there and I got the chance to via 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.000
 to sportze company 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.010
 to get to know where you vdl weweler 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.620
 our Apeldoorn location of VDL Group 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.390
 to handle it story and what they do 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.230
 and what I could do within such a company 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.300
 to do 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.460
 after the damage not at your expense no 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.490
 it is of course a challenge but 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.370
 it harms is just ahead of I have 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.840
 the first two months to 5 hours 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.310
 Just worked in the afternoon and after that 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.380
 means twice a week of 12 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.390
 until 5 o'clock what I got with two the 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.090
 sometimes had to do in the evening 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.470
 yeah i just have it a while ago 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.910
 that reversed what I did that half hour 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.140
 work and I and I took the second training 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.760
 to do an afternoon 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.150
 and so you just have to scan it and and 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.830
 search how that how that what works and what 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.180
 just by testing with early good in the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.740
 keep an eye on whether I am in good shape 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.360
 that just goes well 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.100
 but it will certainly also for the winter 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.780
 again sign that I agree with that 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.970
 also have to find my way but knew that 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.350
 in advance and that is the search 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.020
 it is now not a sprint team because they 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.970
 even though they go so how does that work 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.410
 how is the transition going 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.170
 well in itself are of course always 5 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.790
 sprinters so in that respect we can 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.200
 just with those care and just 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.460
 same way trainer 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.709
 but in addition we now also just have 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.260
 three long hair men who 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.600
 of course also a very good addition 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.160
 certainly in the expensive area in which we 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.739
 also just have prejudices which 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.790
 we just do bacon training 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.080
 easier slightly higher average in and 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.830
 get out of it and we are whole 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.630
 nice and able to turn and 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.640
 I guess that's just going 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.140
 addition is for that matter a 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.760
 those men are actually just too 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.490
 very surprisingly good at certain 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.470
 interval training and that makes it 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.910
 just level it up for the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.190
 for the whole team 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.140
 on average speed because also on 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.430
 the next interval training and that 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.710
 we do with eight men strong so it 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.910
 just add between two 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.830
 olympic champions of team 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.580
 hemolytic and stalls land firmly large 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.410
 house that 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.820
 only reinforce each other yes that 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.610
 I think so yes I think it is a 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.380
 yes you must of course both be fine 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.880
 define and know what you are good at 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.710
 and what your goals have come up yes 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.120
 but I think we have it all 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.580
 smart enough to know to be able to 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.000
 that yes that I am 500 fifteen hundred mine 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.800
 focus and swim he will be 1500 my 10 km 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.780
 focus and there is test pieces 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.070
 overlap in where we use the room 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.600
 and where you can't do it 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.360
 just don't do it and i think that's it 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.280
 right very well goes in direction and 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.390
 keep skating at the age of 32 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.950
 just challenge 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.900
 always remains a skating challenge and 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.200
 technical partners that always remains one 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.200
 nice challenge
