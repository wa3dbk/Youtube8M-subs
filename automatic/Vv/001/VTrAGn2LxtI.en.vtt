00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
right away with these guys not as wide

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.410 
right away with these guys not as wide
as<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.079> 360s<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.040> whether<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
as the 360s on whether that be just the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
as the 360s on whether that be just the
king<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.020> light<00:01:49.140> they<00:01:49.290> use<00:01:49.500> Tom<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.070> the

king of light they use Tom and the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670 
king of light they use Tom and the
differences<00:01:50.610> between<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:52.079> two<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.470> did

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
differences between the two but I did

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.380 
differences between the two but I did
not<00:01:52.829> feel<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.159> these<00:01:53.280> gave<00:01:53.790> me<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> same

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
not feel that these gave me the same

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.630 
not feel that these gave me the same
width<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.860> Maestri<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.340> honestly

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
width as the the Maestri is honestly

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.609 
width as the the Maestri is honestly
they<00:01:57.509> say<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.750> weren't<00:01:57.899> narrow<00:01:58.259> by<00:01:58.469> any

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
they say they weren't narrow by any

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.170 
they say they weren't narrow by any
means<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:58.979> they<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.280> felt<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.670> little<00:01:59.700> little

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
means but they just felt a little little

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.999 
means but they just felt a little little
snug<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.290> don't<00:02:01.439> think<00:02:01.590> that'd<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> huge

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
snug and I don't think that'd be a huge

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.410 
snug and I don't think that'd be a huge
deal<00:02:02.189> obviously<00:02:02.340> I've<00:02:02.640> only<00:02:02.759> demold<00:02:03.180> them<00:02:03.299> for

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
deal obviously I've only demold them for

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
deal obviously I've only demold them for
a<00:02:03.479> little<00:02:03.570> while<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.590> trick<00:02:04.829> Ortiz's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
a little while with the trick Ortiz's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580 
a little while with the trick Ortiz's
but<00:02:05.700> they<00:02:06.270> felt<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.049> more<00:02:07.290> narrow<00:02:07.439> than

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
but they felt a little more narrow than

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.770 
but they felt a little more narrow than
the<00:02:07.950> mace<00:02:08.459> trees<00:02:08.670> did<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.629> something

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the mace trees did so that's something

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.930 
the mace trees did so that's something
to<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:09.989> aware<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.739> far<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:10.950> size<00:02:11.220> wise<00:02:11.489> true

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to be aware of as far as size wise true

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.370 
to be aware of as far as size wise true
to<00:02:12.060> size<00:02:12.209> as<00:02:12.450> far<00:02:12.629> as<00:02:12.720> length

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
to size as far as length

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.930 
to size as far as length
so<00:02:13.800> stick<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.040> whatever<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.490> normally<00:02:14.610> go

obviously the Maestri 3s so I felt like

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.610 
obviously the Maestri 3s so I felt like
they're<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> little<00:02:24.510> more<00:02:24.600> narrow<00:02:24.840> in<00:02:25.470> that
