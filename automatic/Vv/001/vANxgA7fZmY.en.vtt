00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.879
 hello today we will talk to you 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.169
 about how to transplant thuya 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.119
 you may have such a problem 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.100
 if you decide to reschedule the site 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.720
 or decided to just transplant the tree with 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.820
 places to place or someone good neighbor 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.170
 you presented the fifth 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.400
 you need to dig up an adult tree 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.990
 and correctly plant here if we will 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.890
 abide by the rules under which we are now 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.870
 will tell 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.190
 the tree will take root well and will 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.100
 feel great on the new 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.770
 First place is the most important condition for 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.409
 The correct transplant tour is saving 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.489
 earthy coma 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:38.809
 earth com we tried when you to 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.399
 poured save as much as possible 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.170
 by the way u do it in general then 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.940
 easy because usui root 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.609
 the system is superficial therefore deep 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.379
 dig and breget the second is desirable and 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.239
 conditions orient thuyu to the new 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.019
 the place is also on the sides of the world as she 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.690
 grew well let's say south take a sprig 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.969
 which grew south to tie her 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.789
 some ribbon so as not to confuse 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.499
 when you put thuyu on a new place 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.670
 Orient this ribbon just as well. 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:08.030
 to the south then the date I will feel myself 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.400
 fine consensus about what 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.680
 timing is better to transplant thuyu not alone 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.180
 say autumn others say spring on 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.860
 in fact, that can be transplanted 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.630
 literally any time of year for 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.430
 except of course frost when the earth 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.840
 frozen 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.460
 although probably still the best time 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.610
 for transplanting that is autumn 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.140
 from about the end of September numbers 20 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.020
 September to 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.610
 about October 10, before the frost 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.200
 root system and that will have time 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.090
 form small suction 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.770
 rootlets that will actively absorb 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.590
 minerals and moisture 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.700
 Yes, and actually grief in the fall a lot of rain 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.320
 therefore probably 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.000
 no extra watering for you 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.869
 need and as it is correct 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.869
 I am transplanting 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.600
 means the first thing we did we 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.330
 have prepared a pit here pit should be a little 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.010
 slightly more than the root system than 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.170
 earth com this one that we 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.840
 we will replant the depth of the pit not less 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.970
 50 centimeters if you have from soil 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.320
 water fit highly desirable 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.790
 surely do some kind of drainage from 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.130
 broken brick of stone and rubble 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.230
 some kind of excess moisture when 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.090
 watering during the rains went for more 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.590
 lower layers of minerals in 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.840
 in the fall during the fall transplant 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.750
 no wear in any case 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.580
 root system why because 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.500
 minerals cause the growth of new 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.850
 shoots that obviously do not have time for winter 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.020
 ripen accordingly freeze and 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.020
 your tree will suffer 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.510
 but 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.690
 moved our washed into the landing pit 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.640
 notice the root neck 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.530
 who and should be level with 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.450
 the land is by no means buried and 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.800
 Inesh so that it does not halt then 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.180
 tree you feel ok and 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.780
 quietly fill the space 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.690
 around that and our land we have land 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.890
 specially you made a mixture of this turf 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.440
 ground a little peat and a little sand 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.590
 it all mixed up about the same 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.190
 proportions and throwing space 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.190
 around the tour 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.090
 we cover the ground with earth 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.770
 as best as possible to all the voids 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.430
 which formed there air to 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.040
 not condensed 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.380
 and now after that it is necessary that 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.920
 should shed do not regret the water buckets 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.060
 3 or even four here to pour in for not 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.940
 so much water roots 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.770
 how much to allow the earth 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.430
 evenly there spread out and fill 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.340
 all voids 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.250
 If you are not rainy 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.700
 autumn will not be rainy desirable 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.230
 water 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.750
 water once a week for two buckets 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.920
 but well for the winter of course 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.510
 tree trunk is best 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.780
 grind grind with peat 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.850
 tortures to grumble with some kind of wood chips 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.910
 even in the end dry leaves 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.810
 autumn spreading it all evenly 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.350
 about 5 10 centimeters around 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.080
 our young 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.820
 transplanted plants it will allow 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.989
 the roots do not freeze in the winter like this 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.010
 you are actually particular 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.740
 transplants one and 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.990
 In the autumn, transplanting is also possible. 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.580
 make and in early spring the main thing here is not 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.210
 skip this term otherwise plant 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.979
 will hurt 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.370
 transplanted that is immediately as soon as 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.560
 thawed earth but before the growing season 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.330
 plants of our conditions it is about 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.280
 end of march beginning of april 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.440
 here the main thing to catch this term is very 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.570
 clearly 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.070
 when you transplant that spring you can 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.140
 in the lower part i would add 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.790
 phosphate-potassium fertilizers but by no means 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.760
 case of not allowing these contacts 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.740
 fertilizer compared with the root system 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.530
 plants planting technology itself 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.330
 such as the spring and autumn transplanted 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.450
 comfort and watering necessarily once a week 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.520
 Yes, I love abundant watering 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.680
 even the hottest summer principle is quite 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.480
 You can successfully transplant thuya course for 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.190
 it is better to use container 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.660
 cultures 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.060
 But in such plastic containers they 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.130
 There are in which an earthy number 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.620
 good good so dense sprouted 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.320
 roots answer is especially important to keep 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.170
 this one is earthy in solid form 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.120
 Well, right after the transplant in the hot summer 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.160
 that and be sure to cover up 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.980
 awnings will go 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.190
 burlap some kind of craft kraft paper 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.570
 so that the scorching sun did not listen to pine needles 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.840
 until the tree takes root 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.970
 watering of course frequent well if the dealer is summer 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.880
 roast means about 2 times a week 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.500
 With a long time you need to water it 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.270
 actually here are all the features of landing 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.250
 that and in different periods in different seasons 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.720
 if you do everything neatly and with 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.340
 love that your that i'm fine 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.340
 take root and will feel good 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.350
 but
