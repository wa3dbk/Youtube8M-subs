follow where I go here some places it

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.100 
follow where I go here some places it
took<00:00:37.950> me<00:00:38.010> forever<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.760> find<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> had<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.840> cut

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
took me forever to find so I had to cut

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.240

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
it is on the map but there is the first

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
it is on the map but there is the first
piece<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> sword<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.050> they're

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
piece of the sword or it is they're

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.860 
piece of the sword or it is they're
doing<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.410> little<00:00:46.530> tea<00:00:46.710> bag<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.629> I'm<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
doing a little tea bag for you I'm the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.930 
doing a little tea bag for you I'm the
first<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> i<00:00:49.289> get<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:49.829> pretty<00:00:50.399> quickly

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
first to i get actually pretty quickly

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.560 
first to i get actually pretty quickly
on<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.750> third<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.649> after<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.010> i<00:00:53.420> cut<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
on the third but after that i cut it

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.209 
on the third but after that i cut it
basically<00:00:54.989> because<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.410> takes<00:00:55.590> forever<00:00:56.070> to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
basically because it takes forever to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.790 
basically because it takes forever to
find<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.239> there<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> next<00:00:57.960> piece<00:00:58.320> that's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
find so there is the next piece that's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.119 
find so there is the next piece that's
the<00:00:59.309> hilt<00:01:00.770> there<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.219> map<00:01:04.010> then<00:01:05.010> you
