drills<00:01:55.070> now<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.640> important<00:01:56.180> part<00:01:56.540> to

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
drills now the important part to

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.810 
drills now the important part to
remember<00:01:57.170> when<00:01:57.350> passing<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.520> ball

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
remember when passing is that the ball

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.600 
remember when passing is that the ball
should<00:01:59.390> be<00:01:59.600> at<00:01:59.869> chest<00:02:00.229> level<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:00.920> want<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:01.520> to

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
should be at chest level I want you to

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.090 
should be at chest level I want you to
go<00:02:01.789> chest<00:02:02.119> level<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.750> your<00:02:02.930> partner<00:02:03.380> going

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
back and forth while using the side step

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.160 
back and forth while using the side step
okay<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:07.850> basically<00:02:09.399> there<00:02:10.399> we<00:02:10.489> go<00:02:10.640> all<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
okay so basically there we go all the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.350 
okay so basically there we go all the
way<00:02:12.200> down<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.590> court<00:02:12.860> once<00:02:13.670> again<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.120> does

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
way down the court once again this does

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.729 
way down the court once again this does
it<00:02:14.569> allows<00:02:14.599> us<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:15.050> get<00:02:15.170> into<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.319> good<00:02:15.500> rhythm

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
it allows us to get into a good rhythm

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.800 
it allows us to get into a good rhythm
because<00:02:16.099> we<00:02:16.489> all<00:02:16.580> know<00:02:16.610> basketball<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.510> team

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
because we all know basketball is a team

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.320 
because we all know basketball is a team
sport<00:02:17.840> not<00:02:18.410> an<00:02:18.530> individual<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:20.030> allows

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
sport not an individual and this allows

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.449 
sport not an individual and this allows
us<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.630> use<00:02:21.049> our<00:02:21.170> teammates<00:02:21.739> effectively

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
us to use our teammates effectively

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.990 
us to use our teammates effectively
getting<00:02:23.150> us<00:02:23.239> ready<00:02:23.330> for<00:02:23.510> game<00:02:23.810> time<00:02:24.019> situation

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:42.660 

okay

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.730 

you
