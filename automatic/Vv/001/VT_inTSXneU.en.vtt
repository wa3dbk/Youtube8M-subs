00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
it's pretty amazing that the eels that

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.860 
it's pretty amazing that the eels that
we<00:00:08.400> have<00:00:08.580> here<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.849> Atlantic<00:00:09.210> Canada<00:00:09.300> in

that point of migration in the fall from
our<00:00:31.800> region<00:00:32.160> here<00:00:32.460> they<00:00:33.030> migrate<00:00:33.780> down<00:00:33.960> their

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
our region here they migrate down their

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.680 
our region here they migrate down their
eggs<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:35.010> released<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.149> external

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
eggs are released so it's external

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.200 
eggs are released so it's external
fertilization<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.610> eels<00:00:38.820> sort<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
fertilization and all the eels sort of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.240 
fertilization and all the eels sort of
get<00:00:39.390> together<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.200> called<00:00:40.500> pan<00:00:40.770> mixes

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
get together and it's called pan mixes

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.090 
get together and it's called pan mixes
they<00:00:41.550> hatch<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.020> winter<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.500> lepto

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
they hatch in the winter as lepto

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
cephalus what dose apply and that just

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
cephalus what dose apply and that just
basically<00:00:46.440> means<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.219> leaf<00:00:47.399> shaped<00:00:47.789> larvae

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
basically means a leaf shaped larvae

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.439 
basically means a leaf shaped larvae
they're<00:00:48.660> transparent<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.980> look<00:00:50.300> just<00:00:51.300> like

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
they're transparent they look just like

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.959 
they're transparent they look just like
leaves<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.379> they<00:00:52.890> float<00:00:53.160> along<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.579> oceans

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
leaves and they float along the oceans

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.459 
leaves and they float along the oceans
currents<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.870> stage<00:00:55.110> they're<00:00:55.320> not

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
currents at this stage they're not

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.229 
currents at this stage they're not
actually<00:00:55.800> feeding<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.340> their<00:00:56.550> mouths<00:00:56.789> they

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
actually feeding with their mouths they

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
actually feeding with their mouths they
take<00:00:57.480> all<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.780> their<00:00:58.079> nutrition<00:00:58.770> through

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
take all of their nutrition through

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
take all of their nutrition through
absorption<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> large<00:01:00.690> surface

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
absorption so they have a large surface

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.650 
absorption so they have a large surface
area<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:02.219> able<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.640> eat<00:01:02.969> things<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
area to be able to eat things in the

area to be able to eat things in the
water<00:01:03.840> column<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> left<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.830> cephalus<00:01:05.280> stage

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
water column the left of cephalus stage

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.210 
water column the left of cephalus stage
it<00:01:06.000> lasts<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> year<00:01:07.200> depending<00:01:07.680> on

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it lasts for up to a year depending on

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.120 
it lasts for up to a year depending on
where<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.479> left<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.930> cephalus<00:01:10.380> gets<00:01:10.680> carried

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
where the left of cephalus gets carried

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.880 
where the left of cephalus gets carried
to<00:01:11.520> by<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.299> currents<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.049> soon<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.560> they<00:01:13.680> start

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
to by the currents as soon as they start

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.170 
to by the currents as soon as they start
approaching<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> inland<00:01:14.549> waters<00:01:14.820> they<00:01:14.939> begin

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
approaching the inland waters they begin

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.240 
approaching the inland waters they begin
to<00:01:15.240> transform<00:01:15.750> from<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.990> leaf<00:01:16.140> clearly<00:01:17.009> flag

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
to transform from that leaf clearly flag

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.969 
to transform from that leaf clearly flag
shape<00:01:17.490> into<00:01:17.880> glass<00:01:18.360> eels<00:01:18.659> they're<00:01:19.200> very<00:01:19.470> clear

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
shape into glass eels they're very clear

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.609 
shape into glass eels they're very clear
and<00:01:20.189> they're<00:01:21.030> glass-like<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.350> where

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and they're glass-like which is where

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.170 
and they're glass-like which is where
the<00:01:22.770> term<00:01:22.979> comes<00:01:23.220> from<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> glass<00:01:23.850> eel

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the term comes from the glass eel

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.609 
the term comes from the glass eel
basically<00:01:24.810> an<00:01:24.900> eel<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.229> shape<00:01:25.470> but

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
basically an eel like shape but

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.020 
basically an eel like shape but
completely<00:01:25.920> transparent<00:01:26.580> they're<00:01:26.759> still

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
completely transparent they're still

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.410 
completely transparent they're still
very<00:01:27.360> tiny<00:01:27.829> so<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> glass<00:01:29.520> eel<00:01:29.790> stage<00:01:30.150> they

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
very tiny so at the glass eel stage they

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 
very tiny so at the glass eel stage they
lot<00:01:30.630> lack<00:01:31.020> pigment<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:31.860> they're<00:01:32.070> starting<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
lot lack pigment but they're starting to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.490 
lot lack pigment but they're starting to
make<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.909> metamorphosis<00:01:33.750> into<00:01:33.930> more<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.320> an

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
make this metamorphosis into more of an

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.410 
make this metamorphosis into more of an
adult<00:01:34.740> shape<00:01:35.310> once<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:35.820> started<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.210> into

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
adult shape once they started going into

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.490 
adult shape once they started going into
the<00:01:36.509> freshwater<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:37.170> they<00:01:37.290> start

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the freshwater then they start

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.170 
the freshwater then they start
developing<00:01:37.619> their<00:01:37.950> pigments<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.610> known

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
developing their pigments and then known

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
developing their pigments and then known
as<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.390> elders<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:40.229> define<00:01:40.829> Alvers<00:01:41.280> there's

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
as the elders we define Alvers there's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.929 
as the elders we define Alvers there's
anything<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.560> pigmented<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.040> usually<00:01:44.759> up

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
anything that's pigmented and usually up

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.389 
anything that's pigmented and usually up
to<00:01:44.970> about<00:01:45.630> 10<00:01:46.020> or<00:01:46.200> 15<00:01:46.320> centimeters<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.369> length

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
to about 10 or 15 centimeters in length

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.370 
to about 10 or 15 centimeters in length
so<00:01:47.909> right<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.360> they're<00:01:48.600> developing<00:01:49.110> color

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
so right now they're developing color

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.240 
so right now they're developing color
and<00:01:49.939> they're<00:01:50.939> usually<00:01:51.390> hiding<00:01:51.899> around

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and they're usually hiding around

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.279

atrophy they're not feeding up that
stage<00:04:15.270> anymore<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:16.169> they're<00:04:16.350> basically

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
stage anymore so they're basically

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.590 
stage anymore so they're basically
making<00:04:17.040> they're<00:04:17.370> putting<00:04:18.209> all<00:04:18.329> of<00:04:18.389> their

energy into a very lengthy migration for

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.270 
energy into a very lengthy migration for
fertilization<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:21.930> how<00:04:22.290> they<00:04:22.530> get<00:04:22.710> back<00:04:23.010> to

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
fertilization so how they get back to

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.960 
fertilization so how they get back to
the<00:04:23.400> Sargasso<00:04:24.120> Sea<00:04:24.500> barely<00:04:25.500> feeding<00:04:25.919> or<00:04:26.340> able

the Sargasso Sea barely feeding or able
to<00:04:27.090> feed<00:04:27.360> there's<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.260> real<00:04:28.680> big<00:04:28.950> question
