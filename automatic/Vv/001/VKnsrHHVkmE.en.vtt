00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.900
 so let's install 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.829
 now processes 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.829
 above asus motherboard 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.529
 What do I need to do 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:18.980
 take off 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.630
 open the mount 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.989
 defender 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.989
 some water 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.640
 raise 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.640
 iron 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.430
 while accurate sciences 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.990
 we have Kalinich 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.710
 here we have the key 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.950
 unfold 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.140
 included here the start is mocked in the rubble 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.910
 motherboard 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.710
 and in this way 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.640
 install you treat 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 for living processes 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.930
 CPU 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.140
 installed those few 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.760
 further memory 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.250
 setting 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.800
 ram as i said in 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.460
 our case will use beats 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.840
 motherboard 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.480
 It has 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.480
 four connectors 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.160
 buy 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.710
 and supports 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.840
 dual channel mode 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.050
 promptly installed 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.910
 look I have a contact 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.010
 truce 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.630
 turn the opposite 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.720
 and see what it is 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.440
 cope coincides with the maternal connector 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.330
 board 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.130
 install 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.790
 d 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 your first match of the series 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.590
 like that 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.770
 and dragged chicago 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.250
 believe that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.680
 everything is bad 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.870
 reveals 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.870
 trying on see that does not fit Muscovite 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.970
 unfold 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.850
 see that everything goes 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 leaving in the same way 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.789
 first case 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.179
 contact area 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.049
 operative rule set foot 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.049
 thousand 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:17.579
 are set 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.299
 cooling 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.229
 for this we need 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.679
 radiator 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.409
 a ton of terbatas 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.409
 in order to install 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.709
 indicator hinting 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.059
 cooling 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.579
 we take with it the danger date 14 3 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:45.829
 can be done soon 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.119
 protect gun st for scientists 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:50.839
 process contact 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.839
 Kaluga try thermal conductivity 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.449
 teams drain the russos price of our radiation 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.299
 we will install 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.379
 radiator 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.829
 our motherboard 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.009
 worth paying attention 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.009
 vain then face 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.229
 where we are 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.989
 power cooling 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.119
 for cooling 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.439
 after which immediately the required volume 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.629
 in this way 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.629
 charter capital 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.459
 our guys 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.489
 everything usually managed to stop 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.669
 each installed machines 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.069
 conflict 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.229
 so let's see what we got below 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.719
 motherboard 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.209
 turn over 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.329
 here we see 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.879
 latches 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.819
 all came out on the other side 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.069
 evenly 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.029
 latch number pairwise cross 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:09.939
 so somehow they are above 40 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:10.279
 countries
