00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.880 
was lucky enough to score a resto druid
and<00:01:55.549> a<00:01:56.549> resto<00:01:56.969> shaman<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:57.689> me<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> have

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
and a resto shaman with me so I have

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.160 
and a resto shaman with me so I have
more<00:01:59.100> than<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.549> own<00:01:59.729> healer<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.990> he

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
more than just my own healer but he

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.749 
more than just my own healer but he
decimates<00:02:01.469> healing<00:02:01.890> meters<00:02:02.100> by<00:02:02.250> about<00:02:02.430> four

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
decimates healing meters by about four

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.969 
decimates healing meters by about four
hundred<00:02:02.880> percent<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.479> doesn't<00:02:03.659> matter

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
hundred percent so it doesn't matter

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.150 
hundred percent so it doesn't matter
here<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.460> both<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.850> debuff<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.890> both<00:02:07.890> flags

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
here we both have debuff and both flags

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.999 
here we both have debuff and both flags
are<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.489> at<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.789> their<00:02:08.970> base<00:02:09.379> this<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.619> so

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
are going at it in their base this is so

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.000 
are going at it in their base this is so

kid<00:02:22.099> snares<00:02:22.370> killed<00:02:22.700> him<00:02:22.849> I<00:02:23.060> can't<00:02:23.989> click<00:02:24.170> it

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
kid snares killed him I can't click it

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.190 
kid snares killed him I can't click it
in<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.470> solar<00:02:24.680> beam<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.010> couldn't<00:02:25.280> see<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.579> and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
in the solar beam I couldn't see it and

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.809 
in the solar beam I couldn't see it and
they're<00:02:27.200> ret<00:02:27.860> pally<00:02:28.040> gets<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.549> then<00:02:28.700> that

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
they're ret pally gets it and then that

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.660 
they're ret pally gets it and then that
runs<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.390> way<00:02:29.629> from<00:02:29.690> his<00:02:30.110> healers<00:02:30.560> why<00:02:31.340> he's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
runs a way from his healers why he's

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.190 
runs a way from his healers why he's
running<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.239> flag<00:02:32.480> cap<00:02:32.750> when<00:02:32.930> he's<00:02:33.019> being

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
running to the flag cap when he's being

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.160 
running to the flag cap when he's being
chased<00:02:33.650> by<00:02:33.860> our<00:02:34.129> flag<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.670> have<00:02:34.849> no<00:02:35.120> idea<00:02:35.540> it

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
chased by our flag I have no idea it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.309 
chased by our flag I have no idea it
seems<00:02:36.409> just<00:02:36.590> like<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.709> generally<00:02:37.159> stupid<00:02:37.519> idea

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
seems just like a generally stupid idea

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.949 
seems just like a generally stupid idea
so<00:02:39.319> we<00:02:39.440> kill<00:02:39.590> him<00:02:40.420> now<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.450> get<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> hundred

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
so we kill him now I get a hundred

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.170 
so we kill him now I get a hundred
percent<00:02:42.140> key<00:02:42.500> but<00:02:42.799> I<00:02:42.859> have<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.250> run<00:02:43.459> back<00:02:43.489> I

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
percent key but I have to run back I

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.149 
percent key but I have to run back I
thought<00:02:44.750> there<00:02:44.930> was<00:02:45.049> more<00:02:45.079> time<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:45.799> and

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
thought there was more time on this and

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.520 
thought there was more time on this and
this<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.489> probably<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.000> best<00:02:47.870> chance<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.379> have

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
this is probably the best chance I have

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.360 
this is probably the best chance I have
of<00:02:48.560> dying<00:02:49.280> um<00:02:50.409> other<00:02:51.409> than<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:51.889> now<00:02:52.129> we're

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
of dying um other than that now we're

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.589 
of dying um other than that now we're
just<00:02:52.459> going<00:02:52.609> to<00:02:52.760> run<00:02:52.879> back<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.120> our<00:02:53.450> entire

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
just going to run back and our entire

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.140 
just going to run back and our entire
teams<00:02:53.959> with<00:02:54.170> me<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:54.700> they<00:02:55.700> have<00:02:55.849> a<00:02:55.909> hundred

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
teams with me and they have a hundred

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.910 
teams with me and they have a hundred
percent<00:02:56.209> debuff<00:02:56.629> too<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.290> if<00:02:57.530> someone<00:02:57.709> breaks

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
percent debuff too so if someone breaks

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.069 
percent debuff too so if someone breaks
off<00:02:58.129> to<00:02:58.250> get<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.519> flag<00:02:58.760> one<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.359> our<00:02:59.480> dps<00:02:59.780> can
