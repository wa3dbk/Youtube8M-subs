00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
hello everyone I'm Josh Oakland with

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.390 
hello everyone I'm Josh Oakland with
Lady<00:00:07.140> contractors<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.040> today<00:00:08.189> we're<00:00:08.309> going

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
Lady contractors and today we're going

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.129 
Lady contractors and today we're going
to<00:00:08.490> talk<00:00:08.700> about<00:00:08.880> how<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.450> replace<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.960> element

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
to talk about how to replace the element

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.770 
to talk about how to replace the element
in<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.950> glass<00:00:11.160> top<00:00:11.429> range<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.509> will<00:00:12.690> be

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
in a glass top range so this will be

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.950 
in a glass top range so this will be
using<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.490> drill<00:00:14.490> with<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.389> Phillips<00:00:15.780> head<00:00:15.929> bit

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
using a drill with a Phillips head bit

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.920 
using a drill with a Phillips head bit
in<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.940> it's<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> good<00:00:18.090> idea<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.480> have<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> wide

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
in it it's a good idea to have a wide

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.540 
in it it's a good idea to have a wide
range<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.350> bits<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.100> because<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.430> don't

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
range of bits on you because you don't

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.220 
range of bits on you because you don't
know<00:00:20.760> exactly<00:00:21.330> what's<00:00:21.600> going<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
know exactly what's going to be in the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.040 
know exactly what's going to be in the
stove<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.910> glass<00:00:24.090> top<00:00:24.330> stove<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.840> two

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
stove on a glass top stove you have two

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.529 
stove on a glass top stove you have two
screws<00:00:25.410> holding<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.279> top<00:00:26.580> down<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.330> want<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
screws holding the top down you want to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.240 
screws holding the top down you want to
go<00:00:27.599> ahead<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.869> remove<00:00:27.990> those<00:00:28.380> screws<00:00:31.250> make

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
go ahead and remove those screws make

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.770 
go ahead and remove those screws make
sure<00:00:32.399> you're<00:00:32.550> very<00:00:32.579> careful<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.450> part

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
sure you're very careful with this part

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.380 
sure you're very careful with this part
because<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.230> glass<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.100> very<00:00:35.880> fragile

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
because it is glass and very fragile

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.470 
because it is glass and very fragile
here<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.110> elements<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:39.809> wiring<00:00:40.050> held<00:00:40.800> in

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
here are elements and the wiring held in

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.720 
here are elements and the wiring held in
but<00:00:42.480> each<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:43.110> screw<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.500> each<00:00:43.710> side<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.579> want

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
but each one screw on each side you want

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.160 
but each one screw on each side you want
to<00:00:44.789> make<00:00:44.910> sure<00:00:47.300> that<00:00:48.300> those<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.539> removed<00:00:48.750> very

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
to make sure that those are removed very

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.880 
to make sure that those are removed very
carefully<00:00:53.989> now<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.410> our<00:00:55.530> screws

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
carefully now that we have our screws

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.310 
carefully now that we have our screws
off<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> want<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> gently<00:00:56.730> remove<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.629> coils

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
off you want to gently remove the coils

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.240 
off you want to gently remove the coils
I<00:00:59.840> like<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.960> take<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> picture<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
I like to take a picture of all the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
I like to take a picture of all the
wiring<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.600> way<00:01:03.719> when<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> put<00:01:04.350> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
wiring so that way when you go to put it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.750 
wiring so that way when you go to put it
back<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.650> know<00:01:04.949> exactly<00:01:05.369> where<00:01:05.549> everything

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
back you know exactly where everything

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.109 
back you know exactly where everything
goes<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.740> lot<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.860> times<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.970> actually

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
goes a lot of times you have to actually

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.600 
goes a lot of times you have to actually
order<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:10.260> coils<00:01:10.650> through<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
order these coils through the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.570 
order these coils through the
manufacturer<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.280> want<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> make<00:01:14.549> sure

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
manufacturer so you want to make sure

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
manufacturer so you want to make sure
you<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:15.000> model<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.540> serial<00:01:16.049> number

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
you get your model and serial number

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.300 
you get your model and serial number
down<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:18.229> order<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> part<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.040> lot<00:01:20.220> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
down to order the part and a lot of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.830 
down to order the part and a lot of
times<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.790> find<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> part<00:01:21.390> number<00:01:21.720> on

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
times you can find the part number on

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.690 
times you can find the part number on
the<00:01:22.560> coil<00:01:22.799> itself<00:01:25.159> now<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.580> our

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the coil itself now that we have our

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.700 
the coil itself now that we have our
wires<00:01:27.119> remove<00:01:28.250> these<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.520> held<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:30.680> by<00:01:31.680> two

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
wires remove these are held in by two

clamps you want to go ahead and remove

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.289 
clamps you want to go ahead and remove
those<00:01:36.380> on<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.880> our<00:01:39.030> model

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
those on this one we have our model

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.210 
those on this one we have our model
number<00:01:39.540> located<00:01:39.869> right<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.170> back<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> coil

number located right on back of the coil

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.240 
number located right on back of the coil
that<00:01:41.720> allows<00:01:42.720> us<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.590> part<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.189> are
