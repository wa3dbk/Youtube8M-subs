 I own the minecraft manual explain 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.689

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:24.510
 may have done on the spot cable hd tv hd 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.609
 in each portal stage in the game but not 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.240
 it worked out 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:33.230
 so if you enter the system 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.340
 video console settings 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.090

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.350
 You put love not even eighty there. 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:50.879
 again start with 824 in 70 and 80 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:58.969
 and preferably left screen hdmi cable 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.969
 Then you will enter maine craft. 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.750
 You will connect a second control can 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.750

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.770
 iacc appears as this screen as i 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.910
 would prefer not to be subject to 'cause' 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.110
 There you have a second control. 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.730

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:56.230

 the two initial presses will load the 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:05.430
 profiles and went into the match 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:15.700
 You can see both profiles are here. 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:23.190
