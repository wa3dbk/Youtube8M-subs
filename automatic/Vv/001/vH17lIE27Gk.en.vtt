go through that exit and progress on to
the<00:01:55.340> next<00:01:55.520> level<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.750> have<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:56.960> time<00:01:57.200> limit

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the next level you have a time limit

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.770 
the next level you have a time limit
which<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.830> your<00:01:57.979> air<00:01:58.189> at<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.490> bottom<00:01:58.820> it's

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
which is your air at the bottom it's

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.810 
which is your air at the bottom it's
slowly<00:02:00.560> decreasing<00:02:01.250> as<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.430> go<00:02:01.520> through<00:02:01.700> the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
slowly decreasing as you go through the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.179 
slowly decreasing as you go through the
level<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:03.460> there<00:02:04.460> are<00:02:04.670> 20<00:02:05.330> levels<00:02:05.509> in<00:02:05.840> all<00:02:06.189> to

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
level and there are 20 levels in all to

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.330 
level and there are 20 levels in all to
complete<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.640> game<00:02:08.799> when<00:02:09.799> you<00:02:09.890> complete<00:02:10.220> the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
complete the game when you complete the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.210 
complete the game when you complete the
game<00:02:10.519> it<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.269> loops<00:02:11.690> again<00:02:12.190> which<00:02:13.190> is

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
game it just loops again which is

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.350 
game it just loops again which is
disappointing<00:02:13.970> but<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:16.640> those<00:02:16.820> days<00:02:16.880> they

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
disappointing but in those days they

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.650 
disappointing but in those days they
didn't<00:02:17.600> have<00:02:19.660> endings<00:02:20.950> very<00:02:21.950> often<00:02:22.660> so

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
didn't have endings very often so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.390 
didn't have endings very often so
basically<00:02:23.900> that's<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.260> first<00:02:24.470> level<00:02:24.709> that

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
basically that's the first level that

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.520 
basically that's the first level that
took<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.730> lot<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:25.970> practice<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.420> do<00:02:26.690> when<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.410> was

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
took a lot of practice to do when I was

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.410 
took a lot of practice to do when I was
younger<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.860> try<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.160> do<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.519> level<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.060> could

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
younger I try to do that level I could

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.790 
younger I try to do that level I could
never<00:02:29.630> do<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.140> could<00:02:30.319> only<00:02:30.440> get<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.709> the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
never do it I could only get to the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.300 
never do it I could only get to the
second<00:02:31.099> level<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.430> then<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.610> would<00:02:31.760> die

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
second level and then I would die

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.380 
second level and then I would die
this<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.700> second<00:02:34.000> level<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:37.060> know<00:02:37.150> just

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
this is the second level you know just

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.690 
this is the second level you know just

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
can just skip through the levels if only

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.100 
can just skip through the levels if only
I<00:03:28.810> knew<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.019> when<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.349> was<00:03:29.440> younger<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.840> here<00:03:31.989> I

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
I knew that when I was younger so here I

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.420 
I knew that when I was younger so here I
am<00:03:32.170> skipping<00:03:32.530> through<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.890> different<00:03:33.160> levels

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
am skipping through the different levels

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.210 
am skipping through the different levels
but<00:03:33.640> just<00:03:33.819> holding<00:03:34.239> down<00:03:34.360> different<00:03:34.720> keys<00:03:35.220> and

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
but just holding down different keys and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.310 
but just holding down different keys and
what<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.400> do<00:03:36.519> is<00:03:36.670> if<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.030> go<00:03:37.209> to<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.750> very<00:03:38.109> last

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
what I do is if I go to the very last

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.870 
what I do is if I go to the very last
level<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:39.040> i'll<00:03:39.280> just<00:03:39.430> show<00:03:39.609> you<00:03:39.640> how<00:03:39.820> to

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
level and i'll just show you how to

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.199 
level and i'll just show you how to
complete<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.420> game<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:42.310> if<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.820> just<00:03:42.850> hold<00:03:43.120> down

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
complete the game so if I just hold down

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.229 
complete the game so if I just hold down
these<00:03:43.510> four<00:03:43.959> keys<00:03:44.200> now<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:45.250> takes<00:03:45.640> me<00:03:45.910> through

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
these four keys now it takes me through

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.270 
these four keys now it takes me through
to<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.900> final<00:03:47.260> barrier<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:50.410> this<00:03:50.560> was<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.769> if

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
to the final barrier so this was the if

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.970 
to the final barrier so this was the if
you<00:03:51.459> were<00:03:51.609> lucky<00:03:52.329> enough<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.750> get<00:03:52.870> survive<00:03:53.650> the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
you were lucky enough to get survive the

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.099 
you were lucky enough to get survive the
other<00:03:54.640> 19<00:03:55.090> levels<00:03:55.480> this<00:03:55.600> would<00:03:55.750> be<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.930> last

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
other 19 levels this would be the last

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.559 
other 19 levels this would be the last
one<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.700> as<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.880> can<00:03:58.000> see<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.299> go<00:03:58.420> for

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
one so as you can see you go for

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.970 
one so as you can see you go for
collecting<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.049> keys<00:03:59.230> again<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.709> the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
collecting the keys again and the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.699 
collecting the keys again and the
doorway<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:00.850> a<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.600> Omega<00:04:02.230> side<00:04:02.470> which

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
doorway is that a the Omega side which

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.069 
doorway is that a the Omega side which
is<00:04:02.739> at<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:02.980> top<00:04:03.130> of<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.370> screen<00:04:03.430> there<00:04:04.079> in

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
is at the top of the screen there in

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.059 
is at the top of the screen there in
purple<00:04:05.829> and<00:04:05.980> yellow<00:04:07.500> just<00:04:08.500> have<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.709> wait<00:04:08.829> here

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
purple and yellow just have to wait here

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.069 
purple and yellow just have to wait here
for<00:04:09.130> a<00:04:09.310> second<00:04:09.670> because<00:04:10.420> you<00:04:10.569> have<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.840> time<00:04:11.049> it

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
for a second because you have to time it

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.559 
for a second because you have to time it
right<00:04:11.230> cell<00:04:12.010> at<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.160> eye<00:04:12.280> at<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:12.940> end<00:04:13.209> done

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
right cell at the eye at the end done

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.969 
right cell at the eye at the end done
the<00:04:13.750> hit<00:04:13.870> yours<00:04:14.139> you<00:04:14.290> jump<00:04:14.500> over<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:17.530> base<00:04:17.709> its

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
the hit yours you jump over so base its

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.920 
the hit yours you jump over so base its
last<00:04:18.250> level<00:04:18.430> which<00:04:19.060> i<00:04:19.209> think<00:04:19.419> is<00:04:19.510> easier<00:04:19.900> than

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
last level which i think is easier than

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.909 
last level which i think is easier than
the<00:04:20.109> first<00:04:20.260> level<00:04:20.530> strangely<00:04:21.160> enough<00:04:21.310> but

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
the first level strangely enough but

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.760 
the first level strangely enough but
anyway<00:04:23.919> by<00:04:24.729> using<00:04:24.880> this<00:04:25.090> cheat<00:04:25.389> you<00:04:25.570> can<00:04:25.770> test

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
anyway by using this cheat you can test

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.409 
anyway by using this cheat you can test
out<00:04:26.950> every<00:04:27.250> level<00:04:27.490> in<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.610> game<00:04:27.700> which<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.240> a
