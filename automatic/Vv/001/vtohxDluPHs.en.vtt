filter<00:00:21.790> so<00:00:22.779> this<00:00:23.200> is<00:00:23.320> a<00:00:23.349> photo<00:00:23.680> that<00:00:23.800> I<00:00:24.009> took

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
filter so this is a photo that I took

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.749 
filter so this is a photo that I took
with<00:00:24.670> a<00:00:24.939> 4<00:00:25.480> second<00:00:25.900> exposure<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.430> reason<00:00:27.669> I

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
with a 4 second exposure the reason I

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.550 
with a 4 second exposure the reason I
took<00:00:27.970> it<00:00:28.150> with<00:00:28.300> 4<00:00:28.630> seconds<00:00:29.050> is<00:00:29.259> so<00:00:29.410> that<00:00:29.529> I

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
took it with 4 seconds is so that I

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.470 
took it with 4 seconds is so that I
could<00:00:29.770> get<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:30.040> lake<00:00:30.250> kind<00:00:30.790> of<00:00:30.910> all<00:00:31.060> misty

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
could get the lake kind of all misty

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.810 
could get the lake kind of all misty
like<00:00:31.660> that<00:00:31.869> but<00:00:32.619> because<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.130> have<00:00:33.310> a<00:00:33.340> person<00:00:33.730> in

like that but because I have a person in

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.930 
like that but because I have a person in
the<00:00:34.060> photo<00:00:34.780> obviously<00:00:35.530> they<00:00:35.829> can't<00:00:36.730> stand

photo<00:02:15.760> on<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> tripod<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.770> doesn't

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
photo on a tripod but that doesn't

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.880 
photo on a tripod but that doesn't
necessarily<00:02:18.840> mean<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.200> didn't<00:02:20.650> get<00:02:20.710> any

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
necessarily mean that I didn't get any

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.670 
necessarily mean that I didn't get any
camera<00:02:21.280> shake<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.210> want<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.960> all

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
camera shake so I want to all

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.640 
camera shake so I want to all
so<00:02:23.829> reduce<00:02:24.159> some<00:02:24.760> blur<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.019> stones<00:02:26.319> here

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
so reduce some blur in the stones here

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.170 
so reduce some blur in the stones here
at<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.920> bottom<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.400> photo<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:27.760> I'm<00:02:28.030> going

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
at the bottom of the photo so I'm going

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.490 
at the bottom of the photo so I'm going
to<00:02:29.310> put<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.579> blur<00:02:31.329> estimation<00:02:31.989> region<00:02:32.349> down

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
to put that blur estimation region down

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.270 
to put that blur estimation region down
there<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.450> then<00:02:35.140> if<00:02:35.319> I'm<00:02:35.530> happy<00:02:35.799> with<00:02:36.040> it

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
there and then if I'm happy with it

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.539 
there and then if I'm happy with it
I<00:02:36.549> click<00:02:37.060> OK<00:02:37.420> if<00:02:37.689> not<00:02:38.379> you<00:02:38.680> have<00:02:38.859> some<00:02:39.099> sliders

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
I click OK if not you have some sliders

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.949 
I click OK if not you have some sliders
here<00:02:39.909> that<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.139> can<00:02:41.590> adjust<00:02:41.859> to<00:02:42.719> increase<00:02:43.719> or

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
here that you can adjust to increase or

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.020 
here that you can adjust to increase or
decrease<00:02:44.139> the<00:02:44.439> amount<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:45.040> Shake<00:02:45.310> Reduction

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
decrease the amount of Shake Reduction

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.009 
decrease the amount of Shake Reduction
that<00:02:46.569> Photoshop<00:02:46.900> applies<00:02:47.439> or<00:02:47.969> you<00:02:48.969> can<00:02:49.359> apply

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
that Photoshop applies or you can apply

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.199 
that Photoshop applies or you can apply
artifact<00:02:50.650> suppression<00:02:51.250> if<00:02:51.459> necessary

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
artifact suppression if necessary

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.410 
artifact suppression if necessary
because<00:02:53.519> you're<00:02:54.519> reducing<00:02:54.939> shake<00:02:55.180> you're

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
because you're reducing shake you're

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.080 
because you're reducing shake you're
adding<00:02:55.689> sharpness<00:02:56.139> to<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.409> photo<00:02:57.090> sometimes

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
adding sharpness to this photo sometimes

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.390 
adding sharpness to this photo sometimes
you<00:02:58.239> might<00:02:58.359> have<00:02:58.510> some<00:02:58.689> artifacts<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.620> you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
you might have some artifacts and you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.129 
you might have some artifacts and you
might<00:03:00.549> have<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.819> apply<00:03:01.480> quite<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.840> bit<00:03:02.019> of

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.139 
might have to apply quite a bit of

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.750 
might have to apply quite a bit of
artifact<00:03:02.709> suppression<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.310> get<00:03:03.430> rid<00:03:03.579> of<00:03:03.669> those

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
artifact suppression to get rid of those

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.360 
artifact suppression to get rid of those
but<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:05.109> case<00:03:05.319> I'm<00:03:05.590> pretty<00:03:05.799> happy<00:03:06.040> with

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
but in this case I'm pretty happy with

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.399 
but in this case I'm pretty happy with
photoshop<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.269> done<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.750> I'm<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:08.230> going<00:03:08.349> to

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
photoshop is done so I'm just going to

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.740 
photoshop is done so I'm just going to
click<00:03:08.650> OK<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.909> will<00:03:10.090> bring<00:03:10.269> me<00:03:10.329> back

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
click OK and that will bring me back

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.369 
click OK and that will bring me back
into<00:03:11.549> Photoshop<00:03:15.000> ok<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.060> I'm<00:03:16.329> back<00:03:16.389> into<00:03:16.810> my

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
into Photoshop ok so I'm back into my

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.069 
into Photoshop ok so I'm back into my
photoshop<00:03:18.250> window<00:03:18.609> here<00:03:18.909> and<00:03:19.090> if<00:03:19.719> I<00:03:19.840> turn<00:03:19.900> that

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
photoshop window here and if I turn that

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.429 
photoshop window here and if I turn that
layer<00:03:20.500> off<00:03:20.579> you<00:03:21.579> can<00:03:21.730> see<00:03:21.909> the<00:03:22.319> with<00:03:23.319> the

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:23.439 
layer off you can see the with the

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.709 
layer off you can see the with the
original<00:03:23.829> photo<00:03:24.040> look<00:03:24.280> like<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.790> then<00:03:25.359> with

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:25.719 
original photo look like and then with

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.750 
original photo look like and then with
that<00:03:25.959> layer<00:03:26.200> on<00:03:26.439> with<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.280> shake<00:03:27.639> reduction

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
that layer on with the shake reduction

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.330 
that layer on with the shake reduction
and<00:03:28.299> it's<00:03:29.290> pretty<00:03:29.500> subtle<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:29.979> I'm<00:03:30.099> going<00:03:30.250> to

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
and it's pretty subtle so I'm going to

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.509 
and it's pretty subtle so I'm going to
zoom<00:03:30.489> in<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.440> think<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.739> can<00:03:32.919> see<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.280> bit

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
zoom in and I think you can see a bit

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.960 
zoom in and I think you can see a bit
better<00:03:33.729> in<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.290> in<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.440> close-up<00:03:35.709> what<00:03:36.280> has

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
better in the in the close-up what has

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.149 
better in the in the close-up what has
happened<00:03:37.419> there<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:37.810> that's<00:03:38.049> that's<00:03:38.919> the

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
happened there so that's that's the

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.250 
happened there so that's that's the
after<00:03:39.280> with<00:03:39.729> the<00:03:39.909> shake<00:03:40.209> reduction<00:03:40.359> applied

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
after with the shake reduction applied

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.439 
after with the shake reduction applied
and<00:03:41.909> here's<00:03:42.909> how<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.419> looked<00:03:43.629> before<00:03:44.139> and<00:03:45.449> is

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
and here's how it looked before and is

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.800 
and here's how it looked before and is
even<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.199> rock<00:03:47.439> so<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:47.709> can<00:03:47.889> see<00:03:48.810> even

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
even in the rock so you can see even

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.499 
even in the rock so you can see even
with<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.019> on<00:03:50.199> a<00:03:50.229> tripod<00:03:50.590> there<00:03:51.040> is<00:03:51.189> some

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:51.509 
with that on a tripod there is some

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.089 
with that on a tripod there is some
camera<00:03:52.509> shake<00:03:52.689> there<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.169> the<00:03:53.889> shake

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
camera shake there and the shake

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.140 
camera shake there and the shake
reduction<00:03:54.280> filter<00:03:54.879> just<00:03:56.579> makes<00:03:57.579> that<00:03:57.849> all

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
reduction filter just makes that all

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.059 
reduction filter just makes that all
that<00:03:58.599> more<00:03:58.810> sharper<00:03:59.259> and<00:03:59.470> totally<00:03:59.829> cleans

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
that more sharper and totally cleans

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.890 
that more sharper and totally cleans
that<00:04:00.220> up<00:04:00.280> I'll<00:04:01.269> show<00:04:01.449> you<00:04:01.509> a<00:04:01.629> different

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
that up I'll show you a different

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.189 
that up I'll show you a different
example<00:04:01.959> here<00:04:02.620> here's<00:04:03.040> another<00:04:03.099> photo<00:04:04.199> same

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
example here here's another photo same

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.460 
example here here's another photo same
idea<00:04:05.560> this<00:04:05.859> was<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.280> long<00:04:06.729> I<00:04:07.569> think<00:04:08.109> this<00:04:08.259> was<00:04:08.379> a

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
idea this was a long I think this was a

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.749 
idea this was a long I think this was a
two-second<00:04:09.069> exposure<00:04:09.509> but<00:04:11.489> because<00:04:12.489> of

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:12.759 
two-second exposure but because of

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:14.879 
two-second exposure but because of
camera<00:04:13.479> shake<00:04:13.629> and<00:04:13.900> also<00:04:14.139> because<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.590> model

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
camera shake and also because the model

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.860 
camera shake and also because the model
can't<00:04:15.069> stay<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.609> can't<00:04:16.239> stay<00:04:16.449> perfectly

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
can't stay and can't stay perfectly

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.899 
can't stay and can't stay perfectly
still<00:04:16.959> for<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.530> long<00:04:17.590> there's<00:04:18.489> some<00:04:18.699> shake

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
still for that long there's some shake

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.029 
still for that long there's some shake
going<00:04:19.090> on<00:04:19.359> there<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:19.840> that's<00:04:20.079> with<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.650> shake

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
going on there so that's with the shake

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.170 
going on there so that's with the shake
reduction<00:04:21.159> applied<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:22.289> that's<00:04:23.289> without<00:04:23.889> it

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
reduction applied and that's without it

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.469 
reduction applied and that's without it
again<00:04:25.180> it's<00:04:25.389> fairly<00:04:25.960> subtle<00:04:26.460> unless<00:04:27.460> we<00:04:28.240> zoom
