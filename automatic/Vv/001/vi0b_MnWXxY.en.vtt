00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.130 
he stays in with a sleeping Farian so
now<00:00:47.670> I'll<00:00:47.760> start<00:00:47.910> setting<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.300> spikes<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
now I'll start setting up spikes and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.069 
now I'll start setting up spikes and
stuff<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.390> that's<00:00:51.390> pretty<00:00:51.510> much<00:00:51.660> all<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.960> do

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
stuff and that's pretty much all I do

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.740 
stuff and that's pretty much all I do
until<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.590> wakes<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.070> kills<00:00:53.250> me<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> think

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
until you wakes up and kills me I think

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.270 
until you wakes up and kills me I think
yes<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.899> wicks<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.440> superpowers<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
yes a wicks up you superpowers and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.220 
yes a wicks up you superpowers and
that's<00:00:56.550> pretty<00:00:56.670> much<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.940> end<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.270> Myrtle

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that's pretty much the end of Myrtle

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
that's pretty much the end of Myrtle
there<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.460> think<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.670> got<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.910> two<00:01:00.059> layers

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
there so I think I got like two layers

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.209 
there so I think I got like two layers
of<00:01:00.359> spikes<00:01:00.660> down<00:01:00.870> which<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.350> pretty<00:01:01.680> good<00:01:01.859> plus

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
of spikes down which is pretty good plus

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.260 
of spikes down which is pretty good plus

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
stealth rocks so Sparkle didn't shop

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.200 
stealth rocks so Sparkle didn't shop
pretty<00:01:06.510> much<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> go<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> Sue's<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:08.939> to

Ghost
well<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.570> quarter<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.409> still

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
well so that's like a quarter but still

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.459 
well so that's like a quarter but still
that's<00:02:04.799> not<00:02:04.979> enough<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.670> busted<00:02:06.090> or

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
that's not enough or is that busted or

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.719 
that's not enough or is that busted or
you<00:02:07.469> know<00:02:07.590> said<00:02:07.829> are<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.069> trying<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> lot

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
you know said are you trying to do a lot

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.180 
you know said are you trying to do a lot
more<00:02:08.910> than<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.479> I'll<00:02:10.440> go<00:02:10.709> Salamis

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
more than that so I'll go Salamis

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.050 
more than that so I'll go Salamis
because<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:12.209> don't<00:02:12.930> know<00:02:12.989> how<00:02:13.080> speed<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.590> and

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
because I don't know how speed it and

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.040 
because I don't know how speed it and
hoping<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.150> might<00:02:15.270> be<00:02:15.420> able<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.599> kill<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.840> with

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
hoping I might be able to kill it with

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.309 
hoping I might be able to kill it with
my<00:02:16.080> specs<00:02:17.010> jackal<00:02:17.459> meteor<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.930> course<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
my specs jackal meteor and of course I

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.740 
my specs jackal meteor and of course I
do

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
do

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.740 
do
so<00:02:21.750> now<00:02:22.200> he<00:02:22.260> decided<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.830> bring<00:02:23.010> out<00:02:23.190> his

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
so now he decided to bring out his

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.800 
so now he decided to bring out his
hitmonlee<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:26.430> go<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.790> UM<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.540> thing

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
hitmonlee and I go to UM this thing

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.990 
hitmonlee and I go to UM this thing
thinking<00:02:28.680> anywhere<00:02:28.950> tried<00:02:29.190> like<00:02:29.340> stone<00:02:29.760> nodes

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
thinking anywhere tried like stone nodes

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.440 
thinking anywhere tried like stone nodes
or<00:02:30.120> something<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.599> he<00:02:30.660> actually<00:02:30.810> blaze<00:02:31.349> kicks

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
or something but he actually blaze kicks

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.100 
or something but he actually blaze kicks
so<00:02:33.450> oh<00:02:34.310> well<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> still<00:02:35.940> didn't<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.810> still

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
so oh well I still didn't do it still

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.540 
so oh well I still didn't do it still
would've<00:02:37.349> did<00:02:37.470> lessons<00:02:37.830> don't<00:02:38.129> it<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.400> guess

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
would've did lessons don't it I guess

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.420 
would've did lessons don't it I guess
but<00:02:38.879> still<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:40.260> he<00:02:40.620> goes<00:02:40.739> this<00:02:40.980> thing<00:02:41.190> when<00:02:41.400> I

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
but still so he goes this thing when I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.110 
but still so he goes this thing when I
start<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.760> bolt<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:43.250> it's<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.430> nothing<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.970> it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
start a bolt and it's like nothing to it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.000 
start a bolt and it's like nothing to it
because<00:02:45.510> Meganium<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.440> such<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> beast<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.480> now

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
because Meganium is such a beast so now

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.619 
because Meganium is such a beast so now
I<00:02:50.010> think<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.519> ice<00:02:50.760> period<00:02:51.150> or<00:02:51.239> something<00:02:51.420> a

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
I think I ice period or something a

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.490 
I think I ice period or something a
toxic<00:02:52.080> out<00:02:52.260> know<00:02:52.410> what<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.560> do<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:54.440> yeah<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.470> can

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
toxic out know what I do so yeah I can

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.320 
toxic out know what I do so yeah I can
ice<00:02:55.800> beam<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.190> he<00:02:56.370> switches<00:02:56.700> back<00:02:57.000> into

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
ice beam and he switches back into

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.309 
ice beam and he switches back into
hitmonlee<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.769> ice<00:02:58.890> beam<00:02:59.780> does<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.050> don't

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
hitmonlee and the ice beam does I don't

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.860 
hitmonlee and the ice beam does I don't
came<00:03:01.530> out<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.800> damage<00:03:02.129> so<00:03:03.000> now<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> go<00:03:03.510> into

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
came out of damage so now I go into

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.520 
came out of damage so now I go into
Gyarados<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.620> Tim<00:03:04.920> ate<00:03:05.099> it<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:06.300> this<00:03:07.110> time<00:03:07.349> you

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
Gyarados to Tim ate it and this time you

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.070 
Gyarados to Tim ate it and this time you
actually<00:03:07.650> goes<00:03:08.069> for<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.459> Stone<00:03:08.670> Edge<00:03:09.260> and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
actually goes for the Stone Edge and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.869 
actually goes for the Stone Edge and
there's<00:03:13.080> about<00:03:13.500> half<00:03:13.650> after<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.400> intimidate

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
there's about half after to intimidate

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.850 
there's about half after to intimidate
which<00:03:15.060> is<00:03:15.209> pretty<00:03:15.360> cool<00:03:15.599> I<00:03:15.629> guess<00:03:16.760> but<00:03:18.860> does

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
which is pretty cool I guess but does

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.000 
which is pretty cool I guess but does
switch<00:03:20.280> out<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:21.090> go<00:03:21.209> for<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.420> waterfall

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
switch out and I go for the waterfall

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.100 
switch out and I go for the waterfall
and<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.580> resists<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.180> stuff<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.900> doesn't

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
and it resists and stuff so it doesn't

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.500 
and it resists and stuff so it doesn't
do<00:03:25.170> much<00:03:25.379> damage<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.459> now<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.060> know<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.390> can't

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
amount of damage I guess but I can't be

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:25.759 
amount of damage I guess but I can't be
taking<00:06:24.899> off<00:06:24.990> forever<00:06:25.199> because<00:06:25.469> I<00:06:25.529> got<00:06:25.649> no

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
it's like 69 hit points before leftovers

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.550 
it's like 69 hit points before leftovers
so<00:06:39.840> um<00:06:40.730> start<00:06:41.730> as<00:06:41.850> mrs.<00:06:42.240> of<00:06:42.390> chorus<00:06:42.780> and<00:06:43.170> he

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
the grass that Meganium is and not just

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.610 
the grass that Meganium is and not just
going<00:07:07.890> this<00:07:08.270> Salamence<00:07:09.270> because<00:07:09.630> it's<00:07:10.500> gonna

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 
going this Salamence because it's gonna

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.320 
going this Salamence because it's gonna
bring<00:07:10.770> in<00:07:10.860> the<00:07:10.920> Meganium<00:07:11.400> she's<00:07:11.670> last<00:07:11.910> Pokemon

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.310 
bring in the Meganium she's last Pokemon
I'm<00:07:12.570> just<00:07:12.690> going<00:07:12.810> to<00:07:12.870> hit<00:07:12.930> with<00:07:13.020> the<00:07:13.080> fire

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
I'm just going to hit with the fire

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.470 
I'm just going to hit with the fire
blast<00:07:13.650> and<00:07:14.100> it's<00:07:14.340> gonna<00:07:14.460> be<00:07:14.640> good<00:07:14.850> game<00:07:15.060> but<00:07:15.360> of

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.480 
blast and it's gonna be good game but of

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.320 
blast and it's gonna be good game but of
course<00:07:15.720> fire<00:07:15.930> last<00:07:16.200> misses<00:07:16.730> but<00:07:17.730> energy<00:07:18.180> ball

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
course fire last misses but energy ball

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.570 
course fire last misses but energy ball
doesn't<00:07:18.570> do<00:07:18.660> anything<00:07:19.020> to<00:07:19.560> a<00:07:20.010> salamence

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
doesn't do anything to a salamence

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.670 
doesn't do anything to a salamence
because<00:07:20.850> of<00:07:21.000> four<00:07:21.780> times<00:07:21.990> resistance<00:07:22.470> and

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
because of four times resistance and

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.130 
because of four times resistance and
stuff<00:07:22.920> like<00:07:23.040> that<00:07:23.250> so<00:07:24.210> the<00:07:24.330> second<00:07:24.660> fire<00:07:24.840> blast

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.140 
stuff like that so the second fire blast

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.440 
stuff like that so the second fire blast
connects<00:07:25.590> and<00:07:26.010> I<00:07:26.700> think<00:07:26.910> it<00:07:27.030> takes<00:07:27.180> it<00:07:27.330> out

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:27.450 
connects and I think it takes it out

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.600 
connects and I think it takes it out
hopefully<00:07:27.960> should<00:07:28.470> at<00:07:28.680> half<00:07:28.830> health<00:07:28.980> Meganium

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
hopefully should at half health Meganium

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.930 
hopefully should at half health Meganium
specs<00:07:30.360> on<00:07:30.990> its<00:07:31.200> turtle<00:07:31.560> it<00:07:31.770> if<00:07:32.340> not<00:07:32.610> something

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
specs on its turtle it if not something

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.590 
specs on its turtle it if not something
awesome<00:07:33.060> it's<00:07:33.420> so<00:07:33.720> good<00:07:34.320> game
