this week we're making something

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.480 
this week we're making something

different our scarf is not knitted or
crocheted<00:00:12.549> it's<00:00:13.299> made<00:00:13.539> with<00:00:13.719> a<00:00:13.750> nook<00:00:14.049> a<00:00:14.289> nook

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889

is<00:00:15.040> a<00:00:15.070> new<00:00:15.400> tool<00:00:15.730> that's<00:00:16.059> sort<00:00:16.270> of<00:00:16.330> a<00:00:16.390> hybrid

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
is a new tool that's sort of a hybrid

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.350 
is a new tool that's sort of a hybrid
between<00:00:17.220> knitting<00:00:18.220> and<00:00:18.550> crocheting<00:00:18.970> it

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
between knitting and crocheting it

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.330 
between knitting and crocheting it
produces<00:00:19.840> a<00:00:19.869> fabric<00:00:20.349> that's<00:00:20.500> actually<00:00:21.160> a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
produces a fabric that's actually a

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.519 
produces a fabric that's actually a
knitted<00:00:21.759> fabric<00:00:22.210> but<00:00:22.660> it's<00:00:22.810> made<00:00:23.050> with<00:00:23.199> a<00:00:23.230> tool

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
knitted fabric but it's made with a tool

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.830 
knitted fabric but it's made with a tool
that's<00:00:23.859> very<00:00:23.949> similar<00:00:24.369> to<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.760> crochet<00:00:25.240> hook<00:00:25.269> so

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
that's very similar to a crochet hook so

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.919 
that's very similar to a crochet hook so
if<00:00:26.170> you're<00:00:26.710> new<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.090> one<00:00:28.090> or<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.480> other<00:00:28.599> craft

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:28.929 
if you're new to one or the other craft

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.630 
if you're new to one or the other craft
it's<00:00:29.289> a<00:00:29.380> great<00:00:29.590> way<00:00:29.769> to<00:00:29.800> kind<00:00:30.130> of<00:00:30.189> experiment

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
it's a great way to kind of experiment

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.009 
it's a great way to kind of experiment
with<00:00:30.849> something<00:00:31.179> that's<00:00:31.359> sort<00:00:31.630> of<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:31.840> hybrid

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.019 
with something that's sort of a hybrid

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.070 
with something that's sort of a hybrid
and<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:33.010> Nook<00:00:33.420> looks<00:00:34.420> like<00:00:34.570> a<00:00:34.600> crochet<00:00:35.050> hook

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
and the Nook looks like a crochet hook

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.470 
and the Nook looks like a crochet hook
but<00:00:35.890> it's<00:00:36.040> got<00:00:36.190> a<00:00:36.220> tapered<00:00:36.670> end<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.239> then<00:00:37.360> it's

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
but it's got a tapered end and then it's

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.930 
but it's got a tapered end and then it's
got<00:00:37.600> a<00:00:37.629> cord<00:00:38.050> attached<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.799> end<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.370> I'll

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
got a cord attached to the end and I'll

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.460 
got a cord attached to the end and I'll
show<00:00:40.180> you<00:00:40.210> how<00:00:40.659> it<00:00:41.019> works

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
show you how it works

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.630 
show you how it works
you<00:00:42.070> start<00:00:42.400> with<00:00:42.670> a<00:00:42.909> slipknot<00:00:43.180> and<00:00:44.519> then<00:00:45.519> you

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
you start with a slipknot and then you

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.850 
you start with a slipknot and then you
start<00:00:45.940> with<00:00:46.180> a<00:00:46.479> foundation<00:00:47.199> chain<00:00:47.229> very

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
start with a foundation chain very

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.740 
start with a foundation chain very
similar<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.460> crochet<00:00:48.699> I'm<00:00:49.449> going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:51.250> chain

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
similar to crochet I'm going to chain

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:01.369 
similar to crochet I'm going to chain
about<00:00:52.750> 10

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.119 

now<00:01:01.920> I've<00:01:02.039> got<00:01:02.250> my<00:01:02.399> chain<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.379> as<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:05.009> may

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
now I've got my chain and as you may

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.740 
now I've got my chain and as you may
know<00:01:05.309> there's<00:01:05.549> lots<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.119> different<00:01:06.450> ways<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
know there's lots of different ways to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.990 
know there's lots of different ways to
work<00:01:06.930> into<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.259> foundation<00:01:07.860> chain<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
work into a foundation chain but for the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.330 
work into a foundation chain but for the
Nook<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.869> are<00:01:10.229> specifically<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> work

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
Nook we are specifically going to work

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.039 
Nook we are specifically going to work
into<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.729> bump<00:01:12.030> that's<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> back<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
into the bump that's on the back of the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.020 
into the bump that's on the back of the
chain<00:01:13.290> we're<00:01:14.009> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.190> skip<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> first<00:01:14.700> one

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
chain we're going to skip the first one

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
chain we're going to skip the first one
and<00:01:15.420> we're<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> work<00:01:15.990> into<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.710> second

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
and we're going to work into the second

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
and we're going to work into the second
one<00:01:17.490> we're<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> insert<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.350> hook

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
one we're just going to insert the hook

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.130 
one we're just going to insert the hook
into<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.250> bump<00:01:20.539> then<00:01:21.539> we're<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.899> yarn

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
into the bump then we're going to yarn

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.320 
into the bump then we're going to yarn
over<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:23.159> rather<00:01:23.460> we're<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> scoop<00:01:24.149> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
over or rather we're going to scoop the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.749 
over or rather we're going to scoop the
yarn<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.049> need<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.350> scoop<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.220> above

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
yarn and you need to scoop it from above

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.450 
yarn and you need to scoop it from above
and<00:01:27.210> that's<00:01:28.080> important<00:01:28.590> otherwise<00:01:28.830> your

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and that's important otherwise your

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.090 
and that's important otherwise your
stitch<00:01:30.000> will<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.299> twisted<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> again<00:01:31.920> we're

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
stitch will be twisted so again we're

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.880 
stitch will be twisted so again we're
going<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:32.250> insert<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.789> into<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.119> bump<00:01:33.890> scoop

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
going to insert it into the bump scoop

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.919 
going to insert it into the bump scoop
the<00:01:35.039> yarn<00:01:35.310> from<00:01:35.520> above<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.360> pull<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.899> through

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
the yarn from above and pull it through

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.330 
the yarn from above and pull it through
and<00:01:37.550> as<00:01:38.550> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.030> see<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.990> are<00:01:40.050> leaving<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:41.280> of

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and as you can see we are leaving all of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.499 
and as you can see we are leaving all of
the<00:01:41.909> loops<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.890> hook<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.550> on<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:45.060> nook<00:01:45.300> I

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the loops on the hook or on the nook I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.279 
the loops on the hook or on the nook I
should<00:01:45.750> say<00:01:46.970> so<00:01:47.970> again<00:01:48.300> just<00:01:48.330> inserting<00:01:49.140> into

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
should say so again just inserting into

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.440 
should say so again just inserting into
the<00:01:49.440> bump<00:01:49.679> very<00:01:50.580> common<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.179> it<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.330> be

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the bump very common for it to be

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.149 
the bump very common for it to be
difficult<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.990> work<00:01:52.229> into<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> foundation

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
difficult to work into a foundation

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.760 
difficult to work into a foundation
chain<00:01:53.190> so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.789> frequently<00:01:54.450> kind<00:01:55.319> of<00:01:55.409> use<00:01:55.590> my

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
chain so I frequently kind of use my

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.740 
chain so I frequently kind of use my
fingernail<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.549> wiggle<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.539> that's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
fingernail to wiggle in there and that's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.070 
fingernail to wiggle in there and that's
really<00:01:58.110> normal<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> again<00:02:02.220> I'm<00:02:03.080> inserting

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
really normal so again I'm inserting

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.139 
really normal so again I'm inserting
into<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.440> bump<00:02:06.140> scooping<00:02:07.140> from<00:02:07.500> above<00:02:08.149> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
into the bump scooping from above and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.969
