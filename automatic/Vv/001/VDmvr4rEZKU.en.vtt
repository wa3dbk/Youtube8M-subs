red<00:02:36.989> hazy<00:02:37.290> sunset<00:02:37.739> viewed<00:02:38.700> from<00:02:38.970> an

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
red hazy sunset viewed from an

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.080 
red hazy sunset viewed from an
industrially<00:02:39.840> polluted<00:02:39.989> city<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.680> earth

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.309 

today<00:02:45.090> we<00:02:45.360> have<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.510> special<00:02:45.630> guest

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
today we have a special guest

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.070 
today we have a special guest
this<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.160> dr.<00:02:47.520> Bob<00:02:47.700> Fosbury<00:02:48.180> he's<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.900> leader

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
this is dr. Bob Fosbury he's the leader

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.710 
this is dr. Bob Fosbury he's the leader
of<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.440> European<00:02:49.560> Hubble<00:02:50.190> effort

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
of the European Hubble effort

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.210 
of the European Hubble effort
so<00:02:51.720> tell<00:02:51.930> me<00:02:51.959> Bob<00:02:52.200> what's<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.770> special<00:02:53.010> about

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
so tell me Bob what's so special about

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.760 
so tell me Bob what's so special about
this<00:02:53.550> particular<00:02:53.730> star<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.569> its<00:02:54.690> planet<00:02:55.020> well

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
this particular star and its planet well

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.290 
this particular star and its planet well
this<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.100> rather<00:02:56.459> special<00:02:56.610> planetary

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
this is a rather special planetary

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.030 
this is a rather special planetary
system<00:02:57.660> because<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.110> star<00:02:58.350> itself<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:58.920> quite

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
system because the star itself is quite

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.449 
system because the star itself is quite
small<00:02:59.489> it's<00:03:00.209> only<00:03:00.330> about<00:03:00.480> 75%<00:03:00.800> of<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.860> size<00:03:02.220> of

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
small it's only about 75% of the size of

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.000 
small it's only about 75% of the size of
Sun<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.330> yet<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.170> planet<00:03:04.470> itself

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
Sun and yet the planet itself

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.100 
Sun and yet the planet itself
is<00:03:05.280> larger<00:03:05.760> than<00:03:05.880> Jupiter<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.870> when<00:03:07.019> the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
is larger than Jupiter so when the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.500 
is larger than Jupiter so when the
planet<00:03:07.440> transits<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.220> front<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.640> star<00:03:08.910> it

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
planet transits in front of the star it

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.750 
planet transits in front of the star it
it<00:03:10.110> obscures<00:03:10.680> quite<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> large<00:03:11.250> fraction<00:03:11.640> of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
it obscures quite a large fraction of

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.759 
it obscures quite a large fraction of
light<00:03:12.000> from<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.299> star<00:03:12.660> which<00:03:13.200> enables<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.739> very

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
light from the star which enables a very

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.680 
light from the star which enables a very
accurate<00:03:14.069> measurement<00:03:14.459> so<00:03:15.330> what<00:03:15.540> exactly

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
accurate measurement so what exactly

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.229 
accurate measurement so what exactly
made<00:03:16.440> these<00:03:16.620> observations<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.430> precise<00:03:17.850> why

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
made these observations so precise why

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.390 
made these observations so precise why
was<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.630> only<00:03:18.810> possible<00:03:19.290> now<00:03:19.440> well<00:03:20.160> we<00:03:20.280> have

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
was this only possible now well we have

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.729 
was this only possible now well we have
to<00:03:20.519> do<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:20.760> from<00:03:20.940> space<00:03:21.269> because<00:03:21.650> when<00:03:22.650> we

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
to do this from space because when we

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:23.930 
to do this from space because when we
try<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:22.950> do<00:03:23.069> this<00:03:23.190> from<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.459> ground<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
try and do this from the ground the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.580 
try and do this from the ground the
atmosphere<00:03:24.420> makes<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.810> very<00:03:24.900> difficult<00:03:25.170> to

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
atmosphere makes it very difficult to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.650 
atmosphere makes it very difficult to
make<00:03:25.769> precise<00:03:26.190> measurements<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:27.209> brightness

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
make precise measurements of brightness

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.199 
make precise measurements of brightness
so<00:03:28.230> we<00:03:28.350> do<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.530> from<00:03:28.709> space<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.880> special

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
so we do it from space and the special

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.340 
so we do it from space and the special
thing<00:03:30.360> about<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.690> particular<00:03:30.870> observation

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
thing about this particular observation

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.250 
thing about this particular observation
is<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.819> scientists<00:03:33.540> spread<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.080> light

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
is that the scientists spread the light

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.039 
is that the scientists spread the light
out<00:03:34.530> over<00:03:34.980> many<00:03:35.100> pixels<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.970> detector<00:03:36.480> so

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
out over many pixels in the detector so

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.599 
out over many pixels in the detector so
rather<00:03:37.230> than<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:37.709> having<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:38.040> little<00:03:38.160> point

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
rather than just having a little point

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.910 
rather than just having a little point
of<00:03:38.730> light<00:03:38.810> representing<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> star<00:03:40.200> on<00:03:40.709> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
of light representing the star on the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.160 
of light representing the star on the
detector<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:42.120> star<00:03:42.420> light<00:03:42.600> was<00:03:42.780> spread<00:03:43.140> out

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
detector the star light was spread out

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.860 
detector the star light was spread out
into<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.160> spectrum<00:03:44.370> using<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:45.390> so-called

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
into a spectrum using this so-called

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.599 
into a spectrum using this so-called
grism<00:03:46.290> mode<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.950> advanced<00:03:47.190> camera<00:03:47.579> for

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
grism mode of the advanced camera for

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.289 
grism mode of the advanced camera for
surveys<00:03:48.170> now<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:50.040> enables<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.670> very<00:03:50.700> precise

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
surveys now that enables a very precise

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.940 
surveys now that enables a very precise
measurement<00:03:51.540> because<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.230> can<00:03:52.440> measure<00:03:52.620> over

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
measurement because you can measure over

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.039 
measurement because you can measure over
many<00:03:53.400> many<00:03:53.549> pixels<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.420> large<00:03:54.600> area<00:03:54.989> of

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
many many pixels a large area of

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.920 
many many pixels a large area of
detector<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.880> also<00:03:57.030> by<00:03:57.420> spreading<00:03:57.720> out

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
detector but it also by spreading out

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.410 
detector but it also by spreading out
the<00:03:57.959> colors<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:59.250> enables<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.850> to<00:03:59.880> measure<00:04:00.150> the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
the colors it enables you to measure the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.870 
the colors it enables you to measure the
brightness<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.829> or<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.850> the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
reduction in brightness of the starlight

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.660 
reduction in brightness of the starlight
over<00:04:05.700> many<00:04:05.880> colors<00:04:06.299> so<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.829> having<00:04:08.519> these

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
over many colors so and having these

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.160 
over many colors so and having these

different measurements in different

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.590 
different measurements in different
colors<00:04:10.500> enables<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.579> characterize<00:04:12.299> the

Haze's<00:04:16.440> astronomers<00:04:17.010> actually<00:04:17.280> had<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.519> do

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
Haze's astronomers actually had to do

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.150 
Haze's astronomers actually had to do
quite<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:17.940> bit<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.269> detective<00:04:18.690> work<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.169> the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
quite a bit of detective work and the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.860 
quite a bit of detective work and the
reason<00:04:20.489> why<00:04:20.579> this<00:04:20.640> work<00:04:20.910> was<00:04:21.060> possible<00:04:21.479> at<00:04:21.660> all

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
reason why this work was possible at all

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.380 
reason why this work was possible at all
is<00:04:22.229> because<00:04:22.860> from<00:04:22.979> our<00:04:23.220> vantage<00:04:23.490> point<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
is because from our vantage point the

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.219 
is because from our vantage point the
orbit<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.870> HD<00:04:25.410> 1<00:04:25.740> 8<00:04:25.890> 973<00:04:26.760> 3<00:04:26.789> B<00:04:27.270> is<00:04:27.570> seen<00:04:27.960> almost

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
orbit of HD 1 8 973 3 B is seen almost

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.580 
orbit of HD 1 8 973 3 B is seen almost
