00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.089
 the video contains a small amount 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.810
 spoilers but mostly interesting 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.880
 nonsense 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.740
 blizzard as always listens to 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.690
 players and a lot of things straightened in 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 interface so now with a calm 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.100
 soul can remove half of addons 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.990
 I'll start with my favorite topic means 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.000
 travel tab transport 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.619
 perfected to such an extent that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.220
 I have nothing more to do about the video 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.289
 mounts 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 now you can sort them see 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.609
 value where sold or out 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.949
 or for what achievement you can get 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.810
 favorite brute for macro change 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.300
 my don added a button to urge 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.310
 one of the favorite mounts also included 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.590
 all not received mount and among them there are 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.590
 some very interesting specimens 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.640
 the key assignment tab is also slightly 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.380
 remade 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.930
 now everything is very conveniently sorted 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.580
 by groups in the interface tab and now 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.280
 can include this expression frames 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.080
 spells and abilities 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.700
 the map is also very cool, she remade 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.500
 becomes transparent when moving 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.450
 task list tee used to people more 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.470
 ordered and yet it shows 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.790
 pet tamer card can 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.130
 draw away 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.830
 and yet you probably noticed such 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.780
 badges this additional task these 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.700
 jobs do not need to lie to someone like 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.770
 quests they are assigned to a certain 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.869
 territories and automatically counted 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.420
 for their performance get 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.780
 additional experience and gold and now you 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.090
 say that the same is kv-2 and yes 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.009
 no in gv2 you fill hearts 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.890
 assigned to the territory get in 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.660
 reward currency and access to the seller and 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.360
 In general, this is the only kind 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.490
 quests besides the story line warcraft 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.320
 it is rather a replacement for the distant mention 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.050
 which lead to nervous convulsions 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.700
 because of their oversupply in pandaria and 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.740
 Of course, nothing difficult to do with you 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.020
 don't make it all come down to simple 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.360
 beating pigs and collecting blades of grass 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.970
 I could not copy the character 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.760
 but here is the long-awaited tab 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.220
 for toys there will be displayed cd 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.019
 item descriptions and stuff and now 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.760
 a moment of silence in memory of toys 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.120
 that I had to remove due to lack 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.120
 places 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.350
 bags have also changed 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.720
 finally added a tidy button 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.580
 or sort the content like you 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.750
 more like every bag you can 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.360
 bind to one of the few 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.340
 categories that probably also helps 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.680
 rake up the only thing that 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.470
 probably never add this sell 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.880
 trash although now all gray things are marked 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.520
 a coin when you talk to 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.500
 the seller for today is all for now i'm doing 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.080
 video about the garrisons you can watch 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.080
 on the throne and fiercely battling the walls and 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.380
 he won thanks for watching and everyone 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.380
 rays of goodness 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.650
 here
