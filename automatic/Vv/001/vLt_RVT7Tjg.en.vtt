00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
he came out that looks like it's the one

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.189 
he came out that looks like it's the one
that<00:00:36.489> they're<00:00:36.610> gonna<00:00:36.699> use<00:00:37.030> for<00:00:37.420> star-lord<00:00:37.960> and

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
that they're gonna use for star-lord and

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.560 
that they're gonna use for star-lord and
they<00:00:38.410> did<00:00:38.710> he's<00:00:39.280> got<00:00:39.460> a<00:00:39.489> new<00:00:39.670> belt<00:00:39.940> with<00:00:40.420> the

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
they did he's got a new belt with the

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.119 
they did he's got a new belt with the
bottom<00:00:40.840> parts<00:00:41.110> of<00:00:41.199> his<00:00:41.350> coat<00:00:41.590> sculpted<00:00:42.010> on

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
bottom parts of his coat sculpted on

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.799 
bottom parts of his coat sculpted on
there<00:00:42.400> that<00:00:42.879> looks<00:00:43.090> pretty<00:00:43.269> good

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
there that looks pretty good

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.770 
there that looks pretty good
and<00:00:44.229> then<00:00:44.409> he<00:00:44.500> has<00:00:44.589> a<00:00:44.620> new<00:00:44.800> head<00:00:45.309> I<00:00:45.659> think<00:00:46.659> the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
and then he has a new head I think the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.960 
and then he has a new head I think the
collar<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:48.010> might<00:00:48.159> be<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.370> same<00:00:48.550> collar<00:00:48.760> they

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
collar it might be the same collar they

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.180 
collar it might be the same collar they
used<00:00:49.180> I<00:00:49.269> don't<00:00:49.449> remember<00:00:49.659> but<00:00:50.500> it's<00:00:50.830> fine

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
used I don't remember but it's fine

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.560 
used I don't remember but it's fine
either<00:00:51.370> way<00:00:51.580> the<00:00:51.729> head<00:00:51.879> sculpt<00:00:52.210> is<00:00:52.299> really

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
either way the head sculpt is really

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.020 
either way the head sculpt is really
good<00:00:52.780> I<00:00:52.989> like<00:00:53.470> it<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:53.920> think<00:00:54.670> it<00:00:54.760> looks<00:00:54.909> pretty

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
good I like it I think it looks pretty

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.049 
good I like it I think it looks pretty
good<00:00:55.320> paint<00:00:56.320> work<00:00:56.470> on<00:00:56.650> this<00:00:56.799> guy<00:00:56.979> it's<00:00:57.400> mostly

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.000 
good paint work on this guy it's mostly
okay<00:00:58.269> the<00:00:58.750> red<00:00:58.930> line<00:00:59.199> work<00:00:59.409> is<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.650> little

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
okay the red line work is a little

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.439 
okay the red line work is a little
sloppy<00:01:00.280> in<00:01:00.489> some<00:01:00.760> areas<00:01:01.059> like<00:01:01.089> on<00:01:01.330> the

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
sloppy in some areas like on the

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.200 
sloppy in some areas like on the
shoulder<00:01:01.870> there<00:01:02.400> but<00:01:03.400> it<00:01:03.519> looks<00:01:03.549> good<00:01:03.909> for<00:01:04.119> the

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
shoulder there but it looks good for the

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.870 
shoulder there but it looks good for the
most<00:01:04.449> part<00:01:04.809> I<00:01:05.560> wouldn't<00:01:06.130> mind<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.430> if<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.640> blue

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
most part I wouldn't mind it if the blue

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.609 
most part I wouldn't mind it if the blue
was<00:01:07.030> a<00:01:07.060> little<00:01:07.479> bit<00:01:07.630> more<00:01:07.840> blue<00:01:08.049> but<00:01:08.320> that's

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
was a little bit more blue but that's

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.039 
was a little bit more blue but that's
just<00:01:08.920> splitting<00:01:09.369> hairs<00:01:09.580> they<00:01:10.210> did<00:01:10.479> paint<00:01:10.810> all

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
just splitting hairs they did paint all

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.469 
just splitting hairs they did paint all
of<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.409> buttons<00:01:12.280> black<00:01:12.700> it's<00:01:13.060> kind<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.299> hard

of the buttons black it's kind of hard

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.090 
of the buttons black it's kind of hard
to<00:01:13.540> see<00:01:13.869> because<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.260> blue<00:01:14.409> is<00:01:14.530> so<00:01:14.680> dark<00:01:14.920> but

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
to see because the blue is so dark but

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.190

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
are they kind of have a good amount of

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.139 
are they kind of have a good amount of
detail<00:01:51.009> but<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.670> fact<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:51.909> it's<00:01:52.090> just

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
detail but the fact that it's just

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.870 
detail but the fact that it's just
molded<00:01:52.689> plastic<00:01:53.200> hides<00:01:54.069> that<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:54.609> a<00:01:54.640> little

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
molded plastic hides that so a little

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.520 
molded plastic hides that so a little
bit<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.179> paint<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.509> think<00:01:55.780> would<00:01:55.899> go<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> long<00:01:56.259> way

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
bit of paint I think would go a long way

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.679 
bit of paint I think would go a long way
on<00:01:56.710> this<00:01:56.859> guy's<00:01:57.069> accessories<00:01:57.789> it<00:01:58.299> is<00:01:58.479> nice

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
on this guy's accessories it is nice

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.059 
on this guy's accessories it is nice
that<00:01:58.719> he<00:01:59.049> and<00:01:59.200> caught<00:01:59.409> some<00:01:59.649> none<00:01:59.920> of<00:02:00.009> the

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
that he and caught some none of the

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.730 
that he and caught some none of the
other<00:02:00.189> guys<00:02:00.369> did<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:02.259> it<00:02:02.350> doesn't<00:02:02.530> hold<00:02:02.590> the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
other guys did but it doesn't hold the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.649 
other guys did but it doesn't hold the
guns<00:02:02.920> very<00:02:03.310> well<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:03.969> that's<00:02:04.179> a<00:02:04.299> bit<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.569> an

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
guns very well so that's a bit of an

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.309 
guns very well so that's a bit of an
issue<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:06.009> kind<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:06.789> like<00:02:06.969> the<00:02:07.179> movie<00:02:07.780> versions

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
issue I kind of like the movie versions

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.270 
issue I kind of like the movie versions
