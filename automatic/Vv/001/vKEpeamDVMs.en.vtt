 [Author: DarkMatter2525] 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.380
 Genesis 11:6 After God saw the Tower of Babel—“The Lord said, Behold, they are the same people, they are all the same words, and now they are doing this, and what they are going to do in the future, there is no failure. We are going down there, messing up their accents, making their words unreasonable." 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.240
 Kill a lot 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.860
 Shake not let me sleep 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.020
 Hey... God? Can you wake up? 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.040
 Wake up God, blaspheme God 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.980
 Kill a lot... Kill... Kill the light! 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.300
 Jeffery, what do you want? 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.000
 Didn't you see that I was taking a nap? 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.440
 Sorry God, I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch break. 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.800
 But this time the situation is urgent 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.920
 Damn Jeffery, what happened? 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 What is wrong with this time? 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.760
 Sorry God, but I noticed that there is a flying scorpion 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.400
 I don't know how to be good. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.360
 You are right, flying scorpion 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.360
 How come this thing? 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.500
 I... I have no clue 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
 Maybe you should find out 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.920
 I... I don’t know, I’m a little scared. 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.340
 what? 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 what? 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.820
 I didn't say anything, Jeffery. 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.700
 It’s ridiculous, let me find out 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.180
 "Babel Tower / Grand Opening on Tuesday" 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.560
 That's it, Jeffery, I'm done. 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.280
 They think of ways to go to heaven, they don’t need to rely on me. 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.440
 What are you talking about, God? What did they do? 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.380
 They built a tall, big tower that went straight to heaven. 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.860
 So they can go to heaven themselves. 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.820
 Wait, isn't that what you want? Human beings are the same as heaven? 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.660
 Yes, but not in this way 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.620
 I hope they worship a hypocritical Jewish zombie. 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.300
 Those who do this will be excused from going to heaven. 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.320
 This... this... they ran up... 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.780
 I can't accept it... No, no! 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.640
 Oh no, no matter what God is thinking, please calm down. 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.180
 Shut up Jeffery, I have a good idea. 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.360
 Hey God, have you not enough of these humans? 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.140
 You have slaughtered humans once with the Great Flood, please be merciful. 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.960
 Don't be nervous about Jeffery, this is really a good idea. 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.460
 Oh no 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.220
 Good 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.600
 I want to spoof their way of speaking. 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.120
 So they can't understand each other 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.500
 So you can't build a tower. 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.360
 Oh, this is a real "spoof" 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.880
 Jeffery, they can make towers. 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.140
 Nothing is what they can't do together. 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.520
 So I have to start with strong and stop them from cooperating. 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.480
 This will be the last tower that they can build. 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.500
 This is almost the same, but I am still not satisfied. 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.580
 It’s almost ready to build. 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.560
 How could this be? 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.720
 !@#$% 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.220
 ^&amp;*(~ 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.300
 Jeffery, I am tired again. 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.620
 I successfully destroyed the results of their cooperation 

00:05:03.156 --> 00:05:06.296
 In short, I have to sleep back. 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.940
 So... Nothing, don't bother me. 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.940
 Good afternoon 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.220
 After many years... 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.940
 God, God gets up 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.760
 God gets up, I have something to show you 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.800
 What happened, Jeffery? 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.600
 I told you nothing, don't bother me. 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.240
 Oh, yes 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.900
 damned! 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:56.660
 FUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.840
 So I think that different languages ​​can't stop human cooperation, right?
