00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 2 people on the air slayer I have for you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.589
 question i want you to write in 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.530
 comments on this video 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.230
 which tanks enrage you the most 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.890
 randomly ie exactly like opponents 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.900
 For example, they went to Olivier and then clap 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.240
 Pinocchio vanshota go you understand what 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.340
 Pinocchio is the most hated of you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.840
 tank anyway for this fight and 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 preferably with arguments that is 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 for example, yes if I like Pinocchio 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.690
 for example, do not like it because it is given 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.480
 hands out a vanshot having a 1800 hepe gun 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.250
 at the seventh level for example yes or else 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.550
 Something for some reason why not 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.649
 like 395 ass because he is too 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.739
 armored from afar reflects shells 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.949
 but this too can be such an answer 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.899
 I have already seen what all this is for 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.010
 Need I think guess so 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.780
 see what we have what we have 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.400
 negative cause the car certain and 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.409
 accordingly make the corresponding 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.430
 conclusions and then maybe even some 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.549
 video on this topic well and even then it just 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.009
 I have a pension in our modpack 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.030
 First today, before the 12th day 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.420
 version let three 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.950
 and there added five more new mods 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.830
 besides her leading to her and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.790
 panel score and under 96 there are additional 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.850
 there were mistakes corrected and added 5 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.710
 new mods one of them is that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.549
 will see is calculating the necessary 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.280
 amounts of experience and battles to about 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.560
 the next tank that is for example 4p 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.210
 yes there is up to the network and so on 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:51.600
 then there is another mod on lbs that is and 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.150
 the same little alt 1 and now can be seen out 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.160
 which one 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 not once changed the condition of the main and 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.280
 extra meaning he will 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.460
 automatically perry select lbz only 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.580
 when doing with the difference and if we 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.870
 We do more with Al 2 only basic 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.920
 the condition will be minimal for 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.960
 passing 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.580
 that is, you are now with this waters 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.670
 calmly come in 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.170
 automatically you all will be selected and 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.150
