00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hi guys, I came out and let's make and today 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:15.630
 video especially for you that makes me 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:17.010
 laughing alone at home such people I never 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.680
 I went to the manicure 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.910
 I always did my nails alone and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.180
 over time we will improve 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.740
 techniques and today I already lived a bit 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.289
 you are 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.759
 What I learned in that time 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.239
 makes it much easier to do the nails 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.250
 The first tip is good and you can even 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.789
 It seems funny to us but it is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.820
 bathroom before you do sums it up 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.379
 if there is much if you were to leave stay 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.750
 ready before doing the nails because 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:58.140
 usually it is at this moment that you good 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.020
 the nail for example you will see all 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 that work makes the nail looks beautiful 1 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.439
 70 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.519
 And then I want to go to the bathroom as it is 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.110
 What do you do 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.930
 we have no way to ruin Iran 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:17.100
 then this tip is if it coils but it is too much 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.890
 important second tip start by hand 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.590
 that you have more difficulty too 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.150
 It seems like a good folks tip but it's a lot 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.490
 important 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.689
 If you have difficulty painting your 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.009
 right hand because you're right 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.380
 So you start painting this hand. 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.689
 because when you're painting the second 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.960
 hand will be much easier and the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.689
 work will be fast and fast 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.970
 if you start with your easy hand in 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.210

 I'll leave it down here. 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.650
 there in the blog post where I was

 Lady Spin knows when you guys are 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.110
 annotation is perfect and at the time of 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:52.830
 clean the nooks and crannies you 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:55.740
 corintinha and spoils everything so people have 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.580
 a technique that greatly facilitates the 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.650
 handling of the toothpick when cleaning the 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.060
 Caves I do not remember exactly where 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.000
 there was this tip 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.940
 But I know it works so much with me. 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.300
 it is already the tip of the toothpick gives a 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.390
 incredible difference when clear of the 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.560
 because the toothpick fits and fits 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:21.180
 your motif it fits perfectly 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.280
 So I advise you to follow this 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.990
 day that will make it much easier to clean 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.540
 Queen 7 and last tip and your 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.730
 Enamels for durability 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.880
 I'm sure it happened already with 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.940
 you and try to open a 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.460
 get it gets so set up to leave 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.850
 no way and this happens because the 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:49.410
 The nail polish gets its own 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.610
 glaze hardens and the cover is not out 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.280
 as cast 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.660
 to avoid this, you should use the 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.530
 enamel and always 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.930
 odd the border of it or separate 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.950
 a day to clean all your 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.590
 nail polishes 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.560
 you will get two benefits the first 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.140
 the lid will never stick to the 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.770
 second, that the enamel will last a long time 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.050
 more 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.410
 It will not get hard so remember. 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:20.220
 always let your glaze avoid them 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.590
 lying upside down the ideal is 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.240
 that they stand in the foot position here 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.230
 When you are here on my shelf you are 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.810
 seeing in a shoebox or a 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:34.320
 Anyway, you guys are organizing 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:36.900

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.200
