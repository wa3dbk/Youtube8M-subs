00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.690
 it sounds very beautiful 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.710
 and we're done, we're going to create this and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.950
 this 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.070
 ammunition in high school little but something 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.070
 there 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.890
 that I did not see him to see this one that is 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.890
 up and down 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.730
 and they tend to show up all the time 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.730
 try to catch 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.230
 someone here is worth worth I'm going 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.230
 this part to see 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.379
 I was killed 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.379
 to see over there 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.350
 it has been seen has not seen me 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.400
 to see if someone comes out they always come by 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.400
 there all the time 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.640
 vale vale vale vale hope here comes 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:38.370
 to some although this one has left here eye I 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.370
 it was worth what happens with the franc 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.330
 c4 that has taken this there I do not know if 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.230
 I was doing a 360 or what was 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.420
 doing but is that with the franc I do not 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.940
 I trust a lot because as they catch as they leave 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.810
 as for example this I do not know that there are 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:07.110
 how many frank now not useful is that flipo 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.959
 Frank peeked out or good, he already had it 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.310
 and roche of 25 is that there are a few 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.239
 francs and I was playing it already 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.239
 for this he is waiting for me 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.930
 4 what will you play 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.970
 do not leave here but I can not say 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.950
 good a good run of 25 I already had it 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.950
 but is that take the franc 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.969
 if they caught me like that from short distances 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.369
 there is 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:46.249
 it was the bad thing that I could not defend myself so 

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:47.779
 well as scorpions apart from that I think 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.179
 that I had almost no ammunition in the 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:52.819
 secondary but good has been missing very 

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:55.249
 little a streak of 25 fuck what a pity 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.719
 that I did not have ammunition and I had to 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.989
 catch the franc and that I've done some 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.819
 low there how could I not though some 

00:04:59.989 --> 00:05:04.610
 He is trying to ensure that if not passed 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:07.639
 to play it with that streak but good 32 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.799
 against everyone to see if they are coming out 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.469
 hairline so it has been missing very, very little 

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:14.979
 but I hope you liked it and 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:14.979
 until next time
