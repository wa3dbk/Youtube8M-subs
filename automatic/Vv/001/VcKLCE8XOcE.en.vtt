00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.910
 euros 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.009

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.460

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.850
 we open the box and we color we see 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:46.249

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.999
 so presents the princess twilight 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.170
 arkle with her pink lioness hair 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:54.230
 and violets 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.149
 so we can style her the tail is 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.809
 still attached but if I detach 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.079
 see that's quite all she was 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:07.070
 a very pretty yellow necklace with a pretty 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.450
 little gem here it is beautiful and I 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.740
 also presents you 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.219
 monseigneur rainbow of age a superb 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.659
 hydroponics to color yourself then 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:22.430
 in the box we have stickers with 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.890
 bound wheelchair that can 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.200
 color yourself and stickers 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.490
 who are already doing everything I wanted but 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.610
 in a good way for you to see them 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.060
 well it's a frame at first here it is 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.259
 so I'm going to start coloring 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.149
 a sticker on board 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.829
 so obviously in the box 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.469
 you saw it I did not say but a 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.240
 red felt and a felt violated so 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.020
 see also this color well this case 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.829
 and if it's really really effective 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.539
 go I make a pretty little red heart 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.579
 because love is what is the 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.740
 more important in the lives of the little ones 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:03.740
 ponies and in our life to us too 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.929
 first of all a little heart then there we 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.899
 can the stick and where we want to go I 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.960
 will put me on the papatte so here 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.140
 it's going to stick very well 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.140
 and I'm going to make another one 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.420
 will say because I do what I am 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:29.660
 a star miss the dps I have a little 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.460
 exceeded it would take a little thick is 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.160
 not tip top as the coloring 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:40.010
 but it goes to the little star 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.900
 purple like that I'm going to glue him 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:51.740
 said m I'm having fun 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:55.610
 that's it now so I'm going 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.320
 try to color a part was going 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.290
 do it in red because it can 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.020
 come out of his tail and see if that 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.300
 walk that I'm allowed to look already 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.810
 a start actually I do not know if this is the 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.490
 felt that is special for this kind of 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.420
 materials or if it is the material that is 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:18.770
 special but in any case it hangs 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.960
 pretty good and that's pretty pretty is 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.000
 easy enough to do 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.269
 or so so I'll finish my little 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.540
 bullfight 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.620
 yeah so he has his tail red 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.299
 so no what I say is what is 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.430
 a bit of a shame is we only have two 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.200
 colored markers but then I do not know 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.769
 not if it can work with 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.019
 other felts of classic colors 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.739
 games like that so I stupid as I 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.510
 you said it just now I do not know 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.209
 not if it's the material that's special 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.500
 or if it's the felt that's special 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.140
 I have the impression that this is the 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.640
 matter if we tried with nine other 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.540
 again to see if it works 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.730
 and so I stole a pen 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.459
 classic finally a pen a felt 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.709
 classic to my fantasy son and I'm going 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.099
 go back to the rainbow dash because I 'm not going 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.290
 not to spoil this decor that is going to be 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.579
 magnificent futures 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.980
 so I 'm driven to the other side and 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:16.160
 see if it works there on that side 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.160
 it's totally immaculate white and I 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.560
 will try to do a little coloring 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.860
 so I'm going to color or hold 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.710
 at color'i there it works much less 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.979
 well done 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.729
 so I think these are obviously 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.410
 special felts that's because the 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:41.150
 matter is special m 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.970
 so it works but it's not great 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.599
 walk I do not know how to look at you that's 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.530
 not so bad 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:51.699
 we can do it but I think the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.169
 better than it's really to use 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.440
 this is done because that really 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.180
 gives a super nice painting look and 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.479
 everything is in addition very fashionable h 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.659
 it's how to say it's red and 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.010
 purple so it's a creative side I 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.830
 can stop me from imagining others 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.980
 colors 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.630
 that's okay I'm going to continue a 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.900
 little what I like I'll go 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.860
 show how it looks with purple 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.860
 by feeling a bit like being 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.540
 painter veiled veiled I must 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.250
 it's not bad to go I recognize a 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.530
 small sticker for the road 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.510
 so I 'm going to take one of 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.570
 stickers that are already everything 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.810
 done or colored and everything and everything but not 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.810
 embarrass me 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.510
 why it was not like I feel 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.180
 well I made a mistake I males 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:49.380
 take off if the blow it is going to be that like 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.930
 it does not stick well nearly go over 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.760
 delicately than what I'm told that 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.610
 I do my usual thing so here we go 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.220
 for info to go gently 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.740
 when you remove the the sticker 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:06.600
 because if not to the collective angelus 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:08.790
 nicolas petit it's pretty here 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.070
 half salt and fire is super nice 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.750
 name you do not find 1 all these little ones 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.280
 stickers those little things we 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.500
 can do it yourself is funny as 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:23.190
 everything I like it amuses me actually 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:27.630
 the mom who does not grow up is me it's 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:31.920
 you too thank you this is I wish him 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:34.980
 stick one on the cheek as is 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.530
 cute like that here you understood 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.210
 the principle shows you like that what 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.860
 it's like that 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.770
 so obviously we can color in front of 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.069
 behind 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:49.449
 we can queue here is the mane 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:50.949
 everything and everything here I hope that in all 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.120
 case you liked it 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.030
 I think it's pretty 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.909
 convincing so this is an offer 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.470
 special shot I find enough 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.389
 interesting because on one side you 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.000
 have your little pony all done 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.509
 cute and the other one to do you 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.169

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:10.710
 little pony it is mark hasbro from 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.940
