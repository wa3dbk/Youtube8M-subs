corner for about a year and a half and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.309 
corner for about a year and a half and
before<00:00:49.359> that<00:00:49.389> I<00:00:49.539> meant<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:49.899> print<00:00:50.139> them<00:00:50.289> for

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.369 
before that I meant to print them for
like<00:00:50.739> ever<00:00:50.949> so<00:00:51.670> anyway<00:00:52.389> so<00:00:52.449> I'm<00:00:52.690> going<00:00:52.839> to<00:00:52.899> do<00:00:53.019> a

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
like ever so anyway so I'm going to do a

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.259 
like ever so anyway so I'm going to do a
mural<00:00:53.620> basically<00:00:54.579> kind<00:00:54.789> of<00:00:54.879> its<00:00:55.059> going<00:00:55.209> to

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
mural basically kind of its going to

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.389 
mural basically kind of its going to
look<00:00:55.329> kind<00:00:55.539> of<00:00:55.629> like<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.780> vinyl<00:00:56.559> decal<00:00:56.920> but<00:00:57.159> way

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
look kind of like a vinyl decal but way

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.899 
look kind of like a vinyl decal but way
cheaper<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.440> first<00:00:59.679> we<00:01:00.069> got<00:01:00.339> our<00:01:00.429> dual<00:01:00.609> design

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
cheaper so first we got our dual design

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.439 
cheaper so first we got our dual design
going<00:01:01.769> we're<00:01:02.769> going<00:01:02.799> to<00:01:02.920> do<00:01:03.069> a<00:01:03.100> large<00:01:03.699> be<00:01:04.090> and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
going we're going to do a large be and

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.540 
going we're going to do a large be and
silver<00:01:04.870> for<00:01:05.680> Burton<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:08.530> then<00:01:09.130> we're

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
silver for Burton be and then we're

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.950 
silver for Burton be and then we're
going<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.700> do<00:01:09.820> this<00:01:09.940> at<00:01:10.120> first<00:01:10.330> over<00:01:10.720> top<00:01:10.930> and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
going to do this at first over top and

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.870 
going to do this at first over top and
no<00:01:11.290> reason<00:01:11.470> this<00:01:11.650> is<00:01:11.710> printed<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:12.310> large<00:01:12.580> it's

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
no reason this is printed so large it's

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.980 
no reason this is printed so large it's
because<00:01:13.120> sometimes<00:01:14.640> transparencies<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:15.990> can't

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
because sometimes transparencies I can't

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.230 
because sometimes transparencies I can't
clearly<00:01:17.350> see<00:01:17.770> really<00:01:18.460> small<00:01:18.700> print<00:01:19.000> so<00:01:19.120> it's

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
clearly see really small print so it's

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.510 
clearly see really small print so it's
actually<00:01:19.540> going<00:01:19.660> to<00:01:19.750> be<00:01:19.810> small<00:01:20.200> paint<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.890> but

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
actually going to be small paint it but

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.820 
actually going to be small paint it but
that's<00:01:21.640> large<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.630> so<00:01:23.080> any<00:01:23.230> maybe<00:01:23.710> two

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
that's large and so any maybe two

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.810 
that's large and so any maybe two
different<00:01:23.920> colors<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.580> going<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.760> be

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
different colors this is going to be

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.400 
different colors this is going to be
black<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.180> it's<00:01:25.330> going<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.510> be<00:01:25.600> silver<00:01:25.930> so

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
black and it's going to be silver so

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.720 
black and it's going to be silver so
that's<00:01:26.560> all<00:01:26.680> we<00:01:26.710> have<00:01:26.920> them<00:01:27.040> on<00:01:27.100> two<00:01:27.340> separate

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
that's all we have them on two separate

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.040 
that's all we have them on two separate
transparencies<00:01:28.540> I'm<00:01:28.750> going<00:01:28.870> to<00:01:28.930> do<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
transparencies I'm going to do the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.690 
transparencies I'm going to do the
silver<00:01:29.410> first<00:01:29.710> it's<00:01:30.130> going<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.280> be<00:01:30.430> on<00:01:30.580> the

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
silver first it's going to be on the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.420 
silver first it's going to be on the
bottom<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.330> then<00:01:32.250> afterwards<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.490> will<00:01:33.870> do<00:01:34.870> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
bottom and then afterwards I will do the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.390 
bottom and then afterwards I will do the
black<00:01:36.430> on<00:01:36.850> top<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.600> with<00:01:37.870> verse<00:01:38.590> and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
black on top of it with verse and

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.550 
black on top of it with verse and
everything<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:40.870> we<00:01:40.990> have<00:01:41.110> our<00:01:41.140> silver

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
everything and so we have our silver

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.250 
everything and so we have our silver
paint<00:01:41.830> which<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.550> might<00:01:42.790> run<00:01:42.940> out<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:44.200> we

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
paint which I might run out of and we

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.230 
paint which I might run out of and we
have<00:01:44.380> our<00:01:44.470> black<00:01:44.680> paint<00:01:45.010> and<00:01:45.640> then<00:01:45.970> like

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
have our black paint and then like

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.030 
have our black paint and then like
Brazilian<00:01:46.840> brushes<00:01:47.290> make<00:01:47.590> sure<00:01:47.770> you<00:01:47.890> get<00:01:47.980> a
