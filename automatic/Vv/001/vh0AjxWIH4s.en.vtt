architect's use this in larger mass
plantings<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> thought<00:00:56.489> I'd<00:00:56.670> cover<00:00:56.940> it

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
plantings so I thought I'd cover it

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.670 
plantings so I thought I'd cover it
because<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.600> does<00:00:57.809> seem<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> grass<00:00:58.649> that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
because it does seem to be a grass that

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
people are liking so one of the big

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.579 
people are liking so one of the big
benefits<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:02.090> as<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.300> design<00:01:03.960> element<00:01:04.199> is

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
benefits of it as a design element is

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.850 
benefits of it as a design element is
that<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.280> evergreen<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.049> Hardy<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that it's evergreen and it is Hardy to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.160 
that it's evergreen and it is Hardy to
around<00:01:08.250> zero<00:01:08.400> degrees<00:01:08.729> Fahrenheit<00:01:09.150> by<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
around zero degrees Fahrenheit by the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.310 
around zero degrees Fahrenheit by the
way<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:11.729> lot<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.450> grasses<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.080> are

way and a lot of the grasses that are

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.380 
way and a lot of the grasses that are
becoming<00:01:13.799> popular<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.610> think<00:01:14.939> that's<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
becoming popular I think that's the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.780 
becoming popular I think that's the
downfall<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.049> they're<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.740> evergreen<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.610> as

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
downfall is they're not evergreen and as

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.520 
downfall is they're not evergreen and as
a<00:01:17.820> designer<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.659> don't<00:01:18.840> want<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> leave<00:01:19.200> large

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
a designer we don't want to leave large

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.570 
a designer we don't want to leave large
holes<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.310> our<00:01:20.460> design<00:01:20.939> during<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> winter<00:01:22.290> or

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
holes in our design during the winter or

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.359

have the need for large amount of

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
have the need for large amount of
maintenance<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.180> cut<00:01:27.450> back<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.080> hope<00:01:28.229> that

maintenance and cut back and hope that

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.710 
maintenance and cut back and hope that
everything<00:01:28.740> works<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.400> at<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.759> start<00:01:30.600> of

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
everything works out at the start of

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.590 
everything works out at the start of
next<00:01:30.990> year<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.829> an<00:01:32.070> evergreen<00:01:32.640> grass<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.570> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
next year so an evergreen grass is a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
next year so an evergreen grass is a
really<00:01:33.990> beneficial<00:01:34.740> thing<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> have

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
really beneficial thing to have

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219 
really beneficial thing to have
especially<00:01:35.549> larger<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.110> know

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
especially larger like this you know

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.899 
especially larger like this you know
three<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> four<00:01:37.860> feet<00:01:38.070> sprit<00:01:38.430> e<00:01:38.460> good<00:01:38.670> sized

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
three to four feet sprit e good sized

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.240 
three to four feet sprit e good sized
spread<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.890> where<00:01:41.070> they've

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
spread you can see here where they've

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.230 
spread you can see here where they've
used<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.820> amassing<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.670> think<00:01:44.880> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
used it in amassing and so I think this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.630 
used it in amassing and so I think this
also<00:01:45.540> shows<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.619> my<00:01:46.740> concerns<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
also shows one of my concerns as a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.870 
also shows one of my concerns as a
designer<00:01:48.259> I<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.399> an<00:01:50.520> appropriate

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
designer I think this is an appropriate

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.870 
designer I think this is an appropriate
look<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.630> certain<00:01:51.869> areas<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:53.159> cleaning<00:01:53.549> this

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
look in certain areas but cleaning this

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.179 
look in certain areas but cleaning this
up<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.509> bit<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.990> work<00:01:55.200> somebody<00:01:55.740> really

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
up is a bit of work somebody really

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.420 
up is a bit of work somebody really
needs<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> come<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:58.159> deadhead<00:01:59.159> these

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
needs to come in here and deadhead these

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.319 
needs to come in here and deadhead these
and<00:01:59.850> remove<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.509> flower<00:02:00.750> stalks<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
and remove the flower stalks so that

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.020

they're<00:02:27.510> going<00:02:27.689> to<00:02:27.810> do<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.260> right

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
they're going to do the right

maintenance<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.189> it<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.610> when<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.970> should<00:02:30.180> be

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
maintenance on it and when it should be

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.839 
maintenance on it and when it should be
done<00:02:30.540> because<00:02:31.140> until<00:02:31.739> they<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:31.980> you're

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
done because until they do you're

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.360 
done because until they do you're
looking<00:02:33.269> at<00:02:33.420> what<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.720> see<00:02:33.989> here<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:35.159> me

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
looking at what you see here and for me

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.610 
looking at what you see here and for me
I<00:02:35.640> don't<00:02:36.150> mind<00:02:36.329> that<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.870> little<00:02:37.019> while<00:02:37.170> but

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
I don't mind that for a little while but

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.059 
I don't mind that for a little while but
I<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> cleaner<00:02:38.670> look<00:02:39.060> overall<00:02:39.799> for<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.829> lot

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
I like a cleaner look overall for a lot

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.130 
I like a cleaner look overall for a lot
of<00:02:41.250> applications<00:02:42.090> now<00:02:42.329> again<00:02:42.720> if<00:02:42.959> you're

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
of applications now again if you're

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.410 
of applications now again if you're
going<00:02:43.409> for<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.829> natural<00:02:44.430> appearance<00:02:44.879> then<00:02:45.299> I

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
going for a natural appearance then I

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.690 
going for a natural appearance then I
think<00:02:45.629> that's<00:02:45.870> fine<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.190> something<00:02:47.459> to

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
think that's fine but it is something to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.289 
think that's fine but it is something to
consider

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
consider

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.300 
consider
when<00:02:48.930> you're<00:02:49.079> making<00:02:49.290> your<00:02:49.470> your<00:02:50.010> plant

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
when you're making your your plant

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.930 
when you're making your your plant
selections<00:02:51.620> as<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.859> said<00:02:53.069> it's<00:02:53.280> three<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.700> four

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
selections as I said it's three to four

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.330 
selections as I said it's three to four
feet<00:02:54.120> tall<00:02:54.389> and<00:02:54.599> wide<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.200> then<00:02:55.409> those<00:02:55.980> flower

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
feet tall and wide and then those flower

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.300 
feet tall and wide and then those flower
stalks<00:02:56.760> come<00:02:57.150> up<00:02:57.299> another<00:02:57.659> 18<00:02:58.139> inches<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.769> 24

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
stalks come up another 18 inches to 24

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.410 
stalks come up another 18 inches to 24
inches<00:02:59.639> high<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:02.400> know<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.549> haven't<00:03:03.060> seen

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
inches high and you know I haven't seen

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.569 
inches high and you know I haven't seen
them<00:03:03.690> maintain<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:05.010> don't<00:03:05.069> own<00:03:05.370> this

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
them maintain this and I don't own this

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.390 
them maintain this and I don't own this
plan<00:03:05.909> I<00:03:05.940> haven't<00:03:06.420> grown<00:03:06.599> it<00:03:06.780> myself<00:03:07.069> but<00:03:08.069> my

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
plan I haven't grown it myself but my

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.039 
plan I haven't grown it myself but my
sense<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.510> they're<00:03:09.659> gonna<00:03:09.780> have<00:03:09.989> to

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
sense is is that they're gonna have to

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.110 
sense is is that they're gonna have to
come<00:03:10.379> in<00:03:10.409> here<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:10.980> lower<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.430> plant<00:03:11.700> quite<00:03:12.090> a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
come in here and lower the plant quite a

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.949 
come in here and lower the plant quite a
bit<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:13.019> remove<00:03:13.650> those<00:03:14.090> dead<00:03:15.090> flower<00:03:15.450> stalks

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
bit to remove those dead flower stalks

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.069 
bit to remove those dead flower stalks
and<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.409> doing<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.819> green<00:03:18.209> part<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.959> you

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
and in doing so the green part that you

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.500 
and in doing so the green part that you
see<00:03:19.319> at<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> base<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:20.910> going<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.299> get<00:03:21.480> a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
see at the base is going to get a

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.289 
see at the base is going to get a
cutting<00:03:21.989> as<00:03:22.169> well<00:03:22.199> so<00:03:22.889> it'll<00:03:23.819> be<00:03:23.970> interesting

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
cutting as well so it'll be interesting

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.080 
cutting as well so it'll be interesting
to<00:03:24.569> see<00:03:24.930> how<00:03:25.620> one<00:03:25.949> would<00:03:26.190> deal<00:03:26.459> with<00:03:26.669> that<00:03:26.879> but

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
to see how one would deal with that but

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.400 
to see how one would deal with that but
just<00:03:27.299> keep<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.780> mind<00:03:28.049> if<00:03:28.260> you're<00:03:28.379> thinking

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
just keep it in mind if you're thinking

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.309 
just keep it in mind if you're thinking
of<00:03:28.889> using<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:30.150> plant<00:03:30.449> because<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.840> does<00:03:31.109> have

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
of using the plant because it does have

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.199 
of using the plant because it does have
a<00:03:31.379> nice<00:03:31.620> appearance<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:32.489> got<00:03:32.699> this<00:03:32.879> fountain

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
a nice appearance it's got this fountain

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.839 
a nice appearance it's got this fountain
shape<00:03:33.720> naturally<00:03:34.500> these<00:03:35.069> plants<00:03:35.519> haven't

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
shape naturally these plants haven't

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.449 
shape naturally these plants haven't
been<00:03:35.970> touched<00:03:36.180> at<00:03:36.510> all<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.919> tell<00:03:38.190> in

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
been touched at all that I can tell in

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.900 
been touched at all that I can tell in
the<00:03:39.090> last<00:03:39.329> couple<00:03:39.629> of<00:03:39.840> years<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:40.910> that's

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
the last couple of years and so that's

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.729 
the last couple of years and so that's
the<00:03:42.090> other<00:03:42.209> thing<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.690> notice<00:03:43.079> is<00:03:43.199> when<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.440> look

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
the other thing I notice is when I look

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.710 
the other thing I notice is when I look
at<00:03:43.889> them<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:44.280> most<00:03:44.669> of<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.910> time<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.150> see<00:03:45.510> them

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
at them I most of the time I see them

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.500 
at them I most of the time I see them
even<00:03:46.139> if<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.799> spring<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.459> usually<00:03:48.269> see

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
even if it's in the spring I usually see

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.420 
even if it's in the spring I usually see
these<00:03:48.720> flower<00:03:49.049> stalks<00:03:49.500> sticking<00:03:50.069> up<00:03:50.220> that's

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
these flower stalks sticking up that's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.479

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
some of the other grasses out there

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.990 
some of the other grasses out there
these<00:04:00.480> do<00:04:00.690> take<00:04:01.530> low<00:04:01.799> water<00:04:02.099> for<00:04:02.519> sure<00:04:02.730> this

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
these do take low water for sure this

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.089 
these do take low water for sure this
area<00:04:03.389> you're<00:04:03.599> looking<00:04:03.629> at<00:04:04.199> they<00:04:04.440> barely<00:04:04.709> water

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
area you're looking at they barely water

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.309 
area you're looking at they barely water
it<00:04:05.340> at<00:04:05.459> all<00:04:05.639> this<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.180> Northern<00:04:06.599> California

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
it at all this is Northern California

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.899 
it at all this is Northern California
gets<00:04:07.530> ninety<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.159> a<00:04:08.190> hundred<00:04:08.280> degrees

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
gets ninety to a hundred degrees

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.390 
gets ninety to a hundred degrees
Fahrenheit<00:04:09.569> during<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.989> summer<00:04:10.229> and<00:04:10.500> gets

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
Fahrenheit during the summer and gets

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.659 
Fahrenheit during the summer and gets
into<00:04:11.669> the<00:04:11.819> mid-20s<00:04:12.690> typically<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.919> in<00:04:14.129> the

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
into the mid-20s typically in the in the

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.120 
into the mid-20s typically in the in the
winter<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.299> this<00:04:15.750> handles<00:04:16.289> all<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.799> just

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
winter and this handles all of that just

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.550 
winter and this handles all of that just
fine<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.729> a<00:04:17.760> nice<00:04:18.060> low<00:04:18.329> water<00:04:18.630> plant<00:04:19.049> it's

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
fine so a nice low water plant it's

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.610 
fine so a nice low water plant it's
native<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.159> the<00:04:20.669> South<00:04:21.109> southwestern<00:04:22.109> United

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
native to the South southwestern United

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.879 
native to the South southwestern United
States<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.280> northern<00:04:24.120> Mexico<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:25.200> it's<00:04:25.680> used

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
States and northern Mexico so it's used

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.409 
States and northern Mexico so it's used
to<00:04:26.070> some<00:04:26.280> drier<00:04:26.550> conditions

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
to some drier conditions

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.070 
to some drier conditions
so<00:04:28.289> as<00:04:29.009> ever<00:04:29.490> green<00:04:29.789> grasses<00:04:30.120> go<00:04:30.569> this<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.050> a

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
so as ever green grasses go this is a

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.100 
so as ever green grasses go this is a
nice<00:04:31.379> choice<00:04:31.740> it's<00:04:32.129> a<00:04:32.569> medium-sized<00:04:33.569> plant

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
nice choice it's a medium-sized plant

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.279 
nice choice it's a medium-sized plant
and<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:35.460> think<00:04:36.029> that's<00:04:36.240> about<00:04:36.419> what<00:04:36.749> I<00:04:36.779> can<00:04:36.930> tell

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
and I think that's about what I can tell

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.320 
and I think that's about what I can tell
you<00:04:37.439> and<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:38.069> deer<00:04:38.310> don't<00:04:38.520> eat<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:38.879> by<00:04:39.029> the<00:04:39.090> way

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
you and the deer don't eat it by the way

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.540 
you and the deer don't eat it by the way
it<00:04:39.479> is<00:04:39.629> deer<00:04:39.930> tolerant<00:04:40.529> I<00:04:40.680> think<00:04:41.249> the<00:04:41.400> only

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
it is deer tolerant I think the only

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.989 
it is deer tolerant I think the only
hesitation<00:04:41.999> I<00:04:42.659> have<00:04:42.900> with<00:04:43.139> it<00:04:43.349> is<00:04:43.620> the

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:43.999 
hesitation I have with it is the

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.309 
hesitation I have with it is the
maintenance<00:04:44.999> but<00:04:45.330> I<00:04:45.599> think<00:04:45.840> if<00:04:46.020> you've<00:04:46.199> only

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
maintenance but I think if you've only

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.589 
maintenance but I think if you've only
got<00:04:46.499> one<00:04:46.919> or<00:04:47.069> two<00:04:47.099> that's<00:04:47.520> not<00:04:47.699> a<00:04:47.879> challenge<00:04:48.180> at

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
got one or two that's not a challenge at

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.929 
got one or two that's not a challenge at
all<00:04:48.749> it<00:04:49.319> would<00:04:49.469> be<00:04:49.650> fairly<00:04:50.099> easy<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.580> clean<00:04:50.909> up

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
all it would be fairly easy to clean up

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.209 
all it would be fairly easy to clean up
one<00:04:51.330> or<00:04:51.479> two<00:04:51.509> of<00:04:51.840> these<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.289> just<00:04:52.349> think<00:04:53.039> in

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
one or two of these I just think in

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:54.860 
one or two of these I just think in
masks<00:04:53.699> that<00:04:53.789> might<00:04:53.999> be<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.210> bit<00:04:54.419> of<00:04:54.509> a<00:04:54.599> problem

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
masks that might be a bit of a problem

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.050 
masks that might be a bit of a problem
and<00:04:55.199> that<00:04:55.259> is<00:04:55.949> Mullen<00:04:56.400> bersia

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
and that is Mullen bersia

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.259 
and that is Mullen bersia
