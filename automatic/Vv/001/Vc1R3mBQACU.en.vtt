sock the fabric of the sock over on

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.050 
sock the fabric of the sock over on
itself<00:01:05.620> so<00:01:06.340> roll<00:01:06.610> it<00:01:06.760> down<00:01:06.940> to<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.600> very<00:01:07.720> end

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
itself so roll it down to the very end

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.380 
itself so roll it down to the very end
simple<00:01:10.060> enough<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.630> keep<00:01:11.110> on<00:01:11.290> going<00:01:12.390> this

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
simple enough and keep on going this

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.940 
simple enough and keep on going this
might<00:01:13.600> be<00:01:13.810> faster<00:01:13.990> if<00:01:14.410> you<00:01:14.500> have<00:01:14.620> a<00:01:14.650> bigger

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
might be faster if you have a bigger

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
might be faster if you have a bigger
sock<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:16.810> once<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:17.560> get<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.980> end

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
sock and then once you get to the end

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.760 
sock and then once you get to the end
you'll<00:01:19.600> have<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:19.870> little<00:01:20.290> bit<00:01:20.620> of<00:01:20.650> that

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
you'll have a little bit of that

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.830 
you'll have a little bit of that
stretchy<00:01:21.400> fabric<00:01:22.030> that's<00:01:22.240> kind<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.630> got

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
stretchy fabric that's kind of got

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.440 
stretchy fabric that's kind of got
elastic<00:01:23.440> in<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.710> I<00:01:23.920> like<00:01:24.400> these<00:01:24.730> i<00:01:25.000> like<00:01:25.300> that

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
elastic in it I like these i like that

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.780 
elastic in it I like these i like that
particular<00:01:25.780> sock<00:01:26.710> that<00:01:26.860> has<00:01:27.010> an<00:01:27.130> elastic<00:01:27.340> band

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
particular sock that has an elastic band

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.030 
particular sock that has an elastic band
around<00:01:27.910> it<00:01:28.210> because<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.990> makes<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.320> easier<00:01:29.740> for

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
around it because it makes it easier for

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.490 
around it because it makes it easier for
the<00:01:30.220> sock<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.700> keep<00:01:30.730> its<00:01:31.150> form<00:01:31.260> so<00:01:32.260> you<00:01:32.350> just

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
the sock to keep its form so you just

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.000 
the sock to keep its form so you just
fold<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:32.920> elastic<00:01:33.430> part<00:01:33.640> over<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.890> it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
fold that elastic part over and then it

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.970 
fold that elastic part over and then it
creates<00:01:36.190> your<00:01:36.400> little<00:01:36.670> donut<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.710> there<00:01:38.890> it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
creates your little donut and there it

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.150 
creates your little donut and there it
is<00:01:39.070> so<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.630> got<00:01:40.840> two<00:01:41.050> different<00:01:41.200> shape<00:01:41.530> here

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
is so you got two different shape here

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.770 
is so you got two different shape here
you<00:01:42.340> got<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.460> big<00:01:42.700> one<00:01:42.910> that's<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.570> one<00:01:43.690> that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
I'm going to use in this one big ish i

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.700

I'm just gonna slip that through my hair
it's<00:02:18.190> more<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.490> like<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.700> molding

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
it's more of like a molding

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.740 
it's more of like a molding
max<00:02:19.280> it's<00:02:19.730> got<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:19.940> little<00:02:20.090> bit<00:02:20.240> of<00:02:20.270> shine<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.720> it

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
max it's got a little bit of shine to it

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.590 
max it's got a little bit of shine to it
and<00:02:21.740> I'm<00:02:21.860> going<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.040> take<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.190> comb<00:02:22.490> if<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:23.360> have

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
and I'm going to take a comb if you have

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.680 
and I'm going to take a comb if you have
a<00:02:23.930> teasing<00:02:24.500> comb<00:02:24.530> or<00:02:25.130> teasing<00:02:25.670> brush<00:02:26.030> at<00:02:26.450> home

a teasing comb or teasing brush at home

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.360 
a teasing comb or teasing brush at home
that<00:02:26.960> probably<00:02:27.680> would<00:02:27.920> work<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.190> lot<00:02:28.220> better

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
that probably would work a lot better

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.390 
that probably would work a lot better
just<00:02:29.360> because<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.930> does<00:02:30.290> reduce<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.980> frizz<00:02:31.220> in

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
just because it does reduce the frizz in

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400

I mean roll it down more and more more
and<00:03:42.230> more<00:03:42.560> until<00:03:42.860> you<00:03:43.190> reach<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.640> very<00:03:43.880> bottom

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
and more until you reach the very bottom

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.800

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
play around with it until you like it

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.190 
play around with it until you like it
and<00:03:51.280> then<00:03:52.280> take<00:03:52.610> another<00:03:52.760> elastic<00:03:53.390> band<00:03:53.930> and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
and then take another elastic band and

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.440 
and then take another elastic band and
then<00:03:54.680> wrap<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.070> around<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.640> so<00:03:55.940> it's<00:03:56.180> nice<00:03:56.420> and

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
then wrap it around it so it's nice and

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.100 
then wrap it around it so it's nice and
tight<00:03:57.280> that<00:03:58.280> way<00:03:58.400> doesn't<00:03:58.610> fly<00:03:58.970> around<00:03:59.120> or<00:03:59.630> get

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
tight that way doesn't fly around or get

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.790 
tight that way doesn't fly around or get
loose<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:01.220> it's<00:04:01.370> nice<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:01.790> secure<00:04:02.500> now<00:04:03.500> mine

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
loose and it's nice and secure now mine

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.680 
loose and it's nice and secure now mine
could<00:04:03.980> have<00:04:04.070> been<00:04:04.190> tighter<00:04:04.459> but<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.540> get<00:04:05.630> the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
could have been tighter but you get the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.480 
could have been tighter but you get the
general<00:04:05.900> idea<00:04:06.200> I<00:04:06.680> like<00:04:06.950> it<00:04:07.100> kind<00:04:07.280> of<00:04:07.310> loose

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
general idea I like it kind of loose

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.870 
general idea I like it kind of loose
anyways<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.360> that's<00:04:08.510> basically<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.610> top<00:04:10.610> nut

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
anyways and that's basically the top nut

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.320

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080

part<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:03.080> next<00:05:03.350> I'm<00:05:03.440> going<00:05:03.590> in<00:05:03.740> with<00:05:03.770> my

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
part and next I'm going in with my

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.940 
part and next I'm going in with my
second<00:05:04.370> hair<00:05:04.520> extension<00:05:05.060> now<00:05:06.020> I<00:05:06.050> clip<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:06.770> on

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
second hair extension now I clip this on

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.530 
second hair extension now I clip this on
the<00:05:07.040> opposite<00:05:07.520> side<00:05:07.730> so<00:05:07.970> don't<00:05:08.060> have<00:05:08.240> all<00:05:08.420> the

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
the opposite side so don't have all the

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.360 
the opposite side so don't have all the
clips<00:05:08.780> all<00:05:08.990> on<00:05:09.140> one<00:05:09.260> side<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:09.560> it's<00:05:09.890> too<00:05:10.160> heavy

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
clips all on one side and it's too heavy

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.230 
clips all on one side and it's too heavy
and<00:05:10.640> it<00:05:10.760> gets<00:05:10.990> kind<00:05:11.990> of<00:05:12.080> clunky<00:05:12.290> looking<00:05:12.770> and

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
and it gets kind of clunky looking and

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.790 
and it gets kind of clunky looking and
then<00:05:14.240> continue<00:05:14.810> to<00:05:14.900> wrap<00:05:15.080> that<00:05:15.230> around<00:05:15.290> and

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
then continue to wrap that around and

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.070 
then continue to wrap that around and
now<00:05:16.250> I've<00:05:16.400> got<00:05:16.610> my<00:05:16.760> last<00:05:16.970> hair<00:05:17.270> extension<00:05:17.810> I

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
now I've got my last hair extension I

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.400 
now I've got my last hair extension I
want<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:18.920> be<00:05:19.010> a<00:05:19.100> big<00:05:19.400> ol<00:05:19.610> bun<00:05:20.030> so<00:05:20.570> I'm

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
want it to be a big ol bun so I'm

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.460 
want it to be a big ol bun so I'm
clipping<00:05:21.740> that<00:05:22.010> all<00:05:22.250> around<00:05:23.140> it<00:05:24.140> will<00:05:24.350> get

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
clipping that all around it will get

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.170 
clipping that all around it will get
kind<00:05:24.710> of<00:05:24.770> messy<00:05:24.980> but<00:05:25.430> it's<00:05:25.460> going<00:05:25.790> to<00:05:25.880> be<00:05:25.970> ok

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
kind of messy but it's going to be ok

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.610 
kind of messy but it's going to be ok
because<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.660> sock<00:05:26.960> bun<00:05:27.170> is<00:05:27.290> going<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.470> cover

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
because the sock bun is going to cover

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
and instead of just folding it over

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.520 
and instead of just folding it over
itself<00:05:35.150> i'm<00:05:35.450> actually<00:05:35.630> bringing<00:05:36.110> it<00:05:36.290> all<00:05:36.470> the

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
way down to the base yes I find works a

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.100 
way down to the base yes I find works a
lot<00:05:39.440> easier<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:39.980> is<00:05:40.460> less<00:05:40.820> tiresome<00:05:41.690> on<00:05:41.930> your

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
lot easier and is less tiresome on your

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.370 
lot easier and is less tiresome on your
arms<00:05:42.500> if<00:05:42.740> you<00:05:42.860> have<00:05:43.040> long<00:05:43.250> hair<00:05:43.930> just<00:05:44.930> bring<00:05:45.230> it

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
arms if you have long hair just bring it

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.650 
arms if you have long hair just bring it
all<00:05:45.500> the<00:05:45.530> way<00:05:45.710> down<00:05:45.740> to<00:05:45.920> the<00:05:46.100> base<00:05:46.340> and<00:05:46.760> start

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.080 
all the way down to the base and start
showering<00:05:48.080> your<00:05:48.560> hair<00:05:48.860> over<00:05:49.130> the<00:05:49.430> button<00:05:49.760> so

showering your hair over the button so

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.659 
showering your hair over the button so
