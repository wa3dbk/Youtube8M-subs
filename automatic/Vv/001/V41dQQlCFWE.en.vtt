00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.350
 detail but one as here you see this is 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.199
 my new house as you are seeing and good 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.940
 Well basically the house is totally 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.860
 new everything different I have not tried 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.540
 still the editor mode the creator mode 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.610
 of content because you can edit or 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.559
 something but good the new house comes like this 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.210
 of design there are five new houses that 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.489
 They are in five different positions 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.170
 ok and then at the end of the video 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.699
 I will also show you where you have it 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.619
 buy how good is in the same place 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.390
 of always also the new cars 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.340
 and all that much are also going 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.570
 to teach and well basically the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.880
 home I will teach a little here by 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.909
 above the rooms and such that there 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.250
 basically it 's similar to the previous ones 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.869
 but in different ways it is worth and good 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.820
 Then I'll teach it also in 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.250
 the garage that I have here we also have 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.290
 a new garage and well then we have 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.020
 here the three cars and tuned the 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.270
 I have pretty cool as it is 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.710
 quite tuned already to stop for the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.840
 you see already modified and as 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.749
 they would be worth the paint and all that 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.619
 as you want and well then 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.940
 basically, we're going to take out the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.100
 I will also teach it one by one 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.470
 It is worn and so and so well 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.250
 I wanted to tell you the first car the most 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.380
 expensive is worth 725 thousand also you will see 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.120
 I will put the page of the cars on 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.250
 second is worth two hundred and one thousand 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.790
 new record exactly and in the motorcycle 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.560
 It's worth 75 thousand voucher, it only stays because 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.120
 They are quite cheap and good 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.830
 I'm just going to show you a 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.410
 little bit of background is also bought where 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.780
 always where the luxury cars and good 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.430
 we also have a new weapon that 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.429
 I'm going to show him now how he shoots and 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.690
 so and also new clothes is worth that in 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.040
 this case in this video I'm not going to 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.470
 teach everything step by step but 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.730
 just so you can see a new 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.340
 wrinkle, for example, what I have 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.870
 put is new and good clothes then there and 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.730

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.190
 many more things that we are here 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.900
 inquiring and such the color of euros I 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.120
 not found at least I do not 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.490
 I've seen since I think that it was not 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.260
 true what some channels have uploaded 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.790
 and thallium I did not upload it but well I do not know if 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.050
 you will have seen that some people went up 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.550
 a video that there was a golden color 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.950
 that would be worth a million dollars or something 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.989
 so that I have not seen anything of 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.610
 That's okay and well, kids later 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.660
 we will also try to upload a video 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.030
 as I said with everything 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.580
 the other things that are going to come out new or 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.750
 it's good that new ones have come out because 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.700
 I have many things left to investigate 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.490

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.170
 I already know that you want to see the new 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.000
 house the new cars so here what 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.590

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.480
 I liked that if it's like that, resell 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.040
 the live favorites button and nothing else 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.420
 you have the update available as 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.160
 installs asks a lot simply 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.990
 start if the game if it was only worth 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.370
