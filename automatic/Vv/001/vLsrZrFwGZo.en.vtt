00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.290
 parting with the legend of taking part 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.690
 Rostislav Chad 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.539

 tonight when I get enough 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:21.539
 signboards 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.400

 university attribute creation 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:33.700
 of the company 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.990

 we had a lot of deletions we had 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.560
 hard to keep physically by analogy 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.960

 and this is alien game 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.590

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.880
 ashore further country 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.900

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.760
 values â€‹â€‹successfully treats from global 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.660
