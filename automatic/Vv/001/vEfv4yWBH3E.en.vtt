00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770 
to be the case too many people out there

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.709 
to be the case too many people out there
that<00:00:11.100> are<00:00:11.160> currently<00:00:11.580> playing<00:00:11.879> GTA<00:00:12.360> 5

that are currently playing GTA 5
storyline<00:00:14.539> claiming<00:00:15.539> that<00:00:15.779> the<00:00:16.020> story<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.680> too

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
storyline claiming that the story is too

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.240 
storyline claiming that the story is too
short<00:00:18.029> now<00:00:18.779> there's<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.230> reason<00:00:19.740> why<00:00:19.949> people

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
short now there's a reason why people

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.370 
short now there's a reason why people
think<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.000> might<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.359> too<00:00:21.630> short<00:00:21.660> it

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
think that it might be too short it

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.150 
think that it might be too short it
could<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.429> having<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.960> less<00:00:25.829> side

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
could be having to do with less side

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.450 
could be having to do with less side
missions<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.999> could<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.460> how

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
missions it could have to do with how

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.210 
missions it could have to do with how
the<00:00:29.519> story<00:00:29.999> was<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.480> built<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.079> maybe<00:00:31.919> was

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
the story was just built and maybe was

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.400 
the story was just built and maybe was
just<00:00:32.400> made<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:32.880> shorter<00:00:33.300> than<00:00:33.329> GTA<00:00:33.900> fours

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
just made to be shorter than GTA fours

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.700 
just made to be shorter than GTA fours
it<00:00:34.739> could<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.640> any<00:00:35.910> kind<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.720> circumstances

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it could be any kind of circumstances

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.279 
it could be any kind of circumstances
that<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:38.430> makes<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:39.000> game<00:00:39.149> shorter<00:00:39.719> it

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
that actually makes the game shorter it

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.920 
that actually makes the game shorter it
also<00:00:40.739> has<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.850> how<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.090> player<00:00:42.449> plays

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
also has to do with how the player plays

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.610 
also has to do with how the player plays
the<00:00:43.230> game<00:00:43.410> itself<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.620> really

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you've been hyped up for it for years of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.270 
you've been hyped up for it for years of
course<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> play<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> hell<00:00:53.250> out

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.849 
course you're going to play the hell out
of<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.940> you're<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.170> playing<00:00:55.440> as

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
of it and you're going to be playing as

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.669 
of it and you're going to be playing as
much<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.429> you<00:00:56.550> want<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.379> thus<00:00:58.379> that's

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
much as you want to and thus that's

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.380 
much as you want to and thus that's
going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> make<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> story<00:00:59.489> go<00:00:59.670> much<00:01:00.000> faster

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
going to make the story go much faster

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.619 
going to make the story go much faster
so<00:01:01.019> in<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:02.070> opinion<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.000> did<00:01:03.269> want<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
so in my opinion if you did want the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.600 
so in my opinion if you did want the
story<00:01:04.050> to<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.410> slower<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.910> gotta<00:01:06.150> focus<00:01:07.020> on

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
story to go slower you gotta focus on

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.960 
story to go slower you gotta focus on

just had this urge like I gotta run or
something<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.820> know<00:02:55.850> because<00:02:56.450> you've<00:02:56.600> just

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
something you know because you've just

been sewn inactive for hours it's

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.960 
been sewn inactive for hours it's
basically<00:03:00.350> like<00:03:00.560> sleeping<00:03:01.190> but<00:03:01.340> focusing<00:03:01.880> on

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
basically like sleeping but focusing on

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.870 
basically like sleeping but focusing on
something<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:04.360> anyways<00:03:05.360> GTA<00:03:06.050> 5<00:03:06.319> I<00:03:06.739> guess<00:03:07.640> you

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
something but anyways GTA 5 I guess you

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.720 
something but anyways GTA 5 I guess you
could<00:03:08.150> say<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.660> fact<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:10.069> in<00:03:10.700> fact

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
could say it's a fact that it is in fact

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.750 
could say it's a fact that it is in fact
shorter<00:03:11.600> than<00:03:11.810> gta4<00:03:12.430> but<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.550> big<00:03:13.730> question

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
shorter than gta4 but the big question

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.590 
shorter than gta4 but the big question
is<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.989> too<00:03:15.380> short<00:03:15.739> well<00:03:16.489> that's<00:03:17.000> all<00:03:17.360> by

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
is is it too short well that's all by

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.350 
is is it too short well that's all by
perception<00:03:18.170> it's<00:03:18.590> about<00:03:19.160> how<00:03:19.640> much<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.060> play

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
perception it's about how much you play

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.860 
perception it's about how much you play
a<00:03:20.390> day<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.459> what<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.579> moderation<00:03:23.090> is<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:23.840> I

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
even better I think because then you

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.030 
even better I think because then you
really<00:03:53.450> look<00:03:53.600> forward<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:54.290> next<00:03:54.440> day<00:03:54.769> and

really look forward to the next day and

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.340 
really look forward to the next day and
you<00:03:55.910> kind<00:03:56.120> of<00:03:56.209> just<00:03:56.390> hyped<00:03:56.630> up<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.019> play<00:03:57.230> it

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
you kind of just hyped up to play it

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.990 
you kind of just hyped up to play it
again<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:58.100> you're<00:03:58.250> kind<00:03:58.430> of<00:03:58.519> forcing<00:03:58.940> yourself

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
again so you're kind of forcing yourself

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.080 
again so you're kind of forcing yourself
to<00:03:59.329> not<00:03:59.510> play<00:03:59.900> after<00:04:00.320> three<00:04:00.560> missions<00:04:01.090> that's

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
to not play after three missions that's

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.750 
to not play after three missions that's
what's<00:04:02.329> my<00:04:02.510> suggestion<00:04:03.260> it's<00:04:03.560> not<00:04:03.799> a<00:04:04.100> complete

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
what's my suggestion it's not a complete

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.539 
what's my suggestion it's not a complete
fact<00:04:05.630> that<00:04:06.049> it<00:04:06.290> will<00:04:06.530> in<00:04:06.709> fact<00:04:06.950> work<00:04:07.310> for

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
fact that it will in fact work for

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.819 
fact that it will in fact work for
everybody<00:04:07.790> but<00:04:08.269> if<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:09.049> do<00:04:09.260> want<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.560> story

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
everybody but if you do want the story

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.620 
everybody but if you do want the story
to<00:04:09.859> last<00:04:10.130> longer<00:04:10.400> if<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.820> do<00:04:11.000> think<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.359> is<00:04:11.390> in

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
to last longer if you do think it is in

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.039 
to last longer if you do think it is in
fact<00:04:11.870> too<00:04:12.079> short<00:04:12.470> that<00:04:13.310> is<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:14.299> ultimate

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
fact too short that is the ultimate
