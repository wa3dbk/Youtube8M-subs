and stuff like that but apparently
that's<00:02:01.770> not<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> case<00:02:02.360> we're<00:02:03.360> not

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that's not really the case we're not

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.660 
that's not really the case we're not
gonna<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> lot<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.259> them<00:02:04.590> actually<00:02:05.460> we're

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
gonna have a lot of them actually we're

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.190

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
not gonna have at all any you know

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.169 
not gonna have at all any you know
credibility<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.979> Kara<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.789> can't<00:02:09.000> upgrade

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
credibility on Kara so we can't upgrade

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.260 
credibility on Kara so we can't upgrade
any<00:02:09.989> carrots<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> game<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:12.120> can

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
any carrots that are in the game we can

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.400 
any carrots that are in the game we can
only<00:02:12.450> tune<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:13.050> set

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
only tune be set

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.680 
only tune be set
of<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:14.070> after<00:02:15.030> hands<00:02:15.210> themselves<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.630> know

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
of the after hands themselves you know

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.410 
of the after hands themselves you know
the<00:02:15.870> setup<00:02:16.110> that's<00:02:16.850> that's<00:02:17.850> already<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.210> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the setup that's that's already on the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.610 
the setup that's that's already on the
case<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.690> can<00:02:18.810> basically<00:02:18.960> just<00:02:19.200> tuned<00:02:19.470> out

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
case you can basically just tuned out

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.830 
case you can basically just tuned out
and<00:02:19.800> change<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.850> way<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.420> want<00:02:21.750> to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
and change it to to the way you want to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.320 
and change it to to the way you want to
and<00:02:22.110> that's<00:02:23.100> pretty<00:02:23.370> much<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.820> there's<00:02:24.210> not

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and that's pretty much it so there's not

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.150 
and that's pretty much it so there's not
gonna<00:02:24.450> be<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.660> lot<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.110> freedom<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.950> game

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
gonna be a lot of freedom in that game

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.620 
gonna be a lot of freedom in that game
and<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.700> feel<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.030> that's<00:02:27.120> gonna<00:02:27.300> take<00:02:27.570> a

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
and I feel that that's gonna take a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.450 
and I feel that that's gonna take a
little<00:02:27.960> bit<00:02:28.110> away<00:02:28.260> from<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.890> fun<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.430> that

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
little bit away from the fun in that

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.670 
little bit away from the fun in that
game<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> feel<00:02:30.090> like<00:02:30.210> we<00:02:30.660> can<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:31.080> don't<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.650> I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
game I feel like we can I don't know I

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.020 
game I feel like we can I don't know I
feel<00:02:31.890> like<00:02:32.070> project<00:02:32.430> guys<00:02:32.550> should<00:02:32.760> have<00:02:32.880> been

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
feel like project guys should have been

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.960 
feel like project guys should have been
something<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.380> an<00:02:34.590> all-around<00:02:35.520> game<00:02:35.730> now<00:02:35.940> I

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
on the second highest difficulty so it's

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.570
