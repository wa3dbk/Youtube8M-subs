00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.089
 welcome adore salted fish 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.420
 but since in America this is a problem 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.920
 I decided to buy a good salted fish 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.480
 pickle salmon for yourself and so now from 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.930
 this big piece i'll cut myself 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.510
 small piece because I have a taste 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.000
 my husband is about American and how 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.269
 most americans 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.670
 he also does not perceive this taste he 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.369
 does not understand him and he is never 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.950
 Well, I donâ€™t force you 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.180
 so for yourself on sandwiches to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.239
 make i cut this one here 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 the rest will be with us for baking on 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.149
 grill 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.420
 for frying and further on this recipe i 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.550
 Already not the first time I like him 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.930
 so I decided to do it again 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.840
 next we need salt 2 canteens 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.280
 spoons and a teaspoon of sugar well maybe 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.650
 be everything will not go to this piece of site 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.070
 mix further 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.710
 black peas and pepper and grains and whole 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.659
 mustard seeds 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.340
 bay leaf so i already broke it to you 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:25.310
 like and slices and lemon juice now 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.310
 rub this piece of salt with sugar 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:38.350
 you need to fish was just good 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.350
 Lena on the mustard grain and 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.230
 this pepper 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.340
 Now I'll put the fish here 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:55.940
 it means we just pour out to the bottom 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.320
 the rest he is a plastic container 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:04.600
 will the fish marinate 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.600
 a refrigerator like this 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.550
 So 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.550
 and yes under it still need so here leaves 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.989
 5 months 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.989
 shalom new 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.720
 and now lemon juice on both sides 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.940
 so one lemon is quite possible 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.480
 do without a lemon but i love that kind of 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.480
 you anime 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.810
 all and send in the fridge for two days 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.270
 not less 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:07.880
 then show the result so after two 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.950
 of the day here I got it out of the fridge so 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.680
 she looks smells very fragrant 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.960
 fine i'm gonna take away all those leaves now 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.060
 and 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:22.790
 peas like mustard pepper cut the fish 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.820
 here and so looks like a fish in the cut I'm 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.010
 it did not wash just cleared the marinade 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.920
 to be unnecessary by no means 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.700
 cut so thin strips and 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.790
 Now you can on sandwiches 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.490
 salad but I want to cook with 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.440

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.440
