00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:13.849 
three-point line moved a little bit the
shot<00:04:12.540> clock<00:04:12.840> over<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.230> years<00:04:13.470> has<00:04:13.560> been

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
shot clock over the years has been

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.490 
shot clock over the years has been
changed<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.910> all<00:04:15.120> of<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.359> is<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.780> think<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.289> good

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
changed so all of that is I think a good

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.240 
changed so all of that is I think a good
move<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:17.039> try<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.419> unify<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:18.930> make<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.440> one

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
move to try to unify and make it one

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.510 
move to try to unify and make it one
corpse<00:04:20.729> one<00:04:21.269> dimension<00:04:21.870> same<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:23.159> know<00:04:23.250> same

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
corpse one dimension same you know same

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.220 
corpse one dimension same you know same
thing<00:04:23.760> for<00:04:23.909> everything

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
thing for everything

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.600 
thing for everything
III<00:04:26.230> would<00:04:26.650> think<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.070> rules<00:04:27.310> make<00:04:27.580> a

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
III would think that the rules make a

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.070 
III would think that the rules make a
lot<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:27.880> sense<00:04:28.000> because<00:04:28.450> you're<00:04:28.900> going<00:04:29.020> to

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
lot of sense because you're going to

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.870 
lot of sense because you're going to
carry<00:04:29.320> it<00:04:29.470> over<00:04:29.560> into<00:04:29.740> World<00:04:30.130> Championships

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
carry it over into World Championships

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.360 
carry it over into World Championships
why<00:04:31.120> all<00:04:31.420> of<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.600> sudden<00:04:31.900> have<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.260> adjust<00:04:33.100> and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
why all of a sudden have to adjust and

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.130 
why all of a sudden have to adjust and
change<00:04:33.460> everything<00:04:33.910> you've<00:04:34.300> done<00:04:34.480> when

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
but these are things that may take time

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.660

this<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:57.580> year<00:04:57.880> what<00:04:58.090> do<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.210> think

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
this and this year what do you think

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.500 
this and this year what do you think
about<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.750> smile<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.320> painting<00:04:59.680> out<00:04:59.800> I

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
about the smile and the painting out I

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.160 
about the smile and the painting out I
am<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:02.020> fan<00:05:02.410> of<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:03.250> restricted<00:05:04.180> area<00:05:04.270> because

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
am a fan of the restricted area because

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.540 
am a fan of the restricted area because
i<00:05:05.880> think<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.150> such<00:05:07.510> a<00:05:07.720> difficult<00:05:08.050> call<00:05:08.920> when

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
i think it is such a difficult call when

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.410 
i think it is such a difficult call when
players<00:05:09.970> of<00:05:10.420> mba<00:05:11.080> size<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:12.550> are<00:05:12.880> as<00:05:13.000> big<00:05:13.270> as

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
players of mba size that are as big as

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.890 
players of mba size that are as big as
they<00:05:13.570> are<00:05:13.600> jump<00:05:14.530> as<00:05:14.710> well<00:05:14.920> as<00:05:15.100> they<00:05:15.280> do<00:05:15.340> and

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
they are jump as well as they do and

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.560 
they are jump as well as they do and
explode<00:05:16.900> as<00:05:17.200> quickly<00:05:17.470> as<00:05:17.740> they<00:05:17.770> do<00:05:17.980> and

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
explode as quickly as they do and

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.540 
explode as quickly as they do and
another<00:05:19.570> player<00:05:19.960> makes<00:05:20.650> a<00:05:20.830> move<00:05:21.010> to<00:05:21.040> get<00:05:21.370> to

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
another player makes a move to get to

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.360 
another player makes a move to get to
that<00:05:21.670> spot<00:05:21.910> and<00:05:22.360> you're<00:05:22.750> talking<00:05:22.990> about<00:05:23.470> this

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
that spot and you're talking about this

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.340 
that spot and you're talking about this
much<00:05:24.700> distance<00:05:25.150> sometimes<00:05:25.870> and<00:05:26.110> whether<00:05:26.260> he

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
much distance sometimes and whether he

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.320 
much distance sometimes and whether he
got<00:05:26.830> to<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.130> spot<00:05:27.250> or<00:05:27.430> didn't<00:05:28.000> get<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.300> the

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
got to the spot or didn't get to the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.630 
got to the spot or didn't get to the
spot<00:05:28.660> and<00:05:29.200> what<00:05:29.470> this<00:05:29.620> does<00:05:29.680> is<00:05:30.130> it<00:05:30.160> helps

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
spot and what this does is it helps

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.990 
spot and what this does is it helps
clear<00:05:31.000> up<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.450> very<00:05:32.170> important<00:05:32.800> call<00:05:33.130> for<00:05:33.910> the

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
clear up a very important call for the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.990 
clear up a very important call for the
officials<00:05:34.510> because<00:05:34.870> it's<00:05:35.860> either<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:36.370> basket

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
officials because it's either a basket

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.090 
officials because it's either a basket
that's<00:05:37.180> good<00:05:37.450> two<00:05:37.900> points<00:05:38.140> or<00:05:38.470> you're<00:05:38.890> taking

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
that's good two points or you're taking

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.420 
that's good two points or you're taking
a<00:05:39.400> basket<00:05:39.820> away<00:05:39.910> and<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:40.540> can<00:05:40.750> change<00:05:41.020> the

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
a basket away and that can change the

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.830 
a basket away and that can change the
course<00:05:42.430> of<00:05:42.640> the<00:05:42.730> game<00:05:42.880> obviously<00:05:43.330> so<00:05:43.660> if<00:05:43.750> it

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
course of the game obviously so if it

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.110 
course of the game obviously so if it
helps<00:05:44.140> the<00:05:44.260> officials<00:05:44.800> get<00:05:45.250> it<00:05:45.400> right<00:05:45.670> I'm

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
helps the officials get it right I'm

helps the officials get it right I'm
good<00:05:46.660> with<00:05:46.780> it<00:05:46.840> so<00:05:47.200> it's<00:05:47.230> part<00:05:47.710> of<00:05:47.830> the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
good with it so it's part of the

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.010 
good with it so it's part of the
evolution<00:05:48.340> about<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.150> physicality<00:05:49.660> of<00:05:49.900> the

evolution about the physicality of the
