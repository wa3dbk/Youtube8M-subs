that's<00:03:31.320> your<00:03:31.560> reasoning<00:03:31.980> my<00:03:32.130> time<00:03:32.370> cause<00:03:32.610> war

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
that's your reasoning my time cause war

and<00:03:33.030> I'm<00:03:33.090> not<00:03:33.209> saying<00:03:33.540> it's<00:03:34.019> impossible<00:03:34.590> for

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
and I'm not saying it's impossible for

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.120 
and I'm not saying it's impossible for
you<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.400> not<00:03:35.610> like<00:03:35.820> titanfall<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:37.010> think<00:03:38.010> if

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
you to not like titanfall but I think if

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.500
