head<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:26.180> finally<00:02:27.180> section<00:02:27.540> five<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.709> waist

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
head and finally section five the waist

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.160 
head and finally section five the waist
I<00:02:30.530> know<00:02:31.530> there's<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.610> lot<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.030> pieces<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.989> this

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
I know there's a lot of pieces in this

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.830 
I know there's a lot of pieces in this
particular<00:02:34.709> section<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.450> do<00:02:36.630> your<00:02:36.660> best

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
particular section but just do your best

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.800 
particular section but just do your best
to<00:02:37.230> find<00:02:37.440> all<00:02:37.739> three<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.310> them<00:02:38.489> with<00:02:39.480> all<00:02:39.660> of

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
to find all three of them with all of

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.789 
to find all three of them with all of
that<00:02:39.959> out<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.410> way

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
that out of the way

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.979 
that out of the way
finally<00:02:41.250> let's<00:02:41.489> begin<00:02:41.849> building<00:02:42.209> Keisel

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
finally let's begin building Keisel

00:02:42.989 --> 00:03:27.819 
finally let's begin building Keisel
we're<00:02:43.140> starting<00:02:43.620> with<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.950> arms

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.300 

simply<00:03:28.829> mirror<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.489> build<00:03:30.230> for<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.829> second

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
simply mirror the build for the second

00:03:32.310 --> 00:04:02.690 
simply mirror the build for the second
one<00:03:34.130> next<00:03:35.130> we'll<00:03:35.310> build<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.790> legs

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.059 

both<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.209> legs<00:04:04.480> are<00:04:04.810> actually<00:04:05.069> identical

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
both of the legs are actually identical

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.440 
both of the legs are actually identical
so<00:04:06.760> just<00:04:07.359> build<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:08.109> second<00:04:08.739> one<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.010> those<00:04:09.450> now

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
so just build a second one of those now

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:28.490 
so just build a second one of those now
we'll<00:04:10.750> build<00:04:10.989> these<00:04:11.170> sides<00:04:11.560> of<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.069> body<00:04:12.310> just

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.870 

mirror<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.560> build<00:04:29.949> for<00:04:30.789> the<00:04:31.060> second<00:04:31.600> half

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
mirror the build for the second half

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.460 
mirror the build for the second half
next<00:04:33.880> we'll<00:04:34.240> build<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.600> majority<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.139> the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
next we'll build the majority of the

00:04:35.470 --> 00:05:22.550 
next we'll build the majority of the
Dino<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.190> robot<00:04:36.760> mode<00:04:37.030> heads<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:21.419> finally

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
Dino and robot mode heads and finally

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.320 
Dino and robot mode heads and finally
arguably<00:05:23.560> the<00:05:23.830> trickiest<00:05:24.370> section<00:05:25.030> of<00:05:25.150> them

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
arguably the trickiest section of them

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.010 
arguably the trickiest section of them
all<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:26.409> waist<00:05:26.740> this<00:05:27.669> might<00:05:27.970> take<00:05:28.240> a<00:05:28.270> while<00:05:28.539> so

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
all the waist this might take a while so

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.740 
all the waist this might take a while so
bear<00:05:29.800> with<00:05:29.830> me

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:47.950 

oh<00:05:42.730> I<00:05:43.900> almost<00:05:44.900> broke<00:05:45.320> a<00:05:45.380> sweat<00:05:46.450> now<00:05:47.450> all<00:05:47.780> that's

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
oh I almost broke a sweat now all that's

00:05:47.960 --> 00:06:34.330 
oh I almost broke a sweat now all that's
left<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.320> do<00:05:48.560> is<00:05:48.830> assemble<00:05:49.280> the<00:05:49.490> sections<00:06:33.340> and

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
left to do is assemble the sections and

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.600 
left to do is assemble the sections and
