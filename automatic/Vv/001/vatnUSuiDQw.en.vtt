00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.660
 welcome we cook instead 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.250
 Today there is a pure calf's liver 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.310
 Berlin style 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.700
 She is simply a garnish 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.400
 usual everything is acetic double curie 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.730
 mounted onions and fried 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.650
 apple to his mail apple but me 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.210
 refine the whole thing when I'm the one 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.629
 I think we need it sooner 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.430
 and at least a model so fresh 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.309
 created or very thin 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.800
 strips of fresh horseradish 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.650
 so exciting next to probably 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.250
 then suspended there would have happened 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.780
 So I 'm sure many 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.930
 cook the potato and cook 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.000
 burn but it is rare 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.460
 Ultimately, we come to the liver important 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.530
 is at lever basically becomes in 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.540
 marches plus that does not mean 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.930
 salzburg him because it stains then gray 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.500
 gives 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.240
 that would be a pity if wearing rebel 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.460
 We advise you to let them in 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.470
 People around spice up with something 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.050
 combine sea salt and pepper 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.550
 but we give here that's whole 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.610
 important very important, I find something 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:26.940
 so you get one more 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.940
 Coast crust not much better 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.630
 here in her tack tack tack then in the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.810
 fall short and both sides short 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.460
 sauté then rest in the oven 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.969
 let and even if we can do it all 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.969
 it fast too 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.530
 so it is very thin cut 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:10.300
 So as not much something happens 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:12.310
 kottan was waiting and was still coming 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.850
 can make for a bit of fodder to 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.850
 also very nice 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.050
 We are thankful date is when packing 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.050
 then you did not shoot 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.640
 squandered 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.420
 but that would be in any case 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.420
 currently cost as far as ready concreted 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.980
 as I said never hold because the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.980
 gray values 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:03:00.060
 fry through lead plates and by the way 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:03.010
 even the temperature on the helper 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.370
 the whole area held at 90 degrees 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.710
 obama in cultures the grave will continue 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.660
 since making spread 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:16.530
 So that's what apples are all about 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.530
 nice seared 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:25.960
 because now whole mother to the red 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.650
 onion because you please color 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.830
 announce the cook too long so 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.300
 be suspicious that their wrong so absolutely 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.040
 finished but a little salt and drank 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:44.470
 now we have our own 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:49.850
 student boil potatoes is too 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:53.560
 important that it is in the whole mediterranean sea 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:59.200
 it will boil 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:03.690
 and we make ours for a novelty 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.690
 up cult topics 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.790
 once again briefly on the values ​​the 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:19.420
 boil sauce and then we will too 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:21.640
 must set up almost finished is 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.470
 finished the hand prepared peeled 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.110
 and horseradish fresh horseradish has 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.800
 just something else is quite well 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.680
 ideal as me so now i enter 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.680
 rough paris that is, so stood old 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:45.110
 only just a little salt to none 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.110
 flake butter 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.550
 stir the whole 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.580
 and have fun cooking 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.040
 although we want the layered way 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.060
 again ours and the towel 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.060
 our liver out 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.250
 should yes 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.250
 dispense witty 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.340
 niebel for it 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:50.090
 now comes up again 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.090
 now make me the creature 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:01.310
 and so not children because Michael Summer 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.080
 the goal is to relate it simply 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.530
 It's great to be able to do that a bit 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:11.470
 to make others think creatively yes 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.470
 that here is something great this one 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:21.110
 gets again gossamer gossamer would 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:26.000
 also by the peeler 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:30.170
 played down the whole on top 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.950
 I put that right to knit 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.680
 in the nose 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.680
 top of it with something to miss 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.630
 but what is missing to my kitchen no that 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.700
 it does not work 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:00.330
 this behavior by adding some marjoram 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:07.910
 Garnish and then we already have 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:10.140
 the whole thing fits perfectly to the liver yes 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.980
 I wish you a good appetite 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.730
 with my glue fried operator 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.780
 tradable 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.780
