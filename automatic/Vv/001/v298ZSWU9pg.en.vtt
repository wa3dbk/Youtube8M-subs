00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.139
 guys there are a thousand blush and I'll do it 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.599
 see immediately then this first 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.930
 here I can use the angle I can 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.490
 unfortunately it is contrary now 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.160
 these days you waited a while 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.580
 internet how to fix the blush and ho 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.230
 found some league so this is it 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.380
 still its sealed closed 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.140
 so I guess I'll make you a video 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.540
 I open and arrange it together 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.040
 so we see what with less is the 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.460
 first time I do it anyway 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.010
 this is also the bottom pound and it is the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.040
 number one is not that there were many me 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.330
 apparently there were three of them in the bar 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.589
 ilan i took this 2 and this is the 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:57.409
 number 225 is this number 223 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.869
 both are matt but this is a 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.830
 pink caste of the brush 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:07.580
 this is a slightly lighter pink 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:11.150
 but perhaps a little colder this is 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.350
 a little more red, I am still bent 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.350
 nice both of them 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.130
 then I took three selick blushes 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.620
 because they were really too beautiful 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.970
 then one is very hard to open 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:34.310
 these of the scenic 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:37.810
 mom my ok this is so it is a lot 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.750
 similar I have to say this is here 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:47.210
 possible to and these always the fear of 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.210
 on the 5 pando and these also this area 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.020
 where you saw so something a bit 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.820
 we see pixie hanging and huge 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.700
 pink 936 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.659
 this instead highlights life is the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.290
 beach 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:07.040
 us 122 this if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.200
 it's the orange one called cute not 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.680
 I had no big deal like that 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.040
 and this instead is rose gold 926 and this 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.290
 it's beautiful is my favorite 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.300
 will take in the camera already are 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.880
 but it is very nissimo of glitter 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.240
 too much too full beautiful 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.160
 all pink and straight pink glitter 2 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:36.350
 beds I meant then there are two blushes 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.020
 of topshop and these cost about 67 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:44.140
 I do n't remember a gospel hoax 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.140
 however this is flash 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:54.410
 yes this is flash now i do it and 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.239
 honey look how much benino capua ed 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:02.470
 effect these are plexuses in cream 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:06.860
 instead I know how much the English are made 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:11.000
 sport and strong English of the English a 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.709
 say then this is done so and in 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:24.760
 they create and I told you is the blush color 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:24.760
 splash instead this one is and cover it 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.900
 and let's see if I can open it 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.900
 quickly 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.990
 ok, this is more orange instead 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.990
 but always in cream 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.880
 then there is always a kiss in cream 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.230
 you're the one who does it and that's what he does 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.650
 this a lot 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.680
 I don't remember exactly though 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:02.260
 quite a lot very nice powerful 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:06.070
 with all sensitive flowers and 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:11.710
 this is the bobby color number and it is 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:16.000
 so it's dark enough for me to understand 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:18.610
 which I liked best and then the end of plus 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.980
 there is obviously a balance of pineapple that 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.200
 I couldn't not buy but I didn't 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.850
 took a lot of sma because it was too light 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:33.430
 I took angelica it's called that now 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:36.730
 I'll show you then that of 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.490
 steel to how much I will have paid around the 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:45.310
 20 bread but maybe even a little more 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:47.650
 I don't remember this pineapple here as well 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.640
 I don't remember but it will be more or less 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:56.650
 always on the winds even a little more 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.900
 when this data is perhaps very beautiful 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.940
 how nice full of glitter too 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.660
 I don't know if he could see that, but 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.980
 it's super super glittered though these 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.320
 they are silver and non-gold glitter and 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.610
 so we're done with that too 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.370
 blush now there is a scale that is 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.020
 this bongioanni here if we are at 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.440
 big load that I told you there 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.180
 chanel economic line in this 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.190
 how much he has always paid more or less 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.400
 c20 base ie is not economical allows 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.920
 not having poles where I'm saying type 10 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.590
 however it is waterproof 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.720
 volumes in so many the brush is not 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.310
 nothing normal but I have to say that 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.980
 applied is very good but the scale and 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.820
 then on the 10 breads more or less these 12 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:52.000
 and then always from bochum he took this 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.510
 know blue eye shadows that has the number 0 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.730
 2 but you want to spell it out already 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:04.900
 I mirror the brush a sheet e 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:08.530
 the eyeshadow is very beautiful of those 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.210
 I like green water so much for 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.710
 put it below I think it is 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.750
 perfect I liked it too much and this 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:21.010
 I don't remember how much he paid me 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:26.560
 more or less always on 10 then of the year I have 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:34.030

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:41.620

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:01.180

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.280
