00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.330 
we'll walk it with some electrical tape
around<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.520> way<00:03:35.700> does<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:37.130> be<00:03:38.130> too

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
around it so that way does in a be too

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.140 
around it so that way does in a be too
loose<00:03:38.580> in<00:03:38.819> there<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.810> flop<00:03:40.380> around<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:41.400> then

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
loose in there and flop around and then

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.710 
loose in there and flop around and then
you're<00:03:42.239> going<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.420> need<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.569> millimeter<00:03:44.720> socket

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
you're going to need a millimeter socket

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.110 
you're going to need a millimeter socket
and<00:03:46.760> couple<00:03:47.760> extensions<00:03:49.520> and<00:03:50.520> reach<00:03:50.730> up<00:03:50.940> in

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
and couple extensions and reach up in

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.990 
and couple extensions and reach up in
there<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.450> take<00:03:51.660> it<00:03:51.690> out<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:53.310> here's<00:03:53.700> what<00:03:53.880> the

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
there and take it out so here's what the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.030 
there and take it out so here's what the
screws<00:03:54.330> looks<00:03:54.569> like<00:03:54.810> holding<00:03:55.170> them<00:03:55.260> up<00:03:55.410> three

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
screws looks like holding them up three

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.420 
screws looks like holding them up three
little<00:03:56.630> bolt<00:03:57.630> heads<00:03:58.849> threaded<00:03:59.849> bolt<00:04:00.060> heads<00:04:00.300> I

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
little bolt heads threaded bolt heads I

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.370 
little bolt heads threaded bolt heads I
almost<00:04:02.430> got<00:04:02.940> one<00:04:03.000> more<00:04:03.360> screw<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.080> now<00:04:04.260> I'll

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
almost got one more screw and now I'll

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:12.309 
almost got one more screw and now I'll
have<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.860> out<00:04:05.450> alright<00:04:06.450> there<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.440> have<00:04:07.650> it

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
to hang from this wire harness all right

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:26.590 
to hang from this wire harness all right
there<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.440> go<00:04:22.760> there's<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.970> motor<00:04:24.180> plug<00:04:25.080> in

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
there you go there's the motor plug in

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.100 
there you go there's the motor plug in
so<00:04:27.600> sits<00:04:28.290> up<00:04:28.500> there

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110
