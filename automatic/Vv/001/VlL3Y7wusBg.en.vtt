00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.070 
enjoying one of our many tiger ponds out
here<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.610> Tigers<00:00:26.940> they<00:00:27.090> love<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.419> swim<00:00:27.570> and

here the Tigers they love to swim and

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.540 
here the Tigers they love to swim and
being<00:00:28.290> stuck<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.680> cages<00:00:29.040> and<00:00:29.160> there's<00:00:29.400> not<00:00:29.520> a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
being stuck in cages and there's not a

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.570 
being stuck in cages and there's not a
lot<00:00:29.790> of<00:00:29.869> ways<00:00:30.869> they<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.259> swim<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:32.430> give

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
lot of ways they can swim so we give

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.980 
lot of ways they can swim so we give
them<00:00:32.700> these<00:00:32.850> ponds<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.630> they're<00:00:33.780> made<00:00:33.900> of

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
them these ponds and and they're made of

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.569 
them these ponds and and they're made of
the<00:00:34.050> concrete<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.650> they<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:34.980> cost<00:00:35.340> us<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the concrete and they actually cost us a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.760 
the concrete and they actually cost us a
bit<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> money<00:00:35.970> so<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:37.200> very<00:00:37.380> cool<00:00:37.620> when

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
bit of money so it's very cool when

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.350 
bit of money so it's very cool when
people<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.130> donate<00:00:38.310> money<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.850> help<00:00:38.970> us<00:00:39.180> out

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
people can donate money to help us out

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.300 
people can donate money to help us out
by<00:00:39.570> providing<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.230> cron<00:00:40.470> for<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> tiger

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
by providing a cron for a tiger

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.190 
by providing a cron for a tiger
we<00:00:41.430> started<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:41.970> out<00:00:42.239> about<00:00:42.660> five<00:00:42.900> years<00:00:42.930> ago

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
we started this out about five years ago

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
we started this out about five years ago
we<00:00:43.500> started<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.040> retired<00:00:44.400> tigers<00:00:44.910> from

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
we started to get retired tigers from

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.060 
we started to get retired tigers from
the<00:00:45.390> circuit<00:00:45.810> of<00:00:46.290> course<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.680> tough<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:46.980> us

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the circuit of course it's tough for us

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.350 
the circuit of course it's tough for us
to<00:00:47.220> build<00:00:47.400> cages<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.880> are<00:00:48.000> actually<00:00:48.330> out

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
to build cages that are actually out

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.820 
to build cages that are actually out
into<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:48.840> lake<00:00:48.990> like<00:00:49.260> our<00:00:49.410> three<00:00:49.620> original

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
into the lake like our three original

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.920 
into the lake like our three original
Tigers<00:00:50.490> so<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.060> did<00:00:51.210> was<00:00:51.390> came<00:00:51.540> up<00:00:51.750> with

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
Tigers so what we did was came up with

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.140 
Tigers so what we did was came up with
the<00:00:52.440> concrete<00:00:52.740> ponds<00:00:53.040> inside<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.850> actual

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
the concrete ponds inside the actual

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.620 
the concrete ponds inside the actual
enclosure<00:00:55.520> about<00:00:56.520> how<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:56.790> provide<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> water

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
enclosure about how we provide the water

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.210 
enclosure about how we provide the water
for<00:00:57.900> these<00:00:58.020> ponds<00:00:58.470> is<00:00:58.560> we<00:00:58.680> actually<00:00:58.860> stick<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
for these ponds is we actually stick a

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.430 
for these ponds is we actually stick a
pump<00:00:59.490> out<00:00:59.700> in<00:00:59.820> our<00:00:59.910> lake<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.720> recycle<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
pump out in our lake and we recycle the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.710 
pump out in our lake and we recycle the
water<00:01:01.680> through<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.670> always<00:01:02.820> circulating

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
water through so it's always circulating

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.660 
water through so it's always circulating
through<00:01:03.990> sometimes<00:01:04.799> bringing<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.250> fun<00:01:05.430> little

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
through sometimes bringing up fun little

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.429 
through sometimes bringing up fun little
fish<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:05.939> stuff<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.900> don't<00:01:07.080> waste<00:01:07.229> any

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
fish and stuff but we don't waste any

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.260 
fish and stuff but we don't waste any
water<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.830> way<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.430> also<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> nice

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
water that way and also with a nice

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.719 
water that way and also with a nice
fresh<00:01:09.509> supply<00:01:09.960> because<00:01:10.229> unfortunately

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
fresh supply because unfortunately

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.399 
fresh supply because unfortunately
Tigers<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.180> use<00:01:12.750> their<00:01:12.930> ponds<00:01:13.200> as

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
Tigers like to use their ponds as

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.529 
Tigers like to use their ponds as
toilets<00:01:13.860> too<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> bad<00:01:15.119> thing<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.329> they

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
toilets too but the bad thing is they

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.510 
toilets too but the bad thing is they
don't<00:01:15.659> last<00:01:15.929> very<00:01:16.140> long<00:01:16.499> about<00:01:16.859> about<00:01:17.280> five

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
don't last very long about about five

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.950 
don't last very long about about five
years<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:17.969> a<00:01:17.999> lifespan<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.899> these

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
years as a lifespan for one of these

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
years as a lifespan for one of these
ponds<00:01:19.289> so<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.649> costs<00:01:20.130> us<00:01:20.219> a<00:01:20.340> bit<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.579> money<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
ponds so it costs us a bit of money to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
ponds so it costs us a bit of money to
rebuild<00:01:21.149> them<00:01:21.539> resurface<00:01:22.140> them<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.560> they<00:01:23.039> do

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
rebuild them resurface them and they do

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.520 
rebuild them resurface them and they do
develop<00:01:23.429> cracks<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.170> about<00:01:25.380> these

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
develop cracks to think about these

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.950 
develop cracks to think about these
ponds<00:01:25.829> is<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.369> course<00:01:26.579> having<00:01:26.999> a<00:01:27.149> 500-pound

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
ponds is of course having a 500-pound

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
ponds is of course having a 500-pound
tiger<00:01:28.499> jump<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.219> of<00:01:29.399> them<00:01:29.520> several

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
tiger jump in and out of them several

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.090 
tiger jump in and out of them several
times<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.270> day<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.530> starts<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.859> take<00:01:32.069> its

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
times a day it really starts to take its

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.489 
times a day it really starts to take its
toll<00:01:32.429> on<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.789> so<00:01:33.569> the<00:01:33.659> Tigers<00:01:33.990> not<00:01:34.109> the<00:01:34.200> only

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
toll on them so the Tigers not the only

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:36.410 
toll on them so the Tigers not the only
ones<00:01:34.679> that<00:01:34.859> get<00:01:35.159> ponds<00:01:35.609> that<00:01:35.880> they<00:01:35.969> can<00:01:36.149> enjoy

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
ones that get ponds that they can enjoy

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.419 
ones that get ponds that they can enjoy
