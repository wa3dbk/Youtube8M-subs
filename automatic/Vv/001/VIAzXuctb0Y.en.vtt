00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.570
 Hello, Chan is a party built on this Minecraft Beta p 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.810
 Seven and ac came out. 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.279
 I did not review Seven separately because the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.089
 I think I can get into the beta version. 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:33.140
 I'll try to read the tests one by one. 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:38.030
 The game is supported from 20 frames to 60 frames . 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:42.320
 Rather than being a bug fix, it just feels like a display upgrade 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.110
 And let me tell you a lot of things. 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.270
 I think speed cars will be faster. 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:53.870
 Touching Thermo important words from the squid was reported to drop the ink 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.920
 That was available to him wo control 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:03.350
 The gas is said to be 20 as well as Firanka 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.449
 So let's take a look at the updated Beta 2-year-old today. 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.780
 Ah 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:13.569
 There are a lot of things that have been added, and a lot of things that have become more structured. 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:18.609
 To say the first explosion now spend more explosive than I thought uh ps 

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:20.829
 There was a small range of Pocari to such a small feeling, but this time the bomb 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:24.069
 The range is bigger. 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:28.600
 And , when you flap some important information 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:32.049
 5 PCs do not jump very well with their heads banging. 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.409
 Buffy's got a slight effect on it. 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:39.970
 It was said that it was similar to pc until that. 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:43.869
 It's ssengeo Gasthaus is more resilient biasing a range covering jyeotdago 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:48.640
 It was Bridle Six last time. 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.479
 Six muteun fade Was it so that the accuracy of Gasthof Fireball natdago increase 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.619
 I did 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.860
 And I think it's getting harder and harder to catch the gas. 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:02.409
 This is called lava or fire will top two 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.819
 Oh grab the minerals and monster round ball film-to-eat experience 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.899
 The same thing is not rolling. 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:12.549
 Hey, you can ride two of them now or avoid it. 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:15.459
 And continue to update that the update is a bug bear there again. What 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:18.180
 The bug has been modified a lot. 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.840

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.900
 When clicking a button, the blocks in the item window are clicked 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.250
 I did it. 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:36.180
 Well, he said that he corrected it. And this event table 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.840
 I did not play well in multiplayer, but this time the bug was fixed. 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:45.930
 And as I was reading, the words I had stayed in were alive. 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.879
 There sits wolves wolves Oh sit there gyeowoseo the snow accumulation 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.720

 r I have a lot of dissatisfaction with these users because of this. 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:05.159
 The bug has really increased in number with this 12 point update . 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:09.000
 Maybe it will be a big bug fix even in the build dine version 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:12.090
 bda 3 also says burgers appear boredom 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.829

 Momo government seems to have come out at 10:00 snacks . 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:35.280
 Because each part can show the game screen so the case 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.780
 I got a chance to have sex, but the game screen 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.949
