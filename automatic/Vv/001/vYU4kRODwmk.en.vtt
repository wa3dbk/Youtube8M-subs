blues<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.630> don't<00:00:33.840> mean<00:00:33.990> to<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.500> we're

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
blues and I don't mean to that we're

crazy<00:00:36.930> singing<00:00:37.560> the<00:00:37.680> blues<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:39.060> it's

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
crazy singing the blues but I think it's

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
crazy singing the blues but I think it's
impossible<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.530> become<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.100> great<00:00:41.550> metal

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
doing here this is a very interesting

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.860 
doing here this is a very interesting
pattern<00:01:37.030> for<00:01:37.510> me<00:01:37.660> because<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.760> loosely<00:01:39.870> weaves

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
pattern for me because it loosely weaves

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.500 
pattern for me because it loosely weaves
in<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.230> out<00:01:41.380> out<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.220> pentatonic<00:01:42.670> scale<00:01:43.210> I

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
in and out out of the pentatonic scale I

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.440 
in and out out of the pentatonic scale I
mean<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.350> adds<00:01:44.500> several<00:01:45.370> other<00:01:45.670> notes<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.270> it

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
mean and adds several other notes to it

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.470 
mean and adds several other notes to it
a<00:01:46.630> lot<00:01:47.230> of<00:01:47.380> them<00:01:47.500> sound<00:01:47.770> chromatic<00:01:48.340> but<00:01:49.300> it's

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
a lot of them sound chromatic but it's

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.890 
a lot of them sound chromatic but it's
actually<00:01:49.810> got<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:49.990> really<00:01:50.260> blues<00:01:51.630> bluesy<00:01:52.630> sound

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
actually got a really blues bluesy sound

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.350 
actually got a really blues bluesy sound
to<00:01:53.260> it<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.620> I<00:01:54.220> use<00:01:54.370> this<00:01:54.520> lick<00:01:54.760> a<00:01:54.790> lot

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
to it and I use this lick a lot

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.730 
to it and I use this lick a lot
so<00:01:55.540> I'm<00:01:55.660> going<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:55.930> show<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.320> you<00:01:56.500> check

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
so I'm going to show it to you check

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.550 
so I'm going to show it to you check
this<00:01:56.860> out<00:01:57.070> it's<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.790> symmetrical<00:01:58.420> thing<00:01:58.660> so<00:01:59.500> you

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
this out it's a symmetrical thing so you

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.480 
this out it's a symmetrical thing so you
have<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.980> first<00:02:00.660> part<00:02:01.660> of<00:02:01.930> it<00:02:02.140> which<00:02:03.130> happens

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
have the first part of it which happens

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.280 
have the first part of it which happens
to<00:02:03.640> be<00:02:03.760> on<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.880> E<00:02:03.970> string<00:02:04.120> it's<00:02:04.780> just<00:02:05.080> two

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
to be on the E string it's just two

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.990 
to be on the E string it's just two
notes<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.280> fifth<00:02:09.550> string<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:09.970> have

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
notes and on the fifth string you have

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.640 
notes and on the fifth string you have
four<00:02:10.510> notes<00:02:10.780> chromatics<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:14.140> basically

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
four notes chromatics it's basically

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:24.990 
four notes chromatics it's basically
that's<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:24.250> as<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.460> can<00:02:24.610> see<00:02:24.670> I'm

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
that's it so as you can see I'm

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.660 
that's it so as you can see I'm
basically<00:02:25.390> moving<00:02:25.720> up<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.170> pattern<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:27.340> two

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
basically moving up the pattern of two

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:37.920 
basically moving up the pattern of two
string<00:02:28.090> sets<00:02:28.360> up<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.440> string<00:02:29.680> set<00:02:36.930> all

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
string sets up the string set all

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.250 
string sets up the string set all
alternate<00:02:38.620> picked<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.330> as<00:02:40.330> long<00:02:40.510> as<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.840> kind

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
alternate picked and as long as you kind

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.770 
alternate picked and as long as you kind
of<00:02:41.320> approach<00:02:41.740> it<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.340> play<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.730> as<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:42.910> blues

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
of approach it to play it as a blues

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.810 
of approach it to play it as a blues
type<00:02:44.140> lick<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.680> could<00:02:44.860> get<00:02:45.100> away<00:02:45.340> with<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.670> and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
type lick you could get away with it and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.870 
type lick you could get away with it and
I<00:02:46.450> love<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.840> interject<00:02:47.410> this<00:02:47.830> in<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.730> regular

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
I love to interject this in the regular

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:57.270 
I love to interject this in the regular
pentatonic<00:02:49.660> scales

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.240 

okay<00:02:58.280> here's<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.940> very<00:02:59.360> cool<00:02:59.630> singular<00:03:00.440> lick

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
okay here's a very cool singular lick

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.330 
okay here's a very cool singular lick
that<00:03:01.520> I<00:03:01.550> think<00:03:01.940> of<00:03:02.319> for<00:03:03.319> a<00:03:03.349> pentatonic<00:03:03.739> type

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
that I think of for a pentatonic type

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.080 
that I think of for a pentatonic type
playing<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:06.260> basically<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.920> lick<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.670> I

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
playing it's basically a lick that I I

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.500 
playing it's basically a lick that I I
think<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:10.100> finger<00:03:10.580> being<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:11.060> root<00:03:11.239> note

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
think of this finger being the root note

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.360 
think of this finger being the root note
it's<00:03:11.750> really<00:03:12.050> caveman<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.650> way<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.040> looking

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
it's really caveman you way of looking

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.250 
it's really caveman you way of looking
at<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:13.640> but<00:03:13.790> whatever<00:03:14.420> key<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:14.840> might<00:03:15.140> be

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
at it but whatever key I might be

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.430 
at it but whatever key I might be
soloing<00:03:15.830> it<00:03:16.010> whatever<00:03:16.700> note<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:17.989> finger

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
soloing it whatever note this finger

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.100 
soloing it whatever note this finger
falls<00:03:18.709> on<00:03:18.920> that's<00:03:19.400> my<00:03:19.610> root<00:03:19.880> right<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.840> this

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
falls on that's my root right so this

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.860 
falls on that's my root right so this
lick<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.650> an<00:03:21.920> e<00:03:22.280> because<00:03:22.640> obviously<00:03:22.970> my<00:03:23.630> third

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
lick is an e because obviously my third

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.050 
lick is an e because obviously my third
finger<00:03:24.290> is<00:03:24.319> on<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.739> note<00:03:24.980> on<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.370> second<00:03:25.760> string

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
finger is on a note on the second string

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:37.300 
finger is on a note on the second string
and<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:27.200> starts<00:03:27.560> with<00:03:27.680> triplets<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:36.310> I

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
and it starts with triplets so I

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.900 
and it starts with triplets so I
basically<00:03:37.819> hit<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.920> meaning<00:03:39.920> pick<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.340> pick<00:03:40.549> it

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
basically hit it meaning pick it pick it

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.340 
basically hit it meaning pick it pick it
and<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.510> have<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.810> hammer<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:46.810> hammer<00:03:47.810> on<00:03:48.110> gives

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
and you have a hammer on hammer on gives

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.910 
and you have a hammer on hammer on gives
you<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.560> nice<00:03:48.880> smooth<00:03:49.880> sound<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:51.560> repeat

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
you a nice smooth sound and you repeat

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.030 
you a nice smooth sound and you repeat
that<00:03:55.840> now<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:56.900> have<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.230> little<00:03:57.709> bit<00:03:57.829> of<00:03:57.920> a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
that now you have a little bit of a

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.550 
that now you have a little bit of a
stretch<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:58.910> you<00:03:59.090> have<00:03:59.329> a<00:03:59.359> series<00:04:00.109> of<00:04:00.140> hammer

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
stretch and you have a series of hammer

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.530 
stretch and you have a series of hammer
ons<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:01.010> pull<00:04:01.070> offs<00:04:06.549> as<00:04:07.549> you<00:04:07.700> can<00:04:07.880> see<00:04:08.150> you

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
ons and pull offs as you can see you

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.610 
ons and pull offs as you can see you
have<00:04:08.780> two<00:04:09.609> frets<00:04:10.609> in<00:04:10.850> between<00:04:11.299> so<00:04:12.290> it's<00:04:12.500> a

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
have two frets in between so it's a

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.800 
have two frets in between so it's a
little<00:04:12.829> bit<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.160> a<00:04:13.310> workout<00:04:14.060> for<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.329> pinkie

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
little bit of a workout for the pinkie

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.110 
little bit of a workout for the pinkie
but<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:15.890> definitely<00:04:16.039> worth<00:04:16.430> checking<00:04:16.459> it

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
but it's definitely worth checking it

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.860 
but it's definitely worth checking it
out

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.809

guys when you're playing it live with an

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.640 
guys when you're playing it live with an
amp<00:04:28.159> when<00:04:28.909> I<00:04:28.939> do<00:04:29.090> this<00:04:29.449> lick<00:04:29.719> right<00:04:29.960> on<00:04:30.080> top

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
amp when I do this lick right on top

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.469 
amp when I do this lick right on top
I<00:04:31.840> actually<00:04:32.840> rest<00:04:33.289> my<00:04:33.530> thumb<00:04:34.189> on<00:04:34.490> a<00:04:35.000> second

I actually rest my thumb on a second

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.570 
I actually rest my thumb on a second
strength<00:04:35.870> to<00:04:36.050> stop<00:04:36.349> it<00:04:36.560> from<00:04:36.919> ringing<00:04:37.189> because

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
strength to stop it from ringing because

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:47.820 
strength to stop it from ringing because
otherwise<00:04:37.819> you<00:04:38.389> will<00:04:38.509> get<00:04:38.659> messy<00:04:39.080> all<00:04:39.259> right

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.879 

okay<00:04:48.830> so<00:04:48.889> for<00:04:49.189> the<00:04:49.310> next<00:04:49.490> example<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.360> have<00:04:50.569> a

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
okay so for the next example I have a

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.850 
okay so for the next example I have a
combo<00:04:51.889> punch<00:04:52.240> you're<00:04:53.240> going<00:04:53.629> to<00:04:53.900> have<00:04:54.139> a<00:04:54.529> first

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
combo punch you're going to have a first

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.050 
combo punch you're going to have a first
lick<00:04:55.219> that<00:04:55.729> a<00:04:56.469> BB<00:04:57.469> King<00:04:57.889> style<00:04:58.370> lick<00:04:58.759> that's

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
lick that a BB King style lick that's

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.119 
lick that a BB King style lick that's
right<00:04:59.300> we<00:04:59.479> mentioned<00:04:59.870> BB<00:05:00.169> King<00:05:00.469> and<00:05:00.680> metal<00:05:00.949> for

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
right we mentioned BB King and metal for

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.429 
right we mentioned BB King and metal for
life<00:05:01.310> but<00:05:02.120> this<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:02.389> going<00:05:02.599> back<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.870> the<00:05:03.139> metal

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:03.439 
life but this is going back to the metal

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.939 
life but this is going back to the metal
roots<00:05:03.879> so<00:05:04.879> the<00:05:05.270> first<00:05:05.539> part<00:05:05.900> is<00:05:06.139> a<00:05:06.169> BB<00:05:06.680> King

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
order to make it sound nice you have to

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.769 
order to make it sound nice you have to
articulate<00:05:40.789> those<00:05:41.150> things<00:05:41.360> pretty<00:05:41.659> well

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:41.779 
articulate those things pretty well

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:50.390 
articulate those things pretty well
alright<00:05:42.710> so<00:05:42.740> check<00:05:42.889> this<00:05:43.219> out

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
so as you can see I creep up to this

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:02.489 
so as you can see I creep up to this
denote<00:05:54.640> and<00:05:54.910> I<00:05:55.000> bend<00:05:55.330> it<00:05:55.510> into<00:05:55.720> E

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:02.499

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
right let's say just a few notes as they

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.700 
right let's say just a few notes as they
say<00:06:08.300> blue<00:06:08.599> is<00:06:08.659> it<00:06:08.839> simple<00:06:09.199> what<00:06:09.319> doesn't<00:06:09.620> mean

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
say blue is it simple what doesn't mean

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.850 
say blue is it simple what doesn't mean
it's<00:06:09.860> easy<00:06:10.009> right<00:06:10.520> and<00:06:10.909> I<00:06:11.779> follow<00:06:12.080> it<00:06:12.319> up<00:06:12.469> but<00:06:12.830> a

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
it's easy right and I follow it up but a

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.519 
it's easy right and I follow it up but a
very<00:06:13.789> signature<00:06:14.330> Stevie<00:06:14.839> Ray<00:06:15.020> Vaughn<00:06:15.199> lick

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:15.529 
very signature Stevie Ray Vaughn lick

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:20.279 
very signature Stevie Ray Vaughn lick
which<00:06:15.889> starts<00:06:16.449> this<00:06:17.449> is<00:06:17.509> all<00:06:17.779> in<00:06:17.930> C<00:06:18.550> C<00:06:19.550> minor

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
which starts this is all in C C minor

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.469 
which starts this is all in C C minor
very<00:06:21.289> standard<00:06:22.059> C<00:06:23.059> minor<00:06:23.270> type<00:06:23.599> of<00:06:23.779> an<00:06:23.930> idea

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
very standard C minor type of an idea

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:32.090 
very standard C minor type of an idea
right<00:06:26.479> so<00:06:26.749> I<00:06:26.779> bend<00:06:27.199> this<00:06:27.349> F<00:06:27.620> sharp<00:06:27.949> note

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.190 

don't<00:06:32.520> be<00:06:32.640> afraid<00:06:32.850> to<00:06:33.120> let<00:06:33.270> those<00:06:33.480> nodes<00:06:33.810> kind

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
don't be afraid to let those nodes kind

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.060 
don't be afraid to let those nodes kind
of<00:06:34.320> ring<00:06:34.530> together

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.680 

I<00:06:38.770> take<00:06:39.770> this<00:06:39.920> b-flat<00:06:40.490> and<00:06:40.730> I<00:06:40.820> slide<00:06:41.180> it<00:06:41.390> in<00:06:41.540> to

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
I take this b-flat and I slide it in to

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:57.189 
I take this b-flat and I slide it in to
see<00:06:46.780> right<00:06:47.780> so<00:06:47.930> we<00:06:47.990> have<00:06:48.110> that

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.639 

there<00:06:58.199> you<00:06:58.290> have<00:06:58.500> it<00:06:58.710> metal<00:06:59.400> blues
