 "Raisins vs. jelly candies to improve sports performance " 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.090
 After about an hour of strenuous exercise, endurance athletes can begin to feel 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.000
 symptoms of glycogen depletion - a fast energy source for our body. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.030
 Studies, some dating back to the 1930s, have found that if you connect athletes running 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.730
 on the treadmill on the infusion drip supplying sugar water, you can zoom out 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.140
 his exhaustion. Drinking sugar water can also help. 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.940
 Manufacturers of sports accessories have therefore come up with a variety of different energy drinks 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.069
 volumes, energy gels, sticks and chewy candies. 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:40.120
 There was even a special sport version of Jelly Beans that they used 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.229
 Cyclists from the Jelly Belly Cycling Team. 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.179
 Jelly Belly Candy Company even paid for a study that found 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:52.309
 that the sports version of Jelly Beans can be enjoyed by cyclists at ten kilometers 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.440
 a five-second lead over the race drink or gel. 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.679
 How do sweets compare to raisins? 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.420
 Given that "professional, university and recreational sports events 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.799
 They are strongly focused on food supplements and their promotion, athletes of all performance 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.280
 such actions may give the impression that 'specially designed' sports accessories 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.090
 diets are essential to achieve optimal performance. 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.759
 These products are often expensive, yet cheaper 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.219
 natural foods that can serve as 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.270
 healthier replacements are often overlooked. " 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.950
 There are cheap natural foods rich in carbohydrates 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.409
 for example, sun dried raisins. 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.350
 These have the potential to improve sport performance in a similar way. 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.929
 Raisins are nutritious, practical, usually tasty, 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.250
 and a cost-effective source of concentrated carbohydrates. ” 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.109
 Do they perform equally well? 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.479
 They perform exactly the same. 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.289
 Performance improved by the same time. 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.420
 The same can be found when comparing raisins with commercial sports gel. 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.130
 Same breathing gas exchange, same oxidation of carbohydrates and fats and the same energy expenditure. 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.590
 In fact, the only significant difference between raisins and candies was that 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.229
 that raisins beat Jelly Beans 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.840
 on the hedonic scale, 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.450
 therefore in the enjoyment of consumption. 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.319
 Compared to jelly sweets with flavors like "extreme watermelon" 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:22.520
 raisins "raisins" were much more desirable.
