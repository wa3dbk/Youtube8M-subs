00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.430
 turns into a celebration in something special 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.850
 one day the fireworks are so sophisticated that it's easy to forget that 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.719
 they are not a modern invention 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.230
 but you need a pyrotechnic to create a big bang 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.890
 the work of a pyrotechnic is to convert explosives into fires 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.970
 artificial 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.100
 the slightest spark of static electricity could make them detonate 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 that's why antistatic gloves are mandatory 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.680
 the fireworks are formed by several separate compartments 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.410
 inside a cartridge 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.140
 the wick explodes one compartment at a time 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.140
 creating the staggered explosions in the sky 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.660
 the pyrotechnic sticks the main wick to the base of the cartridge first 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.550
 the tail is naturally colorless 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.550
 but it has been dyed blue to know where it applies 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.100
 the base is set aside to work in the second compartment of the 12 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.630
 what is this model 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.790
 the first step is to put explosive powder in the center 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 after stage 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.070
 The next step begins with a cardboard cushion used to 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.590
 protect this compartment from the explosion of the first compartment 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.010
 then a corrugated cardboard disc and a separator are placed 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.840
 plastic 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.240
 the wick will take two and a half seconds to burn these two components 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.200
 that creates a slight delay between the first explosion 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.040
 and the second 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.790
 Pasting the second compartment is complicated 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.850
 yes it was very tight cushion the explosion 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.710
 but it has to be tight enough to withstand the delay 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.600
 finished the second compartment is time to prepare the first one sticks the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.729
 case 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.339
 then filled with hundreds of stars the stars are the ones 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:17.269
 they create the flashes of color are explosives meticulously measured with 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.629
 coloring agents like magnesium to get the white copper salt for the 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.689
 blue and charcoal for orange 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.259
 the pyrotechnician must handle the purchase or they could detonate 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.360
 then add comets 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.360
 another type of explosive decoration 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409
 and to top gunpowder 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.639
 finally the two compartments are glued and the gap is filled with 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.639
 the same combination of ingredients 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.729
 once the cartridge is full the lid is pasted 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.839
 and the tighter the better 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:27.529
 The more pressure accumulates stronger and more spectacular will be the 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.889
 explosion 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.889
 then they are wrapped in a paper 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.959
 international color codes are used to indicate the size 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.079
 of a cartridge 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.699
 the propulsion charge a bag of gunpowder with a long wick and 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.969
 fast action goes on the base of the cartridge 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.969
 that's what launches the fireworks towards the year 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.839
 When the main wick is lit simultaneously two wicks are lit 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:05.659
 secondary the wick with delay that runs through the cartridge by 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.829
 Explosive compartments 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.329
 and the long wick that runs on the outside and that the propulsion load of 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.329
 base 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.689
 once the profusion charge is on, almost heat accumulates inside the 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:32.369
 launch tube until they explode to propel the fireworks to 300 

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:35.369
 meters high 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.129
 let the light show begin
