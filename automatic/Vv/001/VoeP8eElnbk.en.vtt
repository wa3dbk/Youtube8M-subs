your<00:01:47.520> enchantments<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.509> now<00:01:48.990> there<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
your enchantments can be now there is a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.800 
your enchantments can be now there is a
cap<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.820> how<00:01:51.060> many<00:01:51.119> bookcases<00:01:51.630> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
cap on it as to how many bookcases you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.920 
cap on it as to how many bookcases you
have<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.549> 30<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.909> maximum<00:01:54.750> oh

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
have and I think 30 is the maximum oh

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.899 
have and I think 30 is the maximum oh
and<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:56.040> course<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:57.119> training<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:58.500> well<00:01:58.909> so

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
and of course the training but well so

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.440 
and of course the training but well so
anyways<00:02:01.340> 30<00:02:02.340> bookcases<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.000> think<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
anyways 30 bookcases I think is the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.819 
anyways 30 bookcases I think is the
maximum<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> don't<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.409> want<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.710> go

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
maximum so you don't really want to go

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.130 
maximum so you don't really want to go
over<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.310> also<00:02:06.240> they<00:02:06.360> need<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.719> no<00:02:06.930> more

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
over that also they need to be no more

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.740 
over that also they need to be no more
than<00:02:07.320> one<00:02:07.590> block<00:02:07.979> away<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:09.090> basically<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.539> have

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
than one block away so basically I have

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.320 
than one block away so basically I have
you<00:02:10.080> know<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.440> stack<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.129> two<00:02:11.489> blocks<00:02:11.670> high<00:02:11.970> all

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
you know a stack of two blocks high all

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.970 
you know a stack of two blocks high all
the<00:02:12.720> way<00:02:12.810> around<00:02:12.930> here

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the way around here

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.960 
the way around here
which<00:02:14.159> i<00:02:14.310> think<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.849> roughly<00:02:15.420> 28<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.440> think<00:02:16.970> 30

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
which i think is roughly 28 I think 30

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.940 
which i think is roughly 28 I think 30
would<00:02:18.209> be<00:02:18.390> if<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.690> had<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.900> opening<00:02:19.799> here

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
would be if you had the opening here

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.990 
would be if you had the opening here
covered<00:02:20.220> up<00:02:20.390> but<00:02:21.390> anyway<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.670> if<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.819> go<00:02:23.970> down

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
covered up but anyway so if we go down

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.699 
covered up but anyway so if we go down
here<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:26.760> right-click<00:02:27.209> on<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.629> we<00:02:28.560> are

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
here and we right-click on it we are

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.110 
here and we right-click on it we are
presented<00:02:29.069> with<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.640> we'll<00:02:29.790> take<00:02:29.940> our

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
presented with this so we'll take our

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.320 
presented with this so we'll take our
bow<00:02:30.470> will<00:02:31.470> place<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:31.950> here<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:33.209> can

when the bow hits the bad guy it'll go

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.729 
when the bow hits the bad guy it'll go
through<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.829> make<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:22.530> pushes

through and make it so that it pushes
them<00:03:22.980> back<00:03:23.010> kind<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.489> like<00:03:23.579> knock<00:03:23.790> back<00:03:24.030> now

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
the last bow I did which I don't have

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.210 
the last bow I did which I don't have
here<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.790> my<00:03:26.819> inventory<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:28.319> got<00:03:28.620> infinite

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
here in my inventory I got infinite

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.190 
here in my inventory I got infinite
infinite<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.660> basically<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.169> means

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
infinite on it and basically that means

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.400 
infinite on it and basically that means
as<00:03:31.500> long<00:03:31.530> as<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:31.950> have<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.340> arrow<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.150> your

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
as long as you have a arrow and your

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.930 
as long as you have a arrow and your
inventory<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.680> will<00:03:34.829> have<00:03:35.010> infinite<00:03:35.609> arrows

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
inventory you will have infinite arrows

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.940 
inventory you will have infinite arrows
which<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.900> my<00:03:37.049> opinion<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.410> like<00:03:37.560> one<00:03:37.829> of<00:03:37.859> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
which in my opinion is like one of the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.059 
which in my opinion is like one of the
most<00:03:38.069> awesome<00:03:38.190> ones<00:03:38.669> it<00:03:38.849> also<00:03:39.120> had<00:03:39.299> flame

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
most awesome ones it also had flame

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.370 
most awesome ones it also had flame
level<00:03:41.069> one<00:03:41.310> which<00:03:41.639> is<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:42.630> believe<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.230> only

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
level one which is I believe the only

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.870 
level one which is I believe the only
level<00:03:43.680> four<00:03:43.919> and<00:03:44.040> basically<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.430> means<00:03:44.459> it's

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
level four and basically that means it's

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.330 
level four and basically that means it's
basically<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.660> flaming<00:03:46.560> arrow<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:47.010> it'll<00:03:47.160> catch

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
basically a flaming arrow so it'll catch

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.240 
basically a flaming arrow so it'll catch
whatever<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.849> hit<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.060> fire<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.950> let's<00:03:50.099> go

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
whatever you hit on fire so let's go

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.860 
whatever you hit on fire so let's go
through<00:03:50.519> an<00:03:50.669> experiment<00:03:51.120> with<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.569> iron

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.050 
zombies
and<00:04:26.800> skeletons<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.979> think<00:04:28.250> something<00:04:28.940> like

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
and skeletons I think something like

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.839 
and skeletons I think something like
that<00:04:29.860> if<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:30.979> go<00:04:31.069> to<00:04:31.099> the<00:04:31.220> minecraft<00:04:31.370> wiki

there's a big huge list on what all the
various<00:04:36.949> things<00:04:37.879> do<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:40.030> if<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.180> look<00:04:41.210> back

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479
