00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
perhaps a member of XDA devs trying to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.520 
perhaps a member of XDA devs trying to
sort<00:02:30.990> this<00:02:31.050> out<00:02:31.550> okay<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:32.610> we<00:02:32.850> can<00:02:33.000> also<00:02:33.530> shove

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
sort this out okay so we can also shove

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.210 
sort this out okay so we can also shove
in<00:02:34.710> our<00:02:34.890> gmail<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.640> we'll<00:02:36.330> go<00:02:36.510> into<00:02:36.540> our<00:02:39.110> video

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
in our gmail and we'll go into our video

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.180 
in our gmail and we'll go into our video
yet<00:02:41.220> wish<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> video<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.330> other<00:02:42.420> half

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
yet wish of a video and the other half

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.640 
yet wish of a video and the other half
and<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:44.850> can<00:02:45.090> play<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:46.200> didn't<00:02:46.470> really<00:02:46.560> work

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
and we can play it didn't really work

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.930 
and we can play it didn't really work
out<00:02:47.600> but<00:02:48.600> YouTube<00:02:48.930> linear<00:02:49.550> okay<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:50.610> now<00:02:50.820> we've

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
out but YouTube linear okay so now we've

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.000 
out but YouTube linear okay so now we've
got<00:02:51.030> YouTube<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.690> we've<00:02:51.930> got<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.680> video

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
got YouTube and we've got the video

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.930 
got YouTube and we've got the video
playing<00:02:53.510> that's<00:02:54.510> allow<00:02:54.840> some<00:02:55.050> access<00:02:55.820> so<00:02:56.820> we

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
playing that's allow some access so we

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.130 
playing that's allow some access so we
could<00:02:57.060> have<00:02:57.210> two<00:02:57.360> videos<00:02:57.630> play<00:02:57.780> at<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.930> same

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
could have two videos play at the same

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.230 
could have two videos play at the same
time<00:02:58.320> side-by-side<00:02:58.950> one<00:02:59.310> from<00:02:59.580> youtuber<00:03:00.000> one

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
time side-by-side one from youtuber one

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.560 
time side-by-side one from youtuber one
from<00:03:00.600> your<00:03:01.470> personal<00:03:01.860> device<00:03:02.430> obviously<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
from your personal device obviously the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.950 
from your personal device obviously the
sound<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:03.990> going<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.400> both<00:03:05.960> intermixed

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
sound it's going to be both intermixed

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.110 
sound it's going to be both intermixed
but<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> got<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.130> best<00:03:08.280> experience<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:08.970> just

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
but I got the best experience but I just

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.590 
but I got the best experience but I just
want<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.330> see<00:03:09.660> if<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.410> will<00:03:10.590> actually<00:03:10.740> work

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
want to see if this will actually work

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.330 
want to see if this will actually work
now<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.750> probably<00:03:12.990> going<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.260> take<00:03:13.500> all

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
now this is probably going to take all

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.220 
now this is probably going to take all
the<00:03:14.670> processing<00:03:15.120> power<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.690> notes<00:03:15.900> got

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
the processing power that the notes got

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.410 
the processing power that the notes got
but<00:03:16.830> as<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.130> see<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.490> seems<00:03:17.730> we<00:03:17.940> can<00:03:18.180> find

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
but as you can see it seems we can find

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.030 
but as you can see it seems we can find
I've<00:03:18.660> taken<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.260> sound<00:03:19.530> off<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:19.860> it's

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
I've taken the sound off because it's

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.420 
I've taken the sound off because it's
just<00:03:20.190> an<00:03:20.580> wing<00:03:21.410> right<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.830> yeah<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.160> can<00:03:23.280> play

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
just an wing right so yeah you can play

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.980 
just an wing right so yeah you can play
both<00:03:23.610> same<00:03:24.000> time<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:24.360> critical<00:03:26.990> another

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
both same time it's critical another
