 fans but where did this trend come from 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.540

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.910

 nineteenth century then it was thought that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.510

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.150
 the only entertainment for the lower 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.950
 social strata but just watching the game 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.480
