quick video to show you how combustion

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.740 
quick video to show you how combustion
works<00:00:07.950> now<00:00:08.519> I'm<00:00:08.910> kind<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.179> getting<00:00:09.269> bored<00:00:09.660> of

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
works now I'm kind of getting bored of

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.690 
works now I'm kind of getting bored of
doing<00:00:09.870> target<00:00:10.320> dummies<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:10.860> today<00:00:11.250> I've<00:00:11.550> gone

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
doing target dummies so today I've gone

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.720 
doing target dummies so today I've gone
out<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.210> Theramore<00:00:12.780> just<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> variety<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
out to Theramore just for a variety in a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.019 
out to Theramore just for a variety in a
bit<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.030> change<00:00:16.039> and<00:00:17.039> besides<00:00:17.430> are<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> only

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
bit of a change and besides are the only

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.519 
bit of a change and besides are the only
one<00:00:18.180> uses<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> target<00:00:18.869> dummies<00:00:19.140> around<00:00:19.170> here

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
one uses the target dummies around here

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.279 
one uses the target dummies around here
so<00:00:19.949> chances<00:00:20.760> are<00:00:20.970> get<00:00:21.539> some<00:00:21.689> nice<00:00:21.900> peace<00:00:22.140> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
so chances are get some nice peace and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.679 
so chances are get some nice peace and
quiet<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.560> order<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.859> our<00:00:22.980> testing<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.390> how

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
quiet in order to do our testing so how

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.630 
quiet in order to do our testing so how
does<00:00:24.750> combustion<00:00:25.380> actually<00:00:25.740> work<00:00:25.949> well<00:00:26.250> let

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
does combustion actually work well let

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.939 
does combustion actually work well let
me<00:00:26.730> show<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.150> talent<00:00:27.449> first<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.869> all<00:00:27.960> it's

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
me show you the talent first of all it's

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.259 
me show you the talent first of all it's
on<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.220> fourth<00:00:29.369> road<00:00:29.640> down<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> flyer

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
on the fourth road down in the flyer

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.040 
on the fourth road down in the flyer
tree<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:32.040> fairly<00:00:32.369> deep<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.050> basically

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
tree so it's fairly deep and basically

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.620 
tree so it's fairly deep and basically
there<00:00:34.410> are<00:00:34.440> two<00:00:34.530> parts<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.130> combustion<00:00:35.630> one

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
there are two parts to combustion one

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.810 
there are two parts to combustion one
part<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.320> component<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.280> deals<00:00:38.550> damage

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
part is the component that deals damage

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.479 
part is the component that deals damage
instantly<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.890> case<00:00:41.100> we're<00:00:41.370> looking

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
instantly so in this case we're looking

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.529 
instantly so in this case we're looking
at<00:00:42.379> 2935<00:00:43.379> fire<00:00:43.649> damage<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:45.090> other<00:00:45.270> part

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
at 2935 fire damage and the other part

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.319 
at 2935 fire damage and the other part
is<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.020> bit<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.230> combines<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.309> your<00:00:47.460> fire

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
is the bit that combines all your fire

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.229 
is the bit that combines all your fire
dots<00:00:48.600> together<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.219> they<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.910> single

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
dots together so that they do a single

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.869 
dots together so that they do a single
dot<00:00:51.600> now<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.500> bit<00:00:52.890> confuses<00:00:53.430> an<00:00:53.550> awful<00:00:53.820> lot

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
dot now this bit confuses an awful lot

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.430 
dot now this bit confuses an awful lot
of<00:00:54.000> people<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.480> think<00:00:54.510> well<00:00:54.780> how<00:00:55.079> does<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
of people they think well how does that

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.860 
of people they think well how does that
work<00:00:55.680> what<00:00:56.370> does<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.760> well<00:00:57.030> first<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.809> all

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
work what does it do well first of all

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.930 
work what does it do well first of all
let<00:00:58.050> me<00:00:58.079> show<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> dots<00:00:58.800> though<00:00:59.370> actually

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
let me show you the dots though actually

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.740 
let me show you the dots though actually
going<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.390> used<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:02.570> first<00:01:03.570> one

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
going to be used for this first one

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.770 
going to be used for this first one
living<00:01:04.260> bomb<00:01:04.729> it's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.939> fire<00:01:06.180> dot<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.630> know

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
living bomb it's a fire dot that we know

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.580 
living bomb it's a fire dot that we know
and<00:01:06.960> love<00:01:08.150> next<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:10.080> isn't<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and love next up now this isn't really a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.469 
and love next up now this isn't really a
fire<00:01:10.830> dot<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.189> critical<00:01:11.700> mass<00:01:11.880> but<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
fire dot this is critical mass but it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.300 
fire dot this is critical mass but it
helps<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> get<00:01:13.140> crit<00:01:13.470> which<00:01:13.920> helps<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
helps you to get crit which helps you to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.820 
helps you to get crit which helps you to
get<00:01:14.400> ignite<00:01:15.080> ignite<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> other

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
get ignite ignite be one of the other

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.640 
get ignite ignite be one of the other
five<00:01:17.100> dots<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.520> there's<00:01:17.850> ignite<00:01:18.409> deals<00:01:19.409> fire

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
five dots now there's ignite deals fire

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.190 
five dots now there's ignite deals fire
damage<00:01:19.950> every<00:01:20.490> two<00:01:20.640> seconds<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.990> we're

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
damage every two seconds but we're

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.660 
damage every two seconds but we're
relying<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.680> getting<00:01:22.920> those<00:01:23.040> crits<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.610> I'll

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
relying on getting those crits and I'll

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.060 
relying on getting those crits and I'll
just<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> prop<00:01:24.299> ignite<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.799> next<00:01:25.979> one

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
just be of the prop ignite the next one

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.480 
just be of the prop ignite the next one
up<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.220> pyroblast<00:01:26.869> now<00:01:27.869> pyroblast<00:01:28.229> deals<00:01:28.890> 191

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
up is pyroblast now pyroblast deals 191

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.100 
up is pyroblast now pyroblast deals 191
fire<00:01:29.700> damage<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.150> case<00:01:30.360> every<00:01:30.780> three

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
fire damage in this case every three

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.319 
fire damage in this case every three
seconds<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.159> another<00:01:32.430> fire<00:01:32.790> dr.<00:01:33.150> bit

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
seconds so it's another fire dr. bit

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.819 
seconds so it's another fire dr. bit
weaker<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.439> see<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
weaker and you there you can see the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.399 
weaker and you there you can see the
critter<00:01:35.220> triggering<00:01:36.150> tonight<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.509> well<00:01:36.689> so

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
critter triggering tonight as well so

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.929 
critter triggering tonight as well so
how's<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> work<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.009> practice<00:01:38.159> well<00:01:38.610> there's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
how's that work in practice well there's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.910 
how's that work in practice well there's
living<00:01:39.299> Brom<00:01:39.509> next<00:01:40.380> I'm<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> load<00:01:40.799> up

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
living Brom next I'm going to load up

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
living Brom next I'm going to load up
scorch<00:01:41.310> there's<00:01:42.270> hot<00:01:42.689> streak<00:01:42.960> Rockets<00:01:43.409> we've

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
scorch there's hot streak Rockets we've

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.130 
scorch there's hot streak Rockets we've
already<00:01:43.710> got<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.009> good<00:01:44.159> night<00:01:44.600> living<00:01:45.600> bomb<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
already got a good night living bomb and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.649 
already got a good night living bomb and
the<00:01:47.009> pyro<00:01:47.610> brass<00:01:47.790> dot<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.509> we've

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the pyro brass dot and then we've

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.830 
the pyro brass dot and then we've
combined<00:01:49.079> them<00:01:49.350> into<00:01:49.909> combustion<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.689> can

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
combined them into combustion you can

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.420 
combined them into combustion you can
see<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.229> also<00:01:52.380> load<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.860> other<00:01:53.100> dots

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
see it we can also load up other dots

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.179 
see it we can also load up other dots
while<00:01:53.939> combustion<00:01:54.420> still<00:01:54.630> taking<00:01:54.899> down<00:01:55.189> now

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
while combustion still taking down now

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.499 
while combustion still taking down now
the<00:01:56.250> other<00:01:56.430> great<00:01:56.729> thing<00:01:56.969> about<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the other great thing about this is you

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.359 
the other great thing about this is you
can<00:01:57.540> combine<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.229> impacts<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.100> not<00:01:59.219> to

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
can combine it with impacts you not to

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.550 
can combine it with impacts you not to
push<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> combustion<00:02:00.270> help<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.140> other<00:02:01.259> mobs

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
push the combustion help to other mobs

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.520 
push the combustion help to other mobs
as<00:02:01.740> well<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> am<00:02:03.119> loading<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:03.990> all<00:02:04.229> my

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
as well so here I am loading up all my

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.150 
as well so here I am loading up all my
dots<00:02:04.770> onto<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.460> single<00:02:05.729> target<00:02:06.060> as<00:02:06.390> before

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
dots onto a single target as before

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.450 
dots onto a single target as before
there's<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.399> hofstra

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
there's the hofstra

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.059 
there's the hofstra
now<00:02:10.460> I've<00:02:10.610> used<00:02:11.020> combustion<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.200> merging

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
now I've used combustion to merging

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.150 
now I've used combustion to merging
together<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.760> here's<00:02:14.450> impact<00:02:15.230> going<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.830> just

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
together and here's impact going on just

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.650 
together and here's impact going on just
to<00:02:16.220> push<00:02:16.430> them<00:02:16.610> out<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.850> as<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.090> can<00:02:17.209> see<00:02:17.240> me

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
to push them out and as you can see me

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.059 
to push them out and as you can see me
targeting<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.200> other<00:02:18.350> target<00:02:18.680> dummies<00:02:18.920> and

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
targeting the other target dummies and

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.190 
targeting the other target dummies and
they've<00:02:19.220> all<00:02:19.400> got<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.790> same<00:02:20.000> dot<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:21.050> that's

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
they've all got the same dot so that's

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.990 
they've all got the same dot so that's
how<00:02:21.290> combustion<00:02:21.830> works<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.340> hope<00:02:22.850> you've

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
how combustion works I hope you've

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.970 
how combustion works I hope you've
enjoyed<00:02:23.060> this<00:02:23.450> brief<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.410> now<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.590> haven't

enjoyed this brief to it now I haven't
gone<00:02:25.370> through<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.700> details<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.750> numbers

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
gone through the details of the numbers

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.690 
gone through the details of the numbers
that<00:02:27.380> are<00:02:27.590> generated<00:02:27.950> from<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.220> but<00:02:28.459> I<00:02:28.520> hope

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
that are generated from it but I hope

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.010 
that are generated from it but I hope
it's<00:02:28.850> been<00:02:28.970> useful<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.480> anyway<00:02:29.780> I'm<00:02:29.959> sure

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
that there'll be a lot of theory

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.590 
that there'll be a lot of theory
crafting<00:02:31.700> around<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:31.970> at<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> later<00:02:32.150> date<00:02:32.270> if
