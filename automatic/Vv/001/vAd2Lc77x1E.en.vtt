olive oil and now I starting whisking
with<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> fork<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.980> adding<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> flour<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
with a fork and adding the flour a

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
with a fork and adding the flour a
little<00:00:58.079> by<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.969> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.480> after

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
little by little you can see that after

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.389 
little by little you can see that after
a<00:01:00.809> few<00:01:00.989> seconds<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.379> fork<00:01:01.739> becomes<00:01:02.100> useless

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
a few seconds the fork becomes useless

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.340 
a few seconds the fork becomes useless
so<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> need<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.270> start<00:01:03.510> kneading<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:04.229> your

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
so you need to start kneading with your

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.980 
so you need to start kneading with your
hands<00:01:04.700> if<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.119> food<00:01:06.450> processor<00:01:06.600> you

hands if you have a food processor you
can<00:01:07.590> use<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.810> knead<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.470> dough

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
can use it you have to knead the dough

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.399 
can use it you have to knead the dough
until<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.549> homogeneous<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:13.229> will

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
until it's homogeneous and that will

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.490 
until it's homogeneous and that will
take<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:13.950> five<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.549> ten<00:01:14.909> minutes<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:16.170> case

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
take about five to ten minutes in case

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
take about five to ten minutes in case
though<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.280> too<00:01:17.610> wet

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
though it's too wet

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.539 
though it's too wet

and on the chopping board and then you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.460 
and on the chopping board and then you
can<00:01:23.070> keep<00:01:23.280> kneading<00:01:24.170> when<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> dough<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
can keep kneading when the dough is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.609 
can keep kneading when the dough is
