information<00:00:29.900> of<00:00:30.320> course<00:00:30.529> I'm<00:00:30.770> suspecting<00:00:31.550> it

information of course I'm suspecting it

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.970 
information of course I'm suspecting it
to<00:00:31.789> be<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.059> same<00:00:32.090> price<00:00:32.539> as<00:00:32.809> a<00:00:32.870> regular<00:00:33.649> 3d

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
to be the same price as a regular 3d

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.590 
to be the same price as a regular 3d
systems<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:34.670> current<00:00:34.969> ones<00:00:35.120> that<00:00:35.329> are<00:00:35.420> on<00:00:35.479> the

market whatever color they might be I'm

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:38.919 
market whatever color they might be I'm
suspecting<00:00:38.120> it's<00:00:38.359> going<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.569> be<00:00:38.659> the<00:00:38.749> same

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:38.929 
suspecting it's going to be the same

prices<00:00:39.319> out<00:00:39.469> of<00:00:39.559> course<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.890> XL<00:00:40.429> is<00:00:40.639> a<00:00:40.670> bit

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
prices out of course the XL is a bit

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.649 
prices out of course the XL is a bit
more<00:00:41.199> costly<00:00:42.199> than<00:00:42.229> the<00:00:42.829> standard<00:00:43.699> 3d<00:00:43.940> s<00:00:44.120> but

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659 
more costly than the standard 3d s but

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.599 
more costly than the standard 3d s but
i'm<00:00:44.899> still<00:00:45.379> thinking<00:00:45.440> that<00:00:45.979> if<00:00:46.100> people<00:00:46.339> had

00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:46.609 
i'm still thinking that if people had

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.700 
i'm still thinking that if people had
this<00:00:46.760> option<00:00:47.359> between<00:00:47.510> these<00:00:47.929> two<00:00:48.319> brand-new

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
this option between these two brand-new

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.039 
this option between these two brand-new
colors<00:00:49.190> versus<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.030> XL<00:00:50.420> they<00:00:50.569> would<00:00:50.749> still

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
colors versus the XL they would still

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.049 
colors versus the XL they would still
opt<00:00:51.350> for<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:51.769> XL<00:00:52.339> because<00:00:52.609> honestly<00:00:52.999> that's

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
opt for the XL because honestly that's

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.419 
opt for the XL because honestly that's
my<00:00:53.359> opinion<00:00:53.569> because<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.649> back<00:00:55.010> sell<00:00:55.219> one

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
my opinion because it back sell one

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.189 
my opinion because it back sell one
thing<00:00:55.609> it's<00:00:55.760> bigger<00:00:55.999> it<00:00:56.299> even<00:00:56.569> looks<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:57.079> bit

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
thing it's bigger it even looks a bit

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:58.959 
thing it's bigger it even looks a bit
better<00:00:57.440> well<00:00:58.100> again<00:00:58.339> that's<00:00:58.489> my<00:00:58.699> opinion

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
better well again that's my opinion

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.699 
better well again that's my opinion
yours<00:00:59.629> might<00:00:59.870> be<00:00:59.899> different<00:01:00.199> but<00:01:00.379> it<00:01:00.530> looks

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:00.709 
yours might be different but it looks

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:01.959 
yours might be different but it looks
