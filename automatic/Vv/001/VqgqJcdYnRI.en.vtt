so<00:03:33.800> that<00:03:34.010> ought<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:34.940> work<00:03:35.060> pretty<00:03:35.420> well<00:03:37.030> but

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
so that ought to work pretty well but

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.400 
so that ought to work pretty well but
you<00:03:38.239> know<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.360> lot<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:38.570> people<00:03:38.660> say<00:03:39.200> they<00:03:39.380> don't

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
like sleeping in the bivvy because they

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.590 
like sleeping in the bivvy because they
feel<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.720> little<00:03:42.560> bit<00:03:42.709> claustrophobic<00:03:43.420> this<00:03:44.420> is

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
feel a little bit claustrophobic this is

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.940 
feel a little bit claustrophobic this is

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
the road but I just kind of want to use

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.980 
the road but I just kind of want to use
it<00:04:02.750> see<00:04:03.410> what<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.560> think<00:04:03.830> about<00:04:03.920> it<00:04:04.780> go<00:04:05.780> from

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
it see what I think about it go from

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.830 
it see what I think about it go from
there<00:04:06.050> I<00:04:06.230> guess<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.340> it's<00:04:08.300> really<00:04:08.510> lightweight

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
there I guess so it's really lightweight

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.030 
there I guess so it's really lightweight
that's

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
that's

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.149

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.270 
excited about that the reason that
really<00:04:13.610> has<00:04:13.939> driven<00:04:14.269> me<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.870> do<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.009> tarp

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280
