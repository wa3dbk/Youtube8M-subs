00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 ok hello everyone and welcome this is my 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.859
 cause to the microphone for a vo of eads 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.690
 announcement of the tournament mac os french tupac 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.820
 so well we're happy at mac os 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.730
 friends since since we launched the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.230
 project it's finally the site is out 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.609
 in September there was a lot 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.859
 work that has been done continuously 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.869
 so the community and has a lot 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.090
 grossi you're always getting 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.779
 more to be on the stream on 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.510
 the site on chat etc etc 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.489
 really we are happy and so in the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.320
 logical continuity and well we chose 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.510
 we decided in partnership with our 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.280
 first sponsor tupac dot com and well 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.890
 to organize a weekly tournament with 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.149
 cash prize 50 euros every 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.370
 weeks every Sunday 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.930
 So the concept is a kind of co 2 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.510
 go for and its August 2 cup fault but 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.920
 only for the community 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.629
 francophone and the idea is precisely 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.949
 that well there was going to be there are going to be 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.770
 tops masters and major masters who 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.590
 will register every week for 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.210
 is going to win the cash prize and there 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.189
 will have many of the weaker players 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.270
 who do that to be able to face 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.130
 these famous players 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.970
 so it will be streamed obviously on 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.130
 the mac os x tv but apart from the final which 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.110
 is exclusive on the maco either tv all 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.380
 the times the tournament can be streamed 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.320
 by by any web tv that the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.060
 want that so that's cool for you 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.000
 sign up so just go 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.020
 so on mac os france.com and so you 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.930
 click now there is a small 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.630
 mf tupac tournament icon you click 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.340
 on it and you can register so 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.650
 these are tournaments that start in bo1 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.549
 and of course the final stages at 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.170
 from the quarters it's bo3 so I 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.649
 chose to make a simple format like 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.390
 because we're not there yet 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.369
 aware of the number of registrants 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.720
 will and duration of the tournament so that 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.640
 will start every Sunday at 15 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.310
 hours it will be streamed every 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.729
 Sundays and I think I have a 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.619
 experience long enough in the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.049
 game to know roughly how one 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.280
 organizes pretty much at 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.080
 tournament what are the problems that 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.730
 meet the players so necessarily 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.660
 for example the problems of stream axis 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.130
 is streamed so c 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.690
 for that there are rules that impose 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.240
 to streamer to put a delay of one 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.600
 minute if ever it's stream and some 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.930
 trained admins to manage the 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.090
 packages the stuff the stuff so 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.400
 Basically we hope that things are going well 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.870
 pass this first tournament on March 30 and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.940
