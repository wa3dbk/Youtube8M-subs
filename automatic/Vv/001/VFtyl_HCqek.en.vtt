00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
there's no roll to it has very little

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.660 
there's no roll to it has very little
twist<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.289> it<00:01:59.409> so<00:01:59.740> it's<00:01:59.859> gonna<00:01:59.979> give<00:02:00.189> you<00:02:00.340> quite

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
twist to it so it's gonna give you quite

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.830 
twist to it so it's gonna give you quite
a<00:02:00.729> bit<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:00.969> support<00:02:01.119> quite<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.600> bit<00:02:01.749> of

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
a bit of support quite a bit of

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.130 
a bit of support quite a bit of
structure<00:02:02.289> you're<00:02:03.039> gonna<00:02:03.159> be<00:02:03.280> able<00:02:03.399> to<00:02:04.140> stand

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
structure you're gonna be able to stand

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.539 
structure you're gonna be able to stand
on<00:02:05.350> things<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.770> this<00:02:05.920> it's<00:02:06.219> not<00:02:06.340> going<00:02:06.490> to

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
on things and this it's not going to

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.619 
on things and this it's not going to
twist<00:02:06.789> out<00:02:06.969> from<00:02:07.210> under<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.429> midsole<00:02:10.000> at

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
twist out from under you the midsole at

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.839 
twist out from under you the midsole at
the<00:02:10.869> front<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.409> a<00:02:11.440> six<00:02:11.800> millimeter<00:02:12.040> drop<00:02:12.610> and

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
the front is a six millimeter drop and

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.729 
the front is a six millimeter drop and
at<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.209> back<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.569> twelve<00:02:13.959> millimeter<00:02:14.260> drop

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
at the back is a twelve millimeter drop

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.500 
at the back is a twelve millimeter drop
so<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.790> means<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
so that means the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.350 
so that means the
milimeter<00:02:17.140> healed<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.620> toe<00:02:17.799> drop<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.189> these<00:02:18.400> so

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
milimeter healed a toe drop on these so

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.789 
milimeter healed a toe drop on these so
while<00:02:19.540> they're<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> little<00:02:19.959> bit<00:02:20.140> more<00:02:20.170> minimal

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
while they're a little bit more minimal

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.039 
while they're a little bit more minimal
than<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.189> speed<00:02:21.400> cross<00:02:21.610> 3<00:02:21.670> s<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.269> wouldn't

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
than the speed cross 3 s I wouldn't

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.869 
than the speed cross 3 s I wouldn't

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
count them as minimal shoes they don't

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.110 
count them as minimal shoes they don't

the shoe and getting out of the shoe

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.809 
the shoe and getting out of the shoe
pretty<00:03:04.150> quickly<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:05.500> heels<00:03:05.799> quite<00:03:06.159> rigid<00:03:06.700> and

pretty quickly the heels quite rigid and

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.839 
pretty quickly the heels quite rigid and
structured<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.680> that's<00:03:08.680> again<00:03:09.099> just<00:03:09.489> nice

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
structured so that's again just nice

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.550 
structured so that's again just nice

support to it the tongue is open all the
way<00:03:14.650> down<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.010> bottom<00:03:15.129> but<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.150> has<00:03:16.299> this

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
way down to the bottom but it has this

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.860 
way down to the bottom but it has this
unique<00:03:16.690> mesh<00:03:17.200> panel<00:03:17.650> across<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.129> so<00:03:18.870> gravel

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
unique mesh panel across it so gravel

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.229 
unique mesh panel across it so gravel
and<00:03:19.989> rock<00:03:20.200> isn't<00:03:20.440> gonna<00:03:20.590> get<00:03:20.769> in<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:22.000> water

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
and rock isn't gonna get in but water

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.490

lacing system and speed lacing is this

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.869 
lacing system and speed lacing is this

cable that runs through the laces and

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.250 
cable that runs through the laces and
you<00:03:34.750> cinch<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.440> down<00:03:35.519> walk<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:36.940> then<00:03:37.900> took

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
you cinch it down walk it and then took

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.229 
you cinch it down walk it and then took

those fairway sing into a pocket in the
tongue<00:03:40.780> here<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:41.639> don't<00:03:42.639> like<00:03:42.879> that<00:03:43.560> I've<00:03:44.560> had

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
tongue here I don't like that I've had

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.409 
tongue here I don't like that I've had
races<00:03:45.069> where<00:03:45.370> this<00:03:45.489> has<00:03:45.639> come<00:03:45.669> loose<00:03:46.060> on<00:03:46.269> me

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
races where this has come loose on me

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.319 
races where this has come loose on me
and<00:03:46.690> just<00:03:47.079> generally<00:03:47.560> it's<00:03:47.709> it's<00:03:48.699> more<00:03:48.970> hassle

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
and just generally it's it's more hassle

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.939 
and just generally it's it's more hassle
than<00:03:49.449> it's<00:03:49.540> worth<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.989> pair<00:03:50.199> of<00:03:50.290> regular<00:03:50.470> laces

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
than it's worth a pair of regular laces

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.860 
than it's worth a pair of regular laces
is<00:03:51.310> just<00:03:51.609> fine<00:03:51.879> as<00:03:52.060> far<00:03:52.209> as<00:03:52.329> I'm<00:03:52.480> concerned<00:03:52.930> so
