through<00:03:24.599> a<00:03:24.629> wall<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.620> bugged<00:03:25.980> and

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
through a wall but this is bugged and

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.939 
through a wall but this is bugged and
not<00:03:26.579> working<00:03:27.239> but<00:03:27.690> it's<00:03:28.079> in<00:03:28.169> the<00:03:28.290> changelog<00:03:28.680> so

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
not working but it's in the changelog so

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.099 
not working but it's in the changelog so
I'm<00:03:29.040> going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.220> cover<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:29.699> there<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.930> they

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
I'm going to cover it so there so they

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.170 
I'm going to cover it so there so they
improved<00:03:31.500> hoppers<00:03:32.099> first<00:03:32.489> off<00:03:32.699> they<00:03:32.879> actually

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
improved hoppers first off they actually

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.869 
improved hoppers first off they actually
have<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.329> texture<00:03:33.870> right<00:03:34.859> there<00:03:35.159> it<00:03:35.340> looks<00:03:35.549> very

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
have a texture right there it looks very

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.619 
have a texture right there it looks very
nice<00:03:36.169> second<00:03:37.169> off<00:03:37.409> um<00:03:37.849> rent<00:03:38.849> well<00:03:39.299> they

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
nice second off um rent well they

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.360 
nice second off um rent well they
improved<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.139> an<00:03:40.319> item's<00:03:40.680> sort<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.069> little<00:03:41.280> bit

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
improved it an item's sort a little bit

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.460 
improved it an item's sort a little bit
easier<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.760> don't<00:03:42.419> know<00:03:42.569> all<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.840> details<00:03:42.989> but

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
easier I don't know all the details but

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.229 
easier I don't know all the details but
I<00:03:43.650> do<00:03:43.709> know<00:03:43.949> that<00:03:43.979> it<00:03:44.549> is<00:03:44.699> activated<00:03:45.060> by

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
I do know that it is activated by

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.149 
I do know that it is activated by
redstone<00:03:45.690> now<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:46.560> if<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.680> were<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:46.889> put<00:03:47.069> this

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
redstone now so if I were to put this

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.830 
redstone now so if I were to put this
redstone<00:03:47.489> lamp<00:03:47.849> in<00:03:48.030> BAM<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.479> goes<00:03:48.629> in<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
redstone lamp in BAM it goes in the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.559 
redstone lamp in BAM it goes in the
chest<00:03:49.079> correct<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:50.040> now<00:03:50.190> if<00:03:50.579> i<00:03:50.729> were<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.239> put<00:03:51.540> a

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
chest correct but now if i were to put a

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.000 
chest correct but now if i were to put a
torch<00:03:51.840> there<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.319> activate<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.769> with<00:03:52.859> some

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
torch there and activate it with some

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.619 
torch there and activate it with some
redstone<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.549> then<00:03:53.790> try<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.150> put<00:03:54.419> something

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
redstone and then try to put something

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.080 
redstone and then try to put something
in<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.109> will<00:03:55.620> not<00:03:55.829> go<00:03:56.069> in<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.370> until<00:03:56.549> i

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
in it it will not go in it until i

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.509 
in it it will not go in it until i
destroy<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.290> torch<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.769> then<00:03:59.010> it'll<00:03:59.220> go<00:03:59.250> in

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
destroy the torch and then it'll go in

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.399 
destroy the torch and then it'll go in
so<00:03:59.790> this<00:03:59.940> deactivate<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.049> could<00:04:01.199> be<00:04:01.379> very

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
so this deactivate so this could be very

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.580 
so this deactivate so this could be very
very<00:04:02.190> useful<00:04:02.900> alright<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.079> they<00:04:04.229> changed

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
very useful alright so they changed

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.670 
very useful alright so they changed
hello<00:04:05.010> texture<00:04:05.549> panics<00:04:05.849> work<00:04:06.180> now<00:04:06.449> a<00:04:06.720> lot<00:04:07.169> let

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
hello texture panics work now a lot let

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.039 
hello texture panics work now a lot let
me<00:04:07.799> read<00:04:08.159> you<00:04:08.370> this<00:04:08.400> um<00:04:08.819> because<00:04:09.599> I<00:04:09.810> don't

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
me read you this um because I don't

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.809 
me read you this um because I don't
actually<00:04:10.199> know<00:04:10.409> where<00:04:10.769> in<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.609> would

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
actually know where in the I would

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.729 
actually know where in the I would
assume<00:04:12.030> it's<00:04:12.239> in<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.389> jar<00:04:12.599> where<00:04:12.930> this<00:04:13.199> is<00:04:13.470> all

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
assume it's in the jar where this is all

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:14.960 
assume it's in the jar where this is all
right<00:04:13.919> so<00:04:14.099> I'm<00:04:14.159> just<00:04:14.310> going<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.519> read<00:04:14.729> it<00:04:14.819> to

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
right so I'm just going to read it to

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.729 
right so I'm just going to read it to
you<00:04:15.060> guys<00:04:15.239> to<00:04:15.599> give<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.840> guys<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.169> update<00:04:16.560> on

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
you guys to give you guys the update on

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.189 
you guys to give you guys the update on
textures<00:04:17.639> for<00:04:17.909> blocks<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.389> items<00:04:18.570> now<00:04:18.930> have

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
textures for blocks and items now have

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.399 
textures for blocks and items now have
individual<00:04:19.979> image<00:04:20.729> files<00:04:21.229> starting<00:04:22.229> from

individual image files starting from
this<00:04:22.560> snapshot<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.400> forward<00:04:23.880> blocks<00:04:24.270> and

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
this snapshot and forward blocks and

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.750 
this snapshot and forward blocks and
items<00:04:24.630> will<00:04:25.050> no<00:04:25.260> longer<00:04:25.289> load<00:04:26.010> their<00:04:26.250> artwork

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
items will no longer load their artwork

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.330 
items will no longer load their artwork
from<00:04:26.970> one<00:04:27.240> big<00:04:27.570> sheet<00:04:27.600> of<00:04:27.960> sprites<00:04:28.440> instead

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
from one big sheet of sprites instead

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.970 
from one big sheet of sprites instead
they'll<00:04:29.700> have<00:04:30.110> individual<00:04:31.110> files<00:04:31.410> for<00:04:31.800> each

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
they'll have individual files for each

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.400 
they'll have individual files for each
image<00:04:32.340> they're<00:04:32.820> using<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.870> benefit<00:04:34.290> from

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
image they're using the benefit from

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.810 
image they're using the benefit from
this<00:04:34.560> is<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.920> it'll<00:04:35.070> be<00:04:35.190> easier<00:04:35.550> for<00:04:35.580> us<00:04:35.790> to

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
this is that it'll be easier for us to

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.970 
this is that it'll be easier for us to
support<00:04:36.360> custom<00:04:36.930> blocks<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.440> items<00:04:37.530> in<00:04:37.890> the

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
support custom blocks and items in the

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.280 
support custom blocks and items in the
future<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.730> will<00:04:38.850> allow<00:04:39.270> us<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.540> mix<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.110> match

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
future it will allow us to mix and match

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.040 
future it will allow us to mix and match
block<00:04:40.710> artwork<00:04:41.220> resolutions<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.180> we'll<00:04:42.630> sure

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
block artwork resolutions and we'll sure

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.890 
block artwork resolutions and we'll sure
that<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.920> will<00:04:44.310> make<00:04:44.430> sure<00:04:44.700> that<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.180> get

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
that you and will make sure that you get

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.660 
that you and will make sure that you get
the<00:04:46.140> graphics<00:04:46.620> for<00:04:46.800> blocks<00:04:47.070> at<00:04:47.310> your<00:04:47.430> current

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
the graphics for blocks at your current

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.020 
the graphics for blocks at your current
texture<00:04:48.060> pack<00:04:48.240> isn't<00:04:48.510> updated<00:04:49.230> for<00:04:49.470> so<00:04:50.460> now<00:04:50.640> I

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
texture pack isn't updated for so now I

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.120 
texture pack isn't updated for so now I
don't<00:04:51.630> exactly<00:04:51.960> know<00:04:52.230> what<00:04:52.380> that<00:04:52.530> means<00:04:52.770> but

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
don't exactly know what that means but

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.410 
don't exactly know what that means but
it<00:04:53.340> sounds<00:04:53.370> like<00:04:53.910> there's<00:04:54.120> going<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.300> be<00:04:54.330> a

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
it sounds like there's going to be a

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.720 
it sounds like there's going to be a
different<00:04:54.840> odd<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.410> would<00:04:55.770> assume<00:04:55.980> a<00:04:56.130> dot<00:04:56.400> PNG

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
different odd I would assume a dot PNG

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.660 
different odd I would assume a dot PNG
for<00:04:57.480> every<00:04:57.840> single<00:04:58.200> block<00:04:58.560> making<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.460> very

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
for every single block making it very

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.640 
for every single block making it very

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
easy for texture pack makers and to

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.920 
easy for texture pack makers and to
update<00:05:02.070> them<00:05:02.310> I<00:05:02.550> do<00:05:02.790> not<00:05:02.940> know<00:05:03.240> please<00:05:03.630> do

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
update them I do not know please do
