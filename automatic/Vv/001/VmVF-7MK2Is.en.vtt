00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.390

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.600

 formally, ministers gathered 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.280

 having interrupted your summer holidays but 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.950
 what is called now basically everything 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.289
 attention is riveted on Ukraine and Russia 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.640
 therefore, it can not be without it, and or 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.920
 today perhaps for the first time from the beginning 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.379
 Conflict heads of foreign policy 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.199
 departments and quite sensational and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.760
 statement and admission that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.650
 happening in the country 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 for example, the first one spoke 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.600
 sweden foreign minister sweden 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600
 bildt 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.390
 we concentrated on 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.600
 humanitarian situation in the so-called 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.200
 People's Republics in the east of Ukraine 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.609
 humanitarian situation there 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.979
 catastrophic in these territories 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:25.329
 the whole economy is disabled people 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.079
 experiencing severe suffering of course 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.829
 Carl Bildt 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.450
 stayed true to himself putting all the blame on 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.340
 escalation of the conflict in Ukraine 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.560
 precisely on Russia and accusing leadership 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.479
 Donetsk and Lugansk republics in 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.579
 provoking the very same humanitarian 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.829
 disasters but the term humanitarian 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.170
 disaster sounded and from narrow 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.840
 enough influential minister 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.759
 European Foreign Affairs is it really 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.950
 for the first time as to give Donetsk and 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.659
 Lugansk republics today Brussels 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.360
 another very important was made 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.539
 statement according to which European 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.329
 Union refused to include Donetsk and Lugansk 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.610
 in the list of international terrorist 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.819
 organizations as highly requested and Grouse 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.869
 Kiev and several states of the European Union 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:13.930
 generally about consent in the ranks of a large single 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.389
 Europe to tell a separate story 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.880
 28 participating countries sometimes very difficult 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.510
 agree on something here for example more 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.160
 two weeks 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.870
 left on the fact that it was accepted 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.540
 today's decision is to 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.549
 equip Kurds driving on 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.920
 north iraq decision then i will remind 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.239
 appeared only today after 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.549
 two-week consultations and in essence 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.130
 affairs the same situation with the situation on 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.950
 Ukraine , for example, how much was 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.169
 conversations and rumors about what exactly 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.989
 located in the very trucks 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:46.060
 humanitarian columns sounded a pair to him 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.620
 completely absurd assumptions and here 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.639
 today's ministerial statement 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.639
 Foreign Affairs FRG 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.990
 I myself and got quite optimistic 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.180
 signal from an international committee 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.280
 the red cross is now a column with 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.380
 humanitarian aid can be monitored 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.170
 so we can exclude that 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.130
 mud flaps will be used to 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.300
 transportation of weapons under the guise of 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.760
 humanitarian goods 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.130
 now our attention is drawn to this 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.890
 problem however the next major step 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.740
 ceasefire in Ukraine on android 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.240
 thought but recall that it is from Moscow 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.760
 Brussels and Washington on require 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.300
 ensure where the conflict escalates to 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.370
 Ukraine 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.320
 Based on this and the decision taken 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.780
 all sorts of sanctions in a relationship 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.450
 moscow but after ng for a hard answer 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.520
 Russia banned the import of agricultural 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.070
 products from European Union countries 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.290
 the situation on the continent is now wrong 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.090
 unequivocal 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.069
 just listened to himself wildly sanctions 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.260
 conducted by the west against Russia 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.209
 while doing more harm to ourselves than 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.819
 Russia people are not politicians it is called 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.349
 the European Union should not shoot itself 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.569
 only pay compensation 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.299
 manufacturer suffers losses in Poland 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.010
 Slovaks Vendre or Greece but also completely 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.709
 review sanctions policy 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.569
 kampen for they are about but according to 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.340
 European standards and legislation 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.709
 decision on sanctions European Union 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.959
 should take unanimously and after that 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.620
 similar statements made just 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.359
 Today 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.299

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.549
 capitals talk about what for example in 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.650
 the third time will be adopted soon 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.570
 Is there a package of sanctions against Russia ? 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.220
 this may be a conversation well now 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.710
 need to talk about it just 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.780
 prematurely lily alexander thanks
