when<00:01:22.740> Dominique<00:01:23.070> Ansel<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.970> creating<00:01:24.330> this

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
when Dominique Ansel was creating this

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.780 
when Dominique Ansel was creating this
recipe<00:01:24.869> he<00:01:25.080> was<00:01:25.200> inspired<00:01:25.650> by<00:01:25.920> Oreos<00:01:26.340> which<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
recipe he was inspired by Oreos which is

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.910 
recipe he was inspired by Oreos which is
my<00:01:26.939> favorite<00:01:27.270> cookie<00:01:27.570> he<00:01:27.990> had<00:01:28.080> never<00:01:28.290> had<00:01:28.740> an

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
my favorite cookie he had never had an

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.830 
my favorite cookie he had never had an
Oreo<00:01:29.220> before<00:01:29.700> he<00:01:30.240> actually<00:01:30.360> had<00:01:30.600> his<00:01:30.689> first

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
Oreo before he actually had his first

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.630 
Oreo before he actually had his first
Oreo<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> couple<00:01:31.530> months<00:01:31.680> ago<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.250> he<00:01:32.460> thought

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
Oreo a couple months ago and he thought

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.179 
Oreo a couple months ago and he thought
it<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.060> bizarre<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.509> Americans<00:01:34.470> dipped

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
it was so bizarre that Americans dipped

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.429 
it was so bizarre that Americans dipped
their<00:01:35.369> Oreos<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.759> milk<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.509> that's<00:01:37.170> kind<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
their Oreos and milk and that's kind of

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.840 
their Oreos and milk and that's kind of
when<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.680> light<00:01:37.920> bulb<00:01:38.159> went<00:01:38.400> off<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> he

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
when that light bulb went off and he

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.520 
when that light bulb went off and he
thought<00:01:39.060> huh<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.930> could<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.290> both

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
thought huh what if you could have both

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.140 
thought huh what if you could have both
at<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> same<00:01:41.009> time<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.610> that's<00:01:41.939> how<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
at the same time so that's how the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.490 
at the same time so that's how the
chocolate<00:01:42.540> chip<00:01:42.659> cookie<00:01:42.930> milk<00:01:43.079> shot<00:01:43.290> was

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
chocolate chip cookie milk shot was

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.090 
chocolate chip cookie milk shot was
created<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.290> see<00:01:46.350> our<00:01:46.740> dough<00:01:46.920> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
created so as you can see our dough is

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.559 
to coat the inside with melted chocolate
this<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.459> imperative<00:03:29.879> to<00:03:30.209> this<00:03:30.360> chocolate

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
this is so imperative to this chocolate

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.940 
this is so imperative to this chocolate
chip<00:03:30.720> cookie<00:03:30.989> milk<00:03:31.230> shot<00:03:31.440> because<00:03:31.650> if<00:03:31.860> you

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
chip cookie milk shot because if you

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.530 
chip cookie milk shot because if you
just<00:03:32.099> put<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.370> milk<00:03:32.549> directly<00:03:32.819> in<00:03:33.120> there

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
just put the milk directly in there

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.940 
just put the milk directly in there
it<00:03:33.780> would<00:03:33.930> get<00:03:33.989> soggy<00:03:34.260> all<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.709> milk<00:03:34.890> would

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
it would get soggy all the milk would

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.800 
it would get soggy all the milk would
fall<00:03:35.160> out<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.790> going<00:03:35.879> to<00:03:35.940> prevent<00:03:36.420> any

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
fall out so this is going to prevent any

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.839 
fall out so this is going to prevent any
of<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.410> from<00:03:37.620> happening<00:03:37.829> but<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.370> also<00:03:38.489> just

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
of that from happening but it also just

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.360 
of that from happening but it also just
adds<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.120> really<00:03:39.150> yummy<00:03:39.450> flavor<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:41.129> shot

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
adds a really yummy flavor to the shot

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.520 
adds a really yummy flavor to the shot
so<00:03:42.269> all<00:03:42.390> I'm<00:03:42.510> gonna<00:03:42.599> do<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:43.109> just<00:03:43.290> take<00:03:43.500> my

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
so all I'm gonna do is just take my

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.460 
so all I'm gonna do is just take my
melted<00:03:44.040> chocolate<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:45.000> pour<00:03:45.359> it<00:03:45.450> directly<00:03:45.569> in

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
melted chocolate and pour it directly in

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.440 
melted chocolate and pour it directly in
there<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.670> have<00:03:47.849> found<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.299> easiest

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
there and I have found that the easiest

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.110 
there and I have found that the easiest
way<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.200> fill<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.560> up<00:03:49.739> about<00:03:50.250> halfway<00:03:50.519> and

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
way is to fill it up about halfway and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.280 
way is to fill it up about halfway and
then<00:03:51.379> I'm<00:03:52.379> just<00:03:52.620> going<00:03:52.829> to<00:03:52.859> turn<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.290> that

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
then I'm just going to turn this so that

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.830 
then I'm just going to turn this so that
it<00:03:55.349> goes<00:03:55.470> right<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.459> edge<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:58.159> then<00:03:59.840> you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
it goes right to the edge and then you

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.509 
it goes right to the edge and then you
don't<00:04:01.049> want<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.260> pour<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:01.769> chocolate<00:04:02.280> back

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
don't want to pour this chocolate back

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.740 
don't want to pour this chocolate back
into<00:04:02.819> your<00:04:02.940> chocolate<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.269> might<00:04:03.450> get<00:04:03.599> some

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
into your chocolate you might get some

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.970 
into your chocolate you might get some
crumbs<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.109> there<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.409> just<00:04:04.440> have<00:04:04.709> another

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
crumbs in there so just have another

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.110 
crumbs in there so just have another
bowl<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:06.169> as<00:04:07.169> soon<00:04:07.410> as<00:04:07.530> you're<00:04:07.709> ready<00:04:08.120> really

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
chocolate or hazelnut spread as long as

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.730 
chocolate or hazelnut spread as long as
you<00:04:21.479> have<00:04:21.599> some<00:04:21.780> type<00:04:21.930> of<00:04:22.049> barrier<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.560> prevent

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
you have some type of barrier to prevent
