00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
World at War something that a lot of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.100 
World at War something that a lot of
papers<00:01:25.370> saying<00:01:25.550> was<00:01:25.729> close<00:01:25.970> to<00:01:26.210> Vietnam<00:01:26.810> War

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
papers saying was close to Vietnam War

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.600

futuristic<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:29.660> could<00:01:29.780> mean<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:29.960> lot<00:01:30.050> of

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
futuristic so this could mean a lot of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.750

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
maybe the game is still futuristic when

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.630 
maybe the game is still futuristic when
we're<00:01:33.380> seeing<00:01:33.530> flashbacks<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.340> could<00:01:34.490> mean

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
we're seeing flashbacks it could mean

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.650
