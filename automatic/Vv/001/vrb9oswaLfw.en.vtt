00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
he's down there him but then they can

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.080 
he's down there him but then they can
get<00:01:24.990> very<00:01:25.229> aggressive<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.549> group<00:01:26.880> if

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
get very aggressive in that group if

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.920 
get very aggressive in that group if
there's<00:01:27.509> not<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> lot<00:01:28.340> they<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.720> one

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
there's not a lot they actually have one

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.170 
there's not a lot they actually have one
of<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> most<00:01:31.409> aggressive<00:01:32.100> cichlids<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
of the most aggressive cichlids that you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.039 
of the most aggressive cichlids that you
can<00:01:33.329> African<00:01:34.049> cichlids<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.829> find

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
can African cichlids that you can find

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.240 
can African cichlids that you can find
there<00:01:37.049> doesn't<00:01:37.470> look<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.100> don't

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
there doesn't look like they don't

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.370 
there doesn't look like they don't
really<00:01:38.400> look<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.390> aggressive<00:01:39.630> fish<00:01:40.110> but

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
really look like an aggressive fish but

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
really look like an aggressive fish but
trust<00:01:40.680> me<00:01:40.770> they're<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:42.119> really

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
trust me they're just really really

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.880

really<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.470> really<00:01:43.950> aggressive<00:01:45.829> so<00:01:46.829> you

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
really really really aggressive so you

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.560 
really really really aggressive so you
kind<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.610> take<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> into

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
kind of have to take that into

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.649 
kind of have to take that into
consideration<00:01:49.430> on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.490> often<00:01:51.149> people<00:01:51.329> don't

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
consideration on the often people don't

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.810 
consideration on the often people don't
really<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.640> gonna

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
really do this and then it it's gonna

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.179 
really do this and then it it's gonna
cause<00:01:54.090> problems<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.840> well<00:01:55.320> maybe<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:56.009> some
