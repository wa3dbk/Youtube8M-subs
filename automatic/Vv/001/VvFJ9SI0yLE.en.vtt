00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.460
 my name is david aguilar and came 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.550
 fernando ramÃ­rez and we are going to talk about it 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.560
 on trees well 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.260
 10 trees are the element of 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.000
 transmission of the migratory movement and 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.000
 the difference between the axes and the 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.640
 trees is that the axes are elements of 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.189
 Support for rotating organs 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.770
 of the machine and do not transmit power 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.860
 so they are not subjected to effort 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.140
 of torsion the axes are cylinders whose 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.590
 proportion is much greater in proportion 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.590
 that its diameter that the trees are 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.710
 designed so that its length is the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.489
 smaller possible with respect to the diameter for 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.609
 better support the demands of 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.010
 bending that added to the torsion could 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:53.379
 result in an increase 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.379
 excessive diameter of the tree 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.610
 the axes carry moving parts as 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.650
 roller pulleys drums cetera 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.840
 this is subject only to bending 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.970
 utilization is most common its 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.190
 most common use for vehicles 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.260
 on rails or rails which 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.530
 allow easy assembly and disassembly 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.320
 of wheel sets and transmit very 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.470
 well the lateral forces that have 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.960
 as a disadvantage that they are subject to 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.400
 flexion to alternatiba depending on the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.460
 way of working 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.340
 the axes can be 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.950
 are fixed they allow the turn of the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.200
 mechanical elements and all about them 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.560
 but they do not rotate in solidarity with them 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.979
 that is to say the mechanical elements will go 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.810
 freely on them rotating can 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.180
 rotate in solidarity with any of the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.479
 elements placed on them in 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.090
 conclusion the axes are elements of 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.460
 Support of the determined 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.800
 rotary elements of the machine we 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.440
 transmit power so they are not 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.929
 torque subjected to the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.270
 trees can be profiled smooth or 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.090
 fluted depending on the moment of rotation 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.979
 to transmit the smooth trees without 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.680
 exception change are easy to 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.180
 calculate but the most frequent case is 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.420
 that they have different diameters 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.850
 along its length creating like this 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.030
 a zone of concentration of tensions 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.940
 in these changes called points of 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.400
 notch that include notably in 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.040
 the assistance of the tree for the purpose of 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.720
 decrease this notch effect is 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.720
 round the selection changes 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.090
 the trees transmit moments of 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.480
 torsion are subject to bending so 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.880
 that compound resistance is calculated 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.360
 a tree is an element a machine that 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.590
 can be cylindrical or not 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.380
 that different parts are assembled 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.140
 mechanical for example many function of 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.019
 garages or pulleys in which it is transmitted 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.560
 power are 'avatar' different shapes 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.900
 as drawings or flexible straight between 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.630
 other trees also called 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.239
 Transmission shafts rotate is always 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.310
 seen with the organs supported the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.780
 most of the time they should be calculated 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.019
 In addition, deformations and 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.019
 vibrations 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.700
 the trees are elements that really 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.859
 potential and if they are subject to 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.680
 torque those trees 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.890
 they are loaded not only by the express 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.500
 normal due to the moments with the 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.959
 factors but also because of the effort is 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.510
 tangential is generated by moments of 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.410
 tension throughout the length and in 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.180
 isolated sectors of the tree 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.180
 differences between trees feet 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.680
 the essential difference between the axes and 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.720
 the trees is that babies are 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.450
 elements that support or support 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.180
 rotary organs of machines and 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.000
 naturally in power so they are 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.860
 subjected to the traction process 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.020
 while the trees are elements 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.050
 that really is power and if you're 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.890
 subjected to torsional stresses 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.740
 apparently the axes have a 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.570
 smaller diameter than trees processes 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.570
 are subjected to greater efforts
