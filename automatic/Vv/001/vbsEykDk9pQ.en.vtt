00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
really wish they had cut the sequence

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.119 
really wish they had cut the sequence
out<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.260> isn't<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.680> hasn't<00:00:49.920> been<00:00:49.980> so

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
out now this isn't it hasn't been so

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.689 
out now this isn't it hasn't been so
hard<00:00:50.370> before<00:00:50.930> yet<00:00:51.930> what's<00:00:52.800> difficult<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.460> when

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
hard before yet what's difficult is when

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.920 
hard before yet what's difficult is when
you<00:00:53.789> come<00:00:53.940> around<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.239> next<00:00:54.449> corner<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you come around the next corner the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.880 
you come around the next corner the
rocks<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.230> coming<00:00:55.500> down<00:00:55.590> you're<00:00:55.770> actually

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
rocks are coming down you're actually

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.729 
rocks are coming down you're actually
getting<00:00:56.070> shot<00:00:56.460> from<00:00:56.760> behind<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> above<00:00:58.140> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
getting shot from behind and above and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.229 
getting shot from behind and above and
since<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.100> can't<00:00:59.160> fucking<00:00:59.730> aim<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
since you can't fucking aim up in the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.310 
since you can't fucking aim up in the
sky<00:01:00.620> what<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:01.859> need<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:03.320> while

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
sky what you really need to do is while

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.380 
sky what you really need to do is while
you're<00:01:04.350> coming<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.100> these<00:01:05.250> inclines<00:01:05.939> and

you're coming up like these inclines and
these<00:01:06.659> little<00:01:07.020> jumps<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:07.740> taking

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
these little jumps that you're taking

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.940 
these little jumps that you're taking
just<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.479> firing<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.260> machine<00:01:10.530> gun<00:01:10.710> at<00:01:10.830> all

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
just be firing the machine gun at all

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.890 
just be firing the machine gun at all
times<00:01:11.330> because<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:13.170> does<00:01:13.470> help<00:01:14.900> take

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
