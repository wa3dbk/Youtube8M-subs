excuse<00:00:24.750> me<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> leg<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.590> was<00:00:25.740> playing

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
excuse me for the leg I was playing

ground<00:00:26.250> we're<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.670> two<00:00:26.880> or<00:00:26.910> three<00:00:27.240> bars<00:00:27.510> so

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
ground we're on a two or three bars so

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.540 
ground we're on a two or three bars so
that<00:00:28.260> probably<00:00:28.529> explains<00:00:28.680> why<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.130> numbers

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that probably explains why the numbers

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
that probably explains why the numbers
are<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.910> big<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.420> why<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.660> takes<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:30.960> long<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
are so big and why it takes so long and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.130 
are so big and why it takes so long and
fit-out<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:32.250> anyway<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.120> mp7<00:00:33.630> thermal

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
fit-out but anyway this is a mp7 thermal

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.930 
fit-out but anyway this is a mp7 thermal
emily<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> map<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> ground<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
emily be on the map on the ground and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.060 
emily be on the map on the ground and
look<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.210> spawn<00:00:36.570> would<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> market

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
look at that spawn would do the market

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.490 
look at that spawn would do the market
jejunum<00:00:38.520> he<00:00:39.030> had<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> shotgun<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.140> he<00:00:40.410> has

jejunum he had a shotgun and he has

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200 
jejunum he had a shotgun and he has
foreign<00:00:40.770> protection<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.460> i<00:00:41.700> probably<00:00:42.030> would

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
foreign protection so i probably would

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.090 
foreign protection so i probably would
have<00:00:42.270> lost<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.570> gunfight<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.410> anyway<00:00:43.710> my<00:00:43.860> purse
