Express<00:04:08.709> port<00:04:09.010> looks<00:04:09.600> okay<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:10.900> we're<00:04:11.049> gonna

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
Express port looks okay so we're gonna

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:22.250 
Express port looks okay so we're gonna
screw<00:04:11.590> in<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.860> adapter<00:04:12.370> here

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.750 

all<00:04:23.260> right<00:04:23.530> there<00:04:24.190> we<00:04:24.340> go

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.130 

and<00:04:27.760> let's<00:04:28.000> see<00:04:28.180> if<00:04:28.210> there's<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.630> difference<00:04:29.050> in

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
and let's see if there's a difference in

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:40.290 
and let's see if there's a difference in
signal<00:04:29.590> wait<00:04:30.550> for<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.940> refresh<00:04:39.030> all<00:04:40.030> right

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
signal wait for it to refresh all right

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.500 
signal wait for it to refresh all right
here<00:04:40.480> we<00:04:40.570> go<00:04:41.760> all<00:04:42.760> right<00:04:42.820> now<00:04:43.030> we're<00:04:43.300> gonna<00:04:43.390> hit

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
here we go all right now we're gonna hit

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.570 
here we go all right now we're gonna hit
the<00:04:43.660> switch<00:04:45.390> and<00:04:46.740> let's<00:04:47.740> see<00:04:47.950> if<00:04:47.980> we<00:04:48.250> get<00:04:48.370> any

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
the switch and let's see if we get any

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.630 
the switch and let's see if we get any
better<00:04:48.880> signal<00:04:49.540> out<00:04:49.690> of<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:53.160> there<00:04:54.160> we<00:04:54.280> go

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
better signal out of it there we go

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.660 
better signal out of it there we go
so<00:04:55.120> look<00:04:55.300> at<00:04:55.390> that<00:04:55.540> with<00:04:55.750> two<00:04:55.930> antennas<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:56.740> went

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
so look at that with two antennas I went

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.090 
so look at that with two antennas I went
up<00:04:57.790> three<00:04:58.060> more<00:04:58.270> sign<00:04:58.570> our<00:04:58.720> points<00:04:59.170> and<00:04:59.320> came

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
up three more sign our points and came

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.330 
up three more sign our points and came
down<00:05:00.400> about<00:05:00.580> three<00:05:00.970> points<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:01.450> RSSI<00:05:02.080> so<00:05:02.650> take

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
down about three points and RSSI so take

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.290 
down about three points and RSSI so take
a<00:05:03.370> look<00:05:03.580> here<00:05:05.400> all<00:05:06.400> right<00:05:06.670> so<00:05:06.910> this<00:05:07.000> is<00:05:07.180> the

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
a look here all right so this is the

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.050 
a look here all right so this is the
clear<00:05:07.480> hub<00:05:07.690> Express<00:05:08.050> adapter<00:05:08.910> with<00:05:09.910> the

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
clear hub Express adapter with the

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.240 
clear hub Express adapter with the
antenna<00:05:10.420> with<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.620> external<00:05:12.130> antenna

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
antenna with the external antenna

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.730 
antenna with the external antenna
mounted<00:05:12.700> outside<00:05:13.110> this<00:05:14.110> is<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.380> second

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
mounted outside this is the second

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.250 
mounted outside this is the second
external<00:05:15.190> antenna<00:05:15.460> outside<00:05:15.970> is<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.120> 221<00:05:16.900> DB

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
external antenna outside is a 221 DB

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.010 
external antenna outside is a 221 DB
antennas<00:05:17.790> and<00:05:20.220> that's<00:05:21.220> excellent<00:05:21.780> take<00:05:22.780> one

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
antennas and that's excellent take one

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.230 
antennas and that's excellent take one
out<00:05:23.200> let's<00:05:23.920> take<00:05:24.040> one<00:05:24.250> out<00:05:24.400> this<00:05:24.820> sees

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:35.150 

difference<00:05:28.240> here<00:05:28.510> we're<00:05:29.200> just<00:05:29.230> one<00:05:32.130> alright

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.890 

and<00:05:36.160> there<00:05:36.370> you<00:05:36.400> go<00:05:38.520> one<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.700> good<00:05:39.970> two<00:05:40.450> is<00:05:40.480> good

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
and there you go one is good two is good

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.270 
and there you go one is good two is good
you<00:05:41.290> can<00:05:41.320> go<00:05:41.590> either<00:05:41.770> way

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
you can go either way

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.390 
you can go either way
this<00:05:43.150> is<00:05:43.360> with<00:05:43.540> the<00:05:43.720> adapter<00:05:44.290> you're<00:05:44.980> also

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
this is with the adapter you're also

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.550 
this is with the adapter you're also
showing<00:05:45.790> it<00:05:46.090> with<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:46.390> f-type<00:05:46.780> port<00:05:47.140> so<00:05:47.500> you

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
showing it with the f-type port so you

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.470 
showing it with the f-type port so you
can<00:05:47.770> actually<00:05:47.920> change<00:05:48.310> out<00:05:48.580> your<00:05:48.820> clear<00:05:49.330> hub

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
can actually change out your clear hub
