time now from a crime-fighting point of

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
time now from a crime-fighting point of
view<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> police<00:00:54.840> might<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.289> interested<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
view the police might be interested in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.330 
view the police might be interested in
this<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.520> want<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:58.340> everybody

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
this because they want to know everybody

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.709 
this because they want to know everybody
that<00:00:59.520> was<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> area<00:01:00.239> they're<00:01:00.510> trying<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that was in the area they're trying to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.479 
that was in the area they're trying to
figure<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.079> who<00:01:01.320> did<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.590> particular<00:01:01.920> crime

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
figure out who did a particular crime

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.660 
figure out who did a particular crime
and<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.650> pool<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.159> suspects

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and so now they have a pool of suspects

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730 
and so now they have a pool of suspects
of<00:01:05.790> course<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.720> huge<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.470> most

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
of course it's going to be huge in most

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.950 
of course it's going to be huge in most
cases<00:01:09.260> thousands<00:01:10.260> perhaps<00:01:11.570> but<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.810> be

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
cases thousands perhaps but just be

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.270 
cases thousands perhaps but just be
aware<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> type<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.040> thing

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
aware that that's the type of thing

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.270 
aware that that's the type of thing
that's<00:01:14.460> out<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.090> happens<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.900> happens

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
that's out there it happens it happens

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
that's out there it happens it happens
pretty<00:01:17.280> much<00:01:17.430> every<00:01:18.030> day<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> request<00:01:18.810> like

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
pretty much every day a request like

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.039 
pretty much every day a request like
this<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.409> made<00:01:19.820> for<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> cell<00:01:21.150> phone<00:01:21.180> tower<00:01:21.570> dump

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this is made for a cell phone tower dump

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.630 
this is made for a cell phone tower dump
and<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.680> think<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> become<00:01:23.310> more

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and I think it's going to become more

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.789 
and I think it's going to become more
and<00:01:23.729> more<00:01:23.790> common<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> future<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.470> here's

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and more common in the future now here's

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.550 
and more common in the future now here's
what<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.130> may<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.540> how<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:28.200> cell
