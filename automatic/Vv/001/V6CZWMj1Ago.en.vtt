 a video and I very much hope that you 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.150

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.000
 How glad I am to be able to 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.779
 bring this piece of gameplay to you 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.880
 beauty is the second only decod goals I 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.489
 brought some goal videos but the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.010
 same gameplay was just the first video and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.380
 this now that is not an interplay gameplay is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.290
 just an excerpt from the gameplay where I 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.510
 I can give you guys because it's my first 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.210
 Who 's in the code I like and I hope it's 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.370
 the first of many I confess that this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.289
 it was not my best game play and jati 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.089
 we already got 363 new bar and 70 74 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.579
 bar 12 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.370
 but unfortunately I was not recording 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.199
 This game place and I could not get it. 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.149
 those who game the place also English 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.330
 Who is this first, I hope? 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.740
 you listen to the shea ran at the map 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.350
 as much as I could 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.400
 the maximum the map gives people 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.620
 pull right 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.300
 if it were for example strikes where it would be 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.729
 easier but this map is not as 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.640
 small so the gameplay has hours there 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.799
 You're going to miss the fighting but it was 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.619
 well run gameplay hope you 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.680
 enjoy beauty and it's about gameplay 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.770
 I want to talk to you better is the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.570
 best few to drive galley 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.530
 I know there are a lot of people having 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.390
 difficulty complaining about maps 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.000
 complaining that he's dying easy 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.270
 which is killing the connection very fast 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.950
 or the code teaches I wanted to pass 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.439
 some tips for you while we 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.909
 watch it accompanies this gameplay of 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:57.810
 Who, my friend, is beauty, because I love you. 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.020
 I adapted with the setup box a lot but a lot 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.180
 Good face and I wish I could pass these 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.909
 Step afterwards for you and I hope I can 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.610
 help you I think it's a setup 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.620
 very good for who wants to move 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.750
 Well, who wants to win the fight? 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.960
 to leave with more facilities than 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.560
 move faster with the map 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.840
 then maybe it will appear and in the corner 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.680
 away from the screen at some corner of the screen. 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.540
 setap de 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.909
 after I was using it but if not 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.829
 I'll tell you what I'm saying here. 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.239
 the boxes I was wearing beauty I hope 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.780
 that you listen and I hope that you 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.450
 Understand as it is expensive books. 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.980
 was using essential points today is 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.560
 of course you will have to have a 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.260
 Bond number of those points there for you 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.319
 to be able to acquire these ports but 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.870
 fundamental is the few that were 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.359
 using to the advantage for this gameplay there 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.579
 I was using prepared that that 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:00.120
 speed punk the first there that 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.310
 mine that helps you to aim faster 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.040
 When are you running to like this? 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.879
 you aim faster and the fundamental 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.430
 man does a test of this porq with this 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.790
 because without this one because you will feel 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.400
 a difference yes gigantic face and the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.769
 Most parks I was using 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.549
 of the speed benches was 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.639
 second punk Islaine someone who is right 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:29.489
 brest prestige of the sleight of hand 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.970
 something rather there 90 sleight 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.849
 has prepared precipitation and then I 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.220
 I was with the marathon and it's the marathon. 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.019
 which is very good in this code here 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.220
 It's an endless marathon you can. 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.989
 run through the maps 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.489
 they've already made it realize the size 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:50.430
 of the maps and there I was with a draw 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.709
 quick serve which in my opinion is the 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.939
 second most important post that has 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.099
 man in this code is essential for you 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:02.430
 want to have a fluid gameplay you want 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:07.099
 pull you want to go up you want 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:10.620
 earn a faits I advise you a lot 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.590
 open there is the slot for you to use 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.900
 that is fundamental 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:21.090
 I think the guy first thing does not 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.030
 essential in the code you learn to 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.050
 move around and learn to earn their 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.490
 win do not win with front bat 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.699
 to win face to face with your opponent 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.889
 and what if that helps you by simon 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.050
 more alone than there is I think a 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.419
 little pig 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.520
 worse than this for what the stock 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.569
 that here is the stalker if you do not 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.389
 mistake 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:47.659
 that same chased face the tracker 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.849
 and exceptional for me is the best because 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:52.069
 shot so far of the code goal 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.159
 although it seems to me that it will not 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:57.560
 competitive, but since 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.389
 maybe you do not play competitive I know 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.069
 that the majority of my audience is from yesterday 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:07.039
 9 the guy is what is essential I do not 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:10.550
 I used it a lot he confessed nw3 I did not 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:13.310
 I used to use a lot more at bell 2001 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.889
 used a lot of stock that little dog that 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.139
 wore behind the weapon that was an attachment right 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.050
 but here I just in all my class 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.719
 has outstanding face stock 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.479
 Do you want to win in front of you? 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:29.300
 dancing you either do not want to let 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.789
 you are a fixed target in front of you 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.979
 opponent it helps you to get that 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.110
 Soda to that dance to and fro. 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.789
 in front of your opponent this is 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.490
 fundamental for you to win the 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.840
 your gains fight off so that was it 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.340
 What I had to say is gameplay. 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.639
 coming to an end I'm going to pick up now what 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.919
 is that in this kill it's there that's what I 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:51.650
 I had to tell you then serious and 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.050
 if that combination of pÃ¢ques there that I 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.000
 I did that I think it's exceptional and there 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.219
 I used some breads a specialist and 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.740
 also helps a lot but the 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.830
 first because it is the preparation 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.229
 according to israel, third 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.710
 Marathon barracks Estalker the right 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:13.159
 pursuer there and the fifth is punk is the 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.240
 quick serve or the idram beauty was this 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.650
 What I had to tell you and 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.750
