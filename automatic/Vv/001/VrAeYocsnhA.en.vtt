00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
this is clearly based on the lone

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.060 
this is clearly based on the lone
survivor<00:00:53.100> movie<00:00:53.640> which<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.090> did<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.800> saw

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
survivor movie which I did see so I saw

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.889 
survivor movie which I did see so I saw
the<00:00:56.129> lone<00:00:56.309> survivor<00:00:56.670> movie<00:00:57.329> starring<00:00:57.600> Mark

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the lone survivor movie starring Mark

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.430 
the lone survivor movie starring Mark
Wahlberg<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:59.219> he<00:00:59.910> did<00:01:00.719> an<00:01:00.809> excellent<00:01:00.960> job

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
Wahlberg and he did an excellent job

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.200 
Wahlberg and he did an excellent job
I<00:01:01.559> thought<00:01:01.770> lone<00:01:02.010> survivor<00:01:02.399> was<00:01:02.579> an<00:01:02.699> excellent

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
I thought lone survivor was an excellent

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.630 
I thought lone survivor was an excellent
movie<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.899> haven't<00:01:04.140> seen<00:01:04.290> any<00:01:04.680> before<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.899 
movie if you haven't seen any before I
will<00:01:06.150> admit<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.990> pretty<00:01:07.369> depressing<00:01:08.369> but

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
will admit it's pretty depressing but

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.670 
will admit it's pretty depressing but
also<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.659> really<00:01:09.869> good<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.200> depressing<00:01:10.619> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
also really really good and depressing I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
also really really good and depressing I
mean<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.360> not

enjoyed it and I would definitely
recommend<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.780> now<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> game<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:29.820> was<00:01:29.939> kind

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
recommend it now in the game it was kind

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.940 
recommend it now in the game it was kind
of<00:01:30.240> weird<00:01:30.450> I'm<00:01:30.630> pretty<00:01:30.960> sure<00:01:31.170> Mark<00:01:31.470> Wahlberg

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
of weird I'm pretty sure Mark Wahlberg

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.679 
of weird I'm pretty sure Mark Wahlberg
in<00:01:32.159> lone<00:01:32.579> survivor<00:01:32.970> did<00:01:33.360> use<00:01:33.780> an<00:01:34.049> MK<00:01:34.439> mod<00:01:34.740> 11<00:01:35.689> or

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
in lone survivor did use an MK mod 11 or

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.170 
in lone survivor did use an MK mod 11 or
I<00:01:36.720> guess<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.680> military<00:01:38.310> version<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.850> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
I guess the military version would be I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.850 
I guess the military version would be I
think<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:41.720> mm1<00:01:42.720> 10<00:01:43.020> or<00:01:43.380> something<00:01:43.740> like

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
think it's the mm1 10 or something like

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.030 
think it's the mm1 10 or something like
that<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:45.110> which<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.290> mean<00:01:46.470> he<00:01:46.770> would<00:01:46.799> be

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
that and which would mean he would be

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.980 
that and which would mean he would be
based<00:01:47.430> basically<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> M<00:01:48.570> came<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:48.930> at

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
based basically it is the M came out at

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
based basically it is the M came out at
11<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.799> thing<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.579> really<00:01:50.820> weird<00:01:51.000> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
11 the thing is it was really weird in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.670 
11 the thing is it was really weird in
the<00:01:51.149> movie<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.659> thought<00:01:51.990> he<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.259> using<00:01:52.439> that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the movie I thought he was using that

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.999 
the movie I thought he was using that
gun<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:54.000> gun<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.570> far<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:55.799> knowledge

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
gun and that gun as far to my knowledge

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.230 
gun and that gun as far to my knowledge
uses<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.820> 308<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.649> guess<00:01:58.920> would<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.240> 7.62

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
uses the 308 or I guess would be 7.62

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.090 
uses the 308 or I guess would be 7.62
millimeter<00:02:00.750> rounds<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:01.890> there's<00:02:02.040> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
millimeter rounds but then there's a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.590 
millimeter rounds but then there's a
part<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> movie<00:02:02.520> where<00:02:02.759> he<00:02:02.790> gets<00:02:02.909> handed<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
part in the movie where he gets handed a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.660 
part in the movie where he gets handed a
magazine<00:02:04.049> from<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.530> guy<00:02:04.649> using<00:02:04.829> an<00:02:05.040> m16<00:02:05.490> he's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
like puts into his gun and that's 5.56

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.110 
like puts into his gun and that's 5.56
so<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> little<00:02:11.220> bit<00:02:11.310> confused<00:02:11.760> there<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
so I was a little bit confused there to

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.700 
so I was a little bit confused there to
where<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.569> he<00:02:12.840> was<00:02:12.959> actually

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
where if he was actually

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.650 
where if he was actually
using<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:15.240> m110<00:02:15.960> 11<00:02:16.380> or<00:02:17.030> was<00:02:18.030> something<00:02:18.510> else

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
using the m110 11 or was something else

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.750 
using the m110 11 or was something else
and<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.530> was<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.770> little<00:02:19.980> bit<00:02:20.100> weird<00:02:20.460> out<00:02:20.610> by

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
and so I was a little bit weird out by

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.970 
and so I was a little bit weird out by
then<00:02:20.910> but<00:02:21.090> that's<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.420> gun<00:02:21.750> nut<00:02:21.960> stuff<00:02:22.290> most

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
then but that's just gun nut stuff most

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.230 
then but that's just gun nut stuff most
of<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.250> are<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.490> gonna<00:02:23.580> be<00:02:23.670> like<00:02:23.880> yeah<00:02:23.940> he's

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
of you are just gonna be like yeah he's

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.720 
of you are just gonna be like yeah he's
using<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.660> coolest<00:02:25.020> sniper<00:02:25.260> rifle<00:02:25.710> uh-huh<00:02:26.430> and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
using a coolest sniper rifle uh-huh and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.370 
using a coolest sniper rifle uh-huh and
that's<00:02:27.090> pretty<00:02:27.360> much<00:02:27.480> what<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.110> MK

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
that's pretty much what it is so the MK

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.010 
that's pretty much what it is so the MK
mod<00:02:28.530> 11<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.460> actual<00:02:29.820> game<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.330> battlefield

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
mod 11 in the actual game of battlefield

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
mod 11 in the actual game of battlefield
4<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.560> do<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.490> like<00:02:33.030> dmrs<00:02:33.900> I'm<00:02:34.110> gonna<00:02:34.290> say<00:02:34.860> that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
4 I do not like dmrs I'm gonna say that

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.960 
4 I do not like dmrs I'm gonna say that
right<00:02:35.220> out<00:02:35.250> there

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
right out there

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.210 
right out there
tremendously<00:02:36.630> underpowered<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.560> my<00:02:37.770> opinion

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
tremendously underpowered in my opinion

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.580 
tremendously underpowered in my opinion
and<00:02:38.370> although<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.570> do<00:02:39.840> quite<00:02:40.230> well<00:02:40.290> with

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
and although I can do quite well with

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.720 
and although I can do quite well with
the<00:02:40.890> DMR's<00:02:41.280> at<00:02:41.550> no<00:02:42.360> point<00:02:42.780> am<00:02:43.110> i<00:02:43.290> thinking<00:02:43.730> wow

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
the DMR's at no point am i thinking wow

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.660 
the DMR's at no point am i thinking wow
I'm<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.510> glad<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.960> this<00:02:46.110> DMR<00:02:46.680> because<00:02:47.430> in

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
I'm so glad I have this DMR because in

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.550 
I'm so glad I have this DMR because in
every<00:02:48.030> scenario<00:02:48.270> where<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.630> get<00:02:48.810> kills<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.170> DMR

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
every scenario where I get kills the DMR

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.040 
every scenario where I get kills the DMR
I<00:02:49.860> could<00:02:50.310> be<00:02:50.430> getting<00:02:50.760> those<00:02:51.330> same<00:02:51.690> kills

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
I could be getting those same kills

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.010 
I could be getting those same kills
easier<00:02:52.890> with<00:02:53.580> something<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> ak5c

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
easier with something like the ak5c

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.860 
easier with something like the ak5c
there's<00:02:55.260> no<00:02:55.560> point<00:02:55.950> using<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.610> DMR<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.840> I

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
there's no point using the DMR that I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.590 
there's no point using the DMR that I
could<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.950> know<00:02:58.980> not<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.550> using<00:02:59.910> other<00:03:00.090> guns

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
could you know not be using other guns

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.810 
could you know not be using other guns
that<00:03:00.870> are<00:03:01.050> better<00:03:01.320> suited<00:03:01.410> for<00:03:01.800> pretty<00:03:02.670> much

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
that are better suited for pretty much

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.150 
that are better suited for pretty much
everything<00:03:03.480> else<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.290> really<00:03:04.680> feel<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.070> it

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
everything else so I really feel that it

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.970 
everything else so I really feel that it
needs<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.430> be<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.610> couple<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.090> buffs<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.590> DMR

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
needs to be a couple of buffs to the DMR

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.610 
needs to be a couple of buffs to the DMR
is<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.360> for<00:03:09.360> one<00:03:09.540> recall<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> little<00:03:10.500> bit

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
is like for one recall is a little bit

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.240 
is like for one recall is a little bit
ridiculous<00:03:11.040> like<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.920> considering<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.040> are

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
ridiculous like you considering you are

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.120 
ridiculous like you considering you are
limited<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.060> single<00:03:15.420> fire<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.410> recoil<00:03:16.920> is

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
limited to single fire the recoil is

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.610 
limited to single fire the recoil is
just<00:03:17.610> too<00:03:17.940> much<00:03:18.210> I<00:03:18.390> feel<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.990> should<00:03:19.200> be<00:03:19.320> calmed

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
just too much I feel it should be calmed

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.960 
just too much I feel it should be calmed
down<00:03:19.770> a<00:03:19.890> little<00:03:20.130> bit<00:03:20.250> especially<00:03:20.490> then<00:03:20.910> you

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
down a little bit especially then you

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.060 
down a little bit especially then you
get<00:03:21.120> suppressed<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.080> oh<00:03:22.290> my<00:03:22.530> god<00:03:22.710> like

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
get suppressed and oh my god like

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.040 
get suppressed and oh my god like
someone<00:03:23.700> looks<00:03:24.030> at<00:03:24.210> you<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.930> get

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
someone looks at you and you get

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.020 
someone looks at you and you get
suppressed<00:03:25.440> enough<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.980> then<00:03:26.130> miss<00:03:26.430> like<00:03:26.670> so

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
suppressed enough to then miss like so

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.700 
suppressed enough to then miss like so
many<00:03:27.210> shots<00:03:27.510> with<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.720> DMR's<00:03:28.140> which<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.470> kind

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
many shots with the DMR's which is kind

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.990 
many shots with the DMR's which is kind
of<00:03:28.800> ridiculous<00:03:30.140> but<00:03:31.140> again<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.890> MK<00:03:32.400> mod<00:03:32.550> 11<00:03:32.910> is

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
of ridiculous but again the MK mod 11 is

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.790 
of ridiculous but again the MK mod 11 is
actually<00:03:33.300> of<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.600> DMR's<00:03:33.960> I<00:03:34.170> don't<00:03:34.440> like<00:03:34.620> them

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
actually of the DMR's I don't like them

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.830 
actually of the DMR's I don't like them
again<00:03:35.100> but<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.490> MK<00:03:35.760> mod<00:03:35.910> 11<00:03:36.270> is<00:03:36.390> one<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.720> my

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
again but the MK mod 11 is one of my

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.690 
again but the MK mod 11 is one of my
favorite<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.650> DMR<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.100> like<00:03:38.250> if<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.430> had<00:03:38.580> to

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
favorite of the DMR is like if I had to

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.640 
favorite of the DMR is like if I had to
use<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.970> DMR<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.510> lot<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.870> times<00:03:40.050> I<00:03:40.200> do<00:03:40.260> use

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
use the DMR a lot of the times I do use

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.090 
use the DMR a lot of the times I do use
the<00:03:41.100> MK<00:03:41.370> mod<00:03:41.580> 11<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.350> with<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.380> saucer<00:03:43.920> the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
the MK mod 11 and with a saucer the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.750 
the MK mod 11 and with a saucer the
sound<00:03:44.310> sir

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
sound sir

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.570 
sound sir

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
made to use DMR's though I would use a

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.180 
made to use DMR's though I would use a
setup<00:05:42.590> like<00:05:42.710> this

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190

answer<00:05:46.010> but<00:05:46.580> I<00:05:46.640> don't<00:05:47.000> like<00:05:47.240> DMR's<00:05:47.690> as<00:05:47.840> a<00:05:47.870> whole

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
answer but I don't like DMR's as a whole

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.320 
answer but I don't like DMR's as a whole
so<00:05:48.350> I<00:05:48.380> would<00:05:48.680> usually<00:05:49.010> use<00:05:49.250> some<00:05:49.820> other<00:05:50.000> kind

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
so I would usually use some other kind

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.779 
so I would usually use some other kind
