00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.850
 Hello sales is the city and South 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.149
 f108 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.499
 Have facilities 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:11.049
 6th ball 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:12.140
 Rice paper 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.740
 It is not this original model 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.679
 It's a risk by family and friends 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.630
 Petite and lovely Yan 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 Wednesday 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.349
 It is an analog video 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.440
 The 7th is always big 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.560
 Because it was long 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.800
 yui tends to sharpen 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.969
 First see what 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:33.960
 As soon as I find it 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.940
 Present please 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.940
 Even if you put a cat or not search 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.230
 Resign on 31 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440
 I wanted to show 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.730
 Yes, that's right 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.320
 Today's just different, but still a little bit 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.850
 It is a battle 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.740
 I will do the next batter 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740
 Such a person who feels like that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.580
 It is such a woman 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.570
 I am working at midnight before 9:00 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.580
 1 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.170
 It is 13 o'clock 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.470
 And in fact, this results in a new serial number 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.030
 6. 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.610
 With me 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.950
 Japan Rock 456 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.730
 It is February, 1929-1928 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.250
 And I can not say 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.060
 This guarantees 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.310
 Resulting skin is smooth because it is divided on June 17, 2008 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.310
 It is 2010 but 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.760
 I will 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.270
 It will be possible on the lieutenant net and say power 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.270
 please listen 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920
 Dollar falls in the rice market 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.590
 One after another 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.590
 continue 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.940
 Growth rate 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.150
 Same generation is strong 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.310
 Cow departure 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.940
 Haunting 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.390
 I agree 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.650
 On weekdays 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.920
 The result only edots.l 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.000
 There is no indispensable measure on the net, but I receive it 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.680
 Naturally, if it's the environment, it's also a problem, but you'll regret later 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.930
 When it comes to taxation, it is a tax system 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.029
 Damage is expanding 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.029
 Other things are also likely 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.519
 this is 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.219
 But 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.090
 Figure 1
