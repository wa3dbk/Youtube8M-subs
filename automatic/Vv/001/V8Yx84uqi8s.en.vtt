00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.009
 here I come back hello today we talk about the bows then 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.070
 magazine asked some questions about 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.960
 agliardi who uses where they are k I also realized video 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.920
 loaded on the channel are a bit confusing to me is for me a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 difficult to find the information you are looking for 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.179
 because they are mixed in tutorials 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:25.399
 I personally situation strange people at the rims channel opel has created 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:30.130
 you will find me a little in difficulty in finding the information that pixie 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.859
 and therefore 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.010
 morocco the video game series 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.680
 I will try to concentrate on short video subjects 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.929
 with eyes title 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.530
 It is an exhaustive way that we are all simply saying information between us 

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:47.999
 I think an important topic will surely be the ancients 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:49.160
 use 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.290
 quagliarella and bead processing in particular with the technique 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.290
 so now let's see these years is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.590
 my experience on aladdin joy so I just tried it too 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.049
 just to keep vid anyway I worked 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.149
 and this brand age origins are the very subtle journeys made by that 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.730
 which I realized was working with hip beads 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.730
 and I make them buy them bought generally I bought them even before 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.680
 haberdashery 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 but tell me ciriè I ask amiga of the needles to thread the beads and lot 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.970
 every time they gave me 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 add this brand if later also found on the various sites I visit 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.490
 example, artesella 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.170
 there is in lane lanka 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.220
 hey hey exist in different sizes 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.410
 this package that the unit of yesterday but not printing 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.400
 with cn4 environment 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.609
 and the Hebrew dimensions from 10 to 13 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.829
 hey all hand height dimensions inside this package i 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.260
 I found 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.390
 suitable was the processing example with the dedications the peyote I had no problems with 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.400
 dimension 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.500
 maybe the only thing you love isohunt 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.790
 the bigger here was the sender I don't even remember the miserable anymore 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.370
 great it seemed to me to go out but I'm not sure punches maybe contrade on 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.660
 sites 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.949
 he who presents himself in this way 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.649
 like simple ania cushions 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.909
 with a very subtle thing ditto store uses so that the son on TV but count 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:16.429
 that 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.669
 you have to think of obviously thin nylon thread 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.939
 let's say measure 0 10 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.989
 even the smallest star finds the 0 25 thread that divides the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.599
 swaroski does not interfere inner weight tried and very special comfortline 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.219
 poppy will eventually break. 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.999
 for those who have abandoned clothing. at the beginning ampli because I didn't know of 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:41.239
 other solutions existed 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.099
 they are good I found myself well 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.149
 and the problem is asks 30 are barely visible 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.079
 so when working at peyote 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.559
 viscom sometimes need to come in with which job 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.819
 the bottle quite flexible 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.079
 damon a certain number of efforts naturally breaks and therefore we say 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.760
 away I broke with a certain one 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.519
 belief 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.790
 the cost I think of as haberdashery is a pack of 4 beyond the page around 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.839
 2 euros 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:13.099
 so let's say 40 cents I love 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.239
 no 50 cents per hand 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.320
 now though 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.740
 tomas you like technical solutions that tomorrow I think you the quality does not 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.720
 italia bet on the served tracks win for life are win 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.309
 probably of skin 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:27.130
 anyway 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.210
 in short, you can see these but I took them to Rome 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.919
 in a hahah shop that sold costume jewelery components he did the 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.099
 price is a little more than art 2 50 years 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.009
 and then our evenings this thing that the ramista measure 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.749
 environment usually I took aliens they had 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:49.100
 one measure seems to me the 11 was the one I find most easily 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.790
 many 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.399
 the instead m bricolart 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.580
 I discovered that there are others 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.209
 I wanted to test de-lovely of the year 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.509
 these are called bigai bt initial 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.889
 dam the will die that have one 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.279
 one with an enlarged lake and 5, 7 long 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.799
 centimeters and this 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.799
 shut up doing crap all wrong because it was used 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:13.880
 how do you see the eye 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.120
 it's very long part from here up here and comes up to below 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.780
 i feel all this space to be able to 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.690
 bites 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.770
 edeven 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.389
 from the end 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.830
 he is a unicorn 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.120
 for a stretch very well 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.240
 after that the eye begins the same thing on the other side we say 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.789
 so how did you start 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.300
 I love very comfortable 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.970
 because especially when you happen to be short the material files that 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.539
 almost finished work 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.909
 you can still continue in the key to understand more game with the files in 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:51.800
 how much the brunette is very London 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.930
 besides another sensational thing dreams of these years that are extremely 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.930
 flexible see 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.139
 I tell you which one to buy new 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.889
 and then keep the form certain to make time 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.190
 solicited Italy efforts that level are deformed 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.160
 but honestly for me it is not a problem because I usually take the 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.770
 my beautiful intent with flat tip 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.059
 I worked until I came back straight 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:24.889
 but I can also say that sincerely working with compost 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.379
 limb is not who it is 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.950
 you ask me too many times 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.370
 lake takes it, it forms my fingers because it bends well due to the fact 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.419
 of a fist therefore we say of assumes to almost a comfortable form 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:40.699
 this years 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.539
 enea of ​​b of the year 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.199
 I bought them on bricolart but I think there is befunky is to be cont 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.270
 and immediately the art of passamonti with euro each is expensive and true to be 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.480
 agree with you though 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.520
 It is also true that I can tell you that I love you 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.550
 my dear 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.430
 even a couple of months 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.260
 if I can treat it gently I am careful that above all I do not 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:02.960
 I lose 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.190
 or you made me do too demanding jobs here is absolutely lake 2 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.159
 mini 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:12.370
 it's money that I spend very willingly name 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.530
 they are worth it 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.199
 fake not only the b plana land produces these years 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.199
 but with a long skirt, for the time being, she can't tell me 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.680
 from which other cases of supplying you with chopped ithilia apply the best pieces 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.889
 this just didn't mean 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.439
 this bovisio a long five, seven centimeters mara woman dresses does it also 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.300
 longer 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.300
 about double 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.619
 quisisana about 10 centimeters 

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:38.569
 the coruna 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.249
 tecnocasa notice board 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:42.619
 you see 

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:44.939
 empty look the deep 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:48.409
 how soft they are I try to work 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.399
 to say to see 

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:55.589
 sincerely this acidity tail 10 centimeters and I do not recommend it very much 

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:59.919
 uncomfortable for the peyote dinner work on the parallel peyote or working track 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.740
 however workings of those of the propeller 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.650
 your proven malagoli on the cumbersome membership is absolutely bad 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.639
 nothing unwieldy so probably good for others we live 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.089
 Thank you maps which I am doing at the moment 

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:15.499
 winged lion 

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:20.330
 this year longer than having July 25 that of the mind if you take 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.180
 in the pack of 5 pieces saved a little 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:29.949
 seneweb look for these other sites that are foreigners and therefore a delegation 

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.990
 detail look for 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.779
 best tester is true 

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:35.949
 Videohifi 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:38.309
 i have bigger 

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:41.309
 lol limewire wrong this type of attack that is showing me 

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:45.029
 for now these are the trips I have purchased 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.860
 surely those of the biennial are those in which I found myself better 

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:53.379
 and those that keep using because 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.770
 in my opinion 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.409
 for now the best 

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:59.399
 if you were to buy agnini, you will make sabina soon
