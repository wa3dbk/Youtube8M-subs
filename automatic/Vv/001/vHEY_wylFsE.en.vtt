it<00:03:48.140> is<00:03:48.560> my<00:03:48.680> fault<00:03:48.739> that<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:49.280> am<00:03:49.700> out<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.060> position

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
it is my fault that I am out of position

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.360 
it is my fault that I am out of position
like<00:03:50.630> when<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.140> played<00:03:51.440> against<00:03:51.769> me<00:03:51.890> playground

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
like when I played against me playground

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.979 
like when I played against me playground
I<00:03:52.610> think<00:03:53.000> we<00:03:53.120> engaged<00:03:53.450> them<00:03:53.570> over<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.870> Wraiths

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
I think we engaged them over the Wraiths

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.080 
I think we engaged them over the Wraiths
wall<00:03:54.230> and<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:55.250> was<00:03:55.340> like<00:03:55.519> inside<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.940> Wraith

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
wall and I was like inside the Wraith

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.490 
wall and I was like inside the Wraith
bite<00:03:56.510> which<00:03:56.690> hole<00:03:56.810> going<00:03:57.019> as<00:03:57.200> soon<00:03:57.350> as<00:03:57.410> that

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
bite which hole going as soon as that

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.949 
bite which hole going as soon as that
fell<00:03:57.709> off<00:03:57.860> I<00:03:58.130> was<00:03:58.579> out<00:03:58.670> of<00:03:58.700> range<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.630> do<00:03:59.810> any

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
fell off I was out of range to do any

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.449 
fell off I was out of range to do any
damage<00:04:00.260> whatsoever<00:04:00.350> so<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.040> was<00:04:01.130> pretty<00:04:01.280> bad

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
damage whatsoever so it was pretty bad

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.430 
damage whatsoever so it was pretty bad
on<00:04:01.970> my<00:04:02.120> part<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.540> if<00:04:02.600> I<00:04:02.720> definitely<00:04:03.140> was<00:04:03.290> in

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
on my part and if I definitely was in

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.330 
on my part and if I definitely was in
the<00:04:03.500> right<00:04:03.590> position<00:04:03.709> then<00:04:04.040> we<00:04:04.130> could<00:04:04.310> have

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
the right position then we could have

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.400 
the right position then we could have

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
you seem like a little oh it's kind of

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.570 
you seem like a little oh it's kind of
hard<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.960> say<00:04:52.199> I<00:04:52.470> mean<00:04:54.050> you<00:04:55.050> have<00:04:55.139> to<00:04:55.229> have

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
hard to say I mean you have to have

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.900 
hard to say I mean you have to have
everyone<00:04:56.580> on<00:04:56.610> your<00:04:56.729> team<00:04:56.789> put<00:04:57.120> forth<00:04:57.389> effort

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
everyone on your team put forth effort

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.870 
everyone on your team put forth effort
to<00:04:59.910> make<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.180> work<00:05:00.330> out<00:05:00.479> that<00:05:00.810> way<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.949> right

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
to make it work out that way and right

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.300 
to make it work out that way and right
now<00:05:03.030> we<00:05:03.090> are<00:05:03.599> kind<00:05:04.380> of<00:05:04.530> at<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.650> disadvantage<00:05:04.740> was

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
now we are kind of at a disadvantage was

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.559 
now we are kind of at a disadvantage was
not<00:05:05.490> having<00:05:05.729> a<00:05:05.789> gaming<00:05:06.030> house<00:05:06.150> so<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.389> can't

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
not having a gaming house so you can't

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:07.909 
not having a gaming house so you can't
like<00:05:06.660> automatically<00:05:07.169> get<00:05:07.380> someone<00:05:07.620> up<00:05:07.740> and

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
like automatically get someone up and

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.560 
like automatically get someone up and
put<00:05:08.490> them<00:05:08.639> on<00:05:09.630> a<00:05:09.660> computer<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.169> start<00:05:10.349> playing

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
put them on a computer and start playing

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.640 
put them on a computer and start playing
but<00:05:12.570> I<00:05:13.099> think<00:05:14.960> not<00:05:15.960> everyone<00:05:16.320> has<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.620> same

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
but I think not everyone has the same

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.950 
but I think not everyone has the same
mentality<00:05:17.009> on<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.490> team<00:05:17.669> where<00:05:17.910> you<00:05:18.660> want<00:05:18.870> to

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
mentality on the team where you want to

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.200 
mentality on the team where you want to
win<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.590> want<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.860> win<00:05:20.009> if<00:05:20.460> he<00:05:20.970> does<00:05:21.120> he

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
win and you want to win if he does he

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.909 
win and you want to win if he does he
doesn't<00:05:21.419> care<00:05:21.570> if<00:05:21.630> you<00:05:21.690> look<00:05:21.870> bad<00:05:22.050> but

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
doesn't care if you look bad but

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.939 
doesn't care if you look bad but
sometimes<00:05:23.190> egos<00:05:23.940> matter<00:05:24.210> a<00:05:24.300> lot<00:05:24.539> or<00:05:24.780> you<00:05:25.770> put

sometimes egos matter a lot or you put

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:31.100 
sometimes egos matter a lot or you put
the<00:05:26.039> blame<00:05:26.190> on<00:05:26.250> other<00:05:26.520> people<00:05:26.849> so<00:05:29.870> don't<00:05:30.870> want

trying to explain mistakes and deflect
blame<00:06:04.500> and<00:06:04.830> stuff<00:06:04.979> like<00:06:05.070> that<00:06:05.310> you<00:06:05.460> know

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
blame and stuff like that you know

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.629 
blame and stuff like that you know
that's<00:06:06.539> just<00:06:06.750> a<00:06:06.930> natural<00:06:07.800> reaction<00:06:08.159> but<00:06:08.580> I

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
that's just a natural reaction but I

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.860 
that's just a natural reaction but I
