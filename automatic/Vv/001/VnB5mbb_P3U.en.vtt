00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.730
 Yes, it looks like it was 10 o'clock in the last time you can see the top, but it looks like this if you look at the side 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.170
 It becomes 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.960
 here 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.680

 Joue-yan 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.990
 How about that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:26.080
 There are a lot of things to turn 180 degrees 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:34.720
 In how to make the current form it is also how to turn the same now 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:38.750
 Here 180 degrees from 180 degrees of Te guy on Cocos wintering first one 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:43.610

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.630
 I will focus on the scope 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.980

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:21.269
 Well, that person is okay 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:27.180
 Yeah I I mean common is the easy-to-remember the color of the time that this align 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:29.110
 How Well how well That's right kana simple and focus it in color but 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.960
 I No do remember 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:38.680
 This the first time when you turn this time of the 180-degree number also is aligned here 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.920
 I 'll see you next time but I'll meet you once 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.330

 Next time is now and now 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.659
 I think that these four things can be done already 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.900
 The remaining three are three 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.520
 When 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.950
 from now on 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.970
 Wonder 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.819
