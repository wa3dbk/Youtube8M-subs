00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
here I have inserting fybel of ink I am

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.300 
here I have inserting fybel of ink I am
using<00:01:31.420> different<00:01:32.049> holes<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.680> insert<00:01:33.070> this

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
using different holes to insert this

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.639
