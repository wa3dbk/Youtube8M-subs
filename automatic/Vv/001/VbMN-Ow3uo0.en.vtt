00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello welcome to the channel of the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.740
 crafts in this video I want 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.820
 teach you how to be a very 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:18.150
 easy very decorative and all with material 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:26.720
 recycled let's use the ring of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.720
 a bicycle black paint and a plier 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.710
 a brush recycled caps of different 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.710
 colors 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.620
 a cable of this size some more 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.980
 tiny little many two small caps 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.040
 recycled plastic and some tweezers and a 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.790
 rod to make hollow first thing 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:54.780
 what we are going to do is paint the rhythm with 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.780
 this black paint precisely the rays 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.410
 by e 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:15.040
 and once it's dry we 're going to proceed 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.290
 decorate it with the covers 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.700
 we take a lid we bend it a little with 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.190
 the alicante we will go squeezing 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:30.610
 over lightning in this way let's go 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:32.590
 mixing the colors we fold the lid 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.490
 we put it on top of the beam and let's go 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:42.400
 squeezing up to the termination 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:46.350
 will go 7 caps for each ray and 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.350
 well let's do with everyone else 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.330
 in this case 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.930
 I'm almost finishing everything 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.930
 I would only miss 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.649
 this here 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.720
 this here I would miss we are going to continue the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:19.349
 same procedure we will put a cap 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:25.379
 then the second one over here 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:27.270
 I would say a third and a fourth of this 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.500
 side 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.500
 a fifth here 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:46.799
 the sixth we will place it here and then 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.879
 let's run the caps up 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:54.989
 giving a space here below to place 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:59.210
 the seventh you and this way we have 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:02.390
 finished looks very good 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.480
 and it is very colorful and then with the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.310
 pieces of cable the cortitos we are going to 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.450
 go doing some hooks we're going to 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.490
 go tightening by tying them to the ray of 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.480
 ring 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.160
 and then we take a clamp and we're going to 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.680
 put here on this hook for the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.540
 hole that has the clamp with the 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.390
 pliers let's tighten this way and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.920
 well let's do with all the rest 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.920
 tweezers that we are going to place 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.250
 when 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:51.640
 in this case I have placed some 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:54.010
 I'm going to leave like this and then here with the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.400
 hot rod I will open two holes to 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.799
 the covers and then with the longer cable 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.629
 we bend it like this we 're going to go through 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.760
 tips of that cable through the two holes 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.700
 of a lid leaving a ring is here 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.200
 above we pass the cable through the hole 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.540
 bicycle ring 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.510
 we turn around and then we'll put the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:19.549
 another tapita we passed the cables we are going to 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:23.650
 trim the excess we put together these two 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:27.020
 tips and with the pliers we are going to press 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.060
 very well we turn around 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.660
 and then what we're going to do is pass 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:37.440
 the tweezers down 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.440
 we are all going to use it down 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.470
 thus 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.460
 and as you can see this would be the pendant 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.600
 so we stay there and finally 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.860
 work we can use it to hang 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.420
 any item of clothing 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.210
