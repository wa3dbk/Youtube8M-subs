00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
really excellent job of recreating a lot

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.990 
really excellent job of recreating a lot
of<00:05:34.870> the<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.470> famous<00:05:35.919> scenes<00:05:36.220> from<00:05:36.610> throughout

the series in closing dragon ball z
budokai<00:05:40.810> is<00:05:41.470> it's<00:05:42.430> not<00:05:42.669> really<00:05:43.180> a<00:05:43.860> super

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
budokai is it's not really a super

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.219 
budokai is it's not really a super
compelling<00:05:45.250> fighting<00:05:45.820> game<00:05:45.970> judged<00:05:46.900> as

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
compelling fighting game judged as

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.189 
compelling fighting game judged as
justified<00:05:47.889> in<00:05:48.009> a<00:05:48.039> game<00:05:48.220> it's<00:05:49.090> yeah<00:05:49.630> it's<00:05:49.870> it's

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
justified in a game it's yeah it's it's

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.650 
justified in a game it's yeah it's it's
not<00:05:50.440> that<00:05:50.800> great<00:05:50.849> most<00:05:51.849> players<00:05:52.090> would

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
not that great most players would

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.540 
not that great most players would
probably<00:05:53.020> be<00:05:53.229> better<00:05:53.380> off<00:05:53.470> going<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:54.009> a<00:05:54.160> more

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
probably be better off going to a more

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.810 
probably be better off going to a more
established<00:05:54.759> in<00:05:55.240> deeper<00:05:55.570> series<00:05:56.039> but<00:05:57.039> that's

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
established in deeper series but that's

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.310 
established in deeper series but that's
really<00:05:58.000> not<00:05:58.120> what<00:05:58.270> dragon<00:05:58.599> ball<00:05:58.720> z<00:05:58.900> budokai<00:05:59.020> is
