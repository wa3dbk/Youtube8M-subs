00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.710 

for<00:00:01.290> that<00:00:01.439> once<00:00:01.740> course<00:00:02.129> you<00:00:03.090> have<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.510> turn

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
for that once course you have to turn

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.070 
for that once course you have to turn
your<00:00:03.899> bike<00:00:04.110> in<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.410> very<00:00:04.589> tight<00:00:04.890> spot<00:00:06.020> you're<00:00:07.020> in

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
your bike in a very tight spot you're in

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.530 
your bike in a very tight spot you're in
a<00:00:07.170> valley

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.900 

that's<00:00:09.750> why<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.960> few<00:00:10.320> meters<00:00:10.620> wide<00:00:10.910> it's

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
that's why the few meters wide it's

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.930 
that's why the few meters wide it's
quite<00:00:12.090> difficult<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:13.250> turn<00:00:14.250> around<00:00:14.430> your<00:00:14.790> bike

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
quite difficult to turn around your bike

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.440 
quite difficult to turn around your bike
because<00:00:15.690> once<00:00:16.439> you<00:00:16.650> go<00:00:17.550> sideways<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.300> to

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
because once you go sideways you have to

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.339 
because once you go sideways you have to
go<00:00:18.599> up<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.900> hill<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.580> then<00:00:20.580> if<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.330> go<00:00:21.509> Rhea

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
go up the hill and then if you go Rhea

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.589 
go up the hill and then if you go Rhea
what<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.009> get<00:00:23.730> up<00:00:23.939> there<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.450> the

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
what you have to get up there on the

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.810 
what you have to get up there on the
other<00:00:24.660> side<00:00:24.869> huh<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.980> very<00:00:26.220> difficult<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
other side huh it's very difficult to

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.800 
other side huh it's very difficult to
turn<00:00:27.259> but<00:00:28.259> sometimes<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:30.000> see<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.239> have<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
turn but sometimes you see I have to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.299 
turn but sometimes you see I have to
turn<00:00:31.020> around<00:00:31.169> because<00:00:31.410> I'm<00:00:31.800> not<00:00:31.950> getting

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
turn around because I'm not getting

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.250 
turn around because I'm not getting
anywhere<00:00:32.669> here<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.480> then<00:00:33.989> there's<00:00:34.200> another

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
anywhere here and then there's another

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.700 
anywhere here and then there's another
technique<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.430> show<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:36.290> you<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.320> you

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
technique I can show you if you like you

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.850 
technique I can show you if you like you
can<00:00:37.860> try<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.610> little<00:00:38.850> bit<00:00:39.860> more

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
can try but it's a little bit more

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.460 
can try but it's a little bit more
advanced<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.520> maybe<00:00:41.870> becoming<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.170> next

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
advanced and maybe becoming the next

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.160 
advanced and maybe becoming the next
week<00:00:43.650> course<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.970> can<00:00:45.180> train<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.990> work

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
week course we can train in we can work

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
week course we can train in we can work
on<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.740> what<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.240> I<00:00:48.360> show<00:00:48.540> you

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
on this and what you get but I show you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.980 
on this and what you get but I show you
anyhow

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:15.110

I<00:01:15.530> am<00:01:16.530> coming<00:01:16.860> down<00:01:17.190> very<00:01:17.520> tight<00:01:18.120> Kenyan<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
I am coming down very tight Kenyan a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.400 
I am coming down very tight Kenyan a
minute<00:01:19.410> Bo<00:01:19.620> there's<00:01:20.270> some<00:01:21.270> big<00:01:21.480> steps<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.270 

very<00:01:28.410> easy<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.010> a<00:01:29.310> very<00:01:29.820> difficult<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:31.280> turn

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
very easy to a very difficult to turn

the pike in this way in the tile to push
it<00:01:36.360> back<00:01:36.510> and<00:01:36.690> forth<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.890> pushing<00:01:38.490> up

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it back and forth because pushing up

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.350 
it back and forth because pushing up

quite visitors at this time anticipation
you<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.840> use<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:47.640> technique<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.300> show<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.870> now

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
you can use the technique I show you now

00:01:49.370 --> 00:02:01.070 
you can use the technique I show you now
which<00:01:50.370> is<00:01:51.080> use<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.110> engine<00:01:52.590> power

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:12.800 

this'll<00:02:02.080> be<00:02:02.170> cool

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:23.180 

tonight

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:33.470 

oh<00:02:23.390> yeah<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:27.260> want<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.120> very<00:02:33.150> short

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
oh yeah I want that in a very short

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.130 
oh yeah I want that in a very short
distance<00:02:33.900> without<00:02:34.410> using<00:02:35.040> too<00:02:35.340> much<00:02:35.490> power<00:02:36.140> of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
distance without using too much power of

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.310 
distance without using too much power of
course<00:02:37.440> holding<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.100> bike<00:02:38.310> sideways<00:02:39.320> is

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
course holding the bike sideways is

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.340 
course holding the bike sideways is
heavy<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:41.390> people<00:02:42.390> who<00:02:42.540> need<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> lot<00:02:42.960> of<00:02:42.990> power

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
heavy and people who need a lot of power

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.830 
heavy and people who need a lot of power
yeah<00:02:44.330> but<00:02:46.310> sometimes<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.490> much<00:02:47.700> more<00:02:48.180> player

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
yeah but sometimes it's much more player

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.930 
yeah but sometimes it's much more player
this<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.590> similar<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.070> what<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.580> do<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:50.910> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
this is similar to what you do on a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.270 
this is similar to what you do on a
smaller<00:02:51.300> bike<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.960> offer<00:02:52.200> them<00:02:52.710> stick<00:02:53.100> your

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
smaller bike and offer them stick your

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.700 
smaller bike and offer them stick your
leg<00:02:53.430> out<00:02:53.640> yes<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.210> then<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
leg out yes and then you this is the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.340 
leg out yes and then you this is the
next<00:02:55.830> step<00:02:56.220> similar<00:02:57.210> but<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.600> put<00:02:58.020> your<00:02:58.200> whole

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
next step similar but you put your whole

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.220 
next step similar but you put your whole
body<00:02:58.620> because<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.220> weight<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.640> bike

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
body because of the weight of the bike

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.260 
body because of the weight of the bike
you<00:03:01.230> also<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.710> do<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:01.980> with<00:03:02.160> sitting<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
you also can do it with sitting on the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.240 
you also can do it with sitting on the
bikes<00:03:04.100> but<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.580> difficulty<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.380> palace<00:03:07.380> yeah

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
bikes but the difficulty is palace yeah

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.480 
bikes but the difficulty is palace yeah
you<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:09.240> one<00:03:09.420> pivot<00:03:09.780> point<00:03:10.080> yes

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
you have to have one pivot point yes

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.000 
you have to have one pivot point yes
this<00:03:11.900> because<00:03:12.900> if<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.200> make<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.560> run<00:03:13.980> to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
this because if you make the run to

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.160 
this because if you make the run to
right<00:03:15.290> then<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.410> start<00:03:16.940> over<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.690> once<00:03:18.990> you

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
right then you start over and once you

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.920 
right then you start over and once you
have<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.560> step<00:03:19.830> with<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.520> heavy<00:03:20.790> bike<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
have to step with the heavy bike the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.890 
have to step with the heavy bike the
favor<00:03:22.170> different<00:03:22.380> critical<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.570> regain<00:03:24.570> again

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
favor different critical to regain again

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.610 
favor different critical to regain again
you<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.710> get<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.220> bike<00:03:26.430> stable<00:03:27.440> easier<00:03:28.440> with<00:03:28.590> a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
you to get the bike stable easier with a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.340 
you to get the bike stable easier with a
smaller<00:03:29.010> bike<00:03:29.280> because<00:03:29.550> you<00:03:29.880> can<00:03:30.060> drop<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:30.360> so

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
smaller bike because you can drop it so

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.510 
smaller bike because you can drop it so
then<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.739> can<00:03:31.950> communicate<00:03:32.810> week<00:03:33.810> yeah<00:03:34.080> right

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.280 

it's<00:03:38.520> not<00:03:39.230> big<00:03:40.230> magic<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:41.790> only<00:03:42.030> thing<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
it's not big magic the only thing is the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.539 
it's not big magic the only thing is the
more<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.680> unify<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.840> easier<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:47.430> go<00:03:47.610> sideways

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
more you unify the easier to go sideways

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.360 
more you unify the easier to go sideways
because<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.700> have<00:03:50.849> less<00:03:51.200> side<00:03:52.200> forces<00:03:52.560> which

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
because you have less side forces which
