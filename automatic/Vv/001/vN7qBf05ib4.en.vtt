00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
I'm running with some subscribers and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
I'm running with some subscribers and
they<00:01:41.340> proved<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.729> me<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:43.860> don't<00:01:44.820> need<00:01:45.149> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
they proved to me that I don't need to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.539 
they proved to me that I don't need to
go<00:01:45.390> after<00:01:45.570> Flagg's<00:01:45.950> they<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.130> hold<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> room

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
go after Flagg's they can hold the room

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.940 
go after Flagg's they can hold the room
so<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.210> me<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.780> cut<00:01:49.140> off<00:01:49.290> flanks<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
so it's up to me to cut off flanks and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.460 
so it's up to me to cut off flanks and
what<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> saw<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.479> start<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.840> match<00:01:52.079> was

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
what I saw on the start of the match was

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.679 
what I saw on the start of the match was
they<00:01:53.040> all<00:01:53.220> pushed<00:01:53.549> forward<00:01:53.970> underneath<00:01:54.420> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
they all pushed forward underneath and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.649 
they all pushed forward underneath and
on<00:01:55.200> top<00:01:55.500> into<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> towards<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.149> enemy<00:01:57.390> spawn

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
on top into the towards the enemy spawn

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.240 
on top into the towards the enemy spawn
like<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> point<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.710> spawn<00:01:58.950> trap

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
like right to the point of a spawn trap

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.340 
like right to the point of a spawn trap
that<00:01:59.490> lets<00:02:00.360> me<00:02:00.479> know<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.079> eventually

areas<00:06:53.370> a<00:06:53.750> perfect<00:06:54.750> example<00:06:54.870> of<00:06:55.289> this<00:06:55.440> is<00:06:55.680> on

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
areas a perfect example of this is on

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.640 
areas a perfect example of this is on
grid<00:06:56.520> where<00:06:57.360> if<00:06:57.719> they're<00:06:58.080> they<00:06:58.379> have<00:06:58.529> the<00:06:58.620> a
