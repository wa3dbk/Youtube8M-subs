 no draw video or anything was just 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.100
 a little introduction for some 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.930
 to explain what we will 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.879
 talk today that basically it's from the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.010
 people who invent sweepstakes in their 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.740
 channels but then do not draw anything 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.750
 for example I have raffled all 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.420
 hydroxides premium accounts you minecraft 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.340
 and I've raffled one I did it in a 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.630
 video and the other I did it for fried and 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.070
 Well the truth is that I do 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.180
 thanks this pull &amp; bear and all that for 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.650
 I told you that before , because 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.780
 it's really good to win 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.060
 awards and that but good what you want 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.500
 say there are a lot of people that instead of 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.750
 doing it really the only thing he does is 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.700
 because subscribing to the channel give the eep 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.560
 I do not know what and after the draw I do not know 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.360
 they do if they do not delete that video they already have 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.580
 the subscribers the likes give equal 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.350
 but has already won a certain amount of 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.610
 subscribers that is doing well and 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.229
 basically this is a table has the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.000
 rage because if you really want to do 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.830
 a raffle do it for real and will raffle 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.450
 that you want to draw because people 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.410
 that is participating so that 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.030
 because they have a minimum or large interest 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.580
 or whatever you want to call it has an interest 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.679
 that goes although it is very small but 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.550
 they want to get it if you saying 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.470
 is to do 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.860
 that even if they are going to win, they do not take 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.920
 nothing basically people what they do is 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.510
 since said said that I before 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.400
 for good because of course before doing 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.369
 every video I form I've put in 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.200
 internet raffles I have not put forgive 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.780
 if it is an argument the mobile with 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.460
 raffles and what else came out makes a 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.160
 lots of videos that have followed the 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.810
 between today and yesterday and all the raffle 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.030

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.460
 one playstation 4 another movie 64 other 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.620
 playstation 4 that's why the title is 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.000
 today , he raffles a prison 4 because 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.950
 the type be because there are a lot of 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.500
 videos that play playstation 4 you 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.180

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.650
 I tell you that someone who starts in a 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.960
 channel has not won any money or anything 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.240
 to get it I do not think it's going to 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.460
 raffle any play to an account 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.380
 minecraft can be but a prison 4 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.510

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.950
 and good guys it was only to do this 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.720
 video that you are very careful with that 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.890
 of the draws and that because good is not 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.630
