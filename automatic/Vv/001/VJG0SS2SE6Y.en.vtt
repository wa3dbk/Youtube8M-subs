00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.420
 Sony plans to release in April (2011) 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.689
 3D shooting with full high definition 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.450
 Announced 3D Handycam "HDR-TD10" 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.610
 3D Handycam 29.8 mm Wide Angle 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.619
 Two eyes of Sony "G lens" 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.320
 Backside illumination type CMOS sensor 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.100
 2 pieces of Exmor R 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.600
 Proprietary high-speed image processing engine 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.090
 By installing two "BIONZ" (Bionz) 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.840
 Both right-eye and left-eye images 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.020
 We can record full high-definition picture 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.550
 3D movie or 3D game 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.620
 Such content is also rich 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.090
 From now on, 3D personal content 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.100
 Enhance your 3D Handycam with a TV 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.720
 I want to expand the world of 3D 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.760
 It is a product of such enthusiasm 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.579
 A preview of the shot image 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.570
 With 3.5 type liquid crystal for naked eye 3D 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.250
 You can watch in 3D state 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.720
 3D video signal transfer method at the time of HDMI connection 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.690
 Adopted “frame packing” method 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.290
 Both right eye and left eye images 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.450
 Two 1920x1080 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.799
 Because we can send full high-definition signals 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.380
 Images for the right and left eyes 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.520
 Send compressed to one screen 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.300
 Compared to the "side by side" method 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.119
 You can watch high-quality 3D images 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.900
 For example, a grandchild was born 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.920
 Grandpa and grandmother 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.619
 Father and mother who children were born 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.220
 After that I like to shoot landscapes 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.409
 With traditional Handycam users 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.970
 I think that there is no major change 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.590
 What is good about shooting in 3D? 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.039
 Just personal content 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.900
 I think that is the case 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.960
 Memory revives 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.400
 The emotions I experienced at that time 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.119
 Something like joy at that time 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.250
 Revive by watching 3D images 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.820
 This is personal content 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.979
 I think it is a thing 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.320
 The color is a silver color 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.230
 The estimated market price is around 150,000 yen
