some<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> pro<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.199> comes<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> set<00:01:02.340> of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
some of the pro it comes with a set of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.000 
some of the pro it comes with a set of
standard<00:01:02.910> commands<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.409> these<00:01:04.530> commands

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
standard commands one of these commands

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
standard commands one of these commands
are<00:01:05.189> called<00:01:05.430> tunnel<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.900> accepts<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:08.159> variable

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
are called tunnel it accepts a variable

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.440 
are called tunnel it accepts a variable
called<00:01:09.330> length<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:11.010> tell<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
called length so you can tell that the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.060 
called length so you can tell that the
turtle<00:01:12.869> how<00:01:13.020> long<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.890> want<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.659> tunnel<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.840> be

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
turtle how long you want a tunnel to be

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.170 
turtle how long you want a tunnel to be
this<00:01:17.070> tunnel<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> 3x2<00:01:18.840> tunnel<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.759> standard

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
this tunnel is a 3x2 tunnel the standard

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570 
this tunnel is a 3x2 tunnel the standard
program<00:01:21.600> does<00:01:21.810> not<00:01:21.840> place<00:01:22.710> torches<00:01:23.130> which

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
program does not place torches which

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.090 
program does not place torches which
could<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.119> unpleasant<00:01:24.720> experience

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
could be an unpleasant experience

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.090 
could be an unpleasant experience
because<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.960> often<00:01:28.070> have<00:01:29.070> mobs<00:01:30.060> spawning<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
because you often have mobs spawning and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.649 
because you often have mobs spawning and
one<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.220> those<00:01:32.369> could<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.880> creeper<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.479> could

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
one of those could be a creeper it could

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.240 
one of those could be a creeper it could
blow<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.380> diamonds<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:35.009> your

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
blow up all your diamonds all your

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.780 
blow up all your diamonds all your
valuables<00:01:35.759> everything<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:37.979> did<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.549> I

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
valuables everything so what I did is I

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.060 
valuables everything so what I did is I
went<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.930> change<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.439> code<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.890> this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
went in and I change the code of this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
went in and I change the code of this
program<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.090> actually<00:01:42.210> called<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.079> whole<00:01:43.350> new

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
program I actually called it a whole new

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.770 
program I actually called it a whole new
command<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.670> both<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.420> old

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
command so you can have both the old

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.649 
command so you can have both the old
tunnel<00:01:46.320> program<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.549> new<00:01:47.759> one<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.149> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
tunnel program and the new one that I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.800 
tunnel program and the new one that I
modified<00:01:49.909> basically<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.090> new<00:01:51.240> one<00:01:51.479> makes

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
modified basically the new one makes

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.380 
modified basically the new one makes
sure<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.380> place<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> block<00:01:53.009> beneath<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.970> turtle

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
sure to place a block beneath the turtle

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.020 
sure to place a block beneath the turtle
so<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.170> runs<00:01:55.350> into<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.740> ravine<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.640> pool<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
so if it runs into a ravine or a pool of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.039 
so if it runs into a ravine or a pool of
lava<00:01:57.299> or<00:01:57.810> water<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:59.189> generate<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.180> path

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
lava or water it will generate a path

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.109 
lava or water it will generate a path
that<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.829> follow<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.939> don't

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that you can follow it on so you don't

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.459 
that you can follow it on so you don't
have<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.450> make<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> British<00:02:03.960> yourself

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
have to make the British yourself

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.980 
have to make the British yourself
secondly<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.729> places<00:02:06.149> torches<00:02:06.540> every<00:02:06.810> eight

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
secondly it places torches every eight

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.900 
secondly it places torches every eight
blocks<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.500> ensure<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.860> mobs<00:02:08.250> won't<00:02:08.610> spawn

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
blocks to ensure that mobs won't spawn

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.270 
blocks to ensure that mobs won't spawn
in<00:02:09.179> your<00:02:09.479> tunnels<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.619> very<00:02:10.830> efficient

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
in your tunnels this is very efficient

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.700 
in your tunnels this is very efficient
especially<00:02:11.430> if<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.060> want<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.330> make

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
especially if you want to make

gonna be putting coal in the first slot

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.160 
gonna be putting coal in the first slot
torches<00:02:48.710> in<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.220> last<00:02:49.460> slot<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.170> cobblestone

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
in the second to last slot important the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.780 
in the second to last slot important the
standard<00:02:56.090> programs<00:02:56.480> looks<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:57.110> all<00:02:57.470> grits<00:02:58.160> or

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.560 
efficient if it's in the first one
secondly<00:03:03.920> it's<00:03:04.280> important<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:04.880> torches<00:03:05.390> are

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
secondly it's important that torches are

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.930 
secondly it's important that torches are
in<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.780> last<00:03:05.960> slot<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:07.190> whatever<00:03:07.550> block
