00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.779 
nice tactic that I'd like to share here
and<00:05:12.380> it<00:05:12.889> went<00:05:13.070> like<00:05:13.250> this<00:05:14.080> King<00:05:15.080> f8<00:05:15.380> in<00:05:16.250> order

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
and it went like this King f8 in order

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.990 
and it went like this King f8 in order
to<00:05:16.880> get<00:05:17.060> out<00:05:17.210> of<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.539> night<00:05:17.960> check

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
to get out of the night check

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.180 
to get out of the night check
discovering<00:05:20.000> an<00:05:20.210> attack<00:05:20.960> on<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.229> rook<00:05:21.440> after

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
discovering an attack on the rook after

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.710 
discovering an attack on the rook after
King<00:05:22.430> f8<00:05:23.440> F<00:05:24.440> for<00:05:24.830> this<00:05:25.610> move<00:05:25.880> prepares<00:05:26.419> to

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
King f8 F for this move prepares to

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.900 
King f8 F for this move prepares to
develop<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.830> King<00:05:28.070> because<00:05:28.430> in<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.639> endgame

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
develop the King because in the endgame

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.390 
develop the King because in the endgame
your<00:05:29.599> King<00:05:29.930> becomes<00:05:30.380> more<00:05:30.620> powerful<00:05:30.889> and<00:05:31.310> you

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
your King becomes more powerful and you

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.760 
your King becomes more powerful and you
should<00:05:31.580> look<00:05:31.789> to<00:05:31.970> use<00:05:32.150> them<00:05:32.450> use<00:05:32.960> him<00:05:33.169> in<00:05:33.320> the

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
should look to use them use him in the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.110 
should look to use them use him in the
middle<00:05:34.039> game<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.460> so<00:05:34.610> on<00:05:34.760> he's<00:05:34.940> very

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
middle game and so on he's very

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.029 
middle game and so on he's very
vulnerable<00:05:35.360> but<00:05:35.840> as<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.080> endgame<00:05:36.410> approaches

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
vulnerable but as the endgame approaches

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.310 
vulnerable but as the endgame approaches
look<00:05:37.970> to<00:05:38.150> use<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.510> king<00:05:39.700> knight<00:05:40.700> c6<00:05:41.320> attacking

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
look to use the king knight c6 attacking

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.540 
look to use the king knight c6 attacking
the<00:05:42.530> rook<00:05:42.729> rook<00:05:43.729> d3<00:05:44.440> my<00:05:45.440> opponent<00:05:45.860> decided

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
the rook rook d3 my opponent decided

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.339 
the rook rook d3 my opponent decided
that<00:05:46.669> if<00:05:46.820> he<00:05:46.849> waited<00:05:47.270> too<00:05:47.450> long<00:05:47.660> I<00:05:47.960> was<00:05:48.199> just

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
that if he waited too long I was just

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.920 
that if he waited too long I was just
going<00:05:48.530> to<00:05:48.590> win<00:05:48.860> being<00:05:49.310> ahead<00:05:49.460> and<00:05:49.760> force<00:05:50.030> so<00:05:50.810> he

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
going to win being ahead and force so he

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.400 
going to win being ahead and force so he
forced<00:05:51.260> the<00:05:51.440> situation<00:05:52.039> he<00:05:52.190> played<00:05:52.400> 97

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
forced the situation he played 97

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.620 
forced the situation he played 97
