 good device good I'm acquired in 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.400
 third cost me a little bit expensive 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.529
 good depending because it's also the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.689
 most expensive company in Mexico is owner 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.789
 daddy slim and good you already knew that it is 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.080
 a bit expensive but not in what 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.140
 we are in question the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.850
 high- end device that good says 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.760
 that out of the motorola company 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.800
 I make very good steps sincerely 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.850
 It leaves a good taste in my mouth so 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.370
 let's proceed to do the unboxing 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.660
 let's remove this thing here 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.360
 automatically when we open the box 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.700
 it goes on they're watching it feels 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.390
 perfectly well it's because it includes a 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.250
 small plugin or good is a small 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.809
 function that is that when you take out 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.550
 of the bag automatically turns on 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.770
 and it has a good system notifications 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.079
 great let's say the device you 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.070
 let's give a little more of it 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.019
 well what we found was to do 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.070
 a small box or will pull by 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.140
 here we will find a small 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.180
 small envelope where they would include what 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.820
 which would be the quick start manuals 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.600
 that we found motorola insurance 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.030
 intelligent protected motorcycle x knows us 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.560
 we began forgiveness that typical not the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.970
 small manuals that good is appreciated 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.070
 come here in this little envelope 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.150
 with the motorola logo, something else 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.130
 we found around here would be the 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.530
 hearing aids that are not of the best quality 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.840
 that are not insider hearing aids or how they 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.340
 know is a hearing aid without flowers but 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.810
 good you have small pads and 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.240
 leathers and since you feel sorry a little 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.210
 in what would be otherwise not on the part of 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.759
 here since 3.5 mm gold plated 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.680
 very well from motorola and 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.330
 we take care here what would be two small 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.430
 more pads if nothing arrives 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.200
 break these that bags are fabric the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.330
 typical of cloth are typical that 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.979
 break also and a small mini success 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.810
 what would it be to put on the shirts and 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.310
 the shirts are we want to make 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.289
 the strong support and we can put it there 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.700
 we would also find the connector 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.409
 usb micro usb 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.549
 it's pretty good that I feel I 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.350
 that are eating a bit of the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.899
 accessories because only because it is 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.330
 White know how they get but not 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.800
 so it's pretty pretty good looking 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.209
 also here we will find what 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.190
 I would be the connector that I liked a lot 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.599
 that we have two ports to load by 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.150
 the truth that I liked a lot because 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.580
 we have first what would be a connector 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.830
 for the motogp let's say and the moto x are 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.680
 two then now we would make energy and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.269
 so that is a little better what 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.819
 would be the food and others 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.890
 honestly quite small very good 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.290
 paint the motorola logo around here 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.700
 last we found this little thing that 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.819
 I do not know if I'm going to be able to grill it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.769
 that in the minilla visit to get what 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.239
 that would be the nano without that is phone 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.720
 includes nanothin here we would find 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.250
 this thing here and well let's send 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.140
 all this to hell and let's see what 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.030
 that it would be a bit in the bowels the 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.500
 device good guys that's the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.630
 device how can I invest a 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.549
 paints surpassed big mind to what 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.060
 it would be the nexus range good by default 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.220
 it came with android 4.2.2 already living and I 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.690
 the recently updated to 4.4 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.220
 also after some little things to 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.280
 that can see the speed of the system 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.660
 this pretty 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.700
 in settings for you to see 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.770
 stay I'm lying I bought it with 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.360
 I already said with trans and he is coming 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.010
 defect the android kitkat update 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.630
 without any junk and nothing of 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.640
 broadway without anything of blowjobs score is 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.260
 supremely great as you can see by 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.430
 here we could not what would be the egg 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.930
 of easter ideas tÃ©rek very good and 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.560
 pretty light I thought I weighed 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.290
 much more because I know it's a phone 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.180
 stable good is not a tablet nor is it a 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.940
 small phone but it has very good 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.160
 grip of the hand is plastic the part 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.340
 from the back back the five completely 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.769
 motorola camera after flash buttons 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.170
 of raising and lowering volume and the button 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.190
 typical to block unlock 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.459
 we will find out there will be one for 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.319
 nano sim and the 3.5 mm jack and 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.390
 of course also the connector 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.769
 microusb so I hope you like it 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.050
 very much this device that 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.000
 I honestly think that it is a very 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.100
 Good option on the part of Motorola in 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.209
 moto x and moto gp honestly very good 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.340
 since they include native android 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.690
 assured updates and the best is 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.700
 which has a very good price ratio 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.019
 so I think it's basically everything 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.090
 this chaos that has taken the same in that 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:19.060
 a good like we thank the community 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.160
