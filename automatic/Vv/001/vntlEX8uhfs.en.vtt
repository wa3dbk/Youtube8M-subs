00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
this slider will track with the slider

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.030 
this slider will track with the slider
which<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.660> most<00:03:10.960> instances<00:03:11.470> is<00:03:11.800> very

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
which in most instances is very

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.640 
which in most instances is very
important<00:03:12.640> because<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.480> want<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.140> see

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
important because you want to see

exactly what you're getting so you want
it<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:18.010> track<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:18.880> if<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.090> turn<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.600> light

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
it to track so if you turn the light

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.560 
it to track so if you turn the light
down<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:21.100> have<00:03:21.310> two<00:03:21.520> lights<00:03:21.790> set<00:03:22.120> up<00:03:22.330> if

you turn one light down you want that to

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.930 
you turn one light down you want that to
show<00:03:25.180> on<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.480> person's<00:03:25.900> face<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.370> you

with the modeling light powered all the
way<00:03:35.110> up<00:03:35.290> then<00:03:36.100> when<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:37.030> make<00:03:37.180> adjustments

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
way up then when you make adjustments

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.720 
way up then when you make adjustments
you<00:03:38.200> won't<00:03:38.410> be<00:03:38.530> able<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.800> see<00:03:39.070> what's<00:03:39.340> going<00:03:39.610> on

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730

with the lights and shadows so that's a

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.960 
with the lights and shadows so that's a
that's<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.750> tracking<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.620> generally<00:03:45.610> like<00:03:45.820> I

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
that's the tracking and generally like I

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.580 
that's the tracking and generally like I
said<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.209> want<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.570> keep<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:47.170> want<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.440> keep

said I want to keep that I want to keep

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.340 
said I want to keep that I want to keep
that<00:03:47.740> on<00:03:47.980> so<00:03:48.340> that<00:03:48.490> it<00:03:48.610> tracks<00:03:49.230> then<00:03:50.230> you've

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
that on so that it tracks then you've

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.760 
that on so that it tracks then you've
got<00:03:50.560> cycle<00:03:51.220> now<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.480> cycle<00:03:53.020> will<00:03:53.320> whenever

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
got cycle now the cycle will whenever

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.410 
got cycle now the cycle will whenever
you<00:03:54.130> go<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.870> take<00:03:56.350> a<00:03:56.410> picture<00:03:56.860> or<00:03:57.790> fire<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
you go to to take a picture or fire the

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.630 
you go to to take a picture or fire the
strobe<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.560> cycle<00:04:00.160> will<00:04:00.959> actually<00:04:02.400> cycle<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
strobe the cycle will actually cycle the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.090 
strobe the cycle will actually cycle the
light<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.300> model<00:04:04.720> light<00:04:04.900> off<00:04:05.140> after<00:04:06.010> the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
light the model light off after the

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.660 
light the model light off after the
picture<00:04:06.480> okay<00:04:07.480> which<00:04:07.780> comes<00:04:08.410> in<00:04:08.560> handy

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
picture okay which comes in handy

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.730 
picture okay which comes in handy
whereas<00:04:09.670> this<00:04:10.209> one<00:04:10.480> doesn't<00:04:11.170> doesn't

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
whereas this one doesn't doesn't

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.520 
whereas this one doesn't doesn't
actually<00:04:12.160> do<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.150> I'm<00:04:13.209> not<00:04:13.270> sure<00:04:13.660> why

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
actually do that and I'm not sure why

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.289 
actually do that and I'm not sure why
anybody<00:04:14.950> would<00:04:15.130> want<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.580> cycle<00:04:15.940> off<00:04:16.030> but

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
anybody would want it to cycle off but

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.610 
anybody would want it to cycle off but
I'm<00:04:16.390> sure<00:04:16.540> there's<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.810> significant<00:04:17.410> reason

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
I'm sure there's a significant reason

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.900 
I'm sure there's a significant reason
for<00:04:18.070> it<00:04:18.250> if<00:04:18.489> I<00:04:18.669> was<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:19.150> look<00:04:19.540> in

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
for it if I was to look in

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.210 
for it if I was to look in
to<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.120> but<00:04:20.630> I'm<00:04:20.810> not<00:04:20.930> sure<00:04:21.080> what<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.470> so

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
to it but I'm not sure what it is so

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.280 
to it but I'm not sure what it is so
those<00:04:22.670> are<00:04:22.880> basically<00:04:23.390> all<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.630> buttons<00:04:24.080> the

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
those are basically all the buttons the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.850 
those are basically all the buttons the
red<00:04:24.500> one<00:04:24.710> over<00:04:24.740> here<00:04:25.160> is<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.400> test<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:26.860> then

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
red one over here is the test and then

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.090 
red one over here is the test and then
the<00:04:28.040> only<00:04:28.190> other<00:04:28.280> trick<00:04:28.730> with<00:04:28.880> alien<00:04:29.270> bees<00:04:29.480> is

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
the only other trick with alien bees is

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.180 
the only other trick with alien bees is
you've<00:04:31.100> got<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.640> sync<00:04:32.180> cable<00:04:32.450> which<00:04:33.110> is<00:04:33.290> stuck

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
you've got a sync cable which is stuck

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.470 
you've got a sync cable which is stuck
under<00:04:34.370> my<00:04:34.640> table<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:36.550> all<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.760> have<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:37.940> do<00:04:38.210> is

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
under my table and all you have to do is

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.380 
under my table and all you have to do is
plug<00:04:38.780> in<00:04:38.960> your<00:04:39.110> sync<00:04:39.440> cable<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.190> your<00:04:41.120> camera

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
plug in your sync cable and your camera

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.660 
plug in your sync cable and your camera
and<00:04:44.390> basically<00:04:45.290> what<00:04:45.500> this<00:04:45.650> is<00:04:45.710> is<00:04:46.160> just<00:04:46.430> sends

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
and basically what this is is just sends

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.670 
and basically what this is is just sends
a<00:04:46.760> little<00:04:47.480> signal<00:04:47.840> this<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.020> an<00:04:48.290> eighth<00:04:48.500> inch

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
a little signal this is an eighth inch

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.460 
a little signal this is an eighth inch
cable<00:04:49.220> right<00:04:49.370> here<00:04:49.640> or<00:04:49.820> mini<00:04:50.210> for<00:04:50.930> all<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.110> you

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
cable right here or mini for all of you

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.370 
cable right here or mini for all of you
audio-visual<00:04:52.370> buffs<00:04:52.910> out<00:04:53.120> there<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.690> then

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
audio-visual buffs out there and then

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.020 
audio-visual buffs out there and then
once<00:04:54.710> you've<00:04:54.860> got<00:04:54.890> that<00:04:55.160> plugged<00:04:55.460> in<00:04:55.670> it<00:04:55.910> will

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
once you've got that plugged in it will

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.700 
once you've got that plugged in it will
fire<00:04:56.270> this<00:04:56.540> strobe<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:57.290> cool<00:04:57.500> thing

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
fire this strobe and the cool thing

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.630 
fire this strobe and the cool thing
about<00:04:57.740> alien<00:04:58.370> bees<00:04:58.580> is<00:04:58.850> that<00:04:59.540> this<00:04:59.780> will<00:05:00.050> slave

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
about alien bees is that this will slave

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.480 
about alien bees is that this will slave
with<00:05:01.640> other<00:05:02.260> strobes<00:05:03.260> so<00:05:03.890> when<00:05:04.100> this<00:05:04.250> one

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
with other strobes so when this one

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.460 
with other strobes so when this one
fires<00:05:04.730> the<00:05:05.090> other<00:05:05.270> ones<00:05:05.510> will<00:05:05.690> automatically

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
fires the other ones will automatically

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.980 
fires the other ones will automatically
fire<00:05:06.680> which<00:05:07.550> is<00:05:07.910> a<00:05:08.060> very<00:05:08.450> cool<00:05:08.690> feature

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
fire which is a very cool feature

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.450 
fire which is a very cool feature
because<00:05:09.290> you<00:05:09.560> don't<00:05:09.710> have<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:09.920> have<00:05:10.010> cables

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
because you don't have to have cables

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.520 
because you don't have to have cables
run<00:05:10.700> all<00:05:11.000> over<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.300> place<00:05:11.360> now<00:05:12.200> the<00:05:12.260> only

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
run all over the place now the only

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.930 
run all over the place now the only
other<00:05:12.620> thing<00:05:12.800> I'll<00:05:13.070> add<00:05:13.220> is<00:05:13.250> you<00:05:13.490> can<00:05:13.640> get<00:05:13.880> a

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
other thing I'll add is you can get a

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.750 
other thing I'll add is you can get a
remote<00:05:14.540> control<00:05:15.050> which<00:05:15.410> I<00:05:15.710> do<00:05:15.770> not<00:05:16.040> have<00:05:16.370> it's

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
remote control which I do not have it's

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.210 
remote control which I do not have it's
called<00:05:16.970> a<00:05:17.060> magic<00:05:17.270> gadget<00:05:17.900> or<00:05:18.170> a<00:05:18.200> radio<00:05:18.680> sensor

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
called a magic gadget or a radio sensor

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.580 
called a magic gadget or a radio sensor
which<00:05:19.790> will<00:05:19.820> actually<00:05:20.210> set<00:05:20.750> off<00:05:20.780> your<00:05:21.290> strobe

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
which will actually set off your strobe

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.640 
which will actually set off your strobe
wirelessly<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.760> that<00:05:23.570> is<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:23.750> very<00:05:24.140> nice<00:05:24.410> thing

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
wirelessly and that is a very nice thing
