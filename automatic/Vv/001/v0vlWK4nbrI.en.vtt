00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
 I do not remember ever grant with this great 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.920
 slam and methods 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.480
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.040
 your house welcome before the forum if 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.610
 I'm very well accompanied again 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.560
 grow up 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.770
 I always try to relate to me the best 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.180
 that I can was that 2 of 7 normally 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.010
 whenever we think of a terminal if 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.200
 we do not think about mediatek processors 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.090
 few specifications in this case 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.420
 we can open the analysis of a terminal 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.790
 with snapdragon 800 I would stay with you 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.160
 because this video promises we're going to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.860
 start with the review that gives great 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.239
 s2 lte let's start with the design 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.339
 as we always did during all this 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.449
 mode I do congress of Barcelona as you see 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.360
 we find a pretty terminal 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.400
 simple quite big and the truth that 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.989
 with a design quite different from what 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.790
 we are used to others 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.809
 manufacturers behind will have to face 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.050
 a little bit reminds us of the first 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.850
 generation of the galaxy s 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.960
 especially for the top part 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.899
 saying this we're going to see a led 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.269
 notifications logo of the brand 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.720
 front camera and in this case as we see 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.130
 we have three buttons back home and menu 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.140
 which lights up once 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.610
 we interact with them as we see in 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.900
 the sides we will see all the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.520
 terminal coated in a finish 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.979
 metallic the aura that we liked 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.270
 quite normally they are always 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.490
 made of plastic in this case 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.200
 it's also like that you're not 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.810
 metallic finish seems to be wearing a 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.460
 finished quite more carefully we have in 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.369
 the right edge an unlock button 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.970
 a top volume control 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.460
 3 jack with 5 bottom microphone 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.440
 Y 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.260
 in the dedicated slot for the connection 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.200
 microusb and the other side we have it 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.850
 totally naked here we have the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.310
 slot with which we will be able to withdraw 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.560
 the lid and in the back we 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.479
 we finish a plastic finish like you 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.420
 we have commented but with a kind of 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.130
 Drawing imitating metal pretty 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.990
 attractive the truth in this case the 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.420
 back we're going to find the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.240
 top device name 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.430
 flash led camera and we have a microphone 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.820
 for the cancellation of noises that were 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.290
 that 2 ntv weighs only 150 grams the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.610
 truth that feels frankly has 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.739
 the hand we have taken a surprise 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.810
 because of how light it is to keep in mind that 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.310
 is a terminal not large 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.500
 they are large sizes but the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.970
 specifications are also this 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.800
 great this comes to compete directly 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.590
 with the current high-end since I have 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.800
 really powerful hardware processor 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.550
 quad-core snapdragon 800 running at 2.3 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 gigahertz accompanied by 2 gigas of ram 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.019
 16 gigs of storage and a battery 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.690
 of 3000 thousand amps a good amount 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.220
 it seems like enough for a user 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.930
 pretty intensive 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.170
 and obviously if you have the tagline 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.510
 lte is that it has a 4g connection with which 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.860
 is prepared for high speed 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.390
 that said let's move on to the section on 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.700
 software let's see what is the version 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.080
 of the operating system let's see what 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.300
 so they are moving we are going to go to 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.160
 this tics for you to see logically 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.930
 has a custom made layer 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.490
 by the manufacturer the Chinese in this case 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.290
 as always in modification in the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.210
 Modification icons in some 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.930
 parameters ester license we are going to 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.120
 find with jay living in the version 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.610
 4.2.2 as you can see here we have the famous 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.200
 Habitas is true that this maybe tarnishes 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.120
 a little the final result has the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.160
 frankly good specifications a 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.450
 weight content however if in these 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.970
 versions is operational left us a 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.470
 rather sour taste mouth let 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.150
 move the notification bar 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.610
 so you can see 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.189
 divided by notifications and we have a 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.530
 rapid control in which we will be able to 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:40.040
 access different parameters like gps 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.599
 Rotating wifi and other action items 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.010
 one of the surprises we have 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.019
 carried as we have seen on the screen 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.000
 of the great this enjoyment of the truth that is 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.319
 a really big screen of 5.5 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.629
 inches 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.680
 and ips technology that we're going to say that 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.999
 we had not already said good 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.769
 interpretation of good colors 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:57.260
 angles of vision the truth that every time 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.969
 we found this technology in more and more 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.420
 smartphones and the wta that we love 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:04.159
 full HD 1080p resolution and with a 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.269
 pixel density per move really 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:10.549
 got 401 pp and without a doubt the 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.750
 screen from zte is one of your points 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.360
 powerful 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.160
 shift of the cameras this great this 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.019
 twice we are on the front as 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.459
 you see a 2 megapixel camera with a 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.410
 good result the truth that enough 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.060
 to make video calls we are going to 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.639
 move to the back the truth that a 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.370
 quite powerful camera in this case d 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.379
 13 megapixels with autofocus we are going to 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.870
 do a series of captures we are going to 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:34.610
 remove the flash to check the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.949
 shutter speed the truth that is 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.810
 very, very fast, as you see 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.400
 make the catches without any kind of 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.259
 problem from here we will be able to 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.509
 access different options by 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.789
 example in hdr mode panoramic mode 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.229
 we also have with beauty mode how 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.889
 fashion has been put in night mode for 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.080
 photographs with low light and partisanship 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.719
 Sanchez different parameters and 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.800
 logically if we access the section of 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.020
 settings 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.590
 we will be able to modify the size of the 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.210
 image and even directly that is to say 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.860
 apply a series of effects that as 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.719
 You see, we will be able to appreciate directly 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.240
 on the screen well this has been the 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.340
 review the great s2 a terminal really 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.930
 interesting good manufacturer is about and 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.909
 I do not know what you think of the terminal 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.759
 you think you will have good sales by 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.129
 butt if it's very good is better than 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.110
 last year 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:27.489
 people liked very well when they had 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.489
 I would be playing there 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:33.159
 a little more to add after this 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.989
 as always is like dalia share and 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:38.459
 let's say goodbye to the oriental way 

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:42.300
 chinese chinese way 

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:42.300
 Yes Yes
