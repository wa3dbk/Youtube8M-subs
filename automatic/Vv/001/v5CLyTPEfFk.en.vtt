4g<00:00:50.789> light<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.320> by<00:00:52.530> much<00:00:52.770> both<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.309> these

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
4g light but not by much both of these

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.470 
4g light but not by much both of these
phones<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.750> lacking<00:00:54.930> battery<00:00:55.590> life

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
phones are really lacking battery life

phones are really lacking battery life
storage<00:00:57.480> wise<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.680> HTC<00:00:59.219> One<00:00:59.399> X<00:00:59.579> gets<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
storage wise the HTC One X gets a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.760 
storage wise the HTC One X gets a
thousand<00:01:00.420> twenty<00:01:00.570> four<00:01:00.809> megabytes<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.590> does

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
thousand twenty four megabytes and does

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.219 
thousand twenty four megabytes and does
not<00:01:02.010> support<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.579> 32<00:01:03.030> gigabyte<00:01:03.329> SD<00:01:03.719> card

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
not support a 32 gigabyte SD card

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.490 
not support a 32 gigabyte SD card
however<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.280> 4g<00:01:05.700> light<00:01:05.970> also<00:01:06.420> gets<00:01:06.600> 1024

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
however the 4g light also gets 1024

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950 
however the 4g light also gets 1024
megabytes<00:01:07.650> storage<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> supports<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.540> 32

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
megabytes storage and supports a 32

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.460 
megabytes storage and supports a 32
gigabyte<00:01:10.170> SD<00:01:10.530> card<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> evil<00:01:13.260> light

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
gigabyte SD card so the evil light

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
gigabyte SD card so the evil light
definitely<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:15.570> better<00:01:16.320> plus<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
definitely on a better plus is that it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
definitely on a better plus is that it
supports<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> 32<00:01:18.450> gigabyte<00:01:18.869> SD<00:01:19.020> card<00:01:19.439> for

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
supports the 32 gigabyte SD card for

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.880 
supports the 32 gigabyte SD card for
extra<00:01:19.860> storage<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> One<00:01:21.119> X<00:01:21.150> does<00:01:21.479> not

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
extra storage and the One X does not

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
extra storage and the One X does not
both<00:01:22.890> these<00:01:23.040> phones<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.240> thousands<00:01:24.720> or

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
both these phones on have thousands or

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.649 
both these phones on have thousands or
1500<00:01:25.470> megahertz<00:01:25.650> processors<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
1500 megahertz processors on them the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
1500 megahertz processors on them the
One<00:01:27.840> X<00:01:27.869> has<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> quad-core<00:01:28.710> processor<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
One X has a quad-core processor and the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.510 
One X has a quad-core processor and the
4g<00:01:30.659> light<00:01:30.840> has<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> snapdragon<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.220> create

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
4g light has a snapdragon as to create

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.359 
4g light has a snapdragon as to create
processor<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.170> both<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.380> super<00:01:35.100> fast

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
processor so they both have super fast

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.390 
processor so they both have super fast
processors<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.150> them<00:01:36.470> they<00:01:37.470> both<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.950> 8

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
processors on them they both have 8

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.789 
processors on them they both have 8
megapixel<00:01:39.060> bag<00:01:39.240> cameras<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:40.049> 1.3

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799

megapixel bag cameras with 1.3
front-facing<00:01:41.490> cameras<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:42.750> also<00:01:42.930> both

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
front-facing cameras and they also both

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.990 
front-facing cameras and they also both
do<00:01:43.560> 1080p<00:01:44.040> HD<00:01:44.460> video<00:01:44.579> recording<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:47.729> think

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
do 1080p HD video recording so we think

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.300 
do 1080p HD video recording so we think
that<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.600> 4g<00:01:49.229> light<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> winner<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.159> this

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that the 4g light is the winner on this

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.810 
that the 4g light is the winner on this
vs.<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:52.020> they<00:01:52.950> did<00:01:53.159> tie<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.670> lot

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
vs. as you can see they did tie in a lot

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.609 
vs. as you can see they did tie in a lot
of<00:01:53.850> categories<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.630> screen<00:01:55.049> size<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
of categories like screen size and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.950 
of categories like screen size and
resolution<00:01:55.890> along<00:01:56.520> with<00:01:56.729> both<00:01:57.600> having<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
resolution along with both having the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.130 
resolution along with both having the
1500<00:01:58.590> megahertz<00:01:58.860> processors<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.140> identical

1500 megahertz processors and identical
cameras<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.619> them<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.399> also<00:02:03.030> being<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.329> 4g

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
cameras on them and also being on 4g

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.649 
cameras on them and also being on 4g
networks<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.189> evo<00:02:05.460> 4g<00:02:05.850> light<00:02:06.060> does<00:02:06.390> have

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
networks but the evo 4g light does have

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.139 
networks but the evo 4g light does have
a<00:02:06.689> little<00:02:07.530> bit<00:02:07.799> better<00:02:07.950> battery<00:02:08.520> life<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.970> it

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
a little bit better battery life on it

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.150 
a little bit better battery life on it
and<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.840> you're<00:02:10.020> able<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.410> add<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.560> 32

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
and now you're able to add that 32
