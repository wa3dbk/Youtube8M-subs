00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
of functionality baked in if you just

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.710 
of functionality baked in if you just
single<00:04:46.400> tap<00:04:46.639> on<00:04:46.850> it<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.090> behaves<00:04:47.450> as<00:04:47.660> a

single tap on it it behaves as a

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.590 
single tap on it it behaves as a
capacitive<00:04:48.680> back<00:04:48.950> button<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:50.240> can<00:04:50.389> see<00:04:50.570> right

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
the HOME key then that's just not all if

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.270 
the HOME key then that's just not all if
you<00:04:58.220> long<00:04:58.550> tap<00:04:58.880> on<00:04:59.120> it<00:04:59.150> it<00:04:59.889> behaves<00:05:00.889> as<00:05:01.100> the
