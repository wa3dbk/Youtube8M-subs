00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
lubricant because it is designed for

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.920 
lubricant because it is designed for
baldness<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.680> works<00:00:59.520> especially<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.629> 12

laws the gears difference beat has been

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.510 
laws the gears difference beat has been
the<00:01:09.320> balls<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.890> spin<00:01:10.550> freely<00:01:10.790> without

actually losing their friction with the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.940 
actually losing their friction with the
plates<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:17.659> applied<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.020> thin<00:01:18.440> little<00:01:18.619> coat

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
plates so I applied a thin little coat

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.770 
plates so I applied a thin little coat
onto<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.670> one<00:01:19.940> side<00:01:20.210> of<00:01:20.240> that<00:01:20.479> I'm<00:01:20.600> going<00:01:20.690> to

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
onto the one side of that I'm going to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.160 
onto the one side of that I'm going to
put<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:20.990> cup<00:01:21.260> side<00:01:21.500> i<00:01:21.530> coated<00:01:21.950> down<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.990> then

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
put the cup side i coated down and then

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.410 
put the cup side i coated down and then
i'm<00:01:24.320> going<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:24.590> start<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.340> pick<00:01:25.850> up<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.210> balls

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
i'm going to start to pick up the balls

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.030 
i'm going to start to pick up the balls
and<00:01:26.810> pop<00:01:27.080> them<00:01:27.259> into<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.560> little<00:01:27.770> little

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
and pop them into a little little

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:36.280 
and pop them into a little little
respective<00:01:28.729> slots

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.650 

I<00:01:36.350> find<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.250> with<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.820> grease<00:01:38.150> it<00:01:38.330> helps<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
I find that with the grease it helps the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.230 
I find that with the grease it helps the
ball<00:01:38.810> stick<00:01:39.290> better<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.970> when<00:01:41.120> you're

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
ball stick better so when you're

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.820 
ball stick better so when you're
building<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.990> goes<00:01:42.200> together<00:01:42.410> a<00:01:42.620> lot

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
building it it goes together a lot

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:52.380 
building it it goes together a lot
easier

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.620 

okay<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.409> already<00:01:54.310> got<00:01:54.580> five<00:01:54.850> min

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
okay I already got five min

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.389 
okay I already got five min
fix<00:01:58.070> halfway<00:01:59.070> done

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.700 

so<00:02:04.399> then

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.210 

a

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.440 

and

the build should have done this before

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
should be good now for on-road use if

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.749 
should be good now for on-road use if
you're<00:06:52.210> planning<00:06:52.509> to<00:06:52.539> like<00:06:52.780> so<00:06:53.380> this<00:06:53.639> for<00:06:54.639> high

speed runs you're going to want this to

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.230 
speed runs you're going to want this to
be<00:06:56.259> the<00:06:56.650> you<00:06:57.099> probably<00:06:57.370> not<00:06:57.550> going<00:06:57.699> back<00:06:58.030> it<00:06:58.180> up

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
be the you probably not going back it up

put<00:07:10.690> the<00:07:10.720> 12<00:07:11.349> x<00:07:11.740> 18<00:07:12.220> millimeter<00:07:12.849> ball<00:07:13.150> bearings

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:13.569 
put the 12 x 18 millimeter ball bearings

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:16.800 
put the 12 x 18 millimeter ball bearings
into<00:07:14.229> the<00:07:14.909> right<00:07:15.909> half<00:07:16.150> of<00:07:16.240> the<00:07:16.300> transmission

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 
side if you don't do this it will loosen

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.630 
side if you don't do this it will loosen
up<00:07:56.670> eventually<00:07:56.970> and<00:07:57.470> give<00:07:58.470> you<00:07:58.650> problems<00:07:59.040> so

up eventually and give you problems so
this<00:08:00.000> just<00:08:00.330> goes<00:08:01.290> on<00:08:01.530> to<00:08:01.680> here<00:08:01.920> notice<00:08:02.760> I

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 
this just goes on to here notice I

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.740 
this just goes on to here notice I
didn't<00:08:03.300> grease<00:08:03.690> the<00:08:03.960> gears<00:08:05.000> it<00:08:06.000> just<00:08:06.300> tends<00:08:06.510> to

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:06.750 
didn't grease the gears it just tends to

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.320 
didn't grease the gears it just tends to
find<00:08:07.410> that<00:08:07.620> greece's<00:08:08.190> tends<00:08:08.640> to<00:08:08.850> soften<00:08:09.210> up

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:09.330 
find that greece's tends to soften up

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.600 
find that greece's tends to soften up
the<00:08:09.360> gears<00:08:09.720> and<00:08:10.080> just<00:08:10.290> results<00:08:11.010> in<00:08:11.190> a<00:08:11.220> failure

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:11.610 
the gears and just results in a failure

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.820 
the gears and just results in a failure
so<00:08:12.600> that's<00:08:13.290> the<00:08:13.530> transmission<00:08:14.160> assembled
