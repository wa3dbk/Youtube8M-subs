00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Now thoughts are still about the grand prix 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.180
 Japan where the terrible catastrophe happened 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.610
 we are with you about this last time 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.950
 talked yesterday at about 7 pm 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.280
 what has changed since then what news 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.730
 really that's just somewhere 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.940
 twenty back 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 team marussia officially 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.430
 spread the stone and those need 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.080
 notice that in an amazing way on 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.090
 for more than a day the team itself 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.740
 did nothing at all from this point 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.260
 Vision that is, anyone gave 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.000
 statement only release marusya was 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.059
 before that after the race when they just 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.980
 repeated actually in gray with the fact that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.660
 It was from and name about hospital this 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.790
 it was very strange well, it is clear that everything 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.350
 were shocked and today in the morning they 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.629
 circulated statements in which we 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.890
 thanked both the medical staff and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.289
 others asked for patience asked for 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.870
 general respect for the pilot's relatives 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.579
 it seemed that all updates of some kind 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.860
 news will now only 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.410
 the consent of relatives and in general it is long 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.870
 process apparently from other 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.030
 sources on untested again 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.369
 seemingly have to do the second operation 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 today on 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.060
 maybe each other I'm a hematoma on this 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.619
 again not sure i doubt that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.869
 maybe all the same there are those viewers 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.490
 who do not understand what is going on now 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.700
 speech and maybe you in two words 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.970
 Now tell us the point 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.789
 questions the question itself is frightening 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.460
 us pictures and that's what happened on 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.220
 Japanese Grand Prix near the end of the race 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.790
 and the accident itself was not shown but then 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.920
 was restored that 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.810
 there were accidents adrian essence a and crane 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.880
 hoist which rode out to 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.620
 the car itself is evacuated instead 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.500
 Now that the first accident here it is on your 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.570
 screens it flew into him hurts 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.910
 who lived henke too, was wrong 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.640
 that already started heavy rain already beginning 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.100
 get dark and so much was the accident 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.140
 that unconscious was the pilot therefore not 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.150
 they even showed him the moment 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.460
 the accident did not show did not answer the team 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.950
 on the radio and then it turned out that 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.830
 he has a serious head injury 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.140
 they took him away in an ambulance 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.850
 actually those rare photos that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.729
 in the end were later published but 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.800
 far from immediately 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.470
 if the senate learn from the reasons 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.440
 what happened here is more bad weather 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.880
 challenging tracks or a human bag 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.200
 factor number 6 all you know where 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.850
 the most interesting thing about the same thing 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.709
 the place is a high-speed turn there 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.720
 The first sector is very interesting such 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.560
 suits on the rise and at the very end and 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.610
 lingering left high speed turn and 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.170
 In general, in principle, the suzuki is very 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.720
 small safety zones they 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.360
 gravel they are old fashioned this here 7 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.690
 your screens just turn enough 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.510
 speedy left and the most interesting thing 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.090
 something like this was already in the same place 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.769
 when still our current colleague martin 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.299
 brandl now we are an english commentator 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.239
 television and then he performed himself 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.820
 the pilot and there already flew one of his 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.900
 his rivals were evacuated and the commissioners 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.019
 marshal japanese 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.870
 also show rain himself martin was wrong 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.850
 flew out and but he didn't hit the tractor but 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.670
 he broke one of these 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.250
 and so far when here we are with grief he 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.560
 against every possible technique on the track 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.150
 not yet so common 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.709
 minnows now it would be easier to do 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.750
 yes, it would seem, let the car out 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.239
 security gather everyone and then 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.430
 releasing these tractors because i would 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.470
 said and rain and human factors 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.850
 maybe he didnâ€™t see the yellow flags 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.940
 so he didn't slow down there 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.519
 flew it all present but there is here 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.920
 this strong moment if you have 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.600
 the ability to neutralize the race if 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.220
 you are counting all the trees 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.110
 security so we remember ourselves 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.820
 will become 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.320
 start for an hour was postponed when brewed 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.180
 safety speech after accidents kimi 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.310
 raikkonen and this was in an unexpected 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.100
 a place for the river grumbled well why there 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.410
 change well, but it turns out that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.450
 rice security even in the unexpected 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.870
 place we stop the race for an hour and 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.700
 we make a new one so that there is not even 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.410
 the car's capabilities are somehow under bad 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.880
 angle to get somewhere and here here 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.470
 multi-ton tractor like nothing 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.150
 used to go on the road and 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.940
 dangerous place where you can fly under 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.520
 rain now we will see and listen 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.700
 what the race participants say is somewhat 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.700
 quotes 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.419
 when we still started visibility 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.400
 was a good track allowed 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.560
 pilot but near the end of the race 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.490
 it became dark and possible and and worth it 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.650
 finish earlier 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.440
 the safety car had to be released 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.760
 right after my crash 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.310
 the track was practically unsuitable for 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.050
 drive five laps to the karo network i 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.180
 shouted spawned that on the track too 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.470
 plenty of water and the race must be stopped in 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.470
 the result was an accident 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.940
 [music] 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.830
 the incident did not happen by if 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.760
 the car immediately left the track 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.130
 security 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.580
 instead they decided to wait for more 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.570
 a couple of laps is a serious mistake 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.510
 the race board had to act 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:06.850
 more decidedly just unbelievable what 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:09.120
 hurts crashed into a tow truck to close 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.860
 I read this topic the day before that supposedly 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.710
 binky wreckage was transferred to 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.440
 investigations of the Japanese police of some kind 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.300
 criminal history is possible motorsport 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.810
 always when such serious things happen 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.390
 an accident 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.470
 all police are checked because to 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:29.110
 eliminate some kind of diversion 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.670
 let's even say if what but if what 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.740
 this is another article and 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.400
 the car was kept on everyone ; 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.580
 years not so long ago not published well what 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.410
 Well, the Russian Grand Prix is about to start. 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.410
 it will pass the salt
