quite boring hit the tab key now at the
moment<00:01:46.200> inside<00:01:46.410> light<00:01:46.980> waves<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.460> would<00:01:47.580> be

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
moment inside light waves this would be

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.240 
moment inside light waves this would be
like<00:01:47.730> the<00:01:48.000> edit<00:01:48.780> mode<00:01:49.050> be<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.590> object<00:01:49.770> and

live totally different whatever the tab

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.540 
live totally different whatever the tab
key<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.860> same<00:01:56.100> thing<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.340> putting

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
key is the same thing as putting

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.420 
key is the same thing as putting
turbosmooth<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.690> hit<00:01:58.410> italki<00:01:58.710> two<00:01:59.190> votes

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
turbosmooth on so hit italki two votes

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.880 
turbosmooth on so hit italki two votes
move<00:01:59.610> now<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:01.050> thing<00:02:01.260> with<00:02:01.410> light<00:02:01.650> wave

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
move now the thing with light wave

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.680 
move now the thing with light wave
exercise<00:02:02.550> every<00:02:02.940> other<00:02:03.000> program<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.660> there

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
exercise every other program out there

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.170 
exercise every other program out there
is<00:02:04.470> that<00:02:04.890> when<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.550> want<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.760> go<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:05.910> change

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
is that when you want to go and change

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.730 
is that when you want to go and change
something<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.720> go<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.930> edit<00:02:07.080> something<00:02:07.440> so

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
something to go and edit something so

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410 
something to go and edit something so
we're<00:02:08.010> going<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.310> tagged<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.850> point

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
we're going to go and tagged a point

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
we're going to go and tagged a point
we're<00:02:09.630> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> go<00:02:09.899> control<00:02:10.890> patiya<00:02:11.190> but

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
we're going to go control patiya but

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.800 
we're going to go control patiya but
even<00:02:11.550> looking<00:02:11.760> at<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.570> go<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
even looking at that we can just go and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.290 
even looking at that we can just go and
pick<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> point<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:13.860> moves<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.370> okay

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
pick the point and it just moves it okay

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.150 
pick the point and it just moves it okay
and<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.380> basically<00:02:16.530> what<00:02:16.890> we're<00:02:17.070> going

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and that is basically what we're going

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.090 
and that is basically what we're going
to<00:02:17.250> call<00:02:17.370> phantom<00:02:18.120> point<00:02:18.420> editing<00:02:18.900> inside<00:02:19.710> max

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
to call phantom point editing inside max

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.130 
to call phantom point editing inside max
you<00:02:20.490> can't<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.270> because<00:02:21.480> you're<00:02:21.870> stuck

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
you can't do that because you're stuck

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.530 
you can't do that because you're stuck
in<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.530> mode<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.130> then<00:02:23.220> which<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.120> your<00:02:24.270> base

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
in this mode and then which is your base

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.570 
in this mode and then which is your base
mode<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.170> then<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.440> put<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.680> tip<00:02:26.160> us<00:02:26.280> move<00:02:26.490> on

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
mode and then you put a tip us move on

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.460 
mode and then you put a tip us move on
top<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.480> get<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.630> cage<00:02:27.900> showing<00:02:28.410> you

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
top of it and you get a cage showing you

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.130 
top of it and you get a cage showing you
what's<00:02:28.620> going<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:29.210> well<00:02:30.210> as<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.660> don't<00:02:30.930> with

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
what's going on well as you don't with

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.080 
what's going on well as you don't with
most<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> programs<00:02:32.370> now<00:02:32.580> that's<00:02:32.760> one<00:02:32.970> of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
most of the programs now that's one of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.310 
most of the programs now that's one of
the<00:02:33.150> things<00:02:33.210> I've<00:02:33.510> been<00:02:33.630> wanting<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.170> have

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
the things I've been wanting to have

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.520 
the things I've been wanting to have
upgraded<00:02:34.770> inside<00:02:35.220> studio<00:02:35.940> max<00:02:36.330> for<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.840> long

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
upgraded inside studio max for a long

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.840 
upgraded inside studio max for a long
long<00:02:38.070> long<00:02:38.150> time<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:40.430> let's<00:02:41.430> jump<00:02:41.580> back<00:02:41.640> over

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
long long time so let's jump back over

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.670 
long long time so let's jump back over
to<00:02:42.060> studio<00:02:42.360> max<00:02:42.600> has<00:02:42.750> poor<00:02:43.020> matt<00:02:43.290> down<00:02:43.470> there

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
to studio max has poor matt down there

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.300 
to studio max has poor matt down there
so<00:02:44.100> what<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.310> got<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.550> here<00:02:44.580> if<00:02:44.940> we're<00:02:45.120> going<00:02:45.360> to

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
so what we got in here if we're going to

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.860 
so what we got in here if we're going to
solve<00:02:47.310> object<00:02:47.670> mode<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:47.970> editable<00:02:48.390> poly<00:02:48.570> you

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
solve object mode of editable poly you

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.830 
solve object mode of editable poly you
can<00:02:49.020> see<00:02:49.320> we've<00:02:50.010> got<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.280> cage<00:02:50.610> idea<00:02:51.300> yeah

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
can see we've got this cage idea yeah

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.750 
can see we've got this cage idea yeah
again<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.530> if<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.250> want<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.580> edit

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
again and if you want to go and edit

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.280 
again and if you want to go and edit
anything<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.330> can<00:02:54.540> select<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.930> point<00:02:55.140> and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
anything you can select the point and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.500 
anything you can select the point and
move<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.520> can<00:02:56.640> see<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
move it and you can see that the the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.030 
move it and you can see that the the
actual<00:02:57.630> point<00:02:57.959> you're<00:02:58.200> moving<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:58.920> this

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
actual point you're moving is in this

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.470 
actual point you're moving is in this
floating<00:02:59.400> cage<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:00.330> been

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
floating cage and then it's been

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.600 
floating cage and then it's been
subdivided<00:03:00.870> below<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:02.310> as<00:03:02.430> well

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
subdivided below it and that as well

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.400 
subdivided below it and that as well
we've<00:03:02.790> always<00:03:03.060> been<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.750> how<00:03:03.900> much<00:03:04.019> fun<00:03:04.080> is

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
we've always been and how much fun is

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.860 
we've always been and how much fun is
that<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.800> can<00:03:05.310> only<00:03:05.400> tell<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.790> not<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.690> much

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
that I can only tell you not that much

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.040 
that I can only tell you not that much
fun<00:03:07.110> because<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:08.570> diva<00:03:09.570> programs<00:03:09.870> do<00:03:09.959> a

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
fun because you diva programs do a

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.710 
fun because you diva programs do a
different<00:03:10.230> way<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.500> this<00:03:10.650> one's<00:03:10.890> like<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.720> lot

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
different way and this one's like a lot

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.120 
different way and this one's like a lot
of<00:03:12.840> money<00:03:12.870> why<00:03:13.290> don't<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.530> upgrade<00:03:13.860> it'd<00:03:14.040> be

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
of money why don't you upgrade it'd be

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.590 
of money why don't you upgrade it'd be
really<00:03:14.280> nice<00:03:14.519> that'd<00:03:15.030> be<00:03:15.060> one<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.450> things

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
really nice that'd be one of the things

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.710 
really nice that'd be one of the things
I've<00:03:15.750> been<00:03:15.870> asking<00:03:16.440> for<00:03:16.620> for<00:03:16.650> ever<00:03:17.480> guess<00:03:18.480> what

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
I've been asking for for ever guess what

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.470 
I've been asking for for ever guess what
illusion<00:03:19.650> catalyst<00:03:20.130> if<00:03:20.310> we<00:03:20.670> go<00:03:20.820> into<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.300> and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
illusion catalyst if we go into it and

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.590 
illusion catalyst if we go into it and
we<00:03:21.750> say<00:03:21.930> we<00:03:22.140> want<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.590> drag<00:03:23.459> something<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.450> can

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
we say we want to drag something we can

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.300 
we say we want to drag something we can
we<00:03:24.720> get<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.900> brush<00:03:25.140> size<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:25.860> think<00:03:26.040> it's<00:03:26.160> a

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
we get a brush size and I think it's a

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.820 
we get a brush size and I think it's a
sort<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.209> shift<00:03:27.420> or<00:03:27.570> ctrl<00:03:27.870> or<00:03:28.019> ctrl<00:03:28.140> +<00:03:28.470> shift<00:03:28.680> as
