this over and then put the staple
through<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> other<00:01:51.000> side<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.540> close<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
through the other side and close the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.260 
through the other side and close the
staple<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.649> your<00:01:52.799> fingers<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.340> then<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
staple with your fingers and then the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.969 
staple with your fingers and then the
end<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> would<00:01:54.659> look<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.590> you

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
end it would look like that and you

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.679 
end it would look like that and you
would<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.280> nice<00:01:56.490> little<00:01:56.670> circle<00:01:57.149> around

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
would have a nice little circle around

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.200 
would have a nice little circle around
there<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.860> course<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.159> would<00:01:59.820> tie<00:02:00.030> that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
there and of course you would tie that

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.450 
there and of course you would tie that
um<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.170> want<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.829> try<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> tie<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
um if you want you can try to tie the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.069 
um if you want you can try to tie the
same<00:02:02.759> kind<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.060> ribbon<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.930> would<00:02:04.049> be

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
same kind of ribbon but that would be

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.690 
same kind of ribbon but that would be
kind<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.439> hard<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.219> tie<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.460> around

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
kind of hard and you can tie it around

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.930 
kind of hard and you can tie it around
there<00:02:06.409> but<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.439> used<00:02:07.799> curling<00:02:08.429> ribbon<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.879> I

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
there but I used curling ribbon and I

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.660 
there but I used curling ribbon and I
just<00:02:09.119> double<00:02:09.479> knotted<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.979> this

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
just double knotted it for this and this

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.290 
just double knotted it for this and this
is<00:02:11.849> basically<00:02:12.060> what<00:02:12.510> you're<00:02:12.660> fit

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
is basically what you're fit

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.690 
is basically what you're fit
product<00:02:13.750> would<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:14.110> if<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.800> haven't<00:02:15.040> use<00:02:15.220> 11

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
product would be if you haven't use 11

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.520 
product would be if you haven't use 11
inches<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.300> would<00:02:16.600> be<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> little<00:02:17.110> bit<00:02:17.320> bigger

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
inches it would be a little bit bigger

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.740 
inches it would be a little bit bigger
than<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.250> probably<00:02:18.460> appropriate<00:02:19.330> for

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
than this and probably appropriate for

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.440 
than this and probably appropriate for
the<00:02:19.870> back<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.260> ponytail<00:02:20.680> but<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.280> used<00:02:21.820> like<00:02:22.420> a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the back of a ponytail but I used like a

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.720 
the back of a ponytail but I used like a
little<00:02:22.870> bit<00:02:22.990> short<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.470> 11<00:02:23.950> inches<00:02:24.430> on

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
little bit short in the 11 inches on

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.660 
little bit short in the 11 inches on
when<00:02:25.570> i<00:02:25.600> did<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.290> finished<00:02:26.650> product<00:02:27.070> looking

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
when i did the finished product looking

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.840 
when i did the finished product looking
one<00:02:27.820> this<00:02:28.090> one<00:02:28.390> was<00:02:28.570> 11<00:02:28.990> inches<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.640> this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
one this one was 11 inches and this

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.420 
one this one was 11 inches and this
would<00:02:31.000> be<00:02:31.060> like<00:02:31.210> I<00:02:31.660> probably<00:02:32.620> did<00:02:32.830> five<00:02:33.040> inches

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
would be like I probably did five inches

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.040 
would be like I probably did five inches
or<00:02:33.610> something<00:02:33.910> on<00:02:34.060> this<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.630> would<00:02:34.900> be<00:02:35.020> a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
or something on this and this would be a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.170 
or something on this and this would be a
side<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.590> head<00:02:35.710> bow<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.160> as<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:36.970> can<00:02:37.150> see

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
side of the head bow and as you can see

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.270 
side of the head bow and as you can see
I<00:02:37.330> have<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.780> curling<00:02:38.260> ribbon<00:02:38.560> tied<00:02:38.920> neatly

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
I have the curling ribbon tied neatly

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.640 
I have the curling ribbon tied neatly
around<00:02:39.730> there<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.180> silver<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.750> think

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
around there and it's silver and I think

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.900 
around there and it's silver and I think
it<00:02:41.770> looks<00:02:41.800> really<00:02:42.250> cute<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.680> there<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.340> go<00:02:45.370> I
