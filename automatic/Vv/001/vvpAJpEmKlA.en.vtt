00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.379 

for<00:00:01.680> reasons<00:00:02.010> I'm<00:00:02.159> not<00:00:02.190> sure<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.790> that<00:00:02.820> first

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
for reasons I'm not sure of that first

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.190 
for reasons I'm not sure of that first
test<00:00:03.810> got<00:00:04.710> cut<00:00:05.040> short<00:00:05.430> by<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.700> camera<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.569> think

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
test got cut short by the camera I think

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.919 
test got cut short by the camera I think
it<00:00:07.529> when<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.550> camera<00:00:08.910> shut<00:00:09.179> off

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
it when the camera shut off

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.669 
it when the camera shut off
it<00:00:10.410> was<00:00:10.889> reading<00:00:11.400> 32<00:00:12.120> miles-per-gallon

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
it was reading 32 miles-per-gallon

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.220 
it was reading 32 miles-per-gallon
average<00:00:13.679> for<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.849> trip<00:00:15.680> it<00:00:16.680> ended<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.130> at<00:00:17.430> 30

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
average for that trip it ended up at 30

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.929 
average for that trip it ended up at 30
1.0<00:00:19.880> miles<00:00:20.880> per<00:00:21.180> gallon<00:00:21.570> as<00:00:21.930> our<00:00:22.410> baseline<00:00:22.939> so

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
1.0 miles per gallon as our baseline so

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.340 
1.0 miles per gallon as our baseline so

what<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.840> have<00:01:51.050> found<00:01:51.290> that<00:01:51.620> if<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:52.040> run<00:01:52.310> this

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
what I have found that if I run this

what I have found that if I run this
generator<00:01:53.090> on<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:53.780> vehicle

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060

I<00:02:00.799> actually<00:02:01.340> get<00:02:01.790> less<00:02:02.210> gas<00:02:02.600> mileage

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.419 

reason<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.970> anyway<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.180> theory<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
reason for this anyway my theory and

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.360 
reason for this anyway my theory and
that<00:02:10.819> is

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.190 

by<00:02:13.880> adding<00:02:14.180> hydrogen<00:02:14.959> oxygen<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
by adding hydrogen oxygen to the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.970 
by adding hydrogen oxygen to the
next<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.250> causes<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.970> gasoline

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.910 

and<00:02:23.129> so<00:02:23.670> cutting<00:02:24.150> out<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.599> exhaust<00:02:25.020> there's<00:02:25.860> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
and so cutting out the exhaust there's a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.570 
and so cutting out the exhaust there's a
fire

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
fire

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:35.070 
fire
of<00:02:26.700> oxygen

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.449 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.100 

and<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:38.090> have<00:02:38.299> this<00:02:39.290> vehicle

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.860

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.760 

so<00:02:52.020> when<00:02:52.940> with<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.180> oxygen<00:02:54.750> level<00:02:55.080> higher<00:02:55.380> the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
so when with the oxygen level higher the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.400 
so when with the oxygen level higher the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410

you<00:03:01.800> nursys<00:03:02.220> that

Tanner<00:03:21.700> thinks<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.300> should<00:03:22.330> be<00:03:22.570> recording

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
Tanner thinks it should be recording

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.240 
Tanner thinks it should be recording
that's<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.700> reason<00:03:26.090> why

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:42.260 

if<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:34.000> don't<00:03:34.530> adjust<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.910> signal<00:03:37.150> coming

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.110 

well<00:03:42.630> as<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.960> can<00:03:43.080> see

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.050 

I<00:03:46.180> think<00:03:46.989> two<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.860> three<00:03:48.190> miles<00:03:48.459> an<00:03:49.060> hour

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
I think two to three miles an hour

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.980 
I think two to three miles an hour
I'll<00:03:50.120> test<00:03:50.510> and

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
I'll test and

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.880 
I'll test and
to<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.470> average<00:03:53.590> wells

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890

37<00:05:35.949> points

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.490 

that's<00:05:41.140> an<00:05:41.380> improvement<00:05:41.740> of<00:05:42.960> five<00:05:43.960> miles<00:05:44.320> to

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
that's an improvement of five miles to

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.070 
that's an improvement of five miles to

the gallon over our baseline test

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.410 
the gallon over our baseline test
not<00:05:48.040> too<00:05:48.340> shabby<00:05:50.370> and<00:05:51.370> now<00:05:51.760> I'm<00:05:51.850> going<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:52.240> turn

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
not too shabby and now I'm going to turn

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.960 
not too shabby and now I'm going to turn
around<00:05:52.480> and<00:05:53.230> go<00:05:54.070> back<00:05:54.280> to<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:54.550> beginning<00:05:54.910> of
