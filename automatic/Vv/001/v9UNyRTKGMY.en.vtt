00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.269
 after the hang out on sunday for me 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.969
 a loader he found stupid end 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.500
 there was again a new battlefield 4 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.449
 trailer and i want to be a bit like that 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.410
 to hand a few pictures or better to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.900
 has a few scenes 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.180
 I analyze this trailer something 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.119
 will sort this back to map and 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.460
 the start makes sex we won 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.489
 This card has been the last time 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.309
 tested a bit on xbox one and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.050
 There are many cell phone shots where you can 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.790
 unfortunately only a bit 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.309
 know water because he is the quality 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.079
 not so good is decide we are yes 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.480
 usually also the pictures of the map 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.160
 layout and the only picture what 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.989
 really what is good is just here 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.789
 layout of domi nation 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.890
 Actually, you just know that 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.050
 really the a and the b question of the c 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.820
 There is also a flag but you can see it 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.370
 unfortunately something bad that's just so 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.660
 business problem and the other pictures 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.510
 But they are much worse 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.010
 that's why it's a picture with 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.689
 passable quality where to find the map text 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.420
 can still recognize a bit 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.580
 I have two more pictures of that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.890
 factory in the middle of the map where stop too 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.110
 the level value is always here 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.750
 rather a closer shot where you go 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.700
 a little bit the factory so in the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 size can halfway recognize how big 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.720
 so is the little person and winter 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.680
 we have the second picture still mine 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.030
 he further view one left two 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.189
 functional tanks can see and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.759
 right behind the so also armor so 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.619
 seen 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.720
 but most likely they are 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.790
 the rusted tanks will not last anymore 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.650
 go and it seems that way up there 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.200
 as if the chimney would tip over 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.000
 and to the chimney that flies yes 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.280
 not immediately there is the air for it 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.630
 a bomb that just has a timer and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.450
 Hold on as long as this thailand 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.829
 has expired you can stop this 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.720
 Explosion of the bomb again and again 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.939
 prevent if you do not want to stop 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.799
 that the chimney environment and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.259
 ultimately influenced the map layout 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.880
 the next card is in place and that is 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.240
 now very interesting because of 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.369
 stop this big steam and this dam 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.220
 he really is a destroyer 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.380
 all explosive weapons accident this one 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.020
 should go broke the water rises 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.120
 By about four meters which means new 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.620
 but others can reach as well 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.260
 position fall away but for example 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.700
 such a basement was there I come 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.380
 not really clean anymore 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.960
 I can not believe that deep 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.460
 dive we dive in and have 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.680
 not back up in time 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.350
 or so that's why I think that goes 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.670
 do not turn it on and then the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.290
 others just do it when he's everywhere 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.480
 Water is it with the locomotion 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.790
 a bit more difficult because you are just as 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.800
 Floating person not all too 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.160
 fast at the vehicles could up 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.070
 now all like then see this rap 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.840
 boats transport and also scout 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.240
 helicopter and, ultimately, too 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.860
 even quads as there is one for me 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.960
 very funny picture and although you can 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.060
 the income to the medi kit recognize this 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.670
 means you can again this medick 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.560
 medicaid whatever on the square 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.900
 throw that he go away to when 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.390
 The dam will break ground 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.450
 Vehicles replaced by water vehicles 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.420
 the next map is galway 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.640
 that's really this really big map 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.890
 in the style of Abbott wants because that has 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.110
 really a very open and very 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.350
 great to remember Barca to 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.080
 example and it came immediately if this 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.880
 a scene the avenue scene where you are in 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.470
 multiplayer map times the sigma seen 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.050
 You could yes in 17 minutes 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.090
 gameplay of phishing in baku sometimes 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.280
 but not yet seen 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.740
 only multiplayer teeth and there can 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.540
 One recognizes the small buggy there 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.300
 It could never be like that again 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.030
 but much, after all, that's nice 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.470
 is back with it is the other picture is 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.959
 also interesting because we have to 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.240
 now yes the cologne day as well as stealth 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.220
 jet on a map and on this 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.980
 we have a picture in attack jet right now 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.950
 down in the at that time that is if 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.260
 I'm so panzerfahrer'm the lattek 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.830
 its rockets are now the new piece 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.630
 stronger that we say the day is so 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.100
 open area so i am so 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.570
 sometimes in danger 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.650
 because you really have to hope that 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.190
 the stealth jet these vehicles from me 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.989
 keeps away 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.690
 Now, though we have already relaxed one 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.970
 can on the first picture the m60 e4 with 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.710
 the mode recognizes in the quite tense 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.590
 on these weapons category in the beta 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.790
 was for me 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.010
 myself the problem that I hold mine 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.990
 son holos had time to stop and me 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.730
 with the visor not so well come 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.889
 would bieber have his colleague or one 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.830
 cobra or flac are also available though 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.570
 to time I like it so much and then 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.160
 I think I'm just the IMG if 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.440
 So you have a visor with the man 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.310
 maybe a little bit more pleasant 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.290
 can play 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.220
 that the leds then really still 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.650
 times a piece are better than 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.020
 Battlefield 3 and it would be me 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.300
 actually already happy if with 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.010
 mmg times could play in offensive 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.080
 on the next picture I just have 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.820
 smoke, I just come to 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.830
 small point that I hope that 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.050
 You do not really smoke anymore 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.790
 can through the ground because in battlefield 3 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.620
 sometimes make with up throwers 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.150
 if you think and have it 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.130
 still that sometimes spotted 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.690
 and then he does not bring me much 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.540
 I would be happy if that dropped out 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.310
 The next picture would show strong 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.080
 sparks when I for example like 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.419
 I can walk walker long so stop 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.820
 spark it and make it happen 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.590
 so spark in front of things are dazzle these 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.810
 he probably very extreme because of that 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.800
 I also believe that something could happen 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.570
 get annoying 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.070
 that also has the little things one man 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.400
 First hey says it only by spark 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.919
 but at some point you can do it too 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.330
 now and then in kiel and lose 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.250
 then you say it all over again 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.539
 nice stupid that spark therefore 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.520
 noteworthy 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.280
 in addition here still this muzzle fire 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.380
 because this time the minigun of the helicopter 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.320
 It's not without it 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.880
 I think so even my own 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.860
 I can hide my whole opponent 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.570
 just ask me now why do you do that 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.310
 now necessarily makes the minigun's 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.560
 against infantry 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.240
 such a difficult thing so sometimes 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.950
 the really good of his party was very 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.169
 shoot with the thing opponent on it and 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.410
 he curses me over again 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.970
 that's why it's one even if he is 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.930
 no disadvantage if he is through 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.419
 Obviously, it is obvious 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.979
 logically more difficult to 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.180
 to meet 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.090
 well, hopefully you have the video 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.620
 A review would be great 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.840
 otherwise on twitter on facebook for 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.070
 I'm definitely looking forward and 70 at 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.070
 next time three people
