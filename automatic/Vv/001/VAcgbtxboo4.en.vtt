00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
have a cleaning water source other than

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.210 
have a cleaning water source other than
that<00:00:26.029> well<00:00:27.029> that's<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.300> good<00:00:27.420> question<00:00:28.220> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that well that's a good question that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.070 
that well that's a good question that
hundred<00:00:29.490> gallons<00:00:29.820> could<00:00:29.970> last<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.420> family<00:00:30.779> for

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
hundred gallons could last a family for

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.810 
hundred gallons could last a family for
I<00:00:31.320> don't<00:00:31.529> know<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> month<00:00:31.830> maybe<00:00:32.130> two<00:00:32.219> depending

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
I don't know a month maybe two depending

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
I don't know a month maybe two depending
on<00:00:32.910> how<00:00:33.000> much<00:00:33.120> you're<00:00:33.329> using<00:00:33.739> they<00:00:34.739> say<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
on how much you're using they say the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.389 
on how much you're using they say the
average<00:00:35.450> to<00:00:36.450> estimate<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.890> gallon<00:00:38.370> per

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
average to estimate one gallon per

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.810 
average to estimate one gallon per
person<00:00:38.640> per<00:00:39.090> day<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.989> all<00:00:40.500> water<00:00:40.800> needs<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
person per day for all water needs and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.280 
person per day for all water needs and
that's<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.300> mean<00:00:42.719> that's<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.020> minimum

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
that's I mean that's a minimum

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.350 
that's I mean that's a minimum
considering<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.340> you're<00:00:44.700> not<00:00:44.820> taking<00:00:45.120> long

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
considering like you're not taking long

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.190 
considering like you're not taking long
showers<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.930> stuff<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.289> course<00:00:47.239> but<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
showers and stuff of course but what is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.010 
showers and stuff of course but what is
your<00:00:49.440> other<00:00:49.559> solution<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.989> other

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
your other solution and the other

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.470 
your other solution and the other
solution<00:00:52.260> has<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.449> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
solution has to be you have to have a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.479 
solution has to be you have to have a
source<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.230> water<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.430> able

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
source of water and you have to be able

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.450 
source of water and you have to be able
to<00:00:56.610> purify<00:00:56.850> your<00:00:57.180> filter<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.690> water<00:00:58.010> now<00:00:59.010> if

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
to purify your filter that water now if

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.650 
to purify your filter that water now if
you<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> go<00:00:59.910> through<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> boiling<00:01:00.449> process

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you want to go through a boiling process

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.439 
you want to go through a boiling process
okay<00:01:01.260> great<00:01:01.530> that's<00:01:01.820> gonna<00:01:02.820> take<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> while<00:01:03.090> but

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
okay great that's gonna take a while but

a<00:02:42.970> connector<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.239> allows<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.780> go<00:02:45.709> right

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
a connector that allows you to go right

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.750 
a connector that allows you to go right
from<00:02:46.160> your<00:02:46.250> faucet<00:02:46.610> in<00:02:47.410> your<00:02:48.410> house<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:49.730> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
from your faucet in your house to the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.199 
from your faucet in your house to the
filtration<00:02:50.420> system<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:51.200> that's<00:02:52.160> if<00:02:52.520> let's

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
filtration system and that's if let's

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.820 
filtration system and that's if let's
say<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:54.020> water<00:02:54.260> source<00:02:54.620> may<00:02:54.800> be

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
say the water source may be

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.260 
say the water source may be
contaminating<00:02:55.489> it<00:02:55.550> right<00:02:55.730> from<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.030> city

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
contaminating it right from the city

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.470 
contaminating it right from the city
boom<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.290> can<00:02:57.410> use<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.680> right<00:02:57.800> filter<00:02:58.480> but

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
boom you can use the right filter but

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.150 
boom you can use the right filter but
this<00:02:59.660> is<00:02:59.840> what<00:02:59.959> we're<00:03:00.080> gonna<00:03:00.170> use<00:03:00.260> right<00:03:00.920> here

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
now that we have our hole we stick our

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:42.270 
now that we have our hole we stick our
mail<00:04:35.690> end<00:04:35.990> into<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:37.210> buckets<00:04:39.790> see<00:04:40.790> there

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
mail end into the buckets see there

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.440 
mail end into the buckets see there
there<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:43.430> is<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.810> then<00:04:45.290> we<00:04:45.410> stick<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.900> o-ring

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
there it is and then we stick the o-ring

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:58.770 
there it is and then we stick the o-ring
on<00:04:51.670> and<00:04:52.670> finally

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:12.690 

our<00:05:00.450> connector

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.200 

okay<00:05:13.420> so<00:05:13.480> now<00:05:13.660> that<00:05:13.720> we<00:05:13.870> have<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.080> solid<00:05:14.290> seal

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
okay so now that we have that solid seal

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.780 
okay so now that we have that solid seal
now<00:05:16.210> we<00:05:16.270> just<00:05:16.570> connect<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:18.220> soy<00:05:18.430> or<00:05:18.580> water

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
now we just connect the soy or water

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.530 
now we just connect the soy or water
filter<00:05:19.770> to<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.860> end<00:05:21.010> here<00:05:21.330> before<00:05:22.330> we<00:05:22.420> do<00:05:22.510> that

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
filter to the end here before we do that

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:35.040 
filter to the end here before we do that
though<00:05:22.870> let's<00:05:24.750> put<00:05:25.750> our<00:05:27.720> strap<00:05:28.720> guy<00:05:28.990> on

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050

and<00:05:35.530> voila<00:05:36.250> there<00:05:36.849> we<00:05:37.000> go<00:05:37.139> now<00:05:38.139> we<00:05:38.199> can<00:05:38.410> just

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
and voila there we go now we can just

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:50.070 
and voila there we go now we can just
hook<00:05:39.069> it<00:05:39.190> on<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.330> bucket<00:05:40.629> like<00:05:41.620> so<00:05:46.770> okay<00:05:49.080> okay

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
hook it on the bucket like so okay okay

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.749 
hook it on the bucket like so okay okay
we're<00:05:50.199> gonna<00:05:50.289> put<00:05:50.530> this<00:05:50.680> water<00:05:51.250> filtration

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
we're gonna put this water filtration

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.070 
we're gonna put this water filtration
system<00:05:52.330> to<00:05:52.449> the<00:05:52.539> test

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080
