00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
draw a bullet with a rotation and did

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.429 
draw a bullet with a rotation and did
the<00:01:08.939> same<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.960> player<00:01:11.360> on<00:01:12.360> Windows<00:01:13.229> go

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the same in the player on Windows go

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.010 
the same in the player on Windows go
animation<00:01:14.240> rotation<00:01:15.240> sequence<00:01:15.420> counter

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
animation rotation sequence counter

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.230 
animation rotation sequence counter
clockwise<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.979> through<00:01:17.310> 359<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:19.189> then<00:01:20.240> so

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
clockwise and do through 359 and then so

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.380 
clockwise and do through 359 and then so
should<00:01:21.540> create<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.049> spinny<00:01:23.030> thing

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
should create this spinny thing

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
should create this spinny thing
they<00:01:24.990> did<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.260> same<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.800> bullet<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.550> you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
they did the same to the bullet and you

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.380 
they did the same to the bullet and you
make<00:01:27.330> sure<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.690> bullet<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.620> want<00:01:28.860> your<00:01:29.390> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
bullet is wide like mine and you do

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.850 
bullet is wide like mine and you do
rotation<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.540> rotation<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
rotation the rotation will get out of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.249 
rotation the rotation will get out of
the<00:01:46.979> image<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.490> won't<00:01:47.850> work<00:01:47.900> just<00:01:48.900> do<00:01:49.229> it

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
the image so that won't work just do it

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.190 
the image so that won't work just do it
to<00:01:49.500> mine<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.270> when<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.930> spins

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
to mine you can see that when it spins

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.749 
to mine you can see that when it spins
everything<00:01:52.800> fits<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> image<00:01:53.960> yeah<00:01:55.759> okay

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759

in the wall I just drew this wall you
know<00:02:00.690> just<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> wall<00:02:01.470> you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.100> just

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
know just in the wall you can get just

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.730 
know just in the wall you can get just

prey on ball find your final wall online
and<00:02:08.600> let's<00:02:09.600> start<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.500> object<00:02:10.709> player

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
and let's start in the object player

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.910 
and let's start in the object player
object<00:02:12.269> play<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.870> want<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.140> execute<00:02:13.739> this

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
object play you want to execute this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.680 
object play you want to execute this
code<00:02:14.220> um<00:02:16.220> okay<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.250> what<00:02:17.489> this<00:02:17.640> code<00:02:17.880> did<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.330> um

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
code um okay so what this code did is um

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.850 
code um okay so what this code did is um
it<00:02:19.050> has<00:02:19.260> an<00:02:19.560> image<00:02:20.519> index<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:22.170> that's<00:02:22.410> um

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
it has an image index so that's um

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.729 
it has an image index so that's um
that's<00:02:23.360> telling<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.540> rotate<00:02:24.989> down<00:02:25.230> giving

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
that's telling the rotate down giving

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.590 
that's telling the rotate down giving
the<00:02:25.890> rotation<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> sprite<00:02:30.239> and

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
the rotation in the in the sprite and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.539 
the rotation in the in the sprite and
this<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:32.030> giving<00:02:33.140> direction<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.980> mouse<00:02:35.220> or

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
this is giving direction to the mouse or

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.640 
this is giving direction to the mouse or
standard<00:02:36.180> telling<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.959> follow<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.440> mouse

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
standard telling you to follow the mouse

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.880 
standard telling you to follow the mouse
and<00:02:37.980> speed<00:02:38.459> equal<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.820> 0<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.440> doesn't<00:02:40.769> move

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
and speed equal to 0 so it doesn't move

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.220 
and speed equal to 0 so it doesn't move
but<00:02:41.160> if<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.430> keyboard<00:02:42.030> checks<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.600> what<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:42.989> did

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
but if the keyboard checks to what I did

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.460 
but if the keyboard checks to what I did
here<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.440> all<00:02:44.060> W<00:02:45.230> dumb<00:02:47.000> brackets<00:02:48.000> or<00:02:48.470> brackets

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
here is all W dumb brackets or brackets

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.340 
here is all W dumb brackets or brackets
w<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.130> close<00:02:50.370> brackets<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.450> what<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.290> does

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
w in close brackets and what this does

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.900 
w in close brackets and what this does
is<00:02:52.680> check<00:02:52.920> for<00:02:53.160> keyboard<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.910> do<00:02:54.150> for<00:02:54.900> example

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
is check for keyboard to do for example

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.780 
is check for keyboard to do for example
up<00:02:56.910> down<00:02:57.360> left<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.320> right<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.709> do<00:02:58.920> or<00:02:59.310> any

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
up down left and right you do or any

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.000 
up down left and right you do or any
other<00:03:00.269> key<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.410> could<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.890> do

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
other key it but you could have to do

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.170 
other key it but you could have to do
odd<00:03:02.250> for<00:03:03.410> alphabets<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.709> if<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.190> want<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.549> to

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
odd for alphabets so if I want to do to

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.600 
odd for alphabets so if I want to do to
do<00:03:06.329> up<00:03:06.750> for<00:03:07.110> example<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.620> go<00:03:07.739> VK<00:03:08.280> on<00:03:08.489> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
do up for example you go VK on the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.680 
do up for example you go VK on the
scroll<00:03:08.850> up<00:03:09.410> that's<00:03:10.410> up<00:03:10.650> arrow<00:03:10.890> key<00:03:11.540> but<00:03:12.540> I'm

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
scroll up that's up arrow key but I'm

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.440 
scroll up that's up arrow key but I'm
going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.989> stick<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.470> all<00:03:14.120> because<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
going to stick it to all because I

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.480 
going to stick it to all because I

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
um wasd so yeah and you do speed five

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.370 
um wasd so yeah and you do speed five
maybe<00:03:25.000> five<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.570> can<00:03:25.690> change<00:03:25.960> that<00:03:26.170> to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
maybe five you can change that to

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.000

you get the exact place so i just made

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.650 
you get the exact place so i just made
icons<00:04:00.190> just<00:04:00.430> played<00:04:00.640> around<00:04:00.790> with<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.270> until<00:04:01.330> i

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
icons just played around with it until i

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.720 
icons just played around with it until i
got<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.990> perfect<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:03.340> only<00:04:03.430> make<00:04:03.640> sure

got it perfect and you only make sure
you<00:04:03.820> take<00:04:03.940> relative<00:04:04.450> um<00:04:05.970> speed<00:04:06.970> five<00:04:07.750> and

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
you take relative um speed five and

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.340 
you take relative um speed five and
directing<00:04:09.970> equals<00:04:10.210> direction<00:04:10.660> or<00:04:10.810> speed<00:04:11.050> can

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
directing equals direction or speed can

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.060 
directing equals direction or speed can
be<00:04:11.380> whatever<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.860> feel<00:04:12.130> like<00:04:13.680> see<00:04:14.680> if<00:04:14.740> i<00:04:14.830> miss

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
be whatever you feel like see if i miss

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.650 
be whatever you feel like see if i miss
something<00:04:15.400> around<00:04:15.820> here<00:04:16.270> I<00:04:17.880> know<00:04:18.880> okay<00:04:19.360> so

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
something around here I know okay so

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.220 
something around here I know okay so
that's<00:04:20.020> dr.<00:04:20.440> player<00:04:20.739> object<00:04:21.660> bullet<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:22.870> undo

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
that's dr. player object bullet you undo

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.200 
that's dr. player object bullet you undo
a<00:04:24.090> create<00:04:25.090> eight<00:04:25.740> great<00:04:26.740> event<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.220> you<00:04:28.030> want

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
a create eight great event and you want

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.060 
a create eight great event and you want
to<00:04:28.330> move<00:04:28.600> towards<00:04:29.140> mouse<00:04:29.350> on<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.680> school<00:04:29.860> X

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
to move towards mouse on the school X

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.340 
to move towards mouse on the school X
and<00:04:30.340> mouth<00:04:30.460> on<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:30.700> goal<00:04:30.850> line<00:04:31.050> speed<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.170> 10

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
and mouth on the goal line speed of 10

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.790 
and mouth on the goal line speed of 10
um<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:34.180> that's<00:04:34.390> basically<00:04:34.660> making<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.560> thing

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
um so that's basically making the thing

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.040 
um so that's basically making the thing
move<00:04:35.980> towards<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.910> this<00:04:37.240> is<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.510> same<00:04:37.750> as

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
move towards and this is the same as

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.810 
move towards and this is the same as
before<00:04:38.670> this<00:04:39.670> is<00:04:39.850> just<00:04:39.970> letting<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.590> rotate<00:04:41.820> in

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
before this is just letting it rotate in

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.510 
before this is just letting it rotate in
your<00:04:43.060> direction<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.690> you're<00:04:43.840> in<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.950> then<00:04:45.370> I

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
your direction that you're in and then I

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.060 
your direction that you're in and then I
just<00:04:45.700> did<00:04:45.850> a<00:04:45.910> collision<00:04:46.600> wall<00:04:46.930> event<00:04:47.380> destroy

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
just did a collision wall event destroy

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.290 
just did a collision wall event destroy
it<00:04:48.130> instance<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.280> object<00:04:51.400> ball<00:04:51.820> I

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
it instance and in the object ball I

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.660 
it instance and in the object ball I
just<00:04:52.600> put<00:04:52.750> nothing<00:04:53.080> in<00:04:53.200> there<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:54.400> now<00:04:54.610> you

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
just put nothing in there so now you

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.340 
just put nothing in there so now you
just<00:04:54.790> want<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.300> next<00:04:55.750> step<00:04:55.900> you<00:04:56.050> want<00:04:56.170> to<00:04:56.230> set

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
just want to next step you want to set

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.490 
just want to next step you want to set
up<00:04:56.440> your<00:04:56.560> room<00:04:56.740> so<00:04:56.920> I<00:04:56.980> just<00:04:57.010> made<00:04:57.310> this<00:04:57.430> room

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
up your room so I just made this room

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
room and yeah so sure that works a

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.670 
room and yeah so sure that works a
little<00:05:06.730> glitch<00:05:07.090> on<00:05:07.360> collision<00:05:07.990> wall<00:05:08.320> but<00:05:08.560> you

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
little glitch on collision wall but you

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.920 
little glitch on collision wall but you
know<00:05:08.800> that's<00:05:08.980> fine<00:05:09.250> as<00:05:09.880> you<00:05:10.000> can<00:05:10.090> see<00:05:10.270> but<00:05:10.630> you
