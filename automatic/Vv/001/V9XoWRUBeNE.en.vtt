00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
as we can you know these big bikes are

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.910 
as we can you know these big bikes are
pretty<00:02:27.240> heavy<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:28.260> want<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.560> get<00:02:28.680> as<00:02:28.770> much

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
pretty heavy so we want to get as much

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.830 
pretty heavy so we want to get as much
as<00:02:29.100> we<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.580> help<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.970> thing<00:02:30.180> get<00:02:30.420> moving

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
definitely it doesn't have a drop seat

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.750 
definitely it doesn't have a drop seat
in<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:43.800> nothing<00:02:44.100> we've<00:02:44.220> definitely<00:02:44.400> got<00:02:44.730> a

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
in it for nothing we've definitely got a

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.240 
in it for nothing we've definitely got a
hold<00:02:44.970> onto<00:02:45.150> it

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
in the Freestyle class with this bike is

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.830 
in the Freestyle class with this bike is
that<00:03:26.519> because<00:03:26.790> you'd<00:03:26.940> modified<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.600> frame

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
that because you'd modified the frame

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.690 
that because you'd modified the frame
right<00:03:28.290> because<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:28.860> cut<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.220> raped<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.579> got
