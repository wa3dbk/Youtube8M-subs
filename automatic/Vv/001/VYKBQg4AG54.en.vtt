00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
just silly and it's wrong and I feel

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.720 
just silly and it's wrong and I feel
like<00:02:17.560> Naturals<00:02:17.950> have<00:02:18.100> gone<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> little<00:02:18.460> too<00:02:18.580> far

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
like Naturals have gone a little too far

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.480 
like Naturals have gone a little too far
with<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.330> whole<00:02:19.360> natural<00:02:20.140> Nazi<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.250> just

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
with the whole natural Nazi and just

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.940 
with the whole natural Nazi and just
hurting<00:02:22.150> people's<00:02:22.480> feelings<00:02:22.770> because<00:02:23.770> of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
hurting people's feelings because of

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.730 
hurting people's feelings because of
what<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.430> perceive<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.940> be<00:02:25.120> right<00:02:25.420> and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
what you perceive to be right and

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.050 
what you perceive to be right and
probably<00:02:26.740> what<00:02:26.920> is<00:02:27.100> right<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.000> doesn't

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
probably what is right but it doesn't

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.120 
probably what is right but it doesn't
matter<00:02:28.390> there's<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.080> right<00:02:29.350> way<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:30.100> wrong

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
matter there's a right way and a wrong

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.130 
matter there's a right way and a wrong
way<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.550> go<00:02:30.760> about<00:02:30.790> things<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.600> what<00:02:32.050> I'm

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
way to go about things and what I'm

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.550 
way to go about things and what I'm
