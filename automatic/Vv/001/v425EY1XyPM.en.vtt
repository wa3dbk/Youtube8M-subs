00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.509
 impossible a range of models 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.940
 used in the same price range as a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.130
 popular national zero kilometer and I 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.599
 whether it is worth it or not 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.760
 so they are everywhere. 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.150
 part of the newspaper ranks looks 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.109
 that I found an audi a6 at 95 and 14 thousand 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.080
 real 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.210

 well before it 's good you know of some 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.550
 things 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.290
 planning is necessary so that the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.450
 imported does not become a 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.980
 present from Greek is now more or less 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.940
 What happened to a short film? 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.850
 Brazilian bmw 2008 who would have done the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.190
 Theft of the car there will have to collaborate 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.350
 with me in the kitty for gas 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.890
 The character of Augustus Augusto is 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.840
 contemplated with a bmw 325 no draw 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.239
 without the condition of paying 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.159
 and insurance the way it was charged 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.330
 of people who wanted to know the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.050
 brat 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:16.620
 my baby car already the testimony of who 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.120
 experienced that says it all in maintenance 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.610
 when you break some piece a 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.440
 It's difficult for us to get very 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.080
 I'm afraid of the amount to pay 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.690
 his last concert the mechanic spoke 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.820
 that at 70 years 20 thousand occurred when 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.720
 the way he does not think he spoke 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.190
 what was going to stay 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.050
 even with a little more salty 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.510
 because the car does not accept parallel parts 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.760
 only originals that are much more expensive 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.410
 these parts makes the car maintains 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.470
 in the workshop, even with the 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.540
 wear it is very fast because this is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.729
 the problem and it seems that there is already a lot of 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.410
 people knowing this a survey of the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.780

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.450
 automotive in the state of sÃ£o paulo 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.330
 champions looking for a car with 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.520

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.580
 problems in the automatic transmission is a 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.550
 expensive repair may present problems in the 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.370
 abs also that expensive repair is the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.100
 air suspension may have a damper 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.230
 with the bag pierced a costing piece 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.570
 around six thousand reais so 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.390
 take the decision to purchase an imported 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.570

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.410
 used first you should look for your 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.540
 mechanic to make a 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.130

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.320
