single<00:01:24.299> lens<00:01:24.680> but<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> 160<00:01:26.369> uses<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> duel<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
single lens but the 160 uses a duel and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.940 
single lens but the 160 uses a duel and
so<00:01:27.600> what<00:01:27.689> happened<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.049> my<00:01:28.290> friend<00:01:28.590> ended<00:01:28.770> up

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
so what happened was my friend ended up

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.859 
so what happened was my friend ended up
ordering<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.490> wrong<00:01:29.700> lens<00:01:29.970> could<00:01:30.450> fix<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.840> for

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
ordering the wrong lens could fix it for

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.020 
ordering the wrong lens could fix it for
him<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.710> single<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.220> it'll<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.000> one

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
him the single that it'll just be one

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.730 
him the single that it'll just be one
ends<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> middle<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.020> careful<00:01:34.560> when

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740

it apart and this literally just slides
right<00:01:42.869> off<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.619> shaft<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.250> goal<00:01:44.460> is

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
right off the shaft but this goal is

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.920 
right off the shaft but this goal is
that<00:01:44.759> before<00:01:44.880> from<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> shop<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.659> so
