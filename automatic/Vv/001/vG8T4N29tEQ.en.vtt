00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.880
 talk about the things that I do for 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.289
 keep my hydrate what I add 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.199
 I do when I want to give a little 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.850
 more of flavor and all those things that in 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.800
 it's really super super important that 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.240
 we all have water to start if you 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.120
 you are one of those who do not drink water by 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.460
 pause this video for a glass of water 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:34.280
 then you come back and while you are 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.010
 taking still the video take water 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.110
 makes all the difference your skin and your 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.940
 face they will be more hydrated will take 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.710
 Water reduces fatigue and anxiety 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.960
 then apart you're going to be 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.760
 good you're going to be super active indeed 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.829
 right now we're going to be in finals and 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.769
 exams and all that if you want to be 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.719
 I wake up more than a coffee or red bull or 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.489
 what is best is that you take a 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.440
 glass of water with lots of ice and that 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.120
 will help you wake up if you want 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.989
 have a hair like rapunzel you have 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.460
 to drink water 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.679
 If you want to lose weight or you are on a diet 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.840
 you need to drink water if you want to eliminate 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.970
 toxins takes water and finally 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.670
 obviously helps your kidneys and your 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.040
 blood are extremely happy to 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.600
 those who could not have as 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.790
 sometimes I put them on twitter that I 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.580
 ask questions and like that and usually I 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.980
 they put how can I be healthy and 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.740
 what can I eat to be healthy and 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.990
 as underweight and how to lose 5 kilos and 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.510
 all those things so I can think of 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.890
 give them some advice in case you 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.200
 they still do not drink water to start 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.180
 to take the number 1 drink water before 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.070
 sleep and when you wake up this is the best 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.320
 advice to start drinking water because 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.250
 you're going to do it out of habit 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.540
 we supposedly need to make a 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.850
 activity for twenty one days 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.590
 constant to make it a habit I'll 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.450
 I recommend that you do a routine so that 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.430
 you know exactly when you're going to 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.540
 drinking water sounds very exaggerated but 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.369
 believe me you will be helped 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.050
 you really get used to it, it's not me 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.520
 always after putting on makeup I take 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.200
 a glass of water that is like what 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.479
 already established a long time ago and if I do not 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.280
 I feel like something is missing too 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.990
 before going to sleep I like to have a 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.610
 glass and niboro with water so that when 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.190
 wake up the first thing you do is take 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.020
 water number 2 have a water bottle 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.610
 always at hand if you always have water 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.170
 near you most likely do not get 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.239
 It's hard to take it for me 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.770
 much better to buy a nice thermos 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.570
 and they're using instead of buying 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.800
 bottles and all that because apart from that 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.050
 you are saving money 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.970
 and helps to no longer generate so much garbage the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.770
 truth is that having the bottle in the 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.940
 little store really is not having the water 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.550
 close as you need to have 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.490
 literally does it or literally the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.410
 bottle so as not to force yourself to take it 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.240
 but as if to know that it's there that the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.590
 you can drink if you prefer to buy water 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.020
 bottled because it gives you laziness 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.150
 load it I recommend you recycle 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.420
 these bottles and go leaving as 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.160
 little bird like one in each type place in 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.140
 your car, they came in what was 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.940
 one in your office and so we will have in 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.910
 the car because as always I saw it 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.820
 in traffic I like to relax and 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.230
 can take water number 3 uses alarms yes 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.480
 even if you have something nearby you take it 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.130
 with alarms so that the super 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.290
 exaggerated but it will really help you 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.970
 for saying what you can do is that if 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.580
 you're used to eating at 3 o'clock 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.900
 late then paranÃ¡ alarm the 250 for 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.610
 that you know that you have to take your 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.620
 glass of water drink a glass of water before 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.560
 eating helps you to input and no 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.060
 be like with the empty tummy then 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.900
 you will be satisfied a lot more 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.450
 Quick 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.879
 for small steps the ideal would be that 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.560
 you will completely leave juices and drinks 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.840
 all those things is that nothing else have 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.329
 sugar and make us have bad pig 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.920
 but obviously that is not going to happen the day 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.569
 in the morning you can start taking steps 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.060
 little ones like maybe once a 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.459
 week do not eat or with water that has 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.590
 sugar or soda or anything and nothing else 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.900
 eat with natural water and number five it 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.760
 tina you like the natural or already cake is 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.590
 you can always put flavor and that if 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.769
 have the same benefits my three 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.810
 easy exits without pressure ice or 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.370
 fruit in any of the three you can 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.170
 start analyzing and you will see that 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.000
 as time goes by, you are not going to 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.129
 need so much sugar or are you going to 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.440
 completely remove I'm super sweet 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.170
 and before I put sugar in coffee and tea 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.329
 and all that and right now is how it hits me 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.400
 have sugar for the first option 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.379
 all you have to do is grab 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.750
 any tea bag and put from the 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.750
 guardianship wait like two minutes and ready 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.440
 the second option the best thing is that what 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.770
 do at night you are going to grab the fruit 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.430
 You want to put it on your skin 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.680
 it was or I do not know what it's called where do you 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.840
 We are going to add water to it. 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.220
 leave frozen all night and daily 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.900
 next nothing else are you going to put the 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.770
 cubes in a glass of water or in your 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.770
 bottle and ready 

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:53.459
 and if you did not have time to do it 

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:55.559
 previous night what you can do is 

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.830
 just put fruit and add 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:57.830
 ice 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.009
 and this I take as by times as 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.750
 when I feel like I was eating very 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.370
 bad or I feel very heavy and I want 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.560
 clean my tummy you can take it 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.940
 daily for as long as you want and 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.789
 you will help remove all 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.520
 toxins you're going to need a sachet of 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:23.940
 green tea a lemon a spoonful of honey 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.639
 or it's lukewarm or any sweetener one 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.380
 company and a cucumber are you going to do this and 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.240
 as you always do but without adding 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.130
 nothing not you going to put sugar is 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.080
 let it cool approximately 5 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.880
 minutes at the club after those five 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.100
 minutes let's add the cucumber the 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.020
 lemon the strawberries and the sweetener that is 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.360
 preferred but I recommend that you use 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.979
 honey because it 's a thousand times better you're going to 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.620
 stir and you can add ice if 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.210
 you want these were my tips for 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.680
 drink water if you liked the video of 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.870
