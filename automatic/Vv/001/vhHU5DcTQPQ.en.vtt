this<00:05:00.840> is<00:05:01.050> kind<00:05:01.260> of<00:05:01.320> neat<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:01.950> that's<00:05:02.700> it<00:05:03.350> we're

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
this is kind of neat and that's it we're

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.120 
this is kind of neat and that's it we're
now<00:05:04.470> at<00:05:04.760> 65,000<00:05:05.760> miles<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.530> suppose<00:05:07.890> it'll

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
now at 65,000 miles and I suppose it'll

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.800 
now at 65,000 miles and I suppose it'll
be<00:05:08.250> there<00:05:08.460> for<00:05:08.670> quite<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.910> while<00:05:09.120> let<00:05:09.510> me<00:05:09.600> put

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
be there for quite a while let me put

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.040 
be there for quite a while let me put
200<00:05:10.170> and<00:05:10.290> 9.3<00:05:11.250> miles<00:05:11.520> on<00:05:11.790> this<00:05:11.940> thing<00:05:12.210> because

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
200 and 9.3 miles on this thing because

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:21.590 
200 and 9.3 miles on this thing because
I<00:05:13.230> got<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:15.080> let's<00:05:16.080> see

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.290 

I<00:05:21.660> guess<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.740> is<00:05:22.770> our<00:05:24.020> result<00:05:25.020> controls<00:05:25.740> on<00:05:26.310> the

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
I guess it is our result controls on the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.160 
I guess it is our result controls on the
steering<00:05:27.330> wheel<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:30.330> of<00:05:30.450> course<00:05:30.660> to<00:05:30.690> select
