00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.870
 in other 4 he can actually get to know him on the internet as he brings 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.590
 This took the kids sitting to work out of the countries learning here 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.990
 Then put the door to their lesson in their exit 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.990
 can 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.210
 In this respect, everyone in the area is important 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.750
 his drives 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.570
 under control has in the field 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.929
 so nice it is to chat with friends 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.709
 it works should you still find travels Ehrenbrink 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.260
 As against the end, there is such a huge amount of work again 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.040
 to the lessons you can ride the terrain, among other things 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.930
 Blame it or sometimes through barriers or times hold or build 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.060
 be it alone or in the group 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.050
 actually only serves 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.240
 Dr righteousness or attention or that where pink must that spear the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.770
 is so that one always has the feeling one has its feat 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 in which he or different situations absolutely under control 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.380
 This training can playfully incorporate the exit 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.530
 "If you place hard and crazy 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.979
 to not always want to ride on these forest trails 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.380
 you can choose somewhere in LÃ¶hne meadow and next to there big 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.400
 directly create where you say okay percent because you want to ride now 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.580
 Many riders like to have their horses in the area 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.600
 warns that bringing it closer is important that I will 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.440
 to be worked in the field and not only on the long reins or on the Main 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.140
 Nose and head high you run the forest 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719
 Roland controls 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.719
 and irritable 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.829
 OK, one more time 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.759
 so you stay upside down you should definitely not be wearing it 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.780
 Also a good exercise are stepped reinforcements 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.379
 they can easily be used anywhere 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.289
 the gifts there then you can go well with thigh switches 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.969
 exhibited last 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.129
 m but on has 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.919
 also reduce the lesson quadrangle and enlarge a good gymnastics fourth 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.049
 Point 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.049
 Of course the rider has to think of a victory 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:40.589
 Advanced riders and horses can also be good at the Travel 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:42.009
 his work 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.009
 This can be done in the Trabreiten 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.929
 Of course, at a gallop 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.929
 they have something too far inside 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.739
 Philipp Straub expects then looks a bit better 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.469
 Traveling can be done well at the institutes 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.469
 and now comes a new front wing 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.430
 also reducing the circuit is a good exercise around the inner hind leg 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.859
 so far that's calling 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.209
 and it multiplied and represented 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.209
 and so could bring the focus 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.059
 a quarter can then also from the outside auftreibt 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.040
 this strengthens the outer hind leg 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.040
 and 11 it would be almost mandatory 2 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:33.789
 Finally, you can also work alternately on the flying ball 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:36.789
 because you need the latest in the field test 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.759
 in order to obtain an off-road test also the value on condition 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.759
 that is why it is then processed 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.049
 as she continues to keep her profession to five different 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.879
 for tempo differences it in the more or less intervals 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.640
 which you should also do in gallop training or condition training said 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.519
 he and not too monotonous 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.839
 in a row can 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:04.039
 in addition, the gelatinous intervals promote permeability 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.989
 However, the rider must be careful that the car will not just grow 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.809
 the reins DAX mostly and gas gives 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:14.609
 then the work goes up and down during the day gives strength to the left 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:15.089
 hand 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:18.489
 initially should be on first in the cut 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.609
 the buy and the down so now I first count reason 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.110
 and then I start to trot slowly it's important that the horse comes after 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.509
 stays nice in the feeder 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.990
 that'll be mostly in the reason then slowly trotting so you should on 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.650
 do not lose and speed or fast gallop or ride the 

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:38.719
 he uphill 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:42.159
 but this also endangers musculature and strength 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.449
 try everything in the lead in the ruins 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.490
 to ride uphill again at a relatively calm pace 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.629
 our better further topics in the plant then again 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.629
 in the first attempt are still too far apart 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.900
 Often you should not do that in the north 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.969
 the products will be the same 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.529
 To become a preacher 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.309
 that goes for them balloons to lightweight 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.139
 the ferry is incredibly nice to him 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.189
 Now he only has to keep a spark 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.849
 he should get a stretch of this maybe 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.129
 Mark meters 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.129
 so in a certain time so Reid 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.779
 founded 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.039
 because that does not work
