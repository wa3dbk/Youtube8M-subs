area with with the gradient man that

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.960 
area with with the gradient man that
spectators<00:03:23.200> available<00:03:23.769> not<00:03:24.489> only<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.819> amount

of<00:03:25.090> spectators<00:03:25.510> but<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.720> noise<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.230> bet<00:03:26.859> for

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
of spectators but the noise I bet for

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.960 
of spectators but the noise I bet for
you<00:03:27.099> I<00:03:27.129> guess<00:03:27.370> you're<00:03:27.549> sitting<00:03:27.760> on<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:27.879> bike

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
you I guess you're sitting on the bike

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.280 
you I guess you're sitting on the bike
so<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.329> don't<00:03:28.480> hear<00:03:28.599> those<00:03:28.750> kinds<00:03:29.049> of<00:03:29.109> things

but for the spectators themselves the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.030 
but for the spectators themselves the
excitement<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.720> unbelievable<00:03:32.379> because<00:03:32.530> of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
excitement is unbelievable because of

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.039 
excitement is unbelievable because of
the<00:03:33.220> noise<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.790> fumes<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.420> atmosphere<00:03:34.900> and

the noise the fumes the atmosphere and
being<00:03:35.319> that<00:03:35.739> close<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.159> the<00:03:36.250> action<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:36.940> will

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
being that close to the action you will

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
promotion up there earlier in the season

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.280 
promotion up there earlier in the season
you<00:03:51.310> took<00:03:51.430> part<00:03:51.640> in<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.790> as<00:03:51.909> well<00:03:52.060> yes<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.540> did<00:03:52.780> no

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
you took part in it as well yes I did no

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.430 
you took part in it as well yes I did no
I<00:03:53.319> finished<00:03:53.970> fifth<00:03:54.970> overall<00:03:55.359> in<00:03:55.630> that<00:03:55.810> one<00:03:55.959> you

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
I finished fifth overall in that one you

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.960 
I finished fifth overall in that one you
actually<00:03:56.799> had<00:03:56.919> a<00:03:56.950> bit<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.280> bad<00:03:57.400> luck<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.669> fell

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
actually had a bit of bad luck I fell

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.580 
actually had a bit of bad luck I fell
off<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.959> that's<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.230> way<00:03:59.349> they're<00:03:59.530> supposed

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
off and that's the way they're supposed

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.370 
off and that's the way they're supposed
to<00:03:59.769> be<00:03:59.919> a<00:03:59.950> lot<00:04:00.130> of<00:04:00.220> falling<00:04:00.459> off<00:04:00.959> unless<00:04:01.959> that's

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
to be a lot of falling off unless that's

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.050 
to be a lot of falling off unless that's
motor<00:04:02.650> racing<00:04:03.069> you<00:04:03.220> never<00:04:03.430> know<00:04:03.579> what<00:04:03.849> what

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
motor racing you never know what what

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.559 
motor racing you never know what what
can<00:04:04.239> happen

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
can happen

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.539 
can happen
but<00:04:05.079> in<00:04:05.230> this<00:04:05.319> particular<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:06.099> mean<00:04:06.250> at<00:04:06.340> the

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
but in this particular I mean at the

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.039 
but in this particular I mean at the
circuit<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:07.000> guess<00:04:07.150> is<00:04:07.299> so<00:04:07.480> tight<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:07.959> the

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
circuit I guess is so tight and the

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.839 
circuit I guess is so tight and the
starts<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.530> guess<00:04:08.709> must<00:04:08.919> be<00:04:09.010> all-important<00:04:09.609> yes

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
starts I guess must be all-important yes

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.400 
starts I guess must be all-important yes
it's<00:04:10.090> very<00:04:10.120> important<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.780> get<00:04:10.900> out<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.230> gate

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
it's very important to get out the gate

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.800 
it's very important to get out the gate
really<00:04:11.859> quick<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.579> to<00:04:13.239> get<00:04:13.359> from<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.569> first

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
really quick and to get from the first

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.770 
really quick and to get from the first
corner<00:04:14.169> first<00:04:14.349> is<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.709> big<00:04:15.190> advantage<00:04:15.720> tell<00:04:16.720> us

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
corner first is a big advantage tell us

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.360 
corner first is a big advantage tell us
a<00:04:16.810> bit<00:04:16.900> about<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.200> bikes<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.650> you<00:04:17.769> that<00:04:18.250> you

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
a bit about the bikes that you that you

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.819 
a bit about the bikes that you that you
ride<00:04:18.579> what<00:04:18.820> kind<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.120> development<00:04:19.720> has<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.739> go

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
ride what kind of development has to go

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:21.980 
ride what kind of development has to go
into<00:04:21.039> them<00:04:21.160> because<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.430> mean<00:04:21.639> obviously

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:21.990 
into them because I mean obviously

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.300 
into them because I mean obviously
suspension<00:04:22.990> has<00:04:23.199> to<00:04:23.320> be<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.979> has<00:04:24.039> to<00:04:24.220> be

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
suspension has to be it has to be

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.070 
suspension has to be it has to be
special<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.789> survive<00:04:25.240> this<00:04:25.479> kind<00:04:25.750> of<00:04:25.870> wear<00:04:26.050> and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
special to survive this kind of wear and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.409 
special to survive this kind of wear and
tear<00:04:26.349> it<00:04:26.919> was<00:04:27.099> a<00:04:27.220> pretty<00:04:27.430> demanding<00:04:27.820> sport

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
tear it was a pretty demanding sport

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.719 
tear it was a pretty demanding sport
with<00:04:29.410> Matt<00:04:29.620> across<00:04:29.949> the<00:04:30.190> Bark's<00:04:30.520> that's

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
with Matt across the Bark's that's

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.520 
with Matt across the Bark's that's
pretty<00:04:30.940> much<00:04:31.090> standard<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.780> could<00:04:31.960> fly<00:04:32.470> off

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
pretty much standard you could fly off

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.560 
pretty much standard you could fly off
the<00:04:32.740> suspension<00:04:33.250> a<00:04:33.340> little<00:04:33.550> bit<00:04:33.699> and<00:04:34.210> get<00:04:34.449> the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
the suspension a little bit and get the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.270 
the suspension a little bit and get the
matters<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.050> go<00:04:35.169> as<00:04:35.320> fast<00:04:35.470> as<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.830> can<00:04:36.010> because

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
matters to go as fast as you can because

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.550 
matters to go as fast as you can because
the<00:04:37.090> rights<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.510> first<00:04:37.660> corners<00:04:38.110> as<00:04:38.320> I

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
the rights to the first corners as I

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.650 
the rights to the first corners as I
said<00:04:38.740> was<00:04:38.949> the<00:04:39.010> biggest<00:04:39.340> part<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.820> especially

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
said was the biggest part and especially

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.930 
said was the biggest part and especially
in<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.900> Supercross<00:04:41.260> like<00:04:41.639> Sydney<00:04:42.639> and<00:04:42.760> I

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
in the Supercross like Sydney and I

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.520 
in the Supercross like Sydney and I
Mussina<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:44.830> really<00:04:45.039> helps<00:04:45.370> ever<00:04:45.580> fast

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
Mussina and it really helps ever fast

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.550 
Mussina and it really helps ever fast
so<00:04:46.920> there's<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.220> degree<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.900> luck<00:04:48.900> obviously

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
so there's a degree of luck obviously

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.470 
so there's a degree of luck obviously
involved<00:04:50.010> in<00:04:50.190> how<00:04:50.790> you<00:04:50.850> get<00:04:51.000> away<00:04:51.210> from<00:04:51.270> the

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
involved in how you get away from the

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.970 
involved in how you get away from the
start<00:04:51.750> but<00:04:51.930> obviously<00:04:52.260> is<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.440> fair<00:04:52.680> degree<00:04:52.800> of

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
start but obviously is a fair degree of

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.280 
start but obviously is a fair degree of
skill<00:04:53.580> despite<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.420> fact<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.870> track<00:04:55.110> is

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
skill despite the fact that the track is

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.900 
skill despite the fact that the track is
so<00:04:55.440> small<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.040> there's<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.310> much<00:04:56.430> crowded

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
so small and there's so much crowded
