 only basis of scientific studies that 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.530
 Its very important 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.180
 the need to continue studies 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.430
 on the disturbance and confusion of 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 species but also the need for 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.850
 hunters to take responsibility 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.859

 the unitary offensive which must

 now be conducted will bring in 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.380
 consequence on different things 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.490

 hunting and huntable species but 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.740
 also the acceleration of the 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.479
 scientific research and collection 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.310

 Bodin president pledged to make a 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.789
 step point next year on 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.979
 all these actions we have 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.090
 will definitely come back 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.049
 second information of that day you 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.020
 have probably read it in the after 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.030
 hunting or on the website of the fnc 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.120
 Drômois hunters have put in reserve 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.980
 more than fifty thousand hectares then 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.769
 same as the spa claim to have put 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.280
 it reserves barely 100 hectares 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.959
 that's what month hunters month 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.780
 call a nice operation be a 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.000
 area 500 times greater than 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.190
 of the acquisition of the spa which 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.290
 yet made a lot of noise 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.940
 France give more wings precisely 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.680
 to all of these acquisitions made 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.840
 especially through the foundation 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.700
 for the protection of the habitats of the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.010
 wildlife but also through all 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.569
 acquisitions that are made by the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.980
 hunters that represents many of 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.829
 tens of thousands of hectares in 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.540
 France and we must absolutely support 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.970
 this point and not let our 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.840
 contradictors show the few 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.290
 dozens of hectares that put in 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.150

 on the spot the hunters are easily 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.660
 identifiable by their vests 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.419
 fluorescent 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.580

 hunters at the top of ridges 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.349

 once on the spot hunter posted 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.470

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.590
 identified the game without this 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.360
 may pose a danger to others 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.250
 the firing angle must allow the 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.700
 ammunition to sink directly into 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:35.620
 floor 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:36.730
