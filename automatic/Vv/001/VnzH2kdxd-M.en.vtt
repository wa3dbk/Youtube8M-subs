00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
30s 40s 50s whatever I'm not as familiar

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.730 
30s 40s 50s whatever I'm not as familiar
with<00:01:12.240> Superman<00:01:12.720> lore<00:01:12.960> but<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.290> did<00:01:13.470> really

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
with Superman lore but I did really

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.260 
with Superman lore but I did really
appreciate<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.670> thought<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.090> Bruce

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
appreciate it and I thought that Bruce

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.810 
appreciate it and I thought that Bruce
Timm<00:01:15.540> did<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> great<00:01:16.080> job<00:01:16.110> animating<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
Timm did a great job animating it it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
Timm did a great job animating it it
also<00:01:17.970> had<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> lot<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.450> other<00:01:18.659> people<00:01:18.810> behind<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
also had a lot of other people behind it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.960 
also had a lot of other people behind it
I<00:01:19.500> don't<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.830> who<00:01:20.100> was<00:01:20.310> behind<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> be

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
I don't know who was behind it to be

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.670 
I don't know who was behind it to be
quite<00:01:21.210> honest<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.320> Zack

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
quite honest but I do know that Zack

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.070 
quite honest but I do know that Zack
Steiner<00:01:22.979> was<00:01:23.159> also<00:01:23.490> involved<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.450> think

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
Steiner was also involved so I think

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
Steiner was also involved so I think
that's<00:01:25.320> cool<00:01:25.759> but<00:01:26.759> yeah<00:01:26.909> when<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.090> did<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.420> is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that's cool but yeah when I did like is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
that's cool but yeah when I did like is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that you know it was really stylistic it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.719 
that you know it was really stylistic it
it<00:01:30.030> had<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.170> know<00:01:31.470> issues<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> comic

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it had you know issues of the comic

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.490 
it had you know issues of the comic
animated<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.720> would<00:01:33.869> show<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.380> know

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.210 
Superman with the crush car and the very
first<00:01:36.750> issue<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.530> heaven<00:01:37.829> throwing

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
first issue and then in heaven throwing

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.620 
first issue and then in heaven throwing
it<00:01:38.340> flying<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.210> thought<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.540> was

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
it flying out of it I thought that was

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.600 
it flying out of it I thought that was
really<00:01:39.720> cool<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:41.250> stuff<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
really cool so just stuff like that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.510 
really cool so just stuff like that
really<00:01:42.420> cool<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.680> music<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.159> also

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
really cool and the music was also

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.330 
really cool and the music was also
really<00:01:44.700> awesome<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.799> could<00:01:46.799> start<00:01:47.100> off

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
really awesome because could start off

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.090 
really awesome because could start off
with<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.880> original<00:01:48.750> Superman<00:01:49.500> theme<00:01:49.770> from

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
with the original Superman theme from

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.749 
with the original Superman theme from
the<00:01:50.220> first<00:01:51.170> cinematic<00:01:52.170> film<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.610> used

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the first cinematic film and it used

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.880 
the first cinematic film and it used
that<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.119> most<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:54.869> then<00:01:55.140> once<00:01:55.590> I

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
that for most of it but then once I

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.950 
that for most of it but then once I
think<00:01:56.189> Superman<00:01:56.759> started<00:01:57.180> fighting<00:01:57.450> doomsday

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
think Superman started fighting doomsday

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.359 
think Superman started fighting doomsday
and<00:01:58.140> stuff<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> starts<00:01:59.219> showing

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
and stuff and you know it starts showing

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.910 
and stuff and you know it starts showing
Superboy<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.689> stuff<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.829> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
Superboy and all that stuff then it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.499 
Superboy and all that stuff then it
switched<00:02:02.159> over<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> Man<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.790> Steel<00:02:02.939> theme

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
switched over to the Man of Steel theme

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.859 
switched over to the Man of Steel theme
and<00:02:04.520> me<00:02:05.520> know<00:02:05.640> maybe<00:02:05.850> slight<00:02:06.149> variations<00:02:06.719> on

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
and me know maybe slight variations on

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.779 
and me know maybe slight variations on
those<00:02:07.020> themes<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.920> thought<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.580> really

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
those themes but I thought it was really

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.790 
those themes but I thought it was really
cool<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.420> was<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.810> show<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.349> usher<00:02:10.649> in

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
cool and it was the show and usher in

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.120 
cool and it was the show and usher in
that

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
that

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.400 
that
new<00:02:11.250> sort<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:12.030> style<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.660> Superman<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.290> where

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
new sort of style of Superman and where

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470 
new sort of style of Superman and where
he's<00:02:13.530> going<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.820> did<00:02:14.970> have<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> little<00:02:15.360> bit

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
he's going and it did have a little bit

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.840 
he's going and it did have a little bit
of<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> new<00:02:15.810> 52<00:02:16.040> with<00:02:17.040> him<00:02:17.220> fighting<00:02:17.490> dark

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
of the new 52 with him fighting dark

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.060 
of the new 52 with him fighting dark
side<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.330> then<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.570> had<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.500> Man<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.920> Steel

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
side and then it had the Man of Steel

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.820 
side and then it had the Man of Steel
Superman<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:21.000> overall<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.110> was<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> really<00:02:22.500> cool

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
Superman so overall it was a really cool

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.220 
Superman so overall it was a really cool
way<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.100> celebrate<00:02:23.640> 75th<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.570> really<00:02:24.840> hope<00:02:25.020> they

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
way to celebrate 75th I really hope they

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.440 
way to celebrate 75th I really hope they
do<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.590> with<00:02:25.800> their<00:02:26.610> other<00:02:26.760> characters<00:02:27.300> as

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
do that with their other characters as

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.170 
do that with their other characters as
well<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.930> think<00:02:28.230> Batman's<00:02:29.070> would<00:02:29.340> be<00:02:29.520> next<00:02:29.910> year

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
well I think Batman's would be next year

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.030 
well I think Batman's would be next year
so<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.960> should<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.170> interesting<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.770> see<00:02:31.950> how

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
so that should be interesting to see how

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.980 
so that should be interesting to see how
to<00:02:32.100> handle<00:02:32.490> his<00:02:32.700> 75th<00:02:33.330> because<00:02:33.600> he's<00:02:33.780> got<00:02:33.960> a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
to handle his 75th because he's got a

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.710 
to handle his 75th because he's got a
lot<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.170> really<00:02:34.440> cool<00:02:34.500> things<00:02:34.650> too<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.570> he<00:02:36.570> has
