00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello here are makeups that I 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.950
 will realize today with 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.170
 very simple products from shadows to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.690
 eye pencils cream headlights 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.510
 year the honor and that's all it is 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.760
 party I just click and black pencil 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.030
 to intensify the look and then I 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.000
 come and melt it slightly the same thing 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.340
 in lower 6 and then I come 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.250
 involved one sticks up hurts everyone on the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.730
 eyelid and I protrude by forming a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.660
 circle 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.950
 all around the eye I apply a make-up 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.800
 black eyeshadow that I degraded 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 slightly 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.250
 and then inferiorise below 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.500
 eyebrows around the corner and in all 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.970
 place 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.470
 I draw the outline with a blue pencil 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.079
 that I then come degraded with my 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.850
 brush of just now with comfort 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.219
 blue elysÃ©es I come all around 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.219
 circles to create a mask shape 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.640
 then the rhinestones I'm going to use 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.979
 are basically a little kit for them 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.040
 angles i'm going to alternate purple is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.570
 double with mac os the false eyelashes of the top 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.890
 I come drawn small arabesques 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.890
 with a very fine brush 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.490
 I just created a spider's web 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.640
 with a brush I just degrade the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.640
 Spider web 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:09.430
 I create other arabesques by following 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.430
 always the shape of the mask 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.630
 I draw a little heart for them 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.560
 connect 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.730
 I fill empty spaces with 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.730
 small drawings to choose 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.909
 I just apply a layer of mascara 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.030
 big eyes with the big brush the little 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.409
 brush for lower lashes 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.060
 it's a pencil for the eyes that I 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.250
 come on the mouth 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.470
 so the same violated cus for the eyes 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.140
 so here it's about the pencil 052 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.090
 clicquot and blue in the center 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.670
 and over a little blue that remained 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.090
 on my brush this is my mask is 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.090
 completed 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.680
 I hope these makeups have you more 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.930
 they 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.129
 zerah want to reproduce it if you 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.590
 have questions do not hesitate to 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.709
 ask me I tried to make a 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.290
 makeup with summer produced that all the 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.859
 world has or roughly by changing a 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.170
 few colors 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.060
 if it's too complicated we can of course 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.560
 make a mask much simpler in 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.680
 doing the outline as in my 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.819
 previous video so just with a 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.409
 black pencil or a rape client and even the 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.450
 French go around the face here 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:58.299
