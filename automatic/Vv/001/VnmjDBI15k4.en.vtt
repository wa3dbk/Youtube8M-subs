but<00:04:27.540> this<00:04:27.690> way<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.560> know<00:04:28.620> this<00:04:28.980> is<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.130> stronger

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
but this way you know this is a stronger

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.550 
but this way you know this is a stronger
sort<00:04:29.910> of<00:04:30.000> denial<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:30.510> if<00:04:30.600> he's<00:04:30.780> got<00:04:31.350> multiple

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
sort of denial so if he's got multiple

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.080 
sort of denial so if he's got multiple
group<00:04:31.919> membership<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.520> another<00:04:32.700> group<00:04:32.880> had

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
group membership and another group had

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.909 
group membership and another group had
membership<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:34.169> was<00:04:34.290> allowed<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.560> read

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
membership that that was allowed to read

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.159 
membership that that was allowed to read
that<00:04:35.100> gpo<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:36.150> would<00:04:36.360> still<00:04:36.600> be<00:04:36.630> applied<00:04:37.020> to

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
that gpo it would still be applied to

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.870 
that gpo it would still be applied to
Tesla<00:04:37.560> even<00:04:37.830> though<00:04:37.919> we<00:04:38.040> had<00:04:38.160> only<00:04:38.280> implicitly

Tesla even though we had only implicitly
the<00:04:39.060> night<00:04:39.210> here<00:04:39.570> but<00:04:40.350> since<00:04:40.650> we<00:04:40.800> explicitly

we<00:04:48.510> just<00:04:48.690> want<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.870> edit<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.169> dacl<00:04:49.590> there

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
we just want to edit the dacl there

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.909 
we just want to edit the dacl there
another<00:04:51.600> thing<00:04:51.810> we<00:04:51.840> want<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.139> do<00:04:52.290> will<00:04:52.650> apply

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
another thing we want to do will apply

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.920 
another thing we want to do will apply
this<00:04:52.979> to<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.250> northern<00:04:53.610> hemisphere<00:04:53.930> but

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
this to the northern hemisphere but

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.320 
this to the northern hemisphere but
let's<00:04:55.169> say<00:04:55.800> we<00:04:55.979> wanted<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.280> filter<00:04:56.760> nobody<00:04:57.240> in

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
let's say we wanted to filter nobody in

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.550 
let's say we wanted to filter nobody in
the<00:04:57.389> southern<00:04:57.630> hemisphere<00:04:57.660> should<00:04:58.229> have<00:04:58.350> a

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
the southern hemisphere should have a

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.250 
the southern hemisphere should have a
lockdown<00:04:58.860> desktop<00:04:59.550> for<00:05:00.180> some<00:05:00.330> reason<00:05:00.690> well

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
lockdown desktop for some reason well

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.650 
lockdown desktop for some reason well
what<00:05:01.440> we<00:05:01.530> could<00:05:01.710> do<00:05:01.860> is<00:05:02.070> block<00:05:02.669> inheritance<00:05:03.270> at

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
what we could do is block inheritance at

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.530 
what we could do is block inheritance at
this<00:05:04.169> level<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.680> this<00:05:05.130> would<00:05:05.340> block<00:05:05.610> any<00:05:05.910> of

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
this level and this would block any of

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.210 
this level and this would block any of
these<00:05:06.630> policies<00:05:07.139> from<00:05:07.290> being<00:05:07.530> no<00:05:07.620> forced<00:05:08.010> on

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
these policies from being no forced on

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.150 
these policies from being no forced on
this<00:05:08.370> setting<00:05:08.700> so<00:05:09.270> let's<00:05:09.450> test<00:05:09.660> this<00:05:09.870> out<00:05:10.050> now

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
this setting so let's test this out now

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.370 
this setting so let's test this out now
we<00:05:11.160> want<00:05:11.940> to<00:05:12.000> check<00:05:12.419> for<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.660> few<00:05:12.900> things<00:05:13.050> we

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
we want to check for a few things we

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.370 
we want to check for a few things we
want<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.620> see<00:05:13.830> will<00:05:14.580> log<00:05:14.789> n<00:05:14.970> maybe<00:05:15.180> as<00:05:15.510> one<00:05:16.350> of

want to see will log n maybe as one of

want to see will log n maybe as one of
our<00:05:16.560> agents<00:05:16.590> let's<00:05:17.160> login<00:05:17.340> is<00:05:17.720> let's<00:05:18.720> log<00:05:18.870> in

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
our agents let's login is let's log in

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.170 
our agents let's login is let's log in
his<00:05:19.110> Tesla<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:19.770> see<00:05:20.160> if<00:05:20.250> he's<00:05:20.430> filtered<00:05:20.880> he's

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
his Tesla and see if he's filtered he's

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.150 
his Tesla and see if he's filtered he's
in<00:05:21.330> research<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:22.229> will<00:05:22.380> log<00:05:22.530> in<00:05:22.650> as<00:05:22.740> Einstein

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
in research the will log in as Einstein

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.529 
in research the will log in as Einstein
who's<00:05:23.370> not<00:05:23.550> filtered<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.330> should<00:05:24.510> be

who's not filtered and it should be

who's not filtered and it should be
applied<00:05:24.870> Einstein<00:05:25.289> should<00:05:25.440> not<00:05:25.590> be<00:05:25.710> applied

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
applied Einstein should not be applied

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.700 
applied Einstein should not be applied
to<00:05:26.160> Tesla<00:05:26.640> and<00:05:26.820> then<00:05:27.780> let's<00:05:28.200> see<00:05:28.289> if<00:05:28.440> we<00:05:28.560> can

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
to Tesla and then let's see if we can

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.610 
to Tesla and then let's see if we can
block<00:05:29.010> policy<00:05:29.490> inheritance<00:05:29.940> here<00:05:30.210> and<00:05:30.620> login

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
block policy inheritance here and login

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.380 
block policy inheritance here and login
maybe<00:05:32.010> as<00:05:32.190> one<00:05:32.370> of<00:05:32.400> our<00:05:32.580> research<00:05:33.000> or<00:05:33.210> top

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
maybe as one of our research or top

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.409 
maybe as one of our research or top
agents<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.080> spend<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.650> southern<00:05:34.950> hemisphere

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
agents and spend the southern hemisphere

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.690 
agents and spend the southern hemisphere
so<00:05:36.419> with<00:05:36.900> all<00:05:37.050> of<00:05:37.140> these<00:05:37.260> group<00:05:37.500> settings<00:05:38.160> well

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
so with all of these group settings well

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.279 
so with all of these group settings well
you<00:05:39.000> know<00:05:39.120> group<00:05:39.360> policy<00:05:39.600> settings<00:05:39.870> modified

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
you know group policy settings modified

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.450 
you know group policy settings modified
I'm<00:05:40.410> going<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.590> close<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.979> group<00:05:41.130> policy

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
I'm going to close the group policy

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.700 
I'm going to close the group policy
console

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.710 

I'll<00:05:46.710> just<00:05:47.070> we<00:05:47.700> won't<00:05:47.910> save<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.330> console

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
I'll just we won't save the console

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.500 
I'll just we won't save the console
settings<00:05:49.040> it<00:05:50.040> your<00:05:50.460> GPA<00:05:50.790> is<00:05:50.940> saved<00:05:51.180> by<00:05:51.270> the<00:05:51.390> way

settings it your GPA is saved by the way

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.670 
settings it your GPA is saved by the way
it's<00:05:51.660> just<00:05:51.750> that<00:05:52.110> was<00:05:52.230> just<00:05:52.380> asked<00:05:52.470> me<00:05:52.560> if<00:05:52.620> I

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
it's just that was just asked me if I

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.110 
it's just that was just asked me if I
wanted<00:05:52.740> to<00:05:52.920> save<00:05:53.100> the<00:05:53.250> console<00:05:53.700> settings<00:05:53.820> I

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
wanted to save the console settings I

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.030 
wanted to save the console settings I
could<00:05:54.630> just<00:05:54.780> type<00:05:54.960> gpupdate<00:05:55.320> but<00:05:55.770> i<00:05:55.800> want<00:05:56.010> you

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
could just type gpupdate but i want you

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.290 
could just type gpupdate but i want you
to<00:05:56.160> see<00:05:56.340> what's<00:05:56.520> happening<00:05:56.910> so<00:05:57.060> i'm<00:05:57.120> going<00:05:57.210> to

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
to see what's happening so i'm going to

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.740 
to see what's happening so i'm going to
open<00:05:57.330> a<00:05:57.540> command<00:05:57.690> prompt<00:05:58.140> first<00:05:58.380> and<00:05:59.750> gpupdate

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
open a command prompt first and gpupdate

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.390 
open a command prompt first and gpupdate
remember<00:06:01.620> every<00:06:01.770> time<00:06:01.890> we<00:06:01.980> change<00:06:02.190> good

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
remember every time we change good

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.560 
remember every time we change good
policy<00:06:02.790> we<00:06:02.910> want<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:03.150> use<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.360> command

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
policy we want to use the command

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:15.439 
policy we want to use the command
gpupdate

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.290 

and<00:06:16.439> now<00:06:16.680> will<00:06:16.919> log<00:06:17.159> in<00:06:17.370> and<00:06:17.490> out<00:06:17.639> as<00:06:17.849> different
