I<00:00:09.110> had<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.320> muffler<00:00:11.040> replaced<00:00:12.080> with<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.639> more

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I had the muffler replaced with a more

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.870 
I had the muffler replaced with a more
high<00:00:15.330> performance<00:00:16.020> based<00:00:16.609> muffler<00:00:17.609> would

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
high performance based muffler would

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.859 
high performance based muffler would
make<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> little<00:00:18.300> bit<00:00:18.480> more<00:00:18.630> sporty<00:00:19.820> but

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
make it a little bit more sporty but

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.250 
make it a little bit more sporty but
this<00:00:21.869> truck<00:00:22.289> has<00:00:23.150> two<00:00:24.150> catalytic<00:00:24.720> converters

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
this truck has two catalytic converters

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.939 
this truck has two catalytic converters
on<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.820> made<00:00:27.060> for<00:00:27.740> even<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
on it and so that made for even with the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.099 
on it and so that made for even with the
sporty<00:00:29.279> muffler<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.699> still<00:00:29.939> started<00:00:30.449> way<00:00:31.050> too

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
sporty muffler it still started way too

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.110 
sporty muffler it still started way too
quiet<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.130> place<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.550> had<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> exhaust

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
quiet and the place that had the exhaust

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.180 
quiet and the place that had the exhaust
work<00:00:33.300> at<00:00:33.570> done<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.309> would<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:37.160> take<00:00:38.719> the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
work at done it would not take the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.619 
work at done it would not take the
catalytic<00:00:41.190> converters<00:00:41.640> off<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:44.480> figured<00:00:45.480> why

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
catalytic converters off so figured why

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.290 
catalytic converters off so figured why
we<00:00:45.750> let<00:00:45.899> them<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.320> I'll<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.559> it

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:06.300 

so<00:00:51.300> change<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.870> down<00:00:52.230> here

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.210 

there's<00:01:07.310> where<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:07.670> cut<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.150> on<00:01:08.420> one<00:01:08.869> side<00:01:09.290> and

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
there's where I cut it on one side and

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.219 
there's where I cut it on one side and
then<00:01:10.400> in<00:01:10.580> there<00:01:10.790> somewhere<00:01:12.040> is<00:01:14.020> that's<00:01:15.020> it

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
then in there somewhere is that's it

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:15.820 
then in there somewhere is that's it
right<00:01:15.409> there

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
right there

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.620 
right there
that's<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.250> pipe<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:17.350> so<00:01:18.350> there's<00:01:18.740> no<00:01:19.630> second

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
that's the pipe and so there's no second

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.420 
that's the pipe and so there's no second
cat<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:21.080> left<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.500> first<00:01:21.710> cat<00:01:22.040> in<00:01:22.220> there

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
cat I left the first cat in there

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.550 
cat I left the first cat in there
because<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.180> didn't<00:01:23.509> want<00:01:23.690> to<00:01:23.750> be<00:01:23.899> ridiculously

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
because I didn't want to be ridiculously

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:33.010 
because I didn't want to be ridiculously
loud<00:01:27.790> but<00:01:29.409> so<00:01:31.299> now<00:01:32.299> I'm<00:01:32.420> going<00:01:32.540> to<00:01:32.600> take<00:01:32.810> it<00:01:32.930> to

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
loud but so now I'm going to take it to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.399 
loud but so now I'm going to take it to
him

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
him

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.139 
him
say<00:01:34.100> there's<00:01:34.909> no<00:01:35.090> cat<00:01:35.299> just<00:01:35.539> put<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:35.750> pipe<00:01:35.990> there

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
say there's no cat just put a pipe there

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.490 
say there's no cat just put a pipe there
but<00:01:38.149> for<00:01:38.300> right<00:01:38.450> now<00:01:38.509> I'm<00:01:38.929> pretty<00:01:39.229> much<00:01:39.350> just

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
but for right now I'm pretty much just

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.270 
but for right now I'm pretty much just
running<00:01:40.009> out<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.160> one<00:01:40.399> cat<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:40.970> here's<00:01:41.630> a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
running out of one cat so here's a

00:01:42.280 --> 00:02:31.250 
running out of one cat so here's a
startup<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.460> truck<00:01:44.380> with<00:01:46.330> only<00:01:47.330> one<00:01:47.929> cat

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.100
