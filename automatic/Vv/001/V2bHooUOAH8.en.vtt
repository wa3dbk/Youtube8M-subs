00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
show up through this black dye because I

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.950 
show up through this black dye because I
didn't<00:05:01.950> use<00:05:02.160> you<00:05:02.550> know<00:05:03.030> too<00:05:03.090> much<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:03.870> on

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
didn't use you know too much of it on

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.810 
didn't use you know too much of it on
the<00:05:04.110> shoe<00:05:04.350> and<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:05.040> actually<00:05:05.130> think<00:05:05.460> that's<00:05:05.700> a

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
the shoe and I actually think that's a

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.620 
the shoe and I actually think that's a
nice<00:05:06.000> look<00:05:06.560> but<00:05:07.560> in<00:05:08.040> actuality<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.970> was<00:05:09.360> just

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
nice look but in actuality I was just

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.520 
nice look but in actuality I was just
running<00:05:09.960> low<00:05:10.350> on<00:05:10.730> dye<00:05:11.730> as<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.180> can<00:05:12.360> see<00:05:12.600> on<00:05:12.840> the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
running low on dye as you can see on the

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.490 
running low on dye as you can see on the
left<00:05:13.800> shoe<00:05:14.010> in<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.250> back<00:05:14.460> corner<00:05:15.110> which<00:05:16.110> is

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
left shoe in the back corner which is

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.970 
left shoe in the back corner which is
really<00:05:17.510> really<00:05:18.510> showing<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:19.410> know<00:05:19.620> a<00:05:19.650> lot<00:05:19.950> of

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
really really showing you know a lot of

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.670 
really really showing you know a lot of
the<00:05:20.190> blue<00:05:20.490> that<00:05:20.730> was<00:05:21.000> previously<00:05:21.630> there<00:05:21.900> but<00:05:22.650> I

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
the blue that was previously there but I

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.980 
the blue that was previously there but I
think<00:05:22.770> it's<00:05:23.040> a<00:05:23.100> nice<00:05:23.280> look<00:05:23.610> but<00:05:24.180> then<00:05:24.390> again<00:05:24.510> I

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
think it's a nice look but then again I

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.380 
think it's a nice look but then again I
actually<00:05:25.140> might<00:05:25.470> go<00:05:25.680> back<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.250> dye<00:05:26.850> this<00:05:26.910> so

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
actually might go back and dye this so

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.450 
actually might go back and dye this so
that<00:05:27.570> it<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.930> an<00:05:28.230> all<00:05:28.620> black<00:05:29.250> a<00:05:29.780> nubuck<00:05:30.780> upper

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
that it is an all black a nubuck upper

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.370 
that it is an all black a nubuck upper
other<00:05:32.460> than<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:33.030> through<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.750> blue<00:05:33.900> laces

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
other than that through the blue laces

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.850 
other than that through the blue laces
back<00:05:34.620> in<00:05:35.330> left<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.510> sock<00:05:36.780> liner<00:05:37.080> alone<00:05:37.470> it<00:05:37.800> is

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
back in left the sock liner alone it is

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.970 
back in left the sock liner alone it is
kind<00:05:38.310> of<00:05:38.460> messy<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.870> way<00:05:40.020> that<00:05:40.200> I<00:05:40.230> went<00:05:40.830> around
