00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.100 

so<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:44.350> are<00:00:44.940> geriatricians<00:00:45.940> what<00:00:46.840> do<00:00:46.989> you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
so we are geriatricians what do you

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.889 
so we are geriatricians what do you
think<00:00:47.640> geriatricians<00:00:48.640> do<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:52.420> with<00:00:52.600> Jerry

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
think geriatricians do do with Jerry

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:05.700 
think geriatricians do do with Jerry
Lewis<00:00:52.989> like<00:00:53.530> this<00:01:03.839> it's<00:01:04.839> gotta<00:01:05.170> be<00:01:05.440> something

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
Lewis like this it's gotta be something

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.090 
Lewis like this it's gotta be something
in<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.040> sciences<00:01:06.759> I<00:01:06.970> really<00:01:07.330> I<00:01:07.360> have<00:01:07.810> no<00:01:08.100> idea

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
in the sciences I really I have no idea

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.370 
in the sciences I really I have no idea
if<00:01:09.399> you<00:01:09.430> said<00:01:09.820> jury<00:01:10.270> attrition<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:11.080> would<00:01:11.229> think

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
if you said jury attrition I would think

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.899 
if you said jury attrition I would think
it<00:01:11.530> has<00:01:11.649> something<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.009> do<00:01:12.220> with<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.460> courts

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
it has something to do with the courts

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.230 
it has something to do with the courts
but<00:01:13.750> now<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.229> you<00:01:14.289> crushed<00:01:14.649> me<00:01:15.070> I<00:01:15.700> would<00:01:16.000> say

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
but now that you crushed me I would say

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.029 
but now that you crushed me I would say
I<00:01:16.270> have<00:01:16.539> to<00:01:16.810> do<00:01:16.930> something<00:01:17.320> with<00:01:17.440> science

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
I have to do something with science

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.960 
I have to do something with science
medical<00:01:19.770> makes<00:01:20.770> me<00:01:20.890> think<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.220> pharmaceutical

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
medical makes me think of pharmaceutical

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.570 
medical makes me think of pharmaceutical
I<00:01:22.090> really<00:01:22.660> don't<00:01:22.899> know<00:01:23.110> Oh<00:01:23.170> first<00:01:24.160> were<00:01:24.399> the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
I really don't know Oh first were the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.249 
I really don't know Oh first were the
kin<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:24.850> mind<00:01:25.060> gerrymandering<00:01:28.050> sure<00:01:29.050> that

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
kin the mind gerrymandering sure that

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:40.710 
kin the mind gerrymandering sure that
does<00:01:29.830> not<00:01:29.860> happen<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:39.880> just<00:01:40.149> gonna<00:01:40.300> ask<00:01:40.509> you

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
does not happen I'm just gonna ask you

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.380 
does not happen I'm just gonna ask you
what<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:40.929> geriatrician<00:01:41.399> was<00:01:42.399> a<00:01:43.320> jury<00:01:44.640> attrition

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.890

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
I have not heard that sounds like

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.950 
I have not heard that sounds like
something<00:01:54.900> in<00:01:55.110> nutrition<00:01:59.600> choosing<00:02:00.600> foods

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
something in nutrition choosing foods

parents and actually but in the midst of
it<00:02:11.640> all<00:02:11.760> I've<00:02:12.390> read<00:02:13.170> things<00:02:13.590> about<00:02:14.100> taking

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880

care of the elderly and I have not come
across<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:20.510> geriatrician<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.050> I've<00:02:22.350> learned

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
across that geriatrician so I've learned

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.479 
across that geriatrician so I've learned
something<00:02:23.340> today<00:02:24.470> actually<00:02:25.470> not<00:02:25.800> too<00:02:26.190> clear

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
something today actually not too clear

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.699 
something today actually not too clear
on<00:02:26.519> what<00:02:26.820> geriatricians<00:02:27.600> do<00:02:29.780> yeah<00:02:30.780> thing<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
on what geriatricians do yeah thing that

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.360 
on what geriatricians do yeah thing that
initially<00:02:32.250> pops<00:02:32.550> out<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.239> jury<00:02:34.130> something<00:02:35.130> you

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
initially pops out is jury something you

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.949 
initially pops out is jury something you
carry<00:02:36.120> law<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:37.080> then<00:02:37.260> attrition<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.959> only

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
carry law and then attrition the only

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.009 
carry law and then attrition the only
thing<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.440> think<00:02:40.470> about<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:41.970> head<00:02:42.300> is

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
thing I can think about in my head is

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.960 
thing I can think about in my head is
like<00:02:44.150> dietitian<00:02:45.150> or<00:02:45.650> attrition<00:02:46.650> or<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.730> I

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
like dietitian or attrition or but I

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.120 
like dietitian or attrition or but I
have<00:02:48.450> no<00:02:48.720> idea<00:02:49.080> how<00:02:49.320> those<00:02:49.709> could<00:02:50.100> possibly

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
have no idea how those could possibly

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.910 
have no idea how those could possibly
come<00:02:50.970> together<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:52.019> form<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:54.049> career<00:02:55.730> and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
come together to form a career and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.170 
come together to form a career and
geriatricians<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.160> would<00:02:59.459> guess<00:02:59.790> would<00:03:00.150> have

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
geriatricians I would guess would have

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.170 
geriatricians I would guess would have
something<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.690> do<00:03:00.959> decide<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:02.180> nutrition

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
something to do decide like nutrition

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.080 
something to do decide like nutrition
diets<00:03:04.140> diet<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.730> know<00:03:05.820> dietitian<00:03:06.630> made

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
diets diet that you know dietitian made

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.960 
diets diet that you know dietitian made
I<00:03:10.349> haven't<00:03:11.349> that's<00:03:11.560> actually<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.220> first<00:03:12.580> time

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
I haven't that's actually the first time

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.140 
I haven't that's actually the first time
so<00:03:13.510> if<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.900> don't<00:03:14.080> know<00:03:14.319> if<00:03:14.379> that's<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.800> new<00:03:15.099> thing

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
so if I don't know if that's a new thing

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:28.100 
so if I don't know if that's a new thing
going<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.360> because<00:03:16.690> when<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.500> was<00:03:17.860> in<00:03:18.010> college

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.920 

in<00:03:29.110> my<00:03:29.349> life<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:33.670> sounds<00:03:34.209> like<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:34.690> would<00:03:34.900> be

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
in my life it sounds like it would be

00:03:34.930 --> 00:04:10.979 
in my life it sounds like it would be
some<00:03:35.560> form<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:36.370> nutrition<00:04:09.720> geriatrician<00:04:10.720> see

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
some form of nutrition geriatrician see

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.009 
some form of nutrition geriatrician see
well<00:04:11.230> I<00:04:11.470> think<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:12.989> geriatricians<00:04:14.549> geriatric

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
well I think of geriatricians geriatric

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:24.250 
well I think of geriatricians geriatric
children<00:04:19.739> children's<00:04:20.970> doctor<00:04:22.620> pediatrician

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
children children's doctor pediatrician

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.500 
children children's doctor pediatrician
but<00:04:24.560> cheery<00:04:26.770> that<00:04:27.770> would<00:04:28.010> be<00:04:28.220> my<00:04:28.430> guess<00:04:28.700> now

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
but cheery that would be my guess now

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.320 
but cheery that would be my guess now
that<00:04:29.540> I'm<00:04:29.870> thinking<00:04:30.140> about<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:31.330> geriatrics

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
that I'm thinking about it geriatrics

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.660 
that I'm thinking about it geriatrics
have<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.840> do<00:04:33.050> with<00:04:33.230> old<00:04:33.530> people<00:04:33.920> or<00:04:34.400> young

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
have to do with old people or young

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.050 
have to do with old people or young
people<00:04:36.490> gosh

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
people gosh

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.170 
people gosh
I<00:04:38.090> think<00:04:38.540> maybe<00:04:39.250> geriatrics<00:04:40.250> is<00:04:40.520> old<00:04:40.940> people

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
I think maybe geriatrics is old people

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.760 
I think maybe geriatrics is old people
so<00:04:42.080> this<00:04:42.410> has<00:04:42.680> something<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.250> do<00:04:43.640> with<00:04:44.320> our<00:04:45.320> our

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
so this has something to do with our our

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.680 
so this has something to do with our our
older<00:04:47.110> generations<00:04:48.670> that<00:04:49.670> would<00:04:49.910> be<00:04:50.150> my<00:04:50.390> best

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
older generations that would be my best

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.220 
older generations that would be my best
guess<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:52.370> judge<00:04:52.730> you<00:04:53.240> judge<00:04:53.270> people<00:04:53.600> for

what<00:05:12.140> the<00:05:12.350> word<00:05:12.620> would<00:05:12.650> be<00:05:13.010> for<00:05:13.910> a<00:05:15.070> physician

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
what the word would be for a physician

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:33.280 
what the word would be for a physician
in<00:05:16.610> geriatrics<00:05:17.620> is<00:05:18.620> that<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.010> proper<00:05:19.430> term<00:05:32.290> I

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
in geriatrics is that the proper term I

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:42.180 
in geriatrics is that the proper term I
would<00:05:33.950> say<00:05:34.370> nutrition<00:05:35.060> for<00:05:35.540> geriatric<00:05:36.490> so<00:05:39.760> I

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
would say nutrition for geriatric so I

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.750 
would say nutrition for geriatric so I
think<00:05:43.190> that<00:05:43.760> is<00:05:44.770> helping<00:05:45.770> the<00:05:45.950> elderly<00:05:46.130> with

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
think that is helping the elderly with

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.840 
think that is helping the elderly with
their<00:05:47.150> nutrition<00:05:47.600> and

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
their nutrition and

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.360 
their nutrition and
they're<00:05:49.770> taking<00:05:50.770> care<00:05:50.920> of<00:05:50.950> their<00:05:51.160> body

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
they're taking care of their body

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.360 
they're taking care of their body

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
through nutrition the audition yes I

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:08.340 
through nutrition the audition yes I
heard<00:05:57.760> of<00:05:58.030> a<00:05:58.150> geriatric<00:05:58.780> aide<00:06:06.930> have<00:06:07.930> you<00:06:08.140> ever

heard of a geriatric aide have you ever
heard<00:06:08.830> of<00:06:09.040> the<00:06:09.250> term<00:06:09.550> before<00:06:10.680> you've<00:06:11.680> never

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
heard of the term before you've never

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:18.000 
heard of the term before you've never
heard<00:06:12.220> the<00:06:12.490> term<00:06:12.870> geriatrician<00:06:16.020> well<00:06:17.020> it<00:06:17.410> it

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
heard the term geriatrician well it it

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.640 
heard the term geriatrician well it it
sounds<00:06:18.520> kind<00:06:18.850> of<00:06:18.940> like<00:06:19.050> dietitian<00:06:20.050> except<00:06:20.440> for

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.100 
sounds kind of like dietitian except for
old<00:06:20.800> people<00:06:20.950> so<00:06:21.700> I<00:06:22.060> would<00:06:22.390> think<00:06:22.570> it<00:06:22.750> might<00:06:23.080> be

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
old people so I would think it might be

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:31.170 
old people so I would think it might be
related<00:06:23.740> to<00:06:25.140> how<00:06:26.250> people<00:06:27.250> maybe<00:06:29.970> nobody<00:06:30.970> knows

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
related to how people maybe nobody knows

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.810 
related to how people maybe nobody knows
what<00:06:31.330> a<00:06:31.390> geriatrician<00:06:31.750> is<00:06:32.440> is<00:06:33.100> they<00:06:33.340> usually<00:06:33.550> a

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
what a geriatrician is is they usually a

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.070 
what a geriatrician is is they usually a
geriatric<00:06:34.450> doctor<00:06:35.380> it's<00:06:35.560> not<00:06:35.680> a<00:06:35.830> geriatrician

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
geriatric doctor it's not a geriatrician

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.220 
geriatric doctor it's not a geriatrician
first<00:06:38.080> time<00:06:38.350> I've<00:06:38.530> ever<00:06:38.560> heard<00:06:39.010> of
