00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.690
 hello everybody today we have the nikon 18600 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.690
 the one with maximum opening from 35 to 63 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.430
 this is the alternative he offers me 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.350
 to 18 300 with maximum opening 35 56 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.410
 both are compatible with 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.789
 right sensors and are stabilized by 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.730
 web 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.399
 both are also ideal for 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.120
 travel because we can block it 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.920
 zoom asi in order to avoid 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.059
 damaged during transport 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.489
 both are suitable for photography 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.579
 of simona federalist and sportsman 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.059
 given the focal length instead on the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.390
 plan of construction this goal 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.210
 weighs 550 grams 300 less than in comparison 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.629
 to the other and this makes him earn a 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.250
 point to his advantage let's say while a 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.020
 Another point in favor of goal 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.360
 it goes because it is composed of 19 lenses in 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.180
 fourteen groups while this in 16 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.970
 lenses divided into 12 groups however like 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.020
 the other goal among the minds are there 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.150
 three of spherical type and three of type is di 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.900
 both types of lens series are 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.909
 aimed at reducing the impurities that the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.000
 light would produce on the photos we say 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.119
 a great thing 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.820
 a smallness instead is the diameter of the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.220
 filter to this goal from having a 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.430
 filter diameter of 67 mm while 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.549
 the other 77 mm with the recurrence 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.740
 in short, while it is not a smallness for 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.140
 the minimum focusing distance 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.290
 in this the minimum setting distance a 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.009
 fire and 48 centimeters from the focal plane 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.360
 in all zoom positions e 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.500
 this makes him earn another point 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.270
 as in the other is yes 45 centimeters 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.259
 as minimum focusing distance 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.420
 however, it has a focal length of 300 mm 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.210
 then to take advantage of the excursion of the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.180
 zoom 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:18.590
 the difference however substantial between the two 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.560
 objectives is a diaphragm as shown 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.510
 from the name this has a maximum opening 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.120
 of 35 63 with 7 circular blades while 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.570
 the other will be brighter and an account is 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.650
 a maximum opening of 35 56 with nine 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.630
 circular lamellas obviously say ha 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.210
 had to give up something like for 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.740
 example the lenses or the construction of the 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:50.140
 diaphragm to make it more compact more 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.910
 lightweight but doing so made him more 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.880
 economic and therefore competitive for 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.940
 brother doesn't seem to be anything else from 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.990
 add if you have questions do the pure ones 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.550
 and if you have had I do not know 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.630
 experiences with these objectives and goals 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.700
 wanted to share photos and equally and 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.810
 I refer you to the next review from 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.810
 all goodbye
