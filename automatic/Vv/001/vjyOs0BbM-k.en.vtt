in the middle of all this I'm going to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
in the middle of all this I'm going to
place<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:45.239> half<00:00:45.600> an<00:00:45.840> important<00:00:46.260> benchmark

next<00:00:53.190> step<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> lock<00:00:54.120> them<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.840> start

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
next step is to lock them so I can start

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.110 
next step is to lock them so I can start
to<00:00:55.410> use<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.890> here's<00:00:56.579> where<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.910> class

then talk about the justification for

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.940 
then talk about the justification for
their<00:01:26.490> decision<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.990> half<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.380> an<00:01:28.530> important

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
their decision one half is an important

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.249 
their decision one half is an important
benchmark<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.759> could<00:01:29.970> begin<00:01:30.240> by<00:01:30.450> saying<00:01:30.720> we

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
benchmark we could begin by saying we

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.700 
benchmark we could begin by saying we
know<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:31.950> half<00:01:32.220> belongs<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:34.280> now<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.610> we

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
know the one half belongs here now if we

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.899 
know the one half belongs here now if we
change<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> presentation<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
change the presentation of that

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.420 
change the presentation of that
benchmark<00:01:39.240> fraction<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.110> look<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.189> as<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
benchmark fraction and look at it as a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.969 
benchmark fraction and look at it as a
circle<00:01:42.180> fraction<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.409> see<00:01:43.649> visually

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
circle fraction then we can see visually

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.160 
circle fraction then we can see visually
that<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:45.000> half<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.570> two<00:01:45.750> fourths

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that the one half and the two fourths

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.460 
that the one half and the two fourths
are<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.439> fact<00:01:46.680> representing<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:48.090> same<00:01:48.470> value

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
are in fact representing the same value

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.499 
are in fact representing the same value
so<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.280> could<00:01:50.399> help<00:01:50.549> students<00:01:51.090> arrive<00:01:51.360> at

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
so this could help students arrive at

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
so this could help students arrive at
the<00:01:51.630> discovery<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.470> they'll<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.040> placed<00:01:53.310> in

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the discovery that they'll be placed in

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.950 
the discovery that they'll be placed in
the<00:01:53.610> same<00:01:53.850> location<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.500> number<00:01:55.799> line

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
the same location on the number line

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.450 
the same location on the number line
three<00:01:57.960> fourths<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.439> one-fourth<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.159> whole

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
three fourths and one-fourth a whole

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.109 
interesting discussion can take place
where<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.829> we<00:02:01.950> place<00:02:02.189> three<00:02:02.549> forts<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
where do we place three forts in the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.319 
where do we place three forts in the
number<00:02:03.390> line<00:02:03.509> word<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.079> place<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.619> fourth<00:02:05.329> for

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
number line word we place one fourth for

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
number line word we place one fourth for
a<00:02:06.360> young<00:02:06.659> group<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.229> might<00:02:07.409> do<00:02:07.649> with

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
a young group what we might do with

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.720 
a young group what we might do with
three<00:02:08.099> forts<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.580> one<00:02:08.819> fourth<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:11.340> divide

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
three forts and one fourth is to divide

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.640 
three forts and one fourth is to divide
the<00:02:11.910> number<00:02:12.030> line<00:02:12.330> into<00:02:12.629> fourths

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the number line into fourths

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.850 
the number line into fourths
currently<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.069> see<00:02:14.250> half<00:02:14.989> now<00:02:15.989> we<00:02:16.049> see<00:02:16.409> fourths

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
currently we see half now we see fourths

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.339 
currently we see half now we see fourths
so<00:02:17.069> we<00:02:17.549> can<00:02:17.700> begin<00:02:17.849> with<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.420> one-to-one

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
so we can begin with a one-to-one

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.470 
so we can begin with a one-to-one
correspondence<00:02:19.739> placing<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> one-fourth

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
correspondence placing the one-fourth

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.600 
correspondence placing the one-fourth
where<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.019> belongs<00:02:23.299> etc<00:02:24.299> I<00:02:25.310> hope<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.430> gives

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
where it belongs etc I hope this gives

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.250 
where it belongs etc I hope this gives
you<00:02:26.730> some<00:02:26.790> ideas<00:02:27.420> I'm<00:02:27.629> going<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.930> play<00:02:28.200> some

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you some ideas I'm going to play some

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.140 
you some ideas I'm going to play some
different<00:02:28.950> fractions<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> number<00:02:30.120> line

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
different fractions on the number line

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.050 
different fractions on the number line
and<00:02:30.540> show<00:02:31.109> you<00:02:31.170> how<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.859> moved<00:02:32.609> up<00:02:32.819> one

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
and show you how this is moved up one

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.569 
and show you how this is moved up one
step<00:02:35.659> so<00:02:36.659> I've<00:02:36.780> made<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.200> change<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.859> now<00:02:38.519> we

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
step so I've made that change and now we

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.380 
step so I've made that change and now we
have<00:02:38.750> fifths<00:02:40.370> four-fifths<00:02:41.370> two<00:02:41.909> fifths

demarcations on the number line what

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.390 
demarcations on the number line what
gets<00:03:15.629> interesting<00:03:16.439> is<00:03:16.650> when<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:17.010> students

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
gets interesting is when the students

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.430 
gets interesting is when the students
have<00:03:17.549> an<00:03:17.639> opportunity<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:18.239> consider<00:03:18.690> where

and<00:03:22.069> a<00:03:23.069> whole<00:03:23.280> conversation<00:03:23.699> can<00:03:24.209> take<00:03:24.449> place

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
and a whole conversation can take place

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.930 
and a whole conversation can take place
where<00:03:25.500> students<00:03:25.980> come<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.489> discovery

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
where students come to the discovery

something<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.609> want<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.849> have<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.239> rise<00:03:36.480> out<00:03:36.810> of

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
something you want to have a rise out of

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.990 
something you want to have a rise out of
conversation<00:03:37.799> because<00:03:38.129> one<00:03:38.310> half<00:03:38.489> really<00:03:38.879> is

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
conversation because one half really is
