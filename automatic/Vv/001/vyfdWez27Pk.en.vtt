00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.200
"First class"

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:25.383
It is on now, the day

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:27.800
when tens of excited 
salsa enthusiasts

00:00:28.243 --> 00:00:29.842
start their first class

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:32.509
Including our six protagonists,

00:00:32.756 --> 00:00:36.233
who already have made some new 
friends in the lobby

00:00:36.643 --> 00:00:39.804
But before we let them to nervously 
hide in the back rows,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.638
lets get to know a bit more 
always merry and adventurous Cristo

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:47.904
and North-East-Estonia girl Kristel, who is a 
former student in Tartu,

00:00:48.017 --> 00:00:49.819
and only recently has moved to Tallinn

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:51.706
Hi, I am Cristo

00:00:52.727 --> 00:00:56.411
starting the week here in Garage48 hub

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.853
I am self employed and do marketing

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:03.590
I am Kristel and

00:01:04.224 --> 00:01:07.557
I would call myself

00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:09.387
positive activist

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.401
I can’t just sit around

00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:15.711
I always find something 
interesting to do

00:01:16.453 --> 00:01:17.991
I volunteer a lot

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:22.403
and now, having lived in 
Tallinn for 2 weeks

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:24.899
already found salsa

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:28.897
I first heard about salsa
some years ago

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.884
I lived in Malaysia and dances like 
that are very popular there

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.793
Always when I saw those dancers
I kind of envied them

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:45.564
Doing all that, feeling good

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:46.879
and all that

00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:48.964
It stuck in my memory

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:51.360
And when I saw that chance

00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:54.317
to start doing it myself

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:56.557
I decided to go for it!

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.965
I saw salsa at parties in Tartu

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.407
The advanced dancers
were just – wow

00:02:03.153 --> 00:02:04.951
and i got interested

00:02:06.152 --> 00:02:07.865
When i have talked about this

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:09.288
not to many,

00:02:09.518 --> 00:02:11.331
to a few buddies

00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:16.540
The first reaction was: 
of course - who else!

00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:18.524
Nobody was really surprised

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.735
They already know how I am

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.035
I’ve been thinking about this skill,
what to do with it

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.217
and there are definitely options

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.659
In the long run

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.719
it depends on my progress, naturally

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.640
I could be the next salsa teacher

00:02:43.693 --> 00:02:47.160
Moving to South-America
and start teaching there

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:51.999
When the course ends, I want to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.532
feel confident at the salsa parties

00:02:56.297 --> 00:02:58.218
It’s an useful skill, for sure

00:02:58.753 --> 00:03:01.121
Like bicycling, in a way

00:03:01.526 --> 00:03:03.450
You can not do it for a while

00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:06.498
and still remember it later

00:03:07.137 --> 00:03:09.121
when you return

00:03:11.663 --> 00:03:12.789
The first class has started

00:03:13.162 --> 00:03:15.393
Our heroes are hiding in the back

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:18.960
and listen the teacher

00:03:19.337 --> 00:03:21.229
with a little anxious faces

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:22.961
"Salsa hint!"

00:03:23.121 --> 00:03:25.014
In salsa, you have to step 
softly and smoothly

00:03:25.423 --> 00:03:27.955
on toes

00:03:28.244 --> 00:03:30.724
and move your weight on each step

00:03:31.272 --> 00:03:33.552
girls usually manage it easier

00:03:33.854 --> 00:03:36.815
but every beginner needs to practice

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:47.614
What are the impressions 
after first class?

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.545
Was it as terrifying

00:03:49.916 --> 00:03:52.261
as written on the 
faces before the class?

00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:54.487
First impression is very good

00:03:54.648 --> 00:03:55.880
It was very cool

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:57.744
I came and was surprised to see

00:03:57.784 --> 00:04:00.626
so many Estonians in salsa class

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.510
I was rather expecting to see

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.005
maybe 20-30 faces

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.447
It gave some energy

00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:08.600
and laughs

00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:11.985
I saw people I hadn’t seen 15 years

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:15.000
I got a very good feeling

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:16.681
You forget everything else

00:04:17.546 --> 00:04:20.091
you have only the music and dancing

00:04:21.587 --> 00:04:24.177
relaxing shutoff from the world

00:04:29.026 --> 00:04:30.096
Already in the first class

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.920
I mastered the basic move

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.481
Just what I was hoping for

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:37.819
Sometimes it did happen that

00:04:38.363 --> 00:04:40.382
we were stepping on each others toes

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.151
I tried to save my light shoes

00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:44.909
But still got stepped on!

00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:50.250
We learned basics at first

00:04:50.446 --> 00:04:53.292
and teacher told us to find partners

00:04:53.315 --> 00:04:56.659
And then we switched often,
women moved on

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.685
It’s good to have different partners,

00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:02.174
taller ones and shorter ones

00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:06.169
some were moving better, some worse
some couldn't move at all

00:05:06.824 --> 00:05:08.122
Everybody was leading differently

00:05:09.203 --> 00:05:11.763
You always have to adapt 
to each new partner

00:05:12.374 --> 00:05:13.400
I am tall

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:17.675
I’d have liked to pull the 
hand to the ceiling

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.556
But I was reprimanded

00:05:21.152 --> 00:05:22.590
Don’t pull!

00:05:23.312 --> 00:05:26.019
I got two partners who 
were already advanced

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.721
And then it already got interesting

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.518
We managed to dance finally!

00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:34.034
I find it rather good

00:05:34.644 --> 00:05:37.766
so you won't get used to 
one girl and her moves

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.569
and vice versa

00:05:40.324 --> 00:05:44.750
You will learn to lead different girls

00:05:48.003 --> 00:05:50.483
It was good to switch quickly

00:05:51.607 --> 00:05:53.918
The experience was diverse

00:05:57.777 --> 00:06:01.601
I didn’t expect salsa to be so sporty

00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:03.361
It felt like

00:06:03.587 --> 00:06:05.803
I hadn’t moved my body for 5 years

00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:08.927
Like the first time to step quickly

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.195
But it was nice and sweaty

00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:14.244
It was getting hot

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:18.092
The only thing unexpected

00:06:18.534 --> 00:06:21.543
was the feeling in calves

00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:23.499
The calves were getting tired, yeah

00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.960
A lot of stepping on toes

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:29.682
The rhythm was quite hard to follow

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:33.658
Luckily the teacher helped

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.966
It ended so soon, i was surprised

00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:48.637
an hour already!

00:06:49.623 --> 00:06:52.931
I am eager to go to next class

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:55.290
I will be much more confident

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.313
now I know what to wait for

00:06:57.726 --> 00:06:59.128
Looking forward to 
the next class!

00:06:59.768 --> 00:07:03.758
The first class is over
but there’s a lot more coming up

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.958
More intricate moves,
experiencing the first party

00:07:07.686 --> 00:07:10.621
In the next episode we will get to know
Mikk and Irina

00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:14.719
And see if making turns
will nauseate anyone

00:07:15.324 --> 00:07:19.083
And why some girls don’t want to 
let go of some of the guys!
