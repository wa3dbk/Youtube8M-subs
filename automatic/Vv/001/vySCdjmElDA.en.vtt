something I did use neon blue in this

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.939 
something I did use neon blue in this
one<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.839> one<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.929> my<00:00:15.990> subscribers<00:00:16.199> did<00:00:16.770> one<00:00:16.920> of

one and one of my subscribers did one of
my<00:00:17.070> other<00:00:17.160> videos<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.640> believe<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.240> septum

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
my other videos I believe it was septum

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.080 
my other videos I believe it was septum
piercing<00:00:19.140> penny<00:00:19.350> out<00:00:19.439> said<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> should

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
piercing penny out said that I should

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.300 
piercing penny out said that I should
probably<00:00:21.270> clarify<00:00:21.830> whether<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.100> use

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
probably clarify whether to use

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.900 
probably clarify whether to use
non-toxic<00:00:24.300> glue<00:00:25.070> because<00:00:26.070> they<00:00:26.490> must<00:00:26.730> use

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
non-toxic glue because they must use

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.950 
non-toxic glue because they must use
toxic<00:00:27.359> glue<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.230> yeah<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.359> make<00:00:30.599> sure

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
I will see you guys so I pretty much

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.930 
I will see you guys so I pretty much
just<00:00:51.539> use<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> dry<00:00:52.140> erase<00:00:52.260> marker<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.550> mark

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
just use a dry erase marker to mark

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
just use a dry erase marker to mark
where<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> want<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.539> piercing<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.829> makes

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
where I want the piercing to be it makes

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.490 
where I want the piercing to be it makes
it<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.309> much<00:00:56.430> easier<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> end<00:00:57.109> but<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.320> you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
it so much easier in the end but if you

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.729 
it so much easier in the end but if you
make<00:00:58.680> circles<00:00:59.579> too<00:00:59.879> big<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.870> it'll<00:01:01.649> be

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
make circles too big then it'll be

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
make circles too big then it'll be
harder<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.010> cover<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.850> try<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.239> make<00:01:03.390> small

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
harder to cover so try and make small

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.320 
harder to cover so try and make small
back<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> make<00:01:08.850> sure<00:01:08.880> that

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
back and you want to make sure that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.209 
back and you want to make sure that
they're<00:01:09.510> pretty<00:01:09.780> even

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.599 

so<00:01:18.219> take<00:01:18.460> your<00:01:18.640> beef<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.750> your<00:01:19.990> lash<00:01:20.289> glue<00:01:20.649> or

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
so take your beef and your lash glue or

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.169 
so take your beef and your lash glue or
your<00:01:22.360> nail<00:01:22.929> glue<00:01:23.219> and<00:01:24.219> just<00:01:24.729> put<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.939> glue<00:01:25.090> on

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
your nail glue and just put the glue on

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:33.830 
your nail glue and just put the glue on
the<00:01:25.329> beads<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:31.210> then<00:01:31.390> stick<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:31.869> on<00:01:32.200> your<00:01:32.319> face

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the beads and then stick it on your face

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.580 
the beads and then stick it on your face
preferably<00:01:34.840> right<00:01:35.049> on<00:01:35.259> the<00:01:35.409> mark<00:01:37.319> then<00:01:38.319> do<00:01:38.469> the

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
preferably right on the mark then do the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:02:03.569 
preferably right on the mark then do the
same<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.009> other<00:01:39.219> side

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.800 

okay<00:02:04.579> so<00:02:04.640> that's<00:02:04.880> pretty<00:02:05.210> much<00:02:05.299> it

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
okay so that's pretty much it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.800 
okay so that's pretty much it
and<00:02:06.429> this<00:02:07.429> stays<00:02:07.850> on<00:02:08.090> for<00:02:08.119> quite<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.569> while<00:02:08.750> I

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
and this stays on for quite a while I

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.809 
and this stays on for quite a while I
know<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.739> this<00:02:10.039> one<00:02:10.250> looks<00:02:10.429> like<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:10.729> a

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
know that this one looks like it's a

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.100 
know that this one looks like it's a
little<00:02:11.120> like<00:02:12.040> too<00:02:13.040> far<00:02:13.310> up<00:02:13.900> compared<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.989> this

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
little like too far up compared to this

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.280 
little like too far up compared to this
one<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.590> guess<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.450> don't<00:02:17.450> know<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.840> looks<00:02:18.050> kind

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
one I guess I don't know it looks kind

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.059 
one I guess I don't know it looks kind
of<00:02:18.380> different<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.730> me<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.650> pretty<00:02:21.860> much

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
of different to me but you pretty much

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.949 
of different to me but you pretty much
personalize<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.790> make<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.090> your<00:02:23.239> own<00:02:23.390> feel

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
personalize that make it your own feel

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.080 
personalize that make it your own feel
comfortable<00:02:24.680> with<00:02:24.890> whatever<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.489> use<00:02:25.670> Google

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
comfortable with whatever I use Google

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.390 
comfortable with whatever I use Google
Images<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.660> find<00:02:26.900> real<00:02:27.290> bridge<00:02:27.620> piercing<00:02:28.220> and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
Images to find real bridge piercing and

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.000 
Images to find real bridge piercing and
I<00:02:28.610> try<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.910> imitate<00:02:29.269> them<00:02:29.599> a<00:02:29.630> little<00:02:29.959> bit<00:02:30.110> but

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
I try to imitate them a little bit but

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.070 
I try to imitate them a little bit but
like<00:02:31.519> some<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.910> them<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.420> bar<00:02:32.599> sticking

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
like some of them have the bar sticking

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.520 
like some of them have the bar sticking
out<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.319> little<00:02:33.440> bit<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.950> can't<00:02:34.250> do<00:02:34.459> that<00:02:35.470> well<00:02:36.470> I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
out a little bit I can't do that well I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.949 
out a little bit I can't do that well I
could<00:02:36.769> I<00:02:36.799> guess<00:02:37.099> but<00:02:37.580> it's<00:02:38.299> a<00:02:38.390> lot<00:02:38.540> harder<00:02:38.720> to

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
could I guess but it's a lot harder to

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.259 
could I guess but it's a lot harder to
do<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.940> yeah

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
do so yeah

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.020 
do so yeah
and<00:02:41.890> with<00:02:42.890> these<00:02:43.069> as<00:02:43.459> long<00:02:43.670> as<00:02:43.849> you're<00:02:44.000> not
