00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
for me you know Federer is the greatest

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.589 
for me you know Federer is the greatest
player<00:00:22.509> that's<00:00:22.660> ever<00:00:22.779> played<00:00:22.900> the<00:00:23.199> game

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.870 

I'd<00:00:28.599> actually<00:00:28.960> expect<00:00:29.259> Rafa<00:00:29.619> Nadal<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:30.099> be<00:00:30.220> to

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
I'd actually expect Rafa Nadal to be to

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.860 
I'd actually expect Rafa Nadal to be to
be<00:00:31.029> ahead<00:00:31.149> of<00:00:31.329> Federer<00:00:31.720> in<00:00:32.160> statistics<00:00:36.870> at

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
be ahead of Federer in statistics at

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.960 
be ahead of Federer in statistics at
this<00:00:38.050> stage<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.440> me<00:00:38.559> Federer<00:00:38.920> still<00:00:39.250> got<00:00:39.820> more

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
this stage to me Federer still got more

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.240 
this stage to me Federer still got more
Grand<00:00:40.269> Slams<00:00:40.570> and<00:00:40.809> that's<00:00:40.930> how<00:00:41.079> we<00:00:41.220> judge<00:00:42.220> a

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
Grand Slams and that's how we judge a

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.020 
Grand Slams and that's how we judge a
player<00:00:47.010> Nadal<00:00:48.010> is<00:00:48.190> for<00:00:48.399> me<00:00:48.519> the<00:00:48.640> only<00:00:48.729> guy<00:00:48.970> who

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
player Nadal is for me the only guy who

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.170 
player Nadal is for me the only guy who
came<00:00:49.269> in<00:00:49.420> all<00:00:49.570> four<00:00:49.870> in<00:00:50.019> one<00:00:50.170> year<00:00:53.940> two<00:00:54.940> years

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
came in all four in one year two years

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.959 
came in all four in one year two years

it's done so much for tennis he's
probably<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.429> best<00:01:00.609> player<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.850> all<00:01:01.210> time

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.280 

when<00:01:10.310> you've<00:01:10.430> seen<00:01:10.700> Rafa<00:01:11.119> play<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.630> last<00:01:11.840> year

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
when you've seen Rafa play the last year

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.320 
when you've seen Rafa play the last year
here<00:01:12.590> we<00:01:13.100> dislike<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:13.549> he<00:01:13.759> definitely<00:01:13.909> has<00:01:14.299> a

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
here we dislike so he definitely has a

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.210 
here we dislike so he definitely has a
chance<00:01:14.689> now<00:01:14.840> I'm<00:01:15.409> not<00:01:15.619> saying<00:01:15.830> it's<00:01:15.979> gonna<00:01:16.130> be

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
chance now I'm not saying it's gonna be

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.800 
chance now I'm not saying it's gonna be
easy<00:01:16.490> but<00:01:16.940> it<00:01:17.060> definitely<00:01:17.240> has<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.659> chance

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
easy but it definitely has a chance

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.110 
easy but it definitely has a chance
nothing

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.520 

and<00:01:26.120> all<00:01:26.240> of<00:01:26.390> a<00:01:26.480> sudden<00:01:26.510> he's<00:01:26.840> got<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.170> fierce

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
and all of a sudden he's got the fierce

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.480 
and all of a sudden he's got the fierce
Grand<00:01:27.950> Slam

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
Grand Slam

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.550 
Grand Slam

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
he's got to David's cups he's got the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.590 
he's got to David's cups he's got the
Olympics<00:01:31.070> these<00:01:31.760> are<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:31.970> couple<00:01:32.180> things<00:01:32.450> that

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
Olympics these are a couple things that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.910 
Olympics these are a couple things that
Roger<00:01:32.840> doesn't<00:01:33.350> have<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.650> he's<00:01:33.770> got<00:01:33.890> a

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
Roger doesn't have and he's got a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.550 
Roger doesn't have and he's got a
winning<00:01:34.250> record<00:01:34.400> over<00:01:34.790> Roger<00:01:35.000> of<00:01:35.380> course<00:01:36.380> he's

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
winning record over Roger of course he's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.160 
winning record over Roger of course he's
got<00:01:36.770> seven<00:01:37.190> more<00:01:37.340> majors<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.150> that<00:01:38.660> gap<00:01:38.900> could

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
got seven more majors but that gap could

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.630 
got seven more majors but that gap could
be<00:01:39.320> closed<00:01:39.620> because<00:01:39.830> there's<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.190> five-year

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
be closed because there's a five-year

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.620 
be closed because there's a five-year
age<00:01:40.670> difference

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
age difference

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.050 
age difference
so<00:01:41.840> I<00:01:42.200> never<00:01:42.740> thought<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:43.580> it'd<00:01:43.700> be<00:01:43.820> this

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
so I never thought that it'd be this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.500 
so I never thought that it'd be this
quick<00:01:44.360> I'm<00:01:44.980> truly<00:01:45.980> amazed<00:01:46.550> when<00:01:46.940> I<00:01:46.970> see<00:01:47.060> both

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
quick I'm truly amazed when I see both

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.320 
quick I'm truly amazed when I see both
of<00:01:47.750> them<00:01:47.900> but<00:01:48.710> perhaps<00:01:49.040> more<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:49.730> recently<00:01:49.940> in

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
of them but perhaps more so recently in

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.490 
of them but perhaps more so recently in
the<00:01:50.420> doll<00:01:50.660> that<00:01:50.690> he's<00:01:51.080> been<00:01:51.260> able<00:01:51.380> to

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
the doll that he's been able to

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.560 
the doll that he's been able to
transform<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.310> improve<00:01:52.370> his<00:01:52.700> game<00:01:52.910> as<00:01:53.120> as

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
transform and improve his game as as

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.210 
transform and improve his game as as
good<00:01:53.840> as<00:01:53.960> he<00:01:54.110> was<00:01:54.320> as<00:01:54.530> great<00:01:54.770> as<00:01:54.920> he<00:01:55.040> was

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
good as he was as great as he was

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.360 
good as he was as great as he was
already<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.700> be<00:01:55.790> that<00:01:55.970> much<00:01:56.210> better<00:01:56.480> now<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:57.770> is

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
already to be that much better now is is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.820 
already to be that much better now is is
amazing<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:59.300> at<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.480> same<00:01:59.660> time<00:02:00.020> Roger<00:02:00.650> is

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
amazing but at the same time Roger is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.440 
amazing but at the same time Roger is
not<00:02:00.980> finished<00:02:01.340> yet<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:01.580> he<00:02:01.970> still<00:02:02.210> he<00:02:02.420> still

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
not finished yet so he still he still

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.530 
not finished yet so he still he still
got<00:02:02.840> some<00:02:03.050> annual<00:02:03.320> ammunition<00:02:03.890> left<00:02:04.160> so

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
got some annual ammunition left so

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.150 
got some annual ammunition left so
looking<00:02:05.540> at<00:02:05.660> those<00:02:05.900> two<00:02:06.200> players<00:02:06.500> Nadal<00:02:07.010> and

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
looking at those two players Nadal and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.950 
looking at those two players Nadal and
Federer<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.580> think<00:02:07.820> there<00:02:08.000> are<00:02:08.030> two<00:02:08.390> unique

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
Federer I think there are two unique

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.750 
Federer I think there are two unique
players<00:02:09.290> which<00:02:09.619> doesn't<00:02:10.100> come<00:02:10.280> around<00:02:10.429> very

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
players which doesn't come around very

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.600 
players which doesn't come around very
often<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:12.380> they<00:02:13.100> are<00:02:13.160> playing<00:02:13.430> at<00:02:13.580> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
often and that they are playing at the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.850 
often and that they are playing at the
same<00:02:13.940> time<00:02:14.270> in<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.540> same<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.900> nation<00:02:15.440> is

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
same time in the same you nation is

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.620 
same time in the same you nation is
something<00:02:16.820> that<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.000> think<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:17.480> been

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
something that I think it's been

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.050 
something that I think it's been
fantastic<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:18.200> tennis<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.920> they<00:02:19.880> are

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
fantastic to tennis and they are

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.090 
fantastic to tennis and they are
extraordinary<00:02:20.750> players<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.830> they're<00:02:21.980> very

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
extraordinary players and they're very

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.190 
extraordinary players and they're very
faith<00:02:22.430> very<00:02:22.670> skillful<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.540> play<00:02:23.840> at<00:02:23.960> a<00:02:24.050> very

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
faith very skillful and play at a very

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.790 
faith very skillful and play at a very
high<00:02:24.380> level

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
high level

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.980 
high level
throughout<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.490> year<00:02:25.700> which<00:02:25.990> hasn't

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
throughout the year which hasn't

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.170 
throughout the year which hasn't
happened<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.770> past<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.190> think<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:29.000> way

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
happened in the past I think in that way

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.540 
happened in the past I think in that way
you<00:02:30.020> know<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.380> most<00:02:30.650> important<00:02:31.250> thing<00:02:31.280> I

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
you know the most important thing I

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.760 
you know the most important thing I
believe<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.480> they<00:02:32.720> stay<00:02:33.110> together<00:02:33.320> then

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
believe is that they stay together then

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.460 
believe is that they stay together then
they<00:02:33.920> keep<00:02:34.280> at<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.300> level<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.750> keep<00:02:35.959> pushing

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
they keep at this level and keep pushing

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.560 
they keep at this level and keep pushing
each<00:02:36.770> other<00:02:37.010> for<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> while

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
each other for a while

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.260 
each other for a while
Federer<00:02:39.170> was<00:02:39.440> like<00:02:39.590> way<00:02:39.920> above<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.640> nada<00:02:40.880> came

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
Federer was like way above and nada came

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.270 
Federer was like way above and nada came
back<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.810> then<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.410> then<00:02:42.530> Federer<00:02:42.830> came<00:02:43.100> back

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
back and then and then Federer came back

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.010 
back and then and then Federer came back
and<00:02:43.459> I<00:02:43.520> know<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.970> he's<00:02:44.120> coming<00:02:44.300> back<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.810> now

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
and I know that he's coming back and now

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.600 
and I know that he's coming back and now
maybe<00:02:45.260> feather<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.800> going<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.100> come<00:02:46.250> back<00:02:46.400> so

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
maybe feather is going to come back so

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.790 
maybe feather is going to come back so
because<00:02:46.910> they<00:02:47.000> push<00:02:47.330> each<00:02:47.510> other<00:02:47.750> up<00:02:48.020> see<00:02:48.200> and

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
because they push each other up see and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.740 
because they push each other up see and
that's<00:02:48.920> good<00:02:49.190> for<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.459> game<00:02:49.640> at<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.390> end<00:02:50.600> it

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
that's good for the game at the end it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.199 
that's good for the game at the end it
doesn't<00:02:50.989> really<00:02:51.050> matter<00:02:51.440> who's<00:02:51.830> gonna<00:02:52.040> be<00:02:53.030> the

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
doesn't really matter who's gonna be the

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.000 
doesn't really matter who's gonna be the
one<00:02:53.480> because<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.350> think<00:02:54.590> they<00:02:54.650> do<00:02:54.770> it<00:02:54.860> together

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
one because I think they do it together

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.430 
one because I think they do it together
actually
