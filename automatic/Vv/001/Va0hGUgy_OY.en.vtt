00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.670
 I present you rocket launcher a 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.170
 new tweak cydia who will you 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.750
 to display applications 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.310
 which is in your multitasking 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.869
 directly on the lock screen 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.970
 look already then a short moment and hop 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.260
 the icons appears on the right I 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.699
 can slide on the small glimpses and 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.160
 open an application very quickly 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 like that obviously if you have a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.859
 password we will ask you 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.750
 and in the setting panel of the tweak 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.520
 we find an option on off and the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.940
 ability to disable blur and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.890
 color 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.570
 then another option that will us 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.610
 allow if the asset to display the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.020
 glimpses in full screen so watch this 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.340
 that it gives I support a moment and 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.780
 now when I slip on 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.040
 application icons you see that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 the app preview that turns into 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.079
 background task appears on the whole 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.879
 of the screen 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.989
 so it allows you to see more 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.340
 things can be a little bit more 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.320
 easily but I do not think that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.480
 very pretty I prefer to leave the display 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 classic that looks like that so it's 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.899
 really nice but the background is dark 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.940
 so I rather prefer active and these 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.260
 two options here and that's what we 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.520
 now for apps that get 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.530
 found in multitasking they are 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.729
 on the lock screen and here you 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.780
 find the list of all 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.580
 applications installed on your 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.560
 device and if I check for example the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.450
 phone will not show up on my 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.740
 lock screen so here is either 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.939
 show you the apps that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.810
 turn into the multi tasking as I 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.729
 lÃ© do far 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.840
 or so here again you 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.979
 find the list of all 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.939
 applications installed on your 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.380
 apparatus 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.030
 there you can choose other 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.530
 applications not necessarily those that 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.330
 turn into multitasking but 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.979
 other apps that you are getting 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.060
 choose and that you will display as 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.530
 shortcut on the lock screen 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.020
 like the others I had everything to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.520
 the time I'm going to hire some and I 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.439
 I'll show you what it's all about 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.810
 so here I have about 5 or 6 a 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.189
 last the music and now I 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.659
 go back and I go in the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.860
 section just below so there I 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.149
 find all the applications that 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.770
 I checked but they are not yet 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.689
 activated I have the displaced and the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.130
 just put it on top so that there she 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.899
 now appears on the screen of 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.280
 lock as shortcuts so 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.509
 I 'm going all the apps here for 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.759
 that they are displayed and I can also 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.409
 choose their orders you want to place 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.729
 in the order you prefer it will be 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.110
 the order that will be displayed on the screen of 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.860
 lock for example cydia in 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.930
 second 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.549
 so now back on the screen 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.869
 lock game sheave then a short 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.369
 moment on the screen to display the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.500
 tweak is true what I have now 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.819
 the apps that I chose and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.510
 no longer running applications 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.129
 in the background 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.140
 you see that I crashed on 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.400
 flapi bird moreover here we are how 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.720
 it works it can also be a 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.950
 cool solution rather than display 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.140
 the one that runs in the background 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.580
 two possible options so be your 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.650
 personal applications is that of the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.840
 multitasking so a really hyper tweak 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.459
 practice very good shortcuts if he 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.680
 you're interested so his name is rocket 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.660
 launcher like this it is available 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.879
 on the cydia store for one dollar 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.930
 on the fashion source my eyes a 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.400
 I really recommend it if you 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.810
 want a very fast way to access 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.580
 to your apps on the screen of 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.650
 lock us tell me what you 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.940
 thought about it in the comments and 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.660
 I tell you very soon for a 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.590
 next video 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.590
