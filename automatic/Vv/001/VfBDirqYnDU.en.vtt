00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.880
 Have a good day, good afternoon, or good evening 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.160
 depending on the time you are 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.260
 watching this video I'm klaus 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.039
 barbie and you 're on the channel here at 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.020
 youtube 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.300
 but you can check other things that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.300
 I do it on the internet through my site 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.040
 This first one 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.559
 forgiveness episode but I have to 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.730
 catch a cydonia que no kishi 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.730
 which is basically something like knights 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.890
 from cydonia, I did not like the name it remembers 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.250
 that muse's music is a knight of 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.700
 cydonia at last this first episode was 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.710
 Well strange to me because and when I 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.710
 I read the synopsis and I did not expect something like that. 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.109
 in the synopsis I not only expected to see something like 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.020
 humanity had to leave the system 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.520
 because it is an alien race 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.739
 destroyed they were living in a 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.770
 kind of colony until a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.750
 face that will drive a gang one 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.170
 Legendary the legendary is what it is 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.880
 but what we saw we saw what 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 we saw that humanity now has 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.490
 a new sexuality as soon as they are 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.850
 those people are the third genre, right? 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.540
 who are the people who adapt to the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.180
 sex they need depending on the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.680
 partner in which they choose 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.170
 I found it interesting but maybe 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.619
 Unnecessary kind of what this is for. 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:47.780
 if there is not a quantity economy 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.759
 equal coexistence of women and men 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.250
 just not to have kings right 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.990
 the rare and fun and by the way 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.030
 bullshit but I saw a lot of people are 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.090
 commenting and I realized now that the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.719
 anime is totally in cgi né and effect in 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.740
 3d m and dude I liked it or did not like it 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.259
 how they left the frame rate right? 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.600
 number of frames per second and half 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.390
 low or lack of expression 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.150
 the characters but I liked how the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.320
 Tava lighting and drawing style 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.090
 It was well combined with the story you know. 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.220
 I think but in any case the first 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.710
 episode featured the character 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.260
 which was one of the ancient humans 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.750
 that you still need food to 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.150
 because it seems that beyond the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.290
 third gender people now also 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.670
 they feed from light, not with 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.950
 photosynthesis or something 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.870
 It was very complicated this episode and I 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.270
 I had not read anything from him what I read 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.830
 had nothing to do with what was shown 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.440
 I only saw that it was a middle 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.530
 different that it looks like it has some 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.380
 Rebel hidden down there has new 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.120
 people and has this fight against 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.000
 cool aliens right 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.290
 only apparently doing 100 years 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.430
 nothing happened 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.580
 summarizing whether it is economizing sidony kishi 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:19.290
 It's like one with the word is like 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:22.170
 If it was a check of the coden 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.840
 guy who lives there in shit and he kind of 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.300
 involved in the military and we discovered 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.390
 that he has a hidden power is that the 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.520
 power of it is to be a serum a superpilot 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.530
 and apparently it is also almost 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.770
 mortal because he had fallen 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.930
 broke his finger there he had hit the 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.180
 head did not die and we saw that he 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.340
 jumped from a huge height of that 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.200
 window and he did not die either because 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.860
 kind of human he is who is 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.310
 happening right that's the question is 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.410
 what is happening as it works 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.580
 that's because that hair guy 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.560
 long white wanted to fly the ogman dalmo 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.700
 I'll keep calling ganda ano 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.680
 hogan damo 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.650
 how does the robot talk because he wanted to 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.660
 to fly that classic robot there is he 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.500
 has a special power also some 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:19.140
 thing because the protagonist there had 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:22.200
 to get 9999 or 9999 from the escort 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.780
 not the model 17 but in the model 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.830
 18 only took 5 thousand is so different so 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.060
 I want to know 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.080
 What 's happening, I was curious 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.050
 this is it and I will continue to watch 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.449
 then from 0 to 10 naruto cce first 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.930
 episode said donilon kishi that I think 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:42.270
 I'll keep calling knights of 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.819
 cydonia or the knight of citizenship 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.129
 even do not know the cidoc comes easier 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:52.759
 to talk in any case from zero to ten 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.759
 minutes if dono kishi episode 1 won 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.319
 7 naruto because it was fun to 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.819
 watching made me curious 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.900
 especially that tip gueré clip 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.849
 I want to see 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.870
 damn they're going to fight now what goes 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.800
 happen the episode ends up subcontinent 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.289
 nec bag 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.610
 anyway this is what you found of anime 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.169
 mainly because it is done 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.960
 totally in 3d 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.870
 This is worse than the anime and be done. 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.520
 in rotoscopy this is worse than I 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.190
 I do not know if there's any effect 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.750
 the mix of 3d with two of what you 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.729
 found it leave us comments down here 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.159
