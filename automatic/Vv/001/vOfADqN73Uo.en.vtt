of with a lot of their other equipment
well<00:00:32.270> I<00:00:32.300> guess<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.810> one<00:00:32.930> thing<00:00:33.140> that<00:00:33.290> still

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
well I guess the one thing that still

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.020 
well I guess the one thing that still
sticks<00:00:33.650> out<00:00:33.829> of<00:00:33.950> my<00:00:34.070> mind<00:00:34.340> is<00:00:34.550> just<00:00:34.730> how<00:00:34.850> well

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
sticks out of my mind is just how well

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.660 
sticks out of my mind is just how well
it's<00:00:35.180> built<00:00:35.390> it's<00:00:35.780> got<00:00:36.020> a<00:00:36.380> tie<00:00:36.710> rod<00:00:36.920> system<00:00:37.430> and

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
it's built it's got a tie rod system and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.760 
it's built it's got a tie rod system and
the<00:00:37.790> back<00:00:38.150> suspension<00:00:38.780> is<00:00:38.900> really<00:00:39.200> solid<00:00:39.440> and

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
the back suspension is really solid and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.790 
the back suspension is really solid and
heavy<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:40.820> it's<00:00:41.030> built<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.660> last

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
heavy and it's built to last

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.210 
heavy and it's built to last
services<00:00:43.790> very<00:00:44.060> easily<00:00:44.710> it's<00:00:45.710> got<00:00:45.920> more<00:00:46.160> than

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
services very easily it's got more than

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.479 
services very easily it's got more than
adequate<00:00:46.820> power<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:48.350> handle<00:00:48.530> I<00:00:48.770> think<00:00:48.980> any<00:00:49.130> job

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
adequate power to handle I think any job

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.850 
adequate power to handle I think any job
though<00:00:49.880> we<00:00:50.060> just<00:00:50.230> not<00:00:51.230> too<00:00:51.350> long<00:00:51.500> ago<00:00:51.559> went

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
though we just not too long ago went

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.319 
though we just not too long ago went
through<00:00:51.980> some<00:00:52.130> deep<00:00:52.280> old<00:00:52.489> mud<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:52.880> water<00:00:53.090> and

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
through some deep old mud and water and

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.549 
through some deep old mud and water and
it<00:00:53.420> just<00:00:53.540> crawled<00:00:53.840> right<00:00:54.020> through<00:00:54.230> there<00:00:54.380> had

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
it just crawled right through there had

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.710 
it just crawled right through there had
no<00:00:54.680> problem<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:55.280> could<00:00:55.460> go<00:00:55.579> up<00:00:55.670> hills<00:00:55.910> with<00:00:56.690> a

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
no problem I could go up hills with a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.330 
no problem I could go up hills with a
good<00:00:56.960> load<00:00:57.140> on<00:00:57.290> so<00:00:57.590> this<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.920> real<00:00:58.130> work

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
good load on so this is a real work

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.850 
good load on so this is a real work
vehicle<00:00:58.700> that<00:00:59.120> that's<00:00:59.989> rugged<00:01:00.469> they've<00:01:00.649> got<00:01:00.829> a

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
vehicle that that's rugged they've got a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.530 
vehicle that that's rugged they've got a
good<00:01:01.100> box<00:01:01.309> on<00:01:01.610> it<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:01.910> can<00:01:02.090> take<00:01:02.239> a<00:01:02.270> lot<00:01:02.510> of

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
good box on it that can take a lot of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.320 
good box on it that can take a lot of
abuse<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:04.070> can<00:01:04.190> put<00:01:04.370> this<00:01:04.489> put<00:01:05.030> this<00:01:05.089> to

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
abuse and you can put this put this to

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.880 
abuse and you can put this put this to
use<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:05.750> it'll<00:01:05.930> do<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.049> lot<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.260> good<00:01:06.500> work<00:01:06.620> for

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
use and it'll do a lot of good work for

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.760 
use and it'll do a lot of good work for
you<00:01:07.450> so<00:01:08.450> therefore<00:01:08.870> it<00:01:08.990> lacks<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:09.530> some<00:01:09.680> of

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
you so therefore it lacks and some of

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.380 
you so therefore it lacks and some of
the<00:01:09.830> other<00:01:09.979> areas<00:01:10.190> as<00:01:10.460> far<00:01:10.490> as<00:01:10.640> speed<00:01:10.970> down<00:01:11.210> the

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
the other areas as far as speed down the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.500 
the other areas as far as speed down the
road<00:01:11.860> ease<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:13.190> handling<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.880> doesn't<00:01:14.420> have

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
road ease of handling it doesn't have

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.980 
road ease of handling it doesn't have
power<00:01:14.720> steering<00:01:15.340> so<00:01:16.340> but<00:01:17.180> it's<00:01:17.540> in<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.780> middle

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
power steering so but it's in the middle

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.330 
power steering so but it's in the middle
of<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.140> track<00:01:18.409> or<00:01:18.680> maybe<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.950> little<00:01:19.070> on<00:01:19.220> the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
of the track or maybe a little on the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.039 
of the track or maybe a little on the
higher<00:01:19.490> side<00:01:19.520> just<00:01:20.090> depends<00:01:20.450> on<00:01:20.540> your<00:01:20.659> uses

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
higher side just depends on your uses

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.710 
higher side just depends on your uses
you<00:01:21.680> look<00:01:21.860> at<00:01:21.979> how<00:01:22.070> this<00:01:22.310> swing<00:01:23.090> arm<00:01:23.299> here<00:01:23.600> is

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
you look at how this swing arm here is

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.840 
you look at how this swing arm here is
built<00:01:23.960> that's<00:01:24.920> pretty<00:01:25.250> solid

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
built that's pretty solid

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.510 
built that's pretty solid
that<00:01:26.210> thing<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.990> will<00:01:27.140> last<00:01:27.320> forever<00:01:27.590> take<00:01:28.490> a

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
that thing that will last forever take a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.270 
that thing that will last forever take a
lot<00:01:28.790> of<00:01:28.970> real<00:01:29.150> abuse<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:29.930> think<00:01:30.650> this<00:01:30.799> is<00:01:30.950> rated

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
lot of real abuse I think this is rated

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.399 
lot of real abuse I think this is rated
a<00:01:31.400> thousand<00:01:31.880> pounds<00:01:32.180> or<00:01:32.270> more<00:01:32.330> on<00:01:33.080> the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
a thousand pounds or more on the

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.160 
a thousand pounds or more on the
capacity<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.220> as<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:34.700> look<00:01:34.909> at<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.210> way<00:01:35.990> this

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
capacity and as I look at the way this

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.630 
capacity and as I look at the way this
frame<00:01:36.470> is<00:01:36.650> built<00:01:36.830> it's<00:01:37.070> going<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.310> handle<00:01:37.580> that

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
frame is built it's going to handle that

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.140 
frame is built it's going to handle that
easy<00:01:38.000> we<00:01:38.299> put<00:01:38.540> in<00:01:39.070> 250<00:01:40.070> pounds<00:01:40.460> plus<00:01:40.610> myself

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
easy we put in 250 pounds plus myself

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.340 
easy we put in 250 pounds plus myself
and<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.420> couldn't<00:01:41.600> even<00:01:41.750> tell<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.049> weight<00:01:42.200> had

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
and I couldn't even tell the weight had

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.170 
and I couldn't even tell the weight had
been<00:01:42.380> put<00:01:42.680> in<00:01:42.710> here<00:01:43.040> as<00:01:43.610> far<00:01:43.880> as<00:01:44.000> how<00:01:44.150> it

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
been put in here as far as how it

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.780 
been put in here as far as how it
handled<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.040> this<00:01:46.040> thing<00:01:46.250> here<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:46.610> could

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
handled so this thing here you could
