so<00:00:21.760> I<00:00:22.210> thought<00:00:22.690> I<00:00:23.080> would<00:00:23.350> put<00:00:23.560> together<00:00:23.800> a

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.370 
so I thought I would put together a

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.370 
so I thought I would put together a
little<00:00:24.730> weapon<00:00:25.090> guide<00:00:25.270> for<00:00:25.300> you<00:00:25.600> guys<00:00:25.810> since<00:00:26.170> I

guides<00:00:30.970> are<00:00:31.180> useful<00:00:31.600> so<00:00:31.840> why<00:00:32.020> not<00:00:32.169> combine

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
guides are useful so why not combine

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.030 
guides are useful so why not combine
both<00:00:32.920> of<00:00:32.980> them<00:00:33.340> and<00:00:33.670> yeah<00:00:34.330> logic<00:00:35.110> so<00:00:35.680> today

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
both of them and yeah logic so today

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.470 
both of them and yeah logic so today
we're<00:00:36.280> gonna<00:00:36.340> be<00:00:36.460> kicking<00:00:36.730> things<00:00:37.000> off<00:00:37.270> with

channel so what are we looking at here

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.380 
channel so what are we looking at here
what<00:01:56.320> are<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.680> major<00:01:56.950> advantages<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:57.970> using

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
what are the major advantages of using

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.840 
what are the major advantages of using
this<00:01:58.689> weapon<00:01:59.020> well<00:01:59.830> first<00:02:00.130> off<00:02:00.369> we<00:02:00.400> can<00:02:00.820> see

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
this weapon well first off we can see

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.840 
this weapon well first off we can see
that<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.630> acw-r<00:02:02.409> has<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.799> very<00:02:03.159> fast<00:02:03.490> rate<00:02:03.820> of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
that the acw-r has a very fast rate of

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.609 
that the acw-r has a very fast rate of
fire<00:02:04.000> which<00:02:04.540> means<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:05.049> when<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.290> pull<00:02:05.470> the

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
fire which means that when you pull the

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.789 
fire which means that when you pull the
trigger<00:02:05.650> people<00:02:06.610> will<00:02:06.939> die<00:02:07.440> fast<00:02:08.440> that's

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
trigger people will die fast that's

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.919 
trigger people will die fast that's
pretty<00:02:09.310> straightforward<00:02:09.640> now<00:02:10.450> if<00:02:10.600> we<00:02:10.720> combine

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
pretty straightforward now if we combine

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.900 
pretty straightforward now if we combine
that<00:02:11.380> with<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.769> fast<00:02:11.980> reload<00:02:12.400> time<00:02:12.579> which<00:02:12.760> is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910

amongst<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.280> operator<00:02:15.730> weapons<00:02:16.209> we're

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
amongst the operator weapons we're

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.870 
amongst the operator weapons we're
really<00:02:17.110> starting<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.620> see<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.220> strengths<00:02:18.760> of

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
really starting to see the strengths of

really starting to see the strengths of
this<00:02:19.209> weapon<00:02:19.690> that's<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.290> hard<00:02:20.530> word<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.739> say<00:02:21.040> by

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
this weapon that's a hard word to say by

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.240 
this weapon that's a hard word to say by
the<00:02:21.190> way<00:02:21.280> strengthes<00:02:22.620> strengths<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.860> quite

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the way strengthes strengths is quite

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.280 
the way strengthes strengths is quite
stressful<00:02:25.060> for<00:02:25.420> my<00:02:25.570> mouth<00:02:25.840> area

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
stressful for my mouth area

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.860 
stressful for my mouth area
now<00:02:26.829> this<00:02:27.040> weapon<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.640> very<00:02:27.790> effective<00:02:28.630> at

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
now this weapon is very effective at

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.930 
now this weapon is very effective at
taking<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:29.290> pretty<00:02:29.560> much<00:02:29.709> anything<00:02:30.100> at<00:02:30.549> close

to medium range the only thing that

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.970 
to medium range the only thing that

in<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.550> losing<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.000> gunfight<00:02:36.420> at<00:02:36.599> range<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
in you losing a gunfight at range is the

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.589 
in you losing a gunfight at range is the
damage<00:02:38.099> output<00:02:38.310> let's<00:02:39.030> say<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.450> were<00:02:39.569> to

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
damage output let's say if you were to

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.720 
damage output let's say if you were to
take<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:39.989> up<00:02:40.200> against<00:02:40.470> someone<00:02:40.739> with<00:02:41.040> an<00:02:41.160> m16<00:02:41.430> a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
take it up against someone with an m16 a

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.300 
take it up against someone with an m16 a
three<00:02:42.060> or<00:02:42.269> m416<00:02:42.810> you'll<00:02:43.800> have<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> greater

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
three or m416 you'll have a greater

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.670 
three or m416 you'll have a greater
chance<00:02:44.430> at<00:02:45.030> losing<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.599> gun<00:02:45.870> flight<00:02:46.170> due<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
chance at losing that gun flight due to

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.650 
chance at losing that gun flight due to
be<00:02:46.800> higher<00:02:46.980> damage<00:02:47.310> output<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:48.120> those<00:02:48.420> two

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
be higher damage output of those two

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.410 
be higher damage output of those two
rifles<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.769> aiming<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.489> upper<00:02:50.819> chest<00:02:51.209> and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
rifles so aiming for the upper chest and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.990 
rifles so aiming for the upper chest and
head<00:02:51.780> area<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.380> really<00:02:52.860> important<00:02:53.519> with<00:02:53.849> this

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
head area is really important with this

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.479 
head area is really important with this
weapon<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.540> doing<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.769> actually<00:02:55.950> fairly

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
weapon and doing so is actually fairly

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.790 
weapon and doing so is actually fairly
easy<00:02:56.940> for<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.510> most<00:02:57.660> part<00:02:57.900> since<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.349> recoil

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
easy for the most part since the recoil

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.520 
easy for the most part since the recoil
is<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.370> damn<00:02:59.730> low<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.390> weapon<00:03:00.630> it's

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
is so damn low on this weapon it's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.620 
is so damn low on this weapon it's
almost<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:02.220> you're<00:03:02.430> firing<00:03:02.819> an<00:03:03.060> SMG<00:03:03.330> or

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
almost like you're firing an SMG or

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.449 
almost like you're firing an SMG or
something<00:03:04.049> at<00:03:04.440> least<00:03:04.680> that's<00:03:04.950> what<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.220> feels

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
something at least that's what it feels

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.229 
something at least that's what it feels
like<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.910> me<00:03:06.140> however<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.620> acw-r<00:03:08.519> does<00:03:08.940> come

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
like to me however the acw-r does come

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.120 
like to me however the acw-r does come
with<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.599> little<00:03:09.840> bit<00:03:10.019> of<00:03:10.080> spread<00:03:10.470> now<00:03:11.069> you

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
with a little bit of spread now you

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.309 
with a little bit of spread now you
won't<00:03:11.340> notice<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.940> at<00:03:12.209> more<00:03:12.450> close<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.870> medium

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
won't notice it at more close to medium

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.589 
won't notice it at more close to medium
range<00:03:13.709> encounters<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:14.549> once<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.299> start

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
range encounters but once you start

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.809 
range encounters but once you start
engaging<00:03:16.140> people<00:03:16.530> at<00:03:16.769> those<00:03:16.920> longer<00:03:17.400> ranges

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
engaging people at those longer ranges

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.970 
engaging people at those longer ranges
you'll<00:03:18.480> start<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.930> notice<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.440> your<00:03:19.560> bullets

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
you'll start to notice that your bullets

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.500 
you'll start to notice that your bullets
are<00:03:20.130> not<00:03:20.160> hitting<00:03:20.579> on<00:03:20.670> target<00:03:21.150> even<00:03:21.329> though

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
are not hitting on target even though

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.900 
are not hitting on target even though
you're<00:03:22.019> spot-on<00:03:22.380> with<00:03:22.680> your<00:03:22.829> sights<00:03:23.160> so

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
you're spot-on with your sights so

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.270 
you're spot-on with your sights so
what's<00:03:24.630> are<00:03:24.900> we<00:03:25.049> going<00:03:25.349> to<00:03:25.500> do<00:03:25.709> about<00:03:25.950> that

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
what's are we going to do about that

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.550 
what's are we going to do about that
spread<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.730> what<00:03:27.150> are<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.510> best<00:03:27.720> attachments

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
spread and what are the best attachments

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.920 
spread and what are the best attachments
to<00:03:28.680> counter<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.160> well<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.760> have<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.510> perfect

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
to counter that well I have the perfect

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.770 
to counter that well I have the perfect
answer<00:03:31.230> for<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.920> found<00:03:32.430> out<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:33.180> slapping

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
answer for you I found out that slapping

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.140 
answer for you I found out that slapping
the<00:03:34.140> stubby<00:03:34.500> grip<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:35.040> combo<00:03:35.459> with<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.670> muzzle

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
the stubby grip in combo with a muzzle

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.479 
the stubby grip in combo with a muzzle
break<00:03:36.390> will<00:03:36.720> knock<00:03:36.959> off<00:03:37.230> most<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.099> spread

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
break will knock off most of the spread

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.059 
break will knock off most of the spread
and<00:03:38.730> vertical<00:03:39.209> recoil<00:03:39.420> so<00:03:40.290> let's<00:03:40.500> see<00:03:40.709> what

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
and vertical recoil so let's see what

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.660 
and vertical recoil so let's see what
that<00:03:41.100> actually<00:03:41.459> looks<00:03:41.970> like<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.540> game<00:03:43.670> now

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
that actually looks like in game now

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.340 
that actually looks like in game now
you'll<00:03:44.880> first<00:03:45.180> see<00:03:45.299> me<00:03:45.540> firing<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.049> weapon

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
you'll first see me firing the weapon

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.170 
you'll first see me firing the weapon
without<00:03:46.620> any<00:03:46.799> attachments<00:03:47.519> just<00:03:47.850> naked

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
without any attachments just naked

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.720 
without any attachments just naked
nothing<00:03:48.840> on<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.319> as<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:49.950> can<00:03:50.069> see<00:03:50.370> the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
nothing on it and as you can see the

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.879 
nothing on it and as you can see the
weapon<00:03:51.060> starts<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.569> deviate<00:03:51.750> up<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.859> the

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
weapon starts to deviate up and to the

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.129 
weapon starts to deviate up and to the
left<00:03:53.220> when<00:03:53.609> we<00:03:53.760> go<00:03:53.940> full<00:03:54.150> auto<00:03:54.209> now<00:03:54.690> again<00:03:54.989> at

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
left when we go full auto now again at

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.140 
left when we go full auto now again at
close<00:03:55.380> range<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:56.040> might<00:03:56.310> be<00:03:56.489> less<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:57.000> a

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
close range this might be less of a

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.970 
close range this might be less of a
problem<00:03:57.180> but<00:03:57.810> if<00:03:57.870> we<00:03:57.989> back<00:03:58.200> up<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.560> bit<00:03:58.709> if<00:03:58.859> we

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
problem but if we back up a bit if we

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.890 
problem but if we back up a bit if we
put<00:03:59.190> more<00:03:59.400> distance<00:03:59.639> between<00:04:00.090> ourselves<00:04:00.389> and

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
put more distance between ourselves and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.080 
put more distance between ourselves and
the<00:04:00.989> enemy<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.190> start<00:04:02.489> seeing<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:02.940> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
the enemy you can start seeing that the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.960 
the enemy you can start seeing that the
spread<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:04.109> starting<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.859> well<00:04:05.220> be<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> real

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
spread is starting to well be a real

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.360 
spread is starting to well be a real
issue<00:04:06.150> here<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.660> now<00:04:07.410> we're<00:04:07.920> gonna<00:04:08.010> do<00:04:08.220> the

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
issue here and now we're gonna do the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.879 
issue here and now we're gonna do the
same<00:04:08.549> test<00:04:08.850> with<00:04:09.269> both<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.959> stubby<00:04:10.350> grip<00:04:10.410> and

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
same test with both the stubby grip and

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.550 
same test with both the stubby grip and
the<00:04:11.100> muzzle<00:04:11.430> brake<00:04:11.639> attached<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.750> our<00:04:12.959> weapon

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
the muzzle brake attached to our weapon

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.550 
the muzzle brake attached to our weapon
and<00:04:13.769> look<00:04:14.370> at<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:14.579> up<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.329> 50%<00:04:15.690> of<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.229> spread

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
and look at that up to 50% of the spread

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.289 
and look at that up to 50% of the spread
and<00:04:16.769> horizontal<00:04:17.340> recoil<00:04:17.459> has<00:04:17.880> been<00:04:18.060> knocked

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
and horizontal recoil has been knocked

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.420 
and horizontal recoil has been knocked
off<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:19.260> can<00:04:19.440> clearly<00:04:19.769> see<00:04:19.979> the

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
off and you can clearly see the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.339 
off and you can clearly see the
advantage<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:21.030> using<00:04:21.090> these<00:04:21.479> attachments<00:04:22.200> at

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
advantage of using these attachments at

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.560 
advantage of using these attachments at

range the hipfire on this weapon isn't

range the hipfire on this weapon isn't
really<00:04:24.900> bad<00:04:25.229> or<00:04:25.620> great<00:04:25.919> either<00:04:26.190> it's<00:04:26.520> just

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
it's it's somewhere in between I find it

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.680 
it's it's somewhere in between I find it
to<00:04:28.919> do<00:04:29.039> the<00:04:29.160> job<00:04:29.190> just<00:04:29.370> fine<00:04:29.820> but<00:04:30.450> if<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:30.660> want

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
to do the job just fine but if you want

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.360 
to do the job just fine but if you want
to<00:04:30.930> get<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.139> most<00:04:31.349> out<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.770> your<00:04:31.950> hipfire

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
to get the most out of your hipfire

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.550 
to get the most out of your hipfire
accuracy<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.360> like<00:04:33.539> to<00:04:33.660> move<00:04:33.780> around<00:04:33.930> while

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
accuracy and like to move around while

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.670 
accuracy and like to move around while
doing<00:04:35.099> so<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.610> suggest<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:36.870> slap<00:04:37.169> on<00:04:37.410> a

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
doing so I suggest you slap on a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.920 
doing so I suggest you slap on a
vertical<00:04:38.160> grip<00:04:38.370> in<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.820> laser<00:04:39.150> sight<00:04:39.570> and

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
vertical grip in a laser sight and

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.620 
vertical grip in a laser sight and
you'll<00:04:40.590> be<00:04:40.740> good<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.919> go<00:04:41.190> also<00:04:41.970> if<00:04:42.270> you're

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
you'll be good to go also if you're

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.200 
you'll be good to go also if you're
engaging<00:04:43.020> people<00:04:43.380> at<00:04:43.590> range<00:04:43.919> or<00:04:44.280> behind<00:04:44.669> cover

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
engaging people at range or behind cover

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.540 
engaging people at range or behind cover
I<00:04:45.419> recommend<00:04:45.960> firing<00:04:46.229> three<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.979> five<00:04:47.220> round

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
I recommend firing three to five round

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.070 
I recommend firing three to five round
bursts

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
bursts

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.230 
bursts
while<00:04:48.439> slightly<00:04:48.830> compensating<00:04:49.789> for<00:04:50.060> the

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
while slightly compensating for the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.510 
while slightly compensating for the
vertical<00:04:50.659> recoil<00:04:50.870> so<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.770> means<00:04:52.039> making

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
vertical recoil so that means making

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.339 
vertical recoil so that means making
slight<00:04:52.849> adjustments<00:04:53.569> dragging<00:04:53.990> your<00:04:54.080> mouse

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
slight adjustments dragging your mouse

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.439 
slight adjustments dragging your mouse
or<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.800> controller<00:04:55.370> thumb<00:04:55.879> stick<00:04:56.210> thingy

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
or a controller thumb stick thingy

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.890 
or a controller thumb stick thingy
slightly<00:04:57.409> down<00:04:57.710> every<00:04:58.129> time<00:04:58.310> you<00:04:58.460> fire<00:04:58.900> so

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
slightly down every time you fire so

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.480 
slightly down every time you fire so
there<00:05:00.080> we<00:05:00.199> go<00:05:00.229> I've<00:05:00.650> pretty<00:05:00.919> much<00:05:01.009> filled<00:05:01.340> you

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
there we go I've pretty much filled you

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.399 
there we go I've pretty much filled you
in<00:05:01.520> on<00:05:01.909> all<00:05:02.090> of<00:05:02.270> these<00:05:02.419> strengths<00:05:02.990> of<00:05:03.169> the

acw-r now how about the bad stuff does

well<00:05:09.740> except<00:05:10.370> for<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.580> fact<00:05:10.789> that<00:05:10.879> it<00:05:11.060> only

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
well except for the fact that it only

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.839 
well except for the fact that it only
puts<00:05:11.509> out<00:05:11.659> a<00:05:11.719> maximum<00:05:12.229> damage<00:05:12.439> of<00:05:12.680> 22<00:05:13.189> instead

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
good all-rounder that everyone who

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.409 
good all-rounder that everyone who
pre-ordered<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.620> game<00:05:24.650> has<00:05:25.219> access<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:25.969> from

pre-ordered the game has access to from

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
of the other slightly more powerful

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.920 
of the other slightly more powerful
assault<00:05:33.469> rifles<00:05:33.919> so<00:05:34.729> to<00:05:34.789> me<00:05:35.060> it's<00:05:35.449> a<00:05:35.690> nice

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
assault rifles so to me it's a nice

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.740 
assault rifles so to me it's a nice
slightly<00:05:36.530> less<00:05:36.949> damaging<00:05:37.460> substitute<00:05:38.120> for

slightly less damaging substitute for

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.010 
slightly less damaging substitute for
something<00:05:38.900> like<00:05:39.379> the<00:05:39.500> m16a3<00:05:40.159> or<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:40.909> m416<00:05:41.449> and

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
something like the m16a3 or the m416 and

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.959 
something like the m16a3 or the m416 and
that's<00:05:42.740> it<00:05:42.979> really<00:05:43.190> I<00:05:43.340> mean<00:05:43.490> other<00:05:43.729> than<00:05:43.819> that

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:43.969 
that's it really I mean other than that
