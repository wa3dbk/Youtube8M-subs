00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.600 
time I believe this was bought off by a
private<00:00:31.199> individual<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:32.009> distributed

on here as you can see its owner with a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.749 
on here as you can see its owner with a
few<00:01:34.500> different<00:01:34.740> straps<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.549> when<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
few different straps so when you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.300 
few different straps so when you
actually<00:01:35.939> put<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.750> arm<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.950> kind<00:01:38.220> of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
actually put this on your arm it kind of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399 
actually put this on your arm it kind of
feels<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> floats<00:01:39.060> away<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:40.110> only<00:01:40.290> thing

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
feels like it floats away the only thing

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.929 
feels like it floats away the only thing
that<00:01:40.530> kind<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:41.040> takes<00:01:41.369> away<00:01:41.640> from<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
that kind of then takes away from that

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.850 
that kind of then takes away from that
is<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.390> little<00:01:42.659> splash<00:01:42.899> guard<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
is this little splash guard here the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.289 
is this little splash guard here the
splash<00:01:44.130> guard<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.520> guess<00:01:44.700> what<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.149> could

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
splash guard I guess what you could

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.670 
splash guard I guess what you could
possibly<00:01:45.329> do<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.020> because<00:01:46.380> there's<00:01:46.530> some

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
possibly do is because there's some

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.289 
possibly do is because there's some
plastic<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.189> air<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.520> form<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.149> around

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
plastic and air you can form it around

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.389 
plastic and air you can form it around

putting in here which I know is going to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.790 
putting in here which I know is going to
suck<00:03:21.510> up<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.720> lot<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.959> moisture<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.350> eventually

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
suck up a lot of moisture and eventually

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.400 
suck up a lot of moisture and eventually
