00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
known that I think in recent years

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.380 
known that I think in recent years
they've<00:00:55.870> gained<00:00:56.170> more<00:00:56.410> notoriety<00:00:56.829> for<00:00:57.550> how

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
they've gained more notoriety for how

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.330 
they've gained more notoriety for how
strong<00:00:58.660> of<00:00:58.750> a<00:00:58.809> team<00:00:58.840> they<00:00:59.170> are<00:00:59.320> mark<00:00:59.920> Matthews

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
strong of a team they are mark Matthews

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.250 
strong of a team they are mark Matthews
and<00:01:00.520> that<00:01:00.670> offense<00:01:01.149> is<00:01:01.359> extremely<00:01:01.809> potent

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
and that offense is extremely potent

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.400 
and that offense is extremely potent
they<00:01:02.440> have<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:02.789> unique<00:01:03.789> style<00:01:04.059> of<00:01:04.239> play<00:01:04.539> I<00:01:04.809> think

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
they have a unique style of play I think

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.740
