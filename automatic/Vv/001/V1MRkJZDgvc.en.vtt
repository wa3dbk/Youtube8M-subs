00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.340 
buddies we're playing hey Suleiman down
five<00:00:29.840> versus<00:00:30.290> six<00:00:30.850> some<00:00:31.850> domination<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:32.809> I

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
five versus six some domination and I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.100 
five versus six some domination and I
had<00:00:33.830> to<00:00:33.950> swap<00:00:34.190> to<00:00:34.430> my<00:00:34.580> support<00:00:35.150> class<00:00:35.510> because

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
had to swap to my support class because

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.020 
had to swap to my support class because
I<00:00:36.500> could<00:00:37.070> tell<00:00:37.220> we<00:00:37.430> don't<00:00:37.460> have<00:00:37.700> our<00:00:37.820> hands

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
I could tell we don't have our hands

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.670 
I could tell we don't have our hands
full<00:00:38.120> you<00:00:38.300> know<00:00:38.660> these<00:00:38.900> guys<00:00:39.080> were<00:00:39.140> going<00:00:39.410> in

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
full you know these guys were going in

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.369 
full you know these guys were going in
there<00:00:39.949> using<00:00:40.190> all<00:00:41.090> that<00:00:41.390> all<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:41.809> usual<00:00:42.199> easy

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
there using all that all the usual easy

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:43.900 
there using all that all the usual easy
mode<00:00:42.620> stuff<00:00:42.890> like<00:00:43.129> you<00:00:43.280> have<00:00:43.430> either<00:00:43.610> the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
mode stuff like you have either the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.640 
mode stuff like you have either the
satcoms<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:44.809> stuff<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.230> pulled<00:00:45.470> out<00:00:45.590> my

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
satcoms and stuff so I pulled out my

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.280 
satcoms and stuff so I pulled out my
support<00:00:46.250> class<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:47.780> think<00:00:48.020> this<00:00:48.170> is

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
support class and I think this is

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.590 
support class and I think this is
probably<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.890> best<00:00:49.250> support<00:00:49.730> class<00:00:50.059> in<00:00:50.390> the

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
probably the best support class in the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.100 
probably the best support class in the
game<00:00:50.930> period<00:00:52.269> and<00:00:53.269> I<00:00:53.390> was<00:00:53.510> playing<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:53.839> to<00:00:53.989> you

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
game period and I was playing it to you

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.750 
game period and I was playing it to you
and<00:00:54.409> the<00:00:54.559> reasons<00:00:54.920> why<00:00:55.040> I<00:00:55.070> run<00:00:55.400> it<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.610> way<00:00:55.640> I

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and the reasons why I run it the way I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.020 
and the reasons why I run it the way I
do

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
do

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.829 
do
number<00:00:56.720> one<00:00:57.250> SATCOM<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:58.550> helps<00:00:58.970> ballistic

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
number one SATCOM it helps ballistic

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.860 
number one SATCOM it helps ballistic
vests<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:02.239> ground<00:01:02.510> jammer

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
vests and the and the ground jammer

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.490 
vests and the and the ground jammer
because<00:01:04.059> basically<00:01:05.059> it<00:01:05.449> takes<00:01:05.630> out<00:01:05.930> satcoms

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
because basically it takes out satcoms

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.610 
because basically it takes out satcoms
and<00:01:06.860> all<00:01:07.040> anything<00:01:07.490> on<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.700> ground<00:01:07.940> it<00:01:08.090> just

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
and all anything on the ground it just

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.700 
and all anything on the ground it just
wrecks<00:01:09.620> it<00:01:09.950> but<00:01:10.610> I'm<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.180> gun<00:01:12.170> everything

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
wrecks it but I'm the gun everything

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.310 
wrecks it but I'm the gun everything
ties<00:01:12.950> in<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:13.250> wonderful<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.030> gun<00:01:14.320> everything

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
ties in so wonderful the gun everything

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.810 
ties in so wonderful the gun everything
so<00:01:15.590> right<00:01:15.740> now<00:01:15.860> I'm<00:01:15.920> using<00:01:15.979> red<00:01:16.340> dot<00:01:16.580> and

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
so right now I'm using red dot and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.890 
so right now I'm using red dot and
instead<00:01:17.810> of<00:01:17.960> Mads<00:01:18.970> spawn<00:01:19.970> guess<00:01:20.240> which<00:01:20.479> weapon

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
instead of Mads spawn guess which weapon

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.920 
instead of Mads spawn guess which weapon
that's<00:01:21.560> right<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.890> mtar<00:01:22.340> X<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.820> still<00:01:23.780> think

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
that's right the mtar X I still think

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
that's right the mtar X I still think
this<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.260> best<00:01:24.500> SMG<00:01:25.160> in<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.430> game<00:01:25.870> by<00:01:26.870> far

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
this is the best SMG in the game by far

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.010 
this is the best SMG in the game by far
if<00:01:27.950> if<00:01:28.880> you're<00:01:29.150> trying<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.540> just<00:01:29.780> straight-up

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
this kit I use all the speed parts

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.340 
this kit I use all the speed parts
basically<00:02:01.820> for<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.330> most<00:02:02.390> part<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:02.900> don't

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
basically for the most part I don't
