00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
fondant so it's a little bit of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:36.290 
fondant so it's a little bit of
cornflour<00:00:31.279> did<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.369> get<00:00:34.730> find<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> right<00:00:36.090> one

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
cornflour did I get find the right one

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
cornflour did I get find the right one
for<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.780> cupcake<00:00:39.950> what<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.370> kind<00:00:41.670> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
for the cupcake what one that kind of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.130 
for the cupcake what one that kind of
shoots<00:00:42.770> just<00:00:44.120> roughly<00:00:45.120> about<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> wrapper

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
shoots just roughly about on the wrapper

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.950 
shoots just roughly about on the wrapper
okay<00:00:47.039> cuz<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.940> has<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> has<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.660> bit<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
okay cuz this one has a has a bit of a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:58.440 
okay cuz this one has a has a bit of a
dome

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.870 

so<00:00:59.450> typically<00:00:59.960> if<00:01:00.650> your<00:01:00.890> cupcake<00:01:01.310> is<00:01:01.460> not<00:01:01.640> very

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
so typically if your cupcake is not very

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.640 
so typically if your cupcake is not very
smooth<00:01:02.270> you<00:01:02.600> can't<00:01:02.840> actually<00:01:03.020> put<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.350> bit<00:01:03.530> of

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
smooth you can't actually put a bit of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.730 
smooth you can't actually put a bit of
icing<00:01:04.150> typically<00:01:05.150> I<00:01:05.180> do<00:01:05.300> put<00:01:05.750> ganache<00:01:06.200> on<00:01:06.500> this

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
icing typically I do put ganache on this

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.400 
icing typically I do put ganache on this
but<00:01:07.040> for<00:01:07.520> today<00:01:07.790> because<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:08.840> quite<00:01:09.110> smooth

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
but for today because it is quite smooth

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.590 
but for today because it is quite smooth
and<00:01:09.650> this<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.100> just<00:01:10.310> for<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.730> demo<00:01:11.030> I'm<00:01:11.240> just

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
and this is just for the demo I'm just

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.260 
and this is just for the demo I'm just
going<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:12.220> put<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.340> fondant<00:01:13.520> directly<00:01:14.120> on

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
going to put the fondant directly on

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.180 
going to put the fondant directly on
there<00:01:14.480> so<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.020> cupcake<00:01:15.410> is<00:01:15.560> already<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:15.980> little

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
there so the cupcake is already a little

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.090 
there so the cupcake is already a little
bit<00:01:16.400> sticky<00:01:16.700> because<00:01:17.210> it<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.480> fresh<00:01:17.750> if<00:01:18.440> your

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
bit sticky because it is fresh if your

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.860 
bit sticky because it is fresh if your
cupcake<00:01:19.520> is<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.700> little<00:01:20.030> bit<00:01:20.120> drier<00:01:20.390> on<00:01:20.420> top

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
cupcake is a little bit drier on top

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.300 
cupcake is a little bit drier on top
what<00:01:21.050> you<00:01:21.140> can<00:01:21.320> do<00:01:21.440> is<00:01:21.530> actually<00:01:21.650> brush<00:01:22.010> it<00:01:22.190> off

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
what you can do is actually brush it off

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.830 
what you can do is actually brush it off
with<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.520> bit<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.730> sugar<00:01:22.970> syrup<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.510> then<00:01:23.660> your

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
with a bit of sugar syrup and then your

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.370 
with a bit of sugar syrup and then your
fondant<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.320> stick<00:01:24.590> or<00:01:25.070> if<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.430> have<00:01:25.610> your

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
of that the plastic I just cut that into

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.450 
of that the plastic I just cut that into
this<00:01:54.050> shape<00:01:54.290> okay<00:01:54.830> so<00:01:54.890> we're<00:01:55.130> gonna<00:01:55.220> start

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
this shape okay so we're gonna start

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.850 
this shape okay so we're gonna start
from<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.729> middle<00:01:56.410> and<00:01:57.410> we're<00:01:57.560> just<00:01:57.680> gonna

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
from the middle and we're just gonna

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.560 
from the middle and we're just gonna
buff<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.880> smooth<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.240> out

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
buff this and smooth it out

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.600 
buff this and smooth it out
you<00:02:00.050> can<00:02:00.200> notice<00:02:00.500> at<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:00.770> edge<00:02:00.920> I'm<00:02:01.250> pulling

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
you can notice at the edge I'm pulling

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.360 
you can notice at the edge I'm pulling
it<00:02:01.730> down<00:02:01.909> a<00:02:02.210> little<00:02:02.630> bit<00:02:02.870> just<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.950> smooth<00:02:04.250> it

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
it down a little bit just to smooth it

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.930 
it down a little bit just to smooth it
out<00:02:05.860> now<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:06.920> need<00:02:07.159> to<00:02:07.280> put<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.460> little<00:02:07.640> bit<00:02:07.850> of

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
out now you need to put a little bit of

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.919 
out now you need to put a little bit of
pressure<00:02:08.119> if<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:08.510> don't<00:02:08.660> put<00:02:08.780> pressure

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
pressure if you don't put pressure

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.509 
pressure if you don't put pressure
nothing's<00:02:09.590> really<00:02:09.769> going<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.100> happen<00:02:10.399> so

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
nothing's really going to happen so

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.090 
nothing's really going to happen so
we're<00:02:10.670> just<00:02:10.700> gonna<00:02:11.590> drop<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:12.950> put

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
we're just gonna drop that and put

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.500 
we're just gonna drop that and put
pressure<00:02:13.220> if<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.640> find<00:02:13.970> you're<00:02:14.090> doing<00:02:14.360> this

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
pressure if you find you're doing this

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.449 
pressure if you find you're doing this
and<00:02:15.080> your<00:02:15.200> plastic<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.680> getting<00:02:15.980> stuck<00:02:16.250> it

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
and your plastic is getting stuck it

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.800 
and your plastic is getting stuck it
