00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
excited to smoke it to be one hundred

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.399 
excited to smoke it to be one hundred
percent<00:01:31.760> honest<00:01:32.299> just<00:01:32.960> because<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.260> has<00:01:33.380> a

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
percent honest just because it has a

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.690 
percent honest just because it has a
strong<00:01:34.270> floral<00:01:35.270> aroma<00:01:35.830> but<00:01:36.830> with<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.250> floral

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
strong floral aroma but with that floral

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.270 
strong floral aroma but with that floral
aroma<00:01:37.940> comes<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.540> nice<00:01:38.720> raspberry<00:01:39.280> raspberry

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.490 
aroma comes a nice raspberry raspberry
fragrance<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:40.909> think<00:01:41.119> that's<00:01:41.500> honestly

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
fragrance and I think that's honestly

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.580 
fragrance and I think that's honestly
the<00:01:43.310> big<00:01:43.760> part<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.570> why<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.840> smells<00:01:45.140> floral<00:01:45.500> a

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590

as far as the flavor shanked I would say

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.960 
as far as the flavor shanked I would say
it's<00:02:52.240> fairly<00:02:52.540> high<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.200> flavor<00:02:53.470> strength

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.910 
it's fairly high on the flavor strength
um<00:02:54.970> somewhere<00:02:55.690> around<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.990> six<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.500> would<00:02:56.740> say

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
um somewhere around a six I would say

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.360 
um somewhere around a six I would say
maybe<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.730> 5.5<00:02:58.330> or<00:02:58.360> six<00:02:58.830> somewhat<00:02:59.830> mild<00:03:00.070> to

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
predominant type of flavoring is that

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.610 
predominant type of flavoring is that
raspberry<00:03:25.760> floral<00:03:26.450> type<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.780> flavoring<00:03:27.170> which

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
raspberry floral type of flavoring which

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.280 
raspberry floral type of flavoring which
is<00:03:27.830> a<00:03:28.000> kind<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.150> turns<00:03:29.480> me<00:03:29.660> off<00:03:29.690> towards<00:03:30.230> this

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
is a kind of turns me off towards this

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.050 
is a kind of turns me off towards this
flavor<00:03:30.530> but<00:03:31.010> it's<00:03:31.160> still<00:03:31.280> very<00:03:31.340> good<00:03:31.760> just

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
flavor but it's still very good just

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.850 
flavor but it's still very good just
because<00:03:32.210> that<00:03:32.480> raspberry<00:03:32.690> is<00:03:33.020> nice<00:03:33.200> but<00:03:33.710> that

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
because that raspberry is nice but that

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.650 
because that raspberry is nice but that
floral<00:03:34.220> flavors<00:03:34.550> sticks<00:03:34.820> out<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.240> lot<00:03:35.450> to

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
floral flavors sticks out a lot to

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.150 
floral flavors sticks out a lot to
personally<00:03:36.110> myself<00:03:36.260> because<00:03:36.740> I'm<00:03:36.830> not<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:36.980> big

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
personally myself because I'm not a big

personally myself because I'm not a big
floral<00:03:37.400> flan<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.480> then<00:03:38.990> you<00:03:39.680> get<00:03:39.800> a<00:03:39.830> nice<00:03:39.980> mix

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
floral flan and then you get a nice mix

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.370 
floral flan and then you get a nice mix
just<00:03:40.640> nice<00:03:40.970> like<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.300> said<00:03:41.510> just<00:03:42.140> like<00:03:42.230> it

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
it's a nice mix but personally the

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.849 
it's a nice mix but personally the
floral<00:04:20.180> flavor<00:04:20.359> still<00:04:20.660> just<00:04:20.989> is<00:04:21.200> not

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
floral flavor still just is not

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.430 
floral flavor still just is not
something<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.310> I'm<00:04:22.400> really<00:04:22.670> a<00:04:23.240> fan<00:04:23.780> of<00:04:23.810> so
