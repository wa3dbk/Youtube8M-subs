00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.209
 ok then let's talk today 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.240
 of improvisation, however, we see it in 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:20.470
 slightly different way than 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.950
 what you usually think of compared to 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.860
 how it approaches the time that 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.760
 in fact we dedicate to improvisation 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:34.270
 usually improvisation 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.570
 when I decide for example to make of 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.979
 dedicate an hour to improvisation 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.899
 I put on a base began to 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:49.170
 improvise on that base 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:53.139
 and sometimes just things that maybe 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.979
 I want on which I want to improve others 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:01:02.289
 sometimes I try to try to find gods 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:06.310
 new times I try to improve the 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.680
 sound to see expressiveness sometimes 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.229
 I try to think only 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.600
 to improvisation to transmit 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:19.330
 emotions and to make them into music here 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:24.180
 this is a bit what you do when 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.160
 dedicating time to improvisation is 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.270
 absolutely correct however there would be 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:37.000
 a method to make time be 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.820
 distributed in a better way 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.610
 in fact it is usually thought of 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.410
 immunization as a thing I had to 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.620
 everyone can do whatever he wants 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.390
 you have all the freedom to do that 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.640
 which moves obviously following the 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.590
 improvisation techniques and what 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.620
 I advise you to do it 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.550
 from today it's trying to do this 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.100
 here 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.330
 if I say I dedicate an hour e 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.390
 improvisation I take the time there 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.450
 I therefore dedicate it to honor it in half and 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.989
 I do the first half an hour I'm trying 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.150
 of new things or placing mine 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.129
 focus on the things I want 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.280
 improve for example if I want in part 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:28.239
 to improve in your picking then 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:37.299
 improvisations a little further up 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:39.909
 picking so I'll try some things that 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.620
 maybe if someone listens to me in those 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.749
 improvisations and when it will be on air is 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.900
 nice because I'm trying some techniques 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:49.510
 but I can still enjoy myself because 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.540
 this is a base I'm playing on and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.810
 try the technique too and then 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.340
 so improve my technique too 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.829
 this in the first part 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.939
 of improvisation so I do more 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.310
 be careful to find the colors of the 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:10.359
 phrases I can use in the merso 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.459
 therefore more future futures is also 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.090
 more technical then to experiment with it 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.910
 on the roof robo delle 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.129
 moves to improvise and technical in 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.560
 meaning I try to do that exercise 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.650
 those passages that improve mine 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.330
 technique instead in the second part 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.489
 improvisation 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.549
 I would like you to concentrate much more 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:36.120
 only and exclusively on expressiveness 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:42.170
 and therefore produce pure improvisation 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:47.310
 then express what you want 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:49.739
 give and make your emotions feel ed 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.720
 exclusively only that is with 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.130
 what you have that is with what you already have 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.829
 you know the ones with the skills you already have 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.769
 because this is because there is an error that 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:04.590
 it is very often committed that it is 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.700
 to do the two together to make 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.480
 a little and a little 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.480
 or try to improvise a 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.329
 food and improvise while you are 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.160
 giving importance to expressiveness and to 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:21.740
 emotions also feel something 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:25.560
 new here is a little wrong 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.419
 it would be much more efficient to separate the 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.070
 things then try things first 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.200
 new 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:36.200
 improve the technique and so on 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:41.490
 instead find what is more 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.500
 expressiveness and emotion then try 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:50.210
 to implement this advice if you want 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.210
 let me know if good music works
