that where it's a good of Jill see the

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.890 
that where it's a good of Jill see the
regular<00:04:56.639> monopoly<00:04:56.999> has<00:04:57.120> go<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.389> jail<00:04:57.659> right

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
regular monopoly has go to jail right

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.129 
regular monopoly has go to jail right
and<00:04:58.729> chance<00:04:59.729> and<00:05:00.029> chance<00:05:00.300> go<00:05:00.479> to<00:05:00.539> lunch<00:05:00.810> so<00:05:01.110> I
