00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.290
 hello welcome to my game of the month 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.750
 just June and we have to put point 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.599
 end to the stupendous life of the silver 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.950
 city I hope this month has served you 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.410
 to understand the mechanics of the game well 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.450
 and to see why I said at the beginning 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.369
 of the month that this national product game 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.410
 can compete face to face and without fear 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.360
 disheveled with great games of the 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.640
 themed zombie like zombies or own 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.950
 zombie saif you will have seen that it is a 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.140
 game very well thought where all the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.059
 details that have been given a spin 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.640
 so that everything is the most and allows the 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.240
 realistic expression possible and that in addition 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.650
 It has us keeps us in a sensation 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.560
 of constant tension throughout the 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.700
 departure because there are moments like past 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.590
 for example at the beginning of the game 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.270
 where it seems that everything is controlled 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.700
 we can make those temptations to the 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.800
 luck they did and there is not so much zombie 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.190
 in a moment the thing changes and we 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.900
 plague the city of zombies it is true that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.299
 the first games is very normal and a 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.670
 little more lost and end up succumbing 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.950
 before the avalanche of zombies but according to 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.329
 time goes by we can see a little 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.800
 the strategies to follow the fact of 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.690
 get inside 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.580
 of the buildings so as not to generate zombies 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.590
 or how to place the survivors for 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.210
 to be able to draw angles of vision towards 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.280
 all corners and thus prevent it from 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.020
 generate even then time goes on our 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.960
 against and you have seen that it can be 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.440
 really agonizing the game is true 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.290
 is much more serious in terms of less 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.510
 with us that there are zombies since we are not going 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.040
 as solutions for life kill 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.340
 zombies but you really have to 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.710
 escape from that epidemic but it does not stop 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.170
 be for it so so interesting or more 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.090
 interesting 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.220
 good things about zombies of forgiveness of 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.600
 look at silver city all the ones I 've already 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.060
 said throughout the month and you're 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.030
 I'm stressing bad things that also 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.540
 there are first of all I have to give a 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.789
 small pull of ears to the printing press to 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.619
 what they have done this game and is that 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.299
 it seems that the finish of certain 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.539
 components is not everything posted that 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.920
 should the letters have all a 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.390
 dust may have blown it a little 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.039
 by direct makes a dust and is that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.840
 have presented but it has all a 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.730
 dust quite annoying many of the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.590
 letters have the wrong cuts made as 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.030
 if someone had cut you by hand and 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.560
 although the dies are not the dies 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.900
 They are pretty good and they have enough 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.580
 quality are thick and quite good 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.060
 quality so the rest of the components 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.670
 or letters or even the board is not 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.720
 everything well finished that should 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.580
 also seen open enough copies 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.800
 of life of silver city means that 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.739
 in some things did not come as 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.260
 I should have this anyway, of course not 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.910
 it's not Pk's fault but that of the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.220
 printing company that manufactures the game but good 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.390
 the stick people could be a little 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.950
 more behind them so that this does not 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.160
 happen again because the truth is that 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.720
 It's a shame that detracts from the great 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.640
 quality of this game with some 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.590
 components that as above all the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.780
 letters 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.209
 the negative things good the game in a 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.010
 Single player is a little more boring is 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.590
 a little more bland but it's not that either 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.410
 be overly thought for it 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.700
 and it was little else I would say as soon as 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.709
 to negative things because you have already seen 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.239
 I repeat, everything is very well thought out 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.500
 everything is very studied and we have a 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.420
 great variety although board is not 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.940
 modulate that is not a negative thing since 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.890
 between the cards are chips of 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.080
 exploration that we have to give us 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.790
 certain randomness and the bunch of 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.319
 missions that exist between the manual and all 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.629
 those in the forum that has put us 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.180
 a link we have game for a while and not 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:37.819
 it does not matter is not to be repetitive go 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.230
 so good until here the conclusion 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.060
 of life of silver city the month dedicated to 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.290
 this great game I insist for me 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.109
 right now it's the best game of 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.120
 zombie theme that we have those like 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.769
 also the theme do not miss it and 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.900
 let's move on to what moment everyone 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.209
 you are waiting for the draw of a 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.420

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.060
 previous draw we have seen the 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.680
 list of people who have successful 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.540
 the question that we all knew in the 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.489

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.530

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.530
 the question and we are going to make the draw 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.519

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.620
 bingo like we would do in the 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.759
 previous draw each of the 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.859
