little two-car garage was 35 40 years
ago<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.290> started<00:01:49.619> putting<00:01:49.890> tools<00:01:50.100> together<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
ago I started putting tools together to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.130 
ago I started putting tools together to
build<00:01:50.700> bikes<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.630> lived<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.990> garage

that's<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> was<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.909> kind<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that's what I was going to do it kind of

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.740 
that's what I was going to do it kind of
went<00:02:03.360> above<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.840> beyond<00:02:04.170> what

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
went above and beyond what

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.080 
went above and beyond what
dreamed<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.290> now<00:02:06.040> wasn't<00:02:06.220> there<00:02:06.460> just<00:02:06.850> in<00:02:07.000> the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
dreamed of now wasn't there just in the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.669 
dreamed of now wasn't there just in the
shop<00:02:07.330> going<00:02:07.660> oh<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.810> mean<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.110> build<00:02:08.289> something

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
shop going oh I mean to build something

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.290 
shop going oh I mean to build something
or<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:08.860> was<00:02:09.039> just<00:02:09.160> like<00:02:09.280> I'm<00:02:09.460> making<00:02:09.700> bikes<00:02:09.880> Wow

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
or I was just like I'm making bikes Wow

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.090 
or I was just like I'm making bikes Wow
and<00:02:10.600> I<00:02:10.660> got<00:02:10.840> two<00:02:10.960> bucks<00:02:11.200> for<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.440> burrito<00:02:11.680> today

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
and I got two bucks for a burrito today

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.830 
and I got two bucks for a burrito today
so<00:02:12.460> wasn't<00:02:12.670> any<00:02:12.910> expectation<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.630> build

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
so wasn't any expectation to build

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.780 
so wasn't any expectation to build
anything<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.350> was<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.860> just<00:02:15.400> couldn't

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
anything it was just I just couldn't

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.970 
anything it was just I just couldn't
stop<00:02:16.210> building<00:02:16.690> bikes<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.290> built<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.710> lot<00:02:17.830> of

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
stop building bikes and I built a lot of

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.710 
stop building bikes and I built a lot of
bikes<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:18.610> was<00:02:18.730> until<00:02:19.030> 1980<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.660> I

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
bikes and it was until 1980 that I

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.690 
bikes and it was until 1980 that I
actually<00:02:19.870> built<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.320> bike<00:02:20.500> from<00:02:20.740> scratch

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
actually built a bike from scratch

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.120 
actually built a bike from scratch
this<00:02:22.000> bike<00:02:22.240> is<00:02:22.320> relevant<00:02:23.320> now<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.500> anything

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
this bike is relevant now to anything

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.650 
this bike is relevant now to anything
out<00:02:24.250> there<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.670> will<00:02:24.880> perform<00:02:25.030> better<00:02:25.390> than

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
out there and will perform better than

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.449 
out there and will perform better than
anything<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.740> was<00:02:26.920> called<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.280> limited

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
anything this was called a limited

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.850 
anything this was called a limited
edition<00:02:27.790> it's<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.630> fully<00:02:28.870> brave<00:02:29.110> bike<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.709> two

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
edition it's a fully brave bike the two

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.530 
edition it's a fully brave bike the two
beings<00:02:30.070> you<00:02:30.190> know<00:02:30.250> it's<00:02:30.490> like<00:02:30.790> oh<00:02:30.940> three<00:02:31.300> five

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
beings you know it's like oh three five

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.270 
beings you know it's like oh three five
thick<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:32.140> know<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.380> art<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.830> was<00:02:33.010> Phil

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
thick you know the art of this was Phil

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.460 
thick you know the art of this was Phil
appraising<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.660> whole<00:02:34.810> idea<00:02:35.140> was<00:02:35.290> to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
appraising and the the whole idea was to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.620 
appraising and the the whole idea was to
make<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.650> filler<00:02:36.130> Debray<00:02:36.550> brass<00:02:36.970> that's<00:02:37.360> how<00:02:37.570> we

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
make a filler Debray brass that's how we

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.910 
make a filler Debray brass that's how we
joined<00:02:37.959> him<00:02:38.050> was<00:02:38.200> braising<00:02:38.680> them<00:02:38.770> with

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
joined him was braising them with

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.400 
joined him was braising them with
locally<00:02:39.250> mean<00:02:39.400> bronze<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.480> torch<00:02:40.750> but

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
locally mean bronze with the torch but

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.229 
locally mean bronze with the torch but
the<00:02:41.560> art<00:02:41.770> was<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.040> make<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:42.970> beautiful

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
the art was to make a beautiful

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.300 
the art was to make a beautiful
transition<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.530> tangent<00:02:44.800> points<00:02:45.220> were

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
transition so the tangent points were

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.160 
transition so the tangent points were
perfect<00:02:45.760> when<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.120> have<00:02:46.209> acute<00:02:46.540> angles<00:02:46.900> that

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
perfect when you have acute angles that

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.630 
perfect when you have acute angles that
Phil<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.590> was<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.709> little<00:02:47.920> different<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.370> open

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
Phil it was a little different the open

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.340 
Phil it was a little different the open
angles<00:02:48.940> were<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.120> little<00:02:49.360> bit<00:02:49.450> longer<00:02:49.720> but<00:02:50.080> it's

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
angles were a little bit longer but it's

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.840

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
learning how to make it in an efficient

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.900 
learning how to make it in an efficient
way

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
way

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.120

so<00:04:26.510> it's<00:04:26.630> aesthetically<00:04:27.200> beautiful<00:04:27.350> so<00:04:27.950> it's

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
so it's aesthetically beautiful so it's

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.160 
so it's aesthetically beautiful so it's
structurally<00:04:28.790> strong<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.540> so<00:04:29.990> it's<00:04:30.110> a

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
structurally strong and so it's a

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.870 
structurally strong and so it's a
finished<00:04:30.590> product<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.130> it's<00:04:31.460> got<00:04:31.700> all<00:04:31.790> the

finished product and it's got all the
pain<00:04:32.120> lines<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.540> everything<00:04:32.810> it's<00:04:33.200> really

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
pain lines and everything it's really

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.430

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
hard to beat clean and simple it's no

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.910
