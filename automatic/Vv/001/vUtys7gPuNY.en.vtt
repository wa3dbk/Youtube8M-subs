00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
so about a year ago I decided to combine

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.190 
so about a year ago I decided to combine
several<00:00:11.520> pieces<00:00:11.850> of<00:00:12.030> gear<00:00:12.330> by<00:00:12.540> making<00:00:12.990> my<00:00:13.170> own

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
several pieces of gear by making my own

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.290 
several pieces of gear by making my own
poncho<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.070> figured<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.760> would<00:00:14.879> cover<00:00:15.059> my

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
poncho I figured that would cover my

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.679 
poncho I figured that would cover my
rain<00:00:15.570> jacket<00:00:15.599> my<00:00:16.560> pack<00:00:16.890> cover<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.390> rain

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
fly over my hammock and so I made my own

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that I have with it so far is the way I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
that I have with it so far is the way I
put<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.110> snaps<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.739> front<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.220> back<00:00:59.430> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
put the snaps in the front in the back I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.280 
put the snaps in the front in the back I
don't<00:00:59.820> know<00:01:00.030> what<00:01:00.150> I<00:01:00.180> did<00:01:00.269> wrong<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
don't know what I did wrong with the

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.439 
don't know what I did wrong with the
snap<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.710> don't<00:01:01.860> match<00:01:02.040> up<00:01:02.070> correctly<00:01:02.449> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
snap that don't match up correctly and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
snap that don't match up correctly and
also<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> front<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.650> thought<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.250> would

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
also in the front I thought this would

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.520 
also in the front I thought this would
be<00:01:05.460> an<00:01:05.580> appropriate<00:01:06.090> length<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.229> walk

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
be an appropriate length but as I walk

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.010 
be an appropriate length but as I walk
the<00:01:07.830> motion<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.400> body<00:01:08.670> causes<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> poncho

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the motion of my body causes the poncho

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260 
the motion of my body causes the poncho
to<00:01:10.110> come<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.439> above<00:01:10.830> my<00:01:11.070> knees<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.090> get

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
to come up above my knees so I get

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.880 
to come up above my knees so I get
soaking<00:01:12.600> wet<00:01:12.780> from<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.140> knees<00:01:13.320> down<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.830> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
soaking wet from the knees down so I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.920 
soaking wet from the knees down so I
definitely<00:01:14.070> needed<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.790> longer<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.510> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
definitely needed to be longer in the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.870 
definitely needed to be longer in the
front<00:01:16.230> and<00:01:16.440> when<00:01:16.620> I<00:01:16.650> put<00:01:16.830> my<00:01:16.860> backpack<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.640> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
front and when I put my backpack on I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.250 
front and when I put my backpack on I
don't<00:01:18.000> think<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.360> long<00:01:18.540> enough<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> back

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
don't think it's long enough in the back

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.770 
don't think it's long enough in the back
so<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.790> those<00:01:20.940> problems<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.450> ugly<00:01:21.630> with

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
so are those problems you can ugly with

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.880 
so are those problems you can ugly with
yeah

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
yeah

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.100 
yeah
all<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.430> and

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.780 

when<00:01:28.010> zipped<00:01:28.370> up<00:01:28.610> this<00:01:29.150> becomes<00:01:29.570> my<00:01:29.750> rain<00:01:30.020> fly

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
when zipped up this becomes my rain fly

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.130 
when zipped up this becomes my rain fly
so<00:01:31.790> we<00:01:31.910> need<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.150> make<00:01:32.300> sure<00:01:32.480> that<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.780> zipper

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
so we need to make sure that that zipper

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.750 
so we need to make sure that that zipper
is<00:01:33.910> below<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:35.180> diagonal<00:01:35.600> centerline<00:01:36.610> so<00:01:37.610> that

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
is below the diagonal centerline so that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.540 
is below the diagonal centerline so that
that<00:01:37.970> flap<00:01:38.870> over<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.260> zipper<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:40.130> rain<00:01:40.340> will

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
that flap over the zipper the rain will

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.600 
that flap over the zipper the rain will
run<00:01:40.760> over<00:01:41.030> that<00:01:41.390> so<00:01:41.840> as<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.800> problem<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.490> can

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
run over that so as a problem you can

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.180 
run over that so as a problem you can
all<00:01:43.670> be<00:01:43.700> concur<00:01:44.090> as<00:01:44.180> well<00:01:44.380> all<00:01:45.380> right<00:01:45.530> let's<00:01:46.010> do
