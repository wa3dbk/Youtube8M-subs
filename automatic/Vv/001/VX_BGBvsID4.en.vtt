00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that there aren't a bunch of clumps in

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.030 
that there aren't a bunch of clumps in
it<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.900> we<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> wait<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> start

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it and we have to wait for it to start

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.530 
it and we have to wait for it to start
to<00:01:14.100> bubble<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.760> once<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.090> starts<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> bubble

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to bubble and once it starts to bubble

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.210 
to bubble and once it starts to bubble
and<00:01:15.840> we'll<00:01:16.020> take<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> pan<00:01:16.470> off<00:01:18.500> okay<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.799> after

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and we'll take the pan off okay so after

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.070 
and we'll take the pan off okay so after
letting<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.090> sit<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.540> couple<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.930> hours

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
letting it sit for a couple of hours

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.960 
letting it sit for a couple of hours
this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.890> what<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> bubbling<00:01:23.729> looks<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:28.970> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
this is what the bubbling looks like and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.620 
this is what the bubbling looks like and
you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.299> take<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.720> rag<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.530> paint<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> towel

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.920 

and<00:01:38.630> just<00:01:38.870> wake<00:01:39.110> well<00:01:43.090> any<00:01:44.090> parts<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.630> don't

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
and just wake well any parts that don't

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.899 
and just wake well any parts that don't
come<00:01:45.110> off<00:01:45.260> with<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.680> rag<00:01:45.860> just<00:01:46.280> use<00:01:46.610> these

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
come off with the rag just use these

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.350 
come off with the rag just use these
plastic<00:01:47.720> scraper<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:49.130> scrape<00:01:49.400> off<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.760> extra

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
plastic scraper to scrape off the extra

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.620 
plastic scraper to scrape off the extra
paint<00:01:53.290> okay<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:54.979> got<00:01:55.670> most<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:56.180> off<00:01:56.330> and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
paint okay so I got most of it off and

paint okay so I got most of it off and
I'm<00:01:56.810> not<00:01:56.990> worried<00:01:57.380> too<00:01:58.250> much<00:01:58.280> about<00:01:58.460> getting

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
I'm not worried too much about getting

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.270 
I'm not worried too much about getting
all<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.300> it<00:01:59.420> off<00:01:59.570> but<00:02:00.500> now<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:00.680> can<00:02:00.950> see<00:02:00.979> the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
all of it off but now you can see the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.330 
all of it off but now you can see the
reflective<00:02:02.200> surface<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.740> actual<00:02:04.100> mere

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
reflective surface of the actual mere

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.749 
reflective surface of the actual mere
part<00:02:04.610> with<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.030> paint<00:02:05.240> all<00:02:05.360> taken<00:02:05.690> off<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.840> it

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
part with the paint all taken off of it

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.219 
part with the paint all taken off of it
and<00:02:07.759> I'm<00:02:07.880> just<00:02:08.030> going<00:02:08.179> over<00:02:08.330> right<00:02:08.660> now<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.869> get

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
and I'm just going over right now to get

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:21.520 
and I'm just going over right now to get
all<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:18.130> okay<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:19.610> now<00:02:20.150> it's<00:02:20.390> time<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.690> use<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
all the okay so now it's time to use the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.979 
all the okay so now it's time to use the
muriatic<00:02:22.040> acid<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.070> stuff<00:02:28.630> says<00:02:29.630> veins

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
muriatic acid and this stuff says veins

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.740 
muriatic acid and this stuff says veins
are<00:02:30.290> poisoned<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.209> have<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.420> suit<00:02:32.600> up

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
are poisoned so you have to suit up

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.240 
are poisoned so you have to suit up
properly<00:02:33.430> gloves<00:02:34.430> mask<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.540> goggles<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:36.350> put

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
properly gloves mask and goggles I put

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:48.720 
properly gloves mask and goggles I put
it<00:02:37.370> into<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.819> spray<00:02:38.480> bottle<00:02:45.670> around<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.790> edges

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
it into a spray bottle around the edges

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.819 
it into a spray bottle around the edges
and<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:50.150> acid<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:50.720> going<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.959> eat<00:02:51.140> away<00:02:51.170> at<00:02:51.440> the

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
and the acid is going to eat away at the

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:59.470 
and the acid is going to eat away at the
reflective<00:02:52.430> surface<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.310> messed<00:02:59.030> up<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.360> the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
reflective surface so I messed up on the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.720 
reflective surface so I messed up on the
first<00:02:59.510> man<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.799> actually<00:03:01.220> I'll<00:03:01.340> do<00:03:01.519> my

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
first man and actually I'll do my

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.789 
first man and actually I'll do my
project<00:03:02.239> taking<00:03:02.750> all<00:03:02.930> of<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.260> reflective

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
project taking all of the reflective

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.240 
project taking all of the reflective
stuff<00:03:04.010> off<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.489> making<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.970> glass

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
stuff off and making it glass

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.979 
stuff off and making it glass
make<00:03:07.610> sure<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.820> when<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.180> squirt<00:03:08.570> with<00:03:08.840> the

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
make sure that when you squirt with the

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.860 
make sure that when you squirt with the
squirt<00:03:09.230> bottle<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:11.150> have<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.360> make<00:03:11.510> sure<00:03:11.690> that

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
squirt bottle you have to make sure that

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.220 
squirt bottle you have to make sure that
you<00:03:11.989> do<00:03:12.200> little<00:03:12.560> tiny<00:03:12.860> spritz<00:03:13.690> because<00:03:14.690> the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
you do little tiny spritz because the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.170 
you do little tiny spritz because the
script<00:03:15.530> bottle<00:03:15.829> reacted<00:03:16.400> differently<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:17.060> me

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
script bottle reacted differently to me

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.720 
script bottle reacted differently to me
squirting<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.019> it<00:03:18.350> made<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.620> giant<00:03:19.010> hole<00:03:19.519> in

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
squirting it and it made a giant hole in

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.150 
squirting it and it made a giant hole in
