handle then it stands out like a sore
thumb<00:01:18.909> and<00:01:19.909> you<00:01:20.119> need<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:20.420> do<00:01:20.540> something<00:01:20.840> with

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
thumb and you need to do something with

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.530 
thumb and you need to do something with

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
it and that's what I did with this one I

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.100 
it and that's what I did with this one I
took<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.689> handle<00:01:27.049> off<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:29.600> made<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.840> new

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
handle and I used pins to put the new

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.490 
handle and I used pins to put the new
handle<00:01:34.009> onto<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.369> knife<00:01:34.579> and<00:01:35.090> I<00:01:35.689> also<00:01:36.110> change

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.840 
handle and putting a new handle on I'm
not<00:02:00.259> saying<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.740> is<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.950> best<00:02:01.250> way<00:02:01.579> I'm<00:02:01.820> just

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
not saying this is the best way I'm just

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.609 
saying this is the way I did it it's a
fairly<00:02:05.299> simple<00:02:05.780> way<00:02:06.280> I<00:02:08.079> didn't<00:02:09.079> go<00:02:09.229> out<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.410> my

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
fairly simple way I didn't go out of my

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.089 
fairly simple way I didn't go out of my
way<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:11.360> split

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
way to to split

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.489 
way to to split

or anything like that and take timber

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.789 
or anything like that and take timber
off<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.980> cut<00:02:15.819> it<00:02:15.939> down<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.389> used<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.840> piece<00:02:17.019> of<00:02:17.079> a

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
off and cut it down I used a piece of a

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.989 
off and cut it down I used a piece of a
piece<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.909> heavy<00:02:19.150> down<00:02:20.139> for<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.889> handle<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.459> I

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
piece of heavy down for the handle and I

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:26.280 
piece of heavy down for the handle and I
reshaped<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.749> to<00:02:22.930> fit<00:02:23.139> and<00:02:24.719> I'll<00:02:25.719> show<00:02:26.049> you<00:02:26.079> the

reshaped it to fit and I'll show you the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.910 
reshaped it to fit and I'll show you the
process<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:27.010> doing<00:02:27.189> that<00:02:27.959> okay<00:02:28.959> we'll<00:02:29.739> do<00:02:29.889> that
