so I created another mask and this mask

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
so I created another mask and this mask
is<00:01:01.670> based<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:03.439> some<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> fluid<00:01:04.860> mask<00:01:05.070> bits

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
is based on some of the fluid mask bits

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.830 
is based on some of the fluid mask bits
on<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> top<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.540> went<00:01:06.689> through

to this he lip so it looks kind of flat
and<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:09.049> that<00:03:09.409> there<00:03:09.590> was<00:03:09.709> some

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
and I like that there was some

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.800 
and I like that there was some
modulation<00:03:10.579> of<00:03:10.819> tone<00:03:11.090> here<00:03:11.389> I<00:03:11.419> just<00:03:11.510> didn't

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
modulation of tone here I just didn't

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.619 
modulation of tone here I just didn't
like<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.230> shadow<00:03:12.699> so<00:03:13.699> I'm<00:03:13.969> gonna<00:03:14.150> double

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
like the shadow so I'm gonna double

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.710 
like the shadow so I'm gonna double
click<00:03:14.750> that<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.349> open<00:03:15.799> up<00:03:16.040> our<00:03:16.250> layer<00:03:16.639> styles

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
click that and open up our layer styles

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.830 
click that and open up our layer styles
and<00:03:18.159> now<00:03:19.159> I'm<00:03:19.310> going<00:03:19.639> to<00:03:19.879> create<00:03:20.299> a<00:03:20.509> gradient

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
and now I'm going to create a gradient

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.580 
and now I'm going to create a gradient
overlay<00:03:21.259> and<00:03:21.979> we're<00:03:22.669> gonna<00:03:22.819> set<00:03:23.090> that<00:03:23.239> to

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
overlay and we're gonna set that to

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.469 
overlay and we're gonna set that to
multiply<00:03:24.590> mode<00:03:24.949> turn<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.939> down<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.239> little

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
multiply mode turn that down a little

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.780 
multiply mode turn that down a little
bit<00:03:26.750> okay<00:03:27.650> there<00:03:28.040> we<00:03:28.250> go<00:03:28.280> maybe<00:03:28.849> color<00:03:29.299> dodge

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
bit okay there we go maybe color dodge

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.110 
bit okay there we go maybe color dodge
em<00:03:31.790> color<00:03:34.299> now<00:03:35.299> next<00:03:35.870> thing<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.079> want<00:03:36.259> to<00:03:36.349> do<00:03:36.560> is

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
em color now next thing I want to do is

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.589 
em color now next thing I want to do is
I<00:03:38.120> want<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.870> add<00:03:39.079> a<00:03:39.439> pattern<00:03:39.949> overlay<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.970> if

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
I want to add a pattern overlay and if

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.059 
I want to add a pattern overlay and if
you<00:03:41.689> add<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.139> pattern<00:03:42.590> what<00:03:43.489> happens<00:03:43.879> is<00:03:44.120> it

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
you add the pattern what happens is it

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.020 
you add the pattern what happens is it
draws<00:03:46.069> over<00:03:47.349> your<00:03:48.349> gradient<00:03:48.949> so<00:03:49.790> what<00:03:49.939> you

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
draws over your gradient so what you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.550 
draws over your gradient so what you
have<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.209> do<00:03:50.359> is<00:03:50.540> select<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.959> blend<00:03:51.290> mode<00:03:51.530> and

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
have to do is select the blend mode and

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.030 
have to do is select the blend mode and
set<00:03:51.979> that<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.310> multiply<00:03:53.169> okay<00:03:54.169> and<00:03:54.889> then<00:03:55.009> I

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
set that to multiply okay and then I

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.839 
set that to multiply okay and then I
have<00:03:55.099> one<00:03:55.430> pattern<00:03:55.699> down<00:03:56.030> here<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:56.949> I<00:03:57.949> think

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
have one pattern down here and I think

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.229 
have one pattern down here and I think
this<00:03:59.299> is<00:03:59.509> it<00:03:59.889> alright<00:04:00.889> and<00:04:01.310> I'm<00:04:01.430> we're<00:04:01.549> going

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
this is it alright and I'm we're going

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.699 
this is it alright and I'm we're going
to<00:04:02.329> turn<00:04:02.509> this<00:04:02.689> down<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.930> little<00:04:03.229> bit<00:04:03.409> more

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
to turn this down a little bit more

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.610 
to turn this down a little bit more
because<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:04.129> pattern<00:04:04.519> is<00:04:04.989> being<00:04:05.989> multiplied

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
because the pattern is being multiplied

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.149 
because the pattern is being multiplied
and<00:04:07.039> it<00:04:07.219> has<00:04:07.370> its<00:04:07.609> own<00:04:08.229> it's<00:04:09.229> not<00:04:09.379> waiting<00:04:09.889> so

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
and it has its own it's not waiting so

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.279 
and it has its own it's not waiting so
it's<00:04:10.459> darkening<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.389> image<00:04:11.629> up<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.870> little<00:04:12.079> bit

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:12.289 
it's darkening the image up a little bit

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:16.089 
it's darkening the image up a little bit
more<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.739> like<00:04:13.269> okay<00:04:14.269> and<00:04:14.840> let's<00:04:15.229> create<00:04:16.039> a

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
more and I like okay and let's create a

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.689 
more and I like okay and let's create a
inner<00:04:16.489> shadow<00:04:17.949> and<00:04:18.949> when<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.219> set<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.489> distance

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
inner shadow and when I set the distance

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.759 
inner shadow and when I set the distance
to<00:04:20.090> zero<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.719> I'm<00:04:20.840> just<00:04:21.019> going<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.199> open<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.620> up

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
to zero and I'm just going to open it up

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.150 
to zero and I'm just going to open it up
like<00:04:21.949> that<00:04:22.219> and<00:04:22.630> I'm<00:04:23.630> going<00:04:23.779> to<00:04:23.840> add<00:04:23.990> a<00:04:24.020> little

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
like that and I'm going to add a little

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.540 
like that and I'm going to add a little
so<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.120> has<00:04:26.270> a<00:04:26.300> little<00:04:26.510> texture<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:28.130> I'm<00:04:28.370> gonna

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
so it has a little texture and I'm gonna

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.580 
so it has a little texture and I'm gonna
turn<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.270> opacity<00:04:29.510> down<00:04:30.400> like<00:04:31.400> a<00:04:32.030> lot<00:04:32.590> okay

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
turn the opacity down like a lot okay

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.990 
turn the opacity down like a lot okay
there<00:04:34.460> we<00:04:34.610> go

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
there we go

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.420 
there we go
so<00:04:35.480> I'll<00:04:35.570> just<00:04:35.720> click<00:04:35.900> okay<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.290> confirm<00:04:37.190> that

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
so I'll just click okay and confirm that

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.159 
so I'll just click okay and confirm that
and<00:04:37.610> let's<00:04:37.790> take<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:37.940> look<00:04:38.120> before<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.770> after

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
and let's take a look before and after

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.420 
and let's take a look before and after
maybe<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.320> drop<00:04:42.530> shadows<00:04:42.860> too<00:04:43.010> much<00:04:43.250> we'll

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
maybe the drop shadows too much we'll

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.280 
maybe the drop shadows too much we'll
figure<00:04:43.580> we'll<00:04:44.180> figure<00:04:44.450> that<00:04:44.600> out<00:04:44.660> later<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.260> I

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
figure we'll figure that out later so I

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.500 
figure we'll figure that out later so I
only<00:04:45.380> turn<00:04:45.620> it<00:04:45.740> off<00:04:45.830> for<00:04:45.980> now<00:04:46.040> though<00:04:46.480> create<00:04:47.480> a

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
only turn it off for now though create a

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.050 
only turn it off for now though create a
new<00:04:47.690> layer<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.260> I'm<00:04:48.919> gonna<00:04:49.040> hold<00:04:49.370> down<00:04:49.520> ctrl

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
new layer and I'm gonna hold down ctrl

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.250 
new layer and I'm gonna hold down ctrl
alt<00:04:50.330> shift<00:04:50.510> in<00:04:51.020> E<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:51.770> that's<00:04:52.669> gonna<00:04:52.820> merge

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
alt shift in E and that's gonna merge

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.010 
alt shift in E and that's gonna merge
all<00:04:54.260> the<00:04:54.710> art<00:04:55.040> onto<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.550> new<00:04:56.000> layer<00:04:56.240> go<00:04:56.960> to

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
all the art onto a new layer go to

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.950 
all the art onto a new layer go to
filters<00:04:57.530> and<00:04:57.950> I'm<00:04:58.669> just<00:04:58.820> gonna<00:04:59.030> fire<00:04:59.660> up<00:04:59.870> a

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
filters and I'm just gonna fire up a

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
a lot more contrast in detail and I'm

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.810 
a lot more contrast in detail and I'm
using<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.370> effect<00:05:13.850> called<00:05:14.889> tonal<00:05:15.889> contrast<00:05:16.070> and

just<00:05:22.669> gonna<00:05:22.850> click<00:05:23.090> OK<00:05:23.800> if<00:05:24.800> we<00:05:24.889> compare<00:05:25.250> this

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
just gonna click OK if we compare this

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.680 
just gonna click OK if we compare this
to<00:05:26.720> that<00:05:27.580> you<00:05:28.580> see<00:05:28.789> it's<00:05:28.910> much<00:05:29.090> more<00:05:29.330> lively

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
to that you see it's much more lively

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.540 
to that you see it's much more lively
image<00:05:30.350> and<00:05:30.530> then<00:05:31.039> we're<00:05:31.160> actually<00:05:31.220> going<00:05:31.430> to

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
image and then we're actually going to

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.630 
image and then we're actually going to
duplicate<00:05:32.090> that<00:05:32.120> again<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:33.080> I'm<00:05:33.740> gonna<00:05:33.890> run

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
duplicate that again and I'm gonna run

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.940 
duplicate that again and I'm gonna run
the<00:05:34.729> filter<00:05:34.970> on<00:05:35.210> it<00:05:35.330> again<00:05:35.800> sometimes<00:05:36.800> it's

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
the filter on it again sometimes it's

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.540 
the filter on it again sometimes it's
cool<00:05:37.070> to<00:05:37.280> go<00:05:37.400> overboard<00:05:37.789> and<00:05:38.360> then<00:05:39.250> like<00:05:40.250> ramp

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
cool to go overboard and then like ramp

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.529 
cool to go overboard and then like ramp
yourself<00:05:41.030> back<00:05:41.590> so<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:43.100> definitely<00:05:43.970> don't<00:05:44.390> like

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
yourself back so I definitely don't like

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.540 
yourself back so I definitely don't like
what's<00:05:44.930> happening<00:05:45.380> here<00:05:45.440> it's<00:05:46.130> just<00:05:46.370> way<00:05:46.520> too

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
what's happening here it's just way too

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
what's happening here it's just way too
strong<00:05:47.030> so<00:05:47.330> I'm<00:05:47.390> gonna<00:05:47.510> click<00:05:47.870> here<00:05:48.530> on<00:05:48.560> his

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
strong so I'm gonna click here on his

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.029 
strong so I'm gonna click here on his
alpha<00:05:50.570> Channel<00:05:50.960> and<00:05:51.140> I'm<00:05:51.229> gonna<00:05:51.350> go<00:05:51.470> up<00:05:51.500> here

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
alpha Channel and I'm gonna go up here

00:05:52.039 --> 00:06:00.159 
alpha Channel and I'm gonna go up here
and<00:05:52.430> just<00:05:55.030> click<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.510> layer<00:05:57.289> mask<00:05:57.320> and<00:05:59.169> there

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
and just click the layer mask and there

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.260 
and just click the layer mask and there
we<00:06:00.320> go<00:06:00.530> and<00:06:00.800> this<00:06:01.370> is<00:06:01.520> still<00:06:01.789> like<00:06:01.940> way<00:06:02.210> too

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
we go and this is still like way too

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.909 
we go and this is still like way too
strong<00:06:02.840> but<00:06:03.440> if<00:06:03.530> I<00:06:03.590> cut<00:06:03.770> that<00:06:03.919> in<00:06:04.100> half<00:06:05.919> or

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
strong but if I cut that in half or

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.730 
strong but if I cut that in half or
maybe<00:06:07.100> 20<00:06:07.580> 30<00:06:07.610> percent<00:06:08.330> it<00:06:09.320> starts<00:06:09.590> to<00:06:09.650> look

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
maybe 20 30 percent it starts to look

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.980 
maybe 20 30 percent it starts to look
like<00:06:09.950> pretty<00:06:10.490> interesting<00:06:11.210> and<00:06:11.570> if<00:06:11.900> we

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
like pretty interesting and if we

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.620 
like pretty interesting and if we
compare<00:06:12.380> that<00:06:12.650> image<00:06:13.130> with<00:06:13.550> this<00:06:13.700> image<00:06:13.940> and

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
compare that image with this image and

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.409 
compare that image with this image and
this<00:06:14.840> looks<00:06:15.080> like<00:06:15.490> they<00:06:16.490> use<00:06:16.729> a<00:06:16.760> black<00:06:17.090> card

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
this looks like they use a black card

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.800 
this looks like they use a black card
and<00:06:17.990> a<00:06:18.289> lot<00:06:18.830> more<00:06:18.860> interesting<00:06:19.820> lighting<00:06:20.210> and

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
and a lot more interesting lighting and

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.060 
and a lot more interesting lighting and
maybe<00:06:20.990> it's<00:06:21.139> a<00:06:21.169> little<00:06:21.350> overboard<00:06:21.740> for<00:06:21.979> your

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
maybe it's a little overboard for your

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.590 
maybe it's a little overboard for your
taste<00:06:22.340> but<00:06:22.550> you<00:06:22.639> can<00:06:22.789> always<00:06:22.940> just<00:06:23.240> turn<00:06:23.419> it

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
taste but you can always just turn it

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.029 
taste but you can always just turn it
down<00:06:23.750> you<00:06:24.700> can<00:06:25.700> always<00:06:26.060> do<00:06:26.510> that<00:06:26.570> so<00:06:27.229> one<00:06:27.830> out

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
down you can always do that so one out
