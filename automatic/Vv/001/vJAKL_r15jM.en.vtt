00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.500
 I'm Tamara, I'm 35 years old and I chose this Volkswagen T1 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.500
 because I wanted to have a Camperbus for a long time. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 We had first found a bus in America, which we wanted to bring here 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 but the person who sold it at the last minute changed his mind so that did not happen. 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.000
 Then we went looking further and the same evening we found such a similar performance on the internet by chance and it was in England. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 So we flew there by plane, a one-way trip, and watched the bus 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.400
 and he liked it so much that we bought it and drove it back to the Netherlands 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.030
 and that in itself was a very nice, special trip. 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.300
 Via Dunkirk we drove back to the Netherlands and here we mainly started with the technical aspects of the bus, 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.400
 the bottom is completely varnished, it all had rust on it, which was otherwise not completely welded on. 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.100
 In April of this year we completely dismantled it and had it sprayed in these colors, 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.200
 because that is an original color from 1965 and I thought that was a bit nicer. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.200
 Because the bus originally from the factory it was completely white, but I found that a bit less beautiful, 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.800
 I think the two-colored for this model is very suitable so that's why he now has these colors. 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.230
 And since a month he is almost completely finished again. 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:49.900
 We have renewed the ceiling, all rubbers have been renewed, we have searched for all authentic original parts again 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.000
 like the aluminum cups in the small cupboard. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.780
 And furthermore I am always looking for things that are from the same period, 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:09.500
 that fit in so that it becomes one whole, also in the crockery and everything we use with it. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.000
 I only recently found the gas set that is original in the cabinet, so you can complete the picture completely 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:26.700
 and I think that with our whole family we can enjoy it in that style and atmosphere if we go away with it. 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.300
 I had never driven it before, it sends very differently, very differently. 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.000
 Of course we drove in England, on the left that was very exciting 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.519
 but very nice, I really experienced that as very special. 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.959
 Also how people react to you when you drive a van is very nice, 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.700
 everyone is waving enthusiastically, making movies on the highway when you are driving somewhere 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.700
 so that makes you very happy, which is always very nice. 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:05.100
 Certainly here in this bus it is just like sitting on the couch at home, it is of course not a chair so you sit just like sitting on a bench. 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.200
 The steering wheel there you get the tendency to hang up when you are driving. 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.800
 And you always sit a bit forward because it is so low, so you do have a separate position when you are driving. 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.800
 That took some getting used to in the beginning but now I am completely used to it so it runs very well. 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.500
 We sometimes go to a lake here in the neighborhood, where we can swim, 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.100
 we can also park the van at the lake now, because they know us that is very nice. 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.600
 He is then just at the beach and can enjoy the bus all day and play 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.800
 and in the evening he goes back to the garage. 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.800
 Another reason I wanted a bus to camp with us is that we had children 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.169
 and I also think that it is nice to have a nice day out as a family. 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:56.100
 This was really something that we could all use and enjoy 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.000
 so that was also a reason that I wanted to have a T1 camper. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.200
 Yes what I like about this bus is the atmosphere and the picture that goes with it from the 50s and 60s 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.700
 when these buses were delivered. 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:24.700
 And that is something I also try to search for this bus, in all details 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.400
 and the colors of the tent and the bus itself. 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:39.100
 So that we can also create that atmosphere as people used it at the time, that is something I have in mind. 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:48.100
 I like the cozy but also the style, the colors and the shape, but a bit cuddly. 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.200
 But also from camping what is included, it is very homely but also the freedom 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.300
 that you can go camping anywhere you want, I really like that combination. 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.100
 That is also something that I would like our children to experience and experience 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.800
 and luckily they really enjoy it too, so I think that will work. 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.600
 That is something I have in mind a bit of the nostalgia that surrounds the bus and the style, 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.600
 that is something I really love.
