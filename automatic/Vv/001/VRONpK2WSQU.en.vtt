 but today we're not here on the track to 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.029
 just talk about that car on a train 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.020
 that this truck has to do with this 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.570
 story 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.119
 we brought the camaro chevrolet v8 more 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.009
 popular sold in brazil to find 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.910
 with a more powerful v8 produced in the 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.369
 Brazil 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.369
 scania r 620 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.100
 good guys 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.720
 the weather was fine but the truth is that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.410
 southern fantasy miranda did not give time to 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.510
 dry 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.270
 So to stay in style 2008 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.130
 Americans decided to put on this 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.130
 Quiet style to accompany moves 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.060
 we are here in a small vineyard 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.979
 small elevation but so it serves 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.680
 to show for all to see yesterday 8 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.110
 a truck is more than locked take away 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.610
 runs on racetracks in v8 actually 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.380
 here to give strength at any moment 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.720
 so the type of truck you can 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.680
 to start any weight being 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.440
 wanted 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.440
 and he goes ahead come on 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.000
 best of all it was deleted from the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.320
 engine and even arrived at the station 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.570
 gasolline draw wave even the noise of 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.640
 engine is something that when it arrives at the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.590
 there is not one that does not think 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.430
 patient has arrived at v8 here at 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.380
 piece 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.650
 so check out the 8- noise scanner 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.810
 it is simply the famous klec 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.190
 everybody's attention is so much 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.450
 force you can not even compare 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.009
 the gasoline engine 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.560
 after all diesel engines work in 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.730
 even lower rotation 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.640
 but this path still has a business 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.620
 legal when species in the range of 1,400 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.100
 rpm can already start walking 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.260
 you bring the exchange of your direction and he 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.130
 comes forward while pushing to come 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.470
 back 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.239
 it still has a very 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.370
 cool for you to save is called 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.060
 mainly loaded workouts is 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.340
 irritate 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.150
 it can be triggered automatically in the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.310
 manually 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.160
 the fact is that running automatic 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.269
 I'll be able to train in size 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.269
 more than 1,000 horses 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.350
 the camaro became even more popular thanks 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.420

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.910

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.350
 character that was a 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.780
 things have gotten much better from there to 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.760
 But nobody can forget that the leader 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.280

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.780
 movies is another optimus prime character 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.780
