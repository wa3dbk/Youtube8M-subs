00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.069
 good morning everyone welcome to the tutorial 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.830
 in which we will explain how to measure i 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.660
 processes and temperatures and 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.679
 features of our computer 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.440
 we are going to open this application 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.449
 which I downloaded from the users I will limit the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:27.359
 site the link of a site from which I have it 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:29.670
 unloaded and let's see we have the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.890
 our motherboard and with the various ones 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.920
 temperatures of every part of ours 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:41.040
 motherboard and our processor in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.840
 this case of the core 2 duo with the various ones 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.870
 temperatures of the two processors that in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.610
 right now they are oscillating between 67 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.570
 65 quite hot and then there are the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.059
 Voltages of our battery is 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.770
 anyway what interests me me 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.320
 not particularly interested in the card 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.180
 mother the processor 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.000
 so I can remove and put 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.939
 when I think anything I can 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.490
 close anything or 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.840
 add anything and to remove 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.509
 we all do almost perfect we have 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:30.960
 another application that is more specific 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:36.270
 on the processor and we have as before 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.930
 first screen the cpi that there 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:46.100
 the model says as I said before the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:53.220
 voltage and speed of the core 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:58.969
 megahertz we can see the cache la 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.969
 mainboard and other laptops 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:06.700
 other laptops that are open when there 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:11.110
 it seems there is also the characteristic of 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:16.510
 of the ddr2 ram of cona ddr3 in this 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:25.360
 ddr2 case and I'll show you where to 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:34.690
 where I downloaded the program if yes 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:36.850
 opens ok perfect 11 this one I have 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:45.190
 also written wrong just for ha 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:52.239
 married and in any case this one if me 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:55.269
 I'll put a link and that other gpu z and it's 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.830
 this one also always where I have it 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.209
 unloaded I get back however I hope 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.110
 to have been a help would be everything 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.340
 this video 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.340
 put me like it until next time
