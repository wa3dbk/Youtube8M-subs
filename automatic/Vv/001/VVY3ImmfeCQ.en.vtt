and<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.300> then<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.260> also<00:00:40.500> change<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and on and then you can also change the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.850 
and on and then you can also change the
depth<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.379> three

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
depth of it but here you have three

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.760 
depth of it but here you have three
options<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.579> zoom<00:00:45.059> pitch<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.079> roll

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
options you have zoom pitch and roll

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.950 
options you have zoom pitch and roll
unfortunately<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> can't<00:00:48.030> turn<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.420> off<00:00:48.539> Iran

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
uninstall it but here it is i've set it
up<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.640> background<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
up with this background here so it's a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.260 
up with this background here so it's a
little<00:01:04.080> bit<00:01:04.170> different<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.240> see

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
little bit different and as you can see

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.010 
little bit different and as you can see
my<00:01:07.020> background<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:08.030> moving<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.150> lot<00:01:09.390> now<00:01:09.659> i<00:01:09.689> can

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
my background is moving a lot now i can

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.460 
my background is moving a lot now i can
zoom<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:10.979> bit<00:01:11.159> more<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.470> my

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
zoom in a little bit more here and my

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
zoom in a little bit more here and my
background<00:01:13.799> will<00:01:14.250> move<00:01:14.520> even<00:01:14.850> more<00:01:15.330> it's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
background will move even more it's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.240 
background will move even more it's
really<00:01:16.020> cool<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.380> moves<00:01:16.590> around<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
really cool it moves around with the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.950 
really cool it moves around with the
accelerometer<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> feeling<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
accelerometer and I have a feeling that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.950 
accelerometer and I have a feeling that
this<00:01:19.380> looks<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.549> bit<00:01:20.850> better<00:01:21.090> than<00:01:21.420> 3d

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
this looks a little bit better than 3d

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.749 
this looks a little bit better than 3d
board<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.740> guys<00:01:22.890> could<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> judge<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
board but you guys could be the judge of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.120 
board but you guys could be the judge of
that<00:01:24.140> anyways<00:01:25.140> I'll<00:01:25.470> show<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> guys<00:01:25.860> the
