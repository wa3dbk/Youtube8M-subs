00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.770
 look I want to show you our weather 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.919
 our sky and when i show you on 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.919
 I ordered the city 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.660
 on the practical purpose of a space pebbles 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:50.379
 inhale again and so I came 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:58.280
 home opened its set and on the sides 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:01:01.610
 admire together this is a miracle this is a set 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.190
 called my little sunshine from marya 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.840
 mistress 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.350
 now you probably understand why 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.310
 I chose him exactly as I live on 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:19.069
 in the north we have the sun is very very 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.990
 rarely line winter is generally melancholy now 

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:23.960
 will begin autumn summer this year 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.830
 there was almost nothing like I said 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.380
 the sun pleased us but if you gather on 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.539
 maybe two and a half weeks for everything 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.380
 summer 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:40.490
 so as soon as I saw on the internet 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:45.310
 this design then I immediately decided it was 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:49.060
 what i need i hope this 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.860
 picture as soon as it will be embroidered me 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.049
 will take its place the main thing in my 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.680
 apartment to my room because 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.289
 but the sun as I repeat again 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.590
 saying we miss me even you 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:07.159
 look as much as I can curtains 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.850
 Yellow I tablecloth yellow 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.530
 I have everything but all that is possible bath 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.500
 it is generally half 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.359
 design in yellow colors because in fact 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.540
 without sun is very, very hard 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:28.120
 so let's watch what goes into this 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:35.060

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:38.750

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:49.280
 mono blue 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:59.430
 two needles for gloss 1 bead 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:03:05.970
 such as beads for 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.430
 corner and little buttons here they are in a fever of beads 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.360
 for the sun that is it turns out that 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:17.300
 here the sun is embroidered with beads 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.910
 I saw Larisa Milo May Life 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.450
 showed her process then showed 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.290
 his 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.300

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.480
 it was nice to hear her impression of 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.760
 work and she talked about hoping 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.550

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.430
 everything is also clear on her here is such a 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.040
