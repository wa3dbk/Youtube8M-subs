00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.490
 hello everyone my name is deixi and this 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.160
 time I will not share any 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.669
 recipe but I want to buy them the 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.680
 miracle that has happened and some know 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:36.070
 I have been on vacation I have 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.750
 passed very well in the mark with me but 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.600
 during that time my dog ​​got sick 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.989
 I was vomiting, vomiting, vomiting 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.640
 husband took him to the vet 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.100
 they said then 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.860
 they are going to give him medication 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.400
 medicines for vomiting for 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.270
 parasites and so on and so on 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.550
 day I returned and my dog ​​continued 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.070
 with the medications but I was still 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.090
 commenting he had not wanted to eat in 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.250
 all day 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.189
 and that night I had a very bad time I stayed 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:24.940
 next to my dog because he complained 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:28.300
 because his gut ached I was 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.110
 crying a lot because and in the eyes of 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.550
 my puppy 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.710
 as if he was not going to wake up anymore because 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.670
 it was pretty bad he is a very dog 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.930
 Well, look at these pictures, it's a 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.930
 dog that likes to play 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.410
 do not 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.270
 i 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.340
 i 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.150
 have seen is the best dog in the world 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.380
 I think that for those who have pets 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.460
 your animals are always the best 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:49.850
 and it turns out that we take him to the emergency room 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.470
 the vet and the doctor told us that 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.890
 we had to leave because we had to 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.890
 take x-rays 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.890
 but geography if he called us by 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.250
 phone to tell us that he had something 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.740
 that blocked his stomach and that there was 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.660
 to operate that night that was on Sunday 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.900
 and they left him there to put serum 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.540
 because the dog was very dehydrated 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.730
 and good 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.500
 night step the clinic and by the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.790
 early morning, they operated on him 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:31.240
 and the culture because I was very worried 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.210
 because when he opened my dog the 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.800
 intestine was about to burst 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.390
 I was already with a very strong infection 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.340
 with peritonitis 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.380
 and a few more hours and my dog would have 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.120
 dead 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.069
 and good 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:56.390
 It has been a very difficult week but the 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:59.020
 miracles always always always happen 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.090
 my dog ​​went very well from the operation 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.380
 but first I want to show you what it was 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.380
 that my dog ​​had swallowed 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.680
 i 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.080
 two 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.300
 i 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.760
 Well, notice that I had made a 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.820
 old socks ball said good 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.420
 this my dog ​​is not going to break it I do not know 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.550
 he's going to eat because he used to like it a lot 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.800
 play with stuffed animals and take out the stuffing 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.900
 he ate but of course me and then taba 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.570
 never had problems my dog ​​has two 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:11.000
 years and a half as you have seen in the 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.000
 previous videos and good 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.170
 because that had clogging the intestine 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.030
 you do not know how long because he had 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.790
 been vomiting with some frequency 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.420
 but we said good this dog eats 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.520
 everything like not chewing just like the 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.370
 Doctor to my dog looks like a vacuum cleaner 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.930
 he only swallows because he has a very mouth 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.650
 big 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:39.030

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:56.770
 extraordinary even the doctor is 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.169
 He surprised at how quickly my dog 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.740
 The day after the operation because it 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.580
