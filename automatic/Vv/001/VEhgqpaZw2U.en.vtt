are<00:01:08.880> Apes<00:01:09.150> even<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.890> we<00:01:10.890> don't<00:01:11.460> share<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> common

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
are Apes even if we don't share a common

are Apes even if we don't share a common
ancestry<00:01:12.720> with<00:01:12.900> them<00:01:13.110> let's<00:01:13.650> go<00:01:13.770> back<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
ancestry with them let's go back to the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550

18th century when Carl Linnaeus a
bible-believing<00:01:17.220> creationist<00:01:18.619> decided<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
bible-believing creationist decided that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.100 
bible-believing creationist decided that
he<00:01:19.830> wanted<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> categorize<00:01:20.939> God's<00:01:21.420> creations

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
he wanted to categorize God's creations

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.410 
he wanted to categorize God's creations
he<00:01:22.650> noticed<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.460> example<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.390> are

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
he noticed that for example there are

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.960 
he noticed that for example there are
many<00:01:25.110> different<00:01:25.530> kinds<00:01:25.740> yes<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.430> said<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.700> of

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
many different kinds yes I said it of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.990 
many different kinds yes I said it of
birds<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.140> many<00:01:28.619> kinds<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.130> mammals<00:01:29.670> many

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
kinds of fish and so on that we can

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
kinds of fish and so on that we can
identify<00:01:33.170> subcategories<00:01:34.170> within<00:01:34.380> these

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
identify subcategories within these

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.100 
identify subcategories within these
categories<00:01:35.579> there<00:01:36.180> are<00:01:36.270> many<00:01:36.509> kinds<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
categories there are many kinds of
