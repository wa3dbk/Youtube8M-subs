panasonic hdmi really high spec camera

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.300 
panasonic hdmi really high spec camera
it<00:02:11.090> actually<00:02:12.090> slows<00:02:12.239> down<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.840> compute

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
it actually slows down the compute

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.870 
it actually slows down the compute
so<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.819> am<00:02:14.030> looking<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.569> invest<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.440> new
