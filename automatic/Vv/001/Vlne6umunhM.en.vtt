going to have a little bit rougher
texture<00:01:57.500> than<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.860> would<00:01:58.040> with<00:01:58.280> white<00:01:59.180> flour

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
got a very fine flour now one other

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.050 
got a very fine flour now one other
thing<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.710> remember<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.369> tighter<00:02:07.790> you

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
thing to remember is the tighter you

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.259 
thing to remember is the tighter you
make<00:02:08.269> this<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.720> finer<00:02:08.959> pastry<00:02:09.999> type<00:02:10.999> flour

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.849 
make this the finer pastry type flour
that<00:02:11.359> you<00:02:11.420> make<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:11.840> harder<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.349> is<00:02:12.439> to<00:02:12.499> turn

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:12.859 
that you make the harder it is to turn

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.640 
that you make the harder it is to turn
and<00:02:13.329> handles<00:02:14.329> do<00:02:14.510> require<00:02:14.870> effort

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
and handles do require effort

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.309 
and handles do require effort
that's<00:02:15.799> still<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.879> superfine<00:02:17.569> pastry<00:02:18.140> flour

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
that's still on a superfine pastry flour

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.160 
that's still on a superfine pastry flour
you<00:02:19.190> can<00:02:19.250> still<00:02:19.610> turn<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.970> quite<00:02:20.180> easily<00:02:20.390> but

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
you can still turn it quite easily but

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.720 
you can still turn it quite easily but
it<00:02:21.290> does<00:02:21.470> require<00:02:21.680> effort<00:02:21.890> now<00:02:22.400> I'm<00:02:22.519> going<00:02:22.670> to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
it does require effort now I'm going to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.699 
it does require effort now I'm going to
show<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:22.879> how<00:02:23.060> quickly<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.480> can<00:02:23.659> change<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.680> a

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
show you how quickly you can change to a

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.460 
show you how quickly you can change to a
cracked<00:02:25.250> cereal<00:02:25.940> type<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.390> grain<00:02:26.599> simply
