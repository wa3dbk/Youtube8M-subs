00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.190
 hello and welcome to select 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.890
 Today we come to an ifa 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.510
 highlights namely the galaxy greed the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.470
 first smartphones from samsung 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.670
 electronics 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.130
 Of course we want these too 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
 Test thoroughly and before we go with the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.840
 unboxing will start again 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.699
 big thanks to punkt.de for short 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.660
 the provision of which the galaxy greed 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.579
 already available 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.290
 can you give it to us ? 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.420
 actually a meanwhile typical one 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.420
 samsung packaging so at least from 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.739
 pattern ago we have this again 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 wood look though that, of course, quite 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.850
 normal cardboard is very environmentally friendly 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.350
 but now a square one 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.480
 Packaging that was with the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.579
 smartphones and tablets slightly different 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.649
 samsung galaxy greed is the same here 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.390
 again on the page here otherwise 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.670
 still the usual seal and on the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.620
 back a few important technical 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.660
 data but we go in the course of this 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.739
 I'll take videos in even more detail 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.080
 here again my knife 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.240
 we cut through everything here 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.869
 With the seals it saves samsung yes 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.880
 not even at note 3 was this one 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.850
 region lock siegel is here of course 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.490
 not necessary we open the whole and 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.619
 the samsung galaxy comes to the fore 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.630
 gio is already here at the top 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.950
 it in different colors exactly to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.950
 be in six different colors 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.500
 namely in gray green orange white 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.329
 white gold and also in schwaz we have 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.670
 here, of course, the black model like 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.470
 you may already have seen 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.790
 that is the greed that we take 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.829
 Let's have a look 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.009
 later a little closer 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.119
 besides, we get here of course 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.579
 if I got out 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.009
 our actual power supply you can do that 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.360
 namely then here with this loading plate 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.909
 that's how I call it 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.530
 connect here greed comes in and 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.970
 can then be charged like that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.310
 I'll work you in exactly 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.320
 Of course, review still has that show 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.090
 on the ifa very interesting seen from 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.920
 that's the whole picture, I imagine 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.719
 that's a bit awkward if it's that 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.439
 really that will be the review then 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.790
 demonstrate 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.829
 otherwise we have here too 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.869
 paperwork in it you hardly believe it 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.680
 namely the obligatory quickstart 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.670
 guide warranty information etc 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.159
 me again very much 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.650
 environmentally friendly with soja active pressure 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.390
 That's what we know from samsung 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.340
 we all that what the scope of delivery 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.390
 headphones or something like that does not exist here 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.049
 We have no headphones 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.790
 connection 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.180
 we find much more in here 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.859
 not so that's the galaxy of 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.870
 samsung was there too 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.359
 Protective film on it, of course, went 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.430
 but to waste with so far 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.569
 We do not spend too much time with it 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.280
 I do not want that much about them either 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.260
 dimensions speak that makes mine 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.700
 opinion after a clock relatively little 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.739
 I'll blind you anyway 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.430
 more interesting here is the weight because 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.049
 the galaxy weighs 73 8 grams that is 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.540
 Not too much is not 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.400
 little I had on the ifa already 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.780
 Some of her colleagues and we had them 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.329
 We actually agreed that that would be 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.340
 whole relatively pleasant feels the band 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.739
 here is plastic is here yes 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.629
 something not grown in the middle 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.519
 grown there already so pleasant inside 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.200
 of course I mean that and that is 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.780
 really pretty cool that is 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.950
 Of course size adjustable I hope 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.030
 you can see that we have here 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.760
 different stages 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.379
 so that the whole thing is on each hand 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.750
 or arm size fits in that way 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.479
 really quite practical otherwise 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.560
 we have a 16 3 inch large display that 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:28.220
 you see here 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.449
 that dissolves with 320 x 320 pixels 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.840
 logically that is here again 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:35.090
 square which gives 278 pixels per 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.310
 inch without we have a great one here 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.750
 Amoled panel like we do in samsung 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.519
 We do not know either 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.959
 many keys we have here at the side 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.430
 just the power button 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.349
 The display will of course be made of glass 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.030
 Protected on the ifa man us too 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.590
 said that the whole thing will be very robust 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.629
 should not scratch 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.109
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.400
 Of course, that's very important to us 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.549
 use is that your aluminum and me 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.079
 I really want to say that now 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.299
 not attack samsung but that 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.739
 Things feel so valuable when 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.720
 the smartphones are just as high quality 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.939
 I would think then will feel 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.530
 No one complains well with the note 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.329
 3 that was better for her but me 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.280
 Guess you know very well what I mean 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.300
 otherwise we have here in james 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.540
 Bond also still a style 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.420
 1 9 megapixel camera no videos in 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.030
 We also have 720p here 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.760
 of course also bluetooth 4.0 and nfc 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.950
 four gigabytes of internal memory 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.360
 is also still there as well we have 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.910
 also a microphone and a 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.500
 speakers down here the shutter 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.240
 also exists as aluminum 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.500
 there is also a foil on it take 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.210
 I'm quick from the question 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.950
 Of course, how does it work? 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.920
 you just open that up to me 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.020
 here this clip opens and then opens 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.210
 the whole and you see down here 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.710
 already these contact points I show you 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.510
 the whole thing now very fast 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.970
 in the review we go again in detail 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.260
 on one hand, the so this year invite 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.520
 I'll just call it petzow 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.280
 this has this on the side of this 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.660
 lock you for taking to the 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.720
 contact points on contact point eclipse 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.790
 all to and then you have here 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.040
 down the micro-usb connector takes that 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.990
 charging cable puts this in the 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.640
 outlet with it and you can do that 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.330
 whole pads works so over 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.310
 micro usb 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.660
 but greed in itself has one 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.450
 micro-usb connection but the 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.190
 works only on this shell here 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.480
 Personally, I find something of a pity 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.700
 I already mentioned that to me 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.230
 awkward if you do this every night 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.720
 but it must be time 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.150
 show every day is important 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.680
 of course, the battery has 315th 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.660
 billions per hour - that sounds like now 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.430
 not much but for a clock 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.530
 should be enough in the first 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.390
 Test reports you have not 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.370
 too negative about the battery life 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.790
 I 'll say all this here now 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.460
 just right around my hand 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.600
 calm down and put on clothes and I think so 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.700
 I see, I do not have it now 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.470
 but I would be poor 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.150
 Just call it normal size 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.780
 and then the factory works fine 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.610
 quite well 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.560
 it is not too tight now is not 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.390
 too loose and if you can really do that 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.280
 size still set as I just 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.480
 already showed how it feels said 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.520
 quite pleasant to 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.800
 through the aluminum feels the whole 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.270
 of course also reasonably valuable 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.190
 I would say we turn the go 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.440
 I'll do it now, too 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.150
 to operate all again a few 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.010
 seconds the power button 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.660
 then you should have that logo here 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.940
 recognize and while the clock starts up 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.190
 As always, the rest of the data we have 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.280
 yes as cpu one 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.810
 800 megahertz single-core processor bin 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.370
 I no longer accustomed to such things 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.870
 but that should definitely be the case 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.720
 sufficient for a smart watch 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.760
 also 512 mb of memory like 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.670
 already she mentions a microphone and 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.160
 a speaker that is galaxy animals 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.630
 not as independent as I think so 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.410
 would have liked is actually rather a 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:46.300
 companion device and that is what we have here 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.850
 the compatibility already with the 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.270
 galaxy note 3 and with the galaxy note 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.430
 10.1 2010 edition so the 9th 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.680
 but it once the galaxy s for his 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.600
 Android 4.3 update is getting too 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.960
 this is compatible with the galaxy ghia 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.700
 his 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.860
 I'm pretty much into that 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.630
 curious yes dear people that was too 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.580
 again the unboxing of the samsung 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.140
 galaxy we would at this point 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.880
 me now or would me now
