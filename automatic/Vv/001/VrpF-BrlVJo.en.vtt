00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
packs and sell the rest online but don't

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.560 
packs and sell the rest online but don't
worry<00:01:13.170> i<00:01:13.470> will<00:01:13.979> tell<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> people<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.270> i<00:01:15.299> am

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
worry i will tell the people that i am

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.630 
worry i will tell the people that i am
selling<00:01:15.900> them<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.590> they<00:01:16.799> were<00:01:16.860> weighed

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
selling them to that they were weighed

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.090 
selling them to that they were weighed
so<00:01:18.270> people<00:01:18.720> don't<00:01:19.610> think<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.830> just<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
so people don't think that it is just a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
so people don't think that it is just a
normal<00:01:23.640> unweighted<00:01:24.150> pack<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> they

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
normal unweighted pack and they and they

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.380 
normal unweighted pack and they and they
know<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.189> probably<00:01:26.580> won't<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.180> getting

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
know that they probably won't be getting

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.060 
know that they probably won't be getting
an<00:01:27.479> ultra<00:01:27.720> rare<00:01:27.750> however<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.409> scale<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.890> not

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
an ultra rare however my scale is not

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.710 
an ultra rare however my scale is not
very<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.430> good<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> most

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
very what good it's not really the most

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.969
