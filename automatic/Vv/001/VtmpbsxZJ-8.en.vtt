from the community and you've been
brought<00:05:29.820> in<00:05:30.000> jumping<00:05:30.360> which<00:05:30.540> I<00:05:30.690> mean<00:05:30.900> which

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
brought in jumping which I mean which

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.630 
brought in jumping which I mean which
was<00:05:31.920> which<00:05:32.370> was<00:05:32.400> an<00:05:32.640> excitement<00:05:32.910> I<00:05:33.090> remember

was which was an excitement I remember
and<00:05:35.780> what<00:05:36.780> other<00:05:36.900> innovations<00:05:37.740> because<00:05:38.040> I

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
and what other innovations because I

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.040 
and what other innovations because I
mean<00:05:38.640> the<00:05:38.790> toys<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.240> everything<00:05:39.300> what<00:05:40.020> else

mean the toys and everything what else
can<00:05:40.410> we<00:05:40.530> look<00:05:40.560> forward<00:05:40.980> to<00:05:41.100> come<00:05:41.490> fall<00:05:41.700> 2013

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
can we look forward to come fall 2013

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.080 
can we look forward to come fall 2013
you<00:05:43.650> know<00:05:43.740> one<00:05:43.890> of<00:05:43.920> the<00:05:44.040> innovations<00:05:44.490> that<00:05:44.970> we

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
you know one of the innovations that we

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.540 
you know one of the innovations that we
showed<00:05:45.270> today<00:05:45.300> was<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.980> in<00:05:47.130> addition<00:05:47.370> to

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
showed today was that in addition to

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.670 
showed today was that in addition to
elemental<00:05:48.180> area<00:05:48.270> as<00:05:48.480> an<00:05:48.630> elemental<00:05:49.170> alignment

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
elemental area as an elemental alignment

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.830 
elemental area as an elemental alignment
that's<00:05:50.070> been<00:05:50.550> in<00:05:50.820> Skylanders<00:05:51.450> from<00:05:51.720> the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
that's been in Skylanders from the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.160 
that's been in Skylanders from the
beginning<00:05:51.960> we<00:05:52.890> have<00:05:53.160> now<00:05:53.970> swap<00:05:54.450> force<00:05:54.810> zones

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
beginning we have now swap force zones

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.220 
beginning we have now swap force zones
which<00:05:56.010> are<00:05:56.250> for<00:05:56.910> each<00:05:57.180> swap<00:05:57.540> force<00:05:57.780> character

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
which are for each swap force character

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.010 
which are for each swap force character
they<00:05:58.410> have<00:05:58.680> a<00:05:59.010> type<00:05:59.610> of<00:05:59.640> movement<00:06:00.030> that<00:06:00.690> opens

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
they have a type of movement that opens

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.930 
they have a type of movement that opens
up<00:06:01.140> a<00:06:01.290> totally<00:06:01.650> new<00:06:01.770> play<00:06:01.980> experience<00:06:02.520> and<00:06:02.760> so

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
up a totally new play experience and so

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.450 
up a totally new play experience and so
these<00:06:03.840> are<00:06:04.050> for<00:06:04.230> example<00:06:04.320> blast<00:06:04.890> zone<00:06:05.160> has

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
these are for example blast zone has

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.720 
these are for example blast zone has
rocket<00:06:06.450> legs<00:06:06.690> and<00:06:07.080> so<00:06:07.500> he<00:06:07.680> opens<00:06:08.010> up<00:06:08.100> a<00:06:08.250> rocket

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
rocket legs and so he opens up a rocket

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.880 
rocket legs and so he opens up a rocket
type<00:06:08.940> of<00:06:09.210> movement<00:06:09.450> wash<00:06:10.230> buckler<00:06:10.530> has

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
type of movement wash buckler has

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.580 
type of movement wash buckler has
suction<00:06:11.550> cup<00:06:11.820> tentacles<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:12.510> so<00:06:13.050> that<00:06:13.260> area

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
suction cup tentacles and so that area

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.230 
suction cup tentacles and so that area
allows<00:06:13.800> him<00:06:13.980> to<00:06:14.010> climb<00:06:14.340> so<00:06:14.790> he<00:06:14.910> gets<00:06:15.090> in<00:06:15.180> a

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
allows him to climb so he gets in a

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.820 
allows him to climb so he gets in a
climber<00:06:15.480> zone<00:06:15.720> so<00:06:15.930> he<00:06:15.960> goes<00:06:16.110> up<00:06:16.290> vertical<00:06:16.710> on

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
climber zone so he goes up vertical on

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.040 
climber zone so he goes up vertical on
walls<00:06:17.100> and<00:06:17.370> upside<00:06:17.640> down<00:06:17.910> and<00:06:18.270> that<00:06:18.780> kind<00:06:19.020> of

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
walls and upside down and that kind of

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.990 
walls and upside down and that kind of
thing<00:06:19.140> Magna<00:06:19.860> charge<00:06:20.100> is<00:06:20.280> really<00:06:20.520> fast<00:06:20.760> with<00:06:20.970> a

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
thing Magna charge is really fast with a

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.090 
thing Magna charge is really fast with a
speed<00:06:21.300> wheel<00:06:21.480> and<00:06:21.720> so<00:06:22.350> he<00:06:22.470> goes<00:06:22.620> into<00:06:22.800> speed

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
speed wheel and so he goes into speed

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.310 
speed wheel and so he goes into speed
zones<00:06:23.370> and<00:06:23.550> offers<00:06:23.940> are<00:06:24.090> sort<00:06:24.270> of<00:06:24.330> a<00:06:24.450> racing

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
zones and offers are sort of a racing

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.110 
zones and offers are sort of a racing
obstacle<00:06:25.770> experience<00:06:26.220> it's<00:06:26.340> really<00:06:26.580> fast<00:06:26.880> and

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
obstacle experience it's really fast and

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.450 
obstacle experience it's really fast and
you<00:06:27.390> know<00:06:27.480> really<00:06:27.510> speedy<00:06:28.220> so<00:06:29.220> we<00:06:29.340> have

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
you know really speedy so we have

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.450 
you know really speedy so we have
several<00:06:29.700> of<00:06:29.880> these<00:06:30.080> other<00:06:31.080> ones<00:06:31.350> stealth<00:06:32.100> zone

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
several of these other ones stealth zone

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.070 
several of these other ones stealth zone
where<00:06:32.850> you<00:06:33.360> go<00:06:33.510> out<00:06:33.690> and<00:06:33.870> sneak<00:06:34.230> and<00:06:34.500> you

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
where you go out and sneak and you

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.600 
where you go out and sneak and you
sneak<00:06:35.439> based<00:06:35.740> gameplay<00:06:37.500> there<00:06:38.610> teleport

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
sneak based gameplay there teleport

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.850 
sneak based gameplay there teleport
capabilities<00:06:40.360> and<00:06:40.659> so<00:06:41.110> there's<00:06:41.349> a<00:06:41.470> zone<00:06:41.830> that

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
capabilities and so there's a zone that

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.369 
capabilities and so there's a zone that
features<00:06:42.340> a<00:06:42.370> novel<00:06:43.060> teleporting<00:06:43.629> gameplay<00:06:43.960> so

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:44.379 
features a novel teleporting gameplay so

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:45.929 
features a novel teleporting gameplay so
each<00:06:44.560> of<00:06:44.680> these<00:06:44.710> swap<00:06:45.039> zones<00:06:45.400> and<00:06:45.699> they'll<00:06:45.819> be

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:45.939 
each of these swap zones and they'll be

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.820 
each of these swap zones and they'll be
aight<00:06:46.180> of<00:06:46.210> the<00:06:46.449> different<00:06:46.780> swap<00:06:47.020> zones<00:06:47.289> in

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
aight of the different swap zones in

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.920 
aight of the different swap zones in
