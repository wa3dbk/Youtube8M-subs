00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
being incorporated in parkour because

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.609 
being incorporated in parkour because
you<00:00:21.029> fall<00:00:21.270> over<00:00:21.300> doing<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.930> run<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.380> then<00:00:22.470> you

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you fall over doing a run and then you

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.320 
you fall over doing a run and then you
can<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.920> pop<00:00:23.130> back<00:00:23.340> up<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.699> look<00:00:23.820> much<00:00:24.060> cooler

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
can just pop back up it look much cooler

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.970 
can just pop back up it look much cooler
than<00:00:24.539> if<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:24.810> fall<00:00:25.140> over<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.650> kind<00:00:25.830> of

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
than if you just fall over and kind of

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.529 
than if you just fall over and kind of
struggle<00:00:26.880> getting<00:00:27.150> back<00:00:27.300> up

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
struggle getting back up

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.140 
struggle getting back up
so<00:00:28.109> when<00:00:28.830> getting<00:00:29.010> started<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> Kip<00:00:29.970> up

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
so when getting started with the Kip up

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.630 
so when getting started with the Kip up
it's<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.470> pretty<00:00:31.710> simple<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> hardest

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it's a it's pretty simple the hardest

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.130 
it's a it's pretty simple the hardest
part<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.940> getting<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.329> timing<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.989> so

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
part is getting the timing of it so

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.600 
part is getting the timing of it so
we'll<00:00:34.260> go<00:00:34.440> through<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.739> step<00:00:34.980> by<00:00:35.010> step<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.579> how

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
we'll go through it step by step on how

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.119 
we'll go through it step by step on how
you<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.180> right<00:00:36.360> pop<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> push<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.860> come

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
you get the right pop and push to come

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.190 
you get the right pop and push to come
