get good game plays on it i mean i find
it<00:02:52.080> really<00:02:52.110> hard<00:02:52.410> because<00:02:52.530> i'm<00:02:52.680> running

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
it really hard because i'm running

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.289 
it really hard because i'm running
around<00:02:53.220> trying<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.549> flank<00:02:53.790> people<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.239> you

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
around trying to flank people and you

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.880 
around trying to flank people and you
can't<00:02:54.510> really<00:02:54.660> flank<00:02:55.080> with<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.440> map<00:02:55.620> yeah

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
can't really flank with this map yeah

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.470 
can't really flank with this map yeah
there's<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.250> many<00:02:56.340> routes<00:02:56.700> but<00:02:57.269> then<00:02:57.360> those

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
there's so many routes but then those

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.850 
there's so many routes but then those
people<00:02:57.540> take<00:02:57.930> different<00:02:58.110> routes<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.530> go<00:02:58.680> like

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
people take different routes and go like

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.220 
people take different routes and go like
elsewhere<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.610> hard<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.880> find<00:03:00.150> them<00:03:00.390> but

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
elsewhere so it's hard to find them but

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.470 
elsewhere so it's hard to find them but
