00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello youtube I have returned with a new video that authorities near how 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.110
 emulate a command after 360 without any problem in our games using 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.919
 the cim putu b3 0 with any type demanded this I did it since always 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.560
 I put soto when playing a game with the fucking keyboards taking command of ps2 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 They swell the eggs good but thanks to that I found this month 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
 great program for those with generic ps2 command that originate 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.839
 it will also serve you good 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.839
 do not start 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.500
 The first thing we are going to do is copy this link and paste it into our 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.510
 browser the link will be left in the description of the video 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.200
 fucking mother I was wrong to hit the hundredth book we go again 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.620
 Now it's good, we wait for the 25 seconds the video asks us to 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.620
 file was uploaded by me 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.750
 we give it in normal download 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.250
 we do not need this anymore so we close it 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.070
 this too 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.050
 now we look for the route where our file is saved in my case I saved it in 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.270
 downloads 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.270
 we move the file to the desktop 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:16.589
 we double-click it and open it will appear inside a folder called 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.669
 without putin we extract it by moving it towards the desk 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:31.049
 this is our coach we open it we will appear this folder and we open it 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.899
 now we see these seven files 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.479
 we eliminate it 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.040
 now we select all the files we copy them and then if we go to 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.209
 the route where we have installed in our game and bring them 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.279
 and seen there are now we open intopress 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.259
 this is our gesticulator that provides the program to verify 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:41.549
 if our control and the buttons that are used are used correctly 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.109
 at your command so you do not have problems 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.629
 now we move our analogue left and see how it moves 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.299
 now we move the right to all directions and as you can see there is a problem 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.139
 it does not move as it should be look at the left analogue if it moves as it should 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.009
 be but do not worry for that I bring you the solution we close the weight we 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.979
 let's sketch it is 160 cm a kilo open we will appear a notepad 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.979
 with codes 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:22.550
 now we see where the analogous oit xirah tared says and we modified it and 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.639
 Do not make an original copy of how you are doing. 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.759
 rooted what we wanted to be the s1 and we placed a 6 and enric analog what 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.759
 I love a 3 serrano if we give in saving changes 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.370
 we enter again my imputa is 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.439
 we move the left analogue and if it serves now the right analog and also already 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.759
 it does not work we press the saucers and they do not work and now the buttons and also 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.629
 it serves us and our analogous problem is solved which is the most 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.039
 usual on the buttons will not have any inconvenience they just came to show 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.039
 this problem that has already been solved we closed this 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.480
 good friends this was all in my tutorial I hope you liked it
