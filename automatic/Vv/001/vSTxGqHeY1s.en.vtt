team<00:02:31.960> at<00:02:32.960> least<00:02:33.200> on<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.410> paper<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:34.610> have<00:02:34.790> a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
team at least on the paper we have a

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.400 
team at least on the paper we have a
great<00:02:35.090> coach<00:02:35.420> who<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.900> player<00:02:36.110> who

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
great coach who is the player who

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.370

understands<00:02:37.040> players<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.240> computer<00:02:39.140> on<00:02:39.290> the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
understands players and computer on the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.310 
understands players and computer on the
high<00:02:39.530> high<00:02:39.830> level<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.630> as<00:02:41.630> long<00:02:41.870> as<00:02:42.050> we<00:02:42.200> all

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
high high level and as long as we all

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.020 
high high level and as long as we all
get<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.650> chemistry<00:02:43.130> in<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.460> training<00:02:43.700> camp

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
get the chemistry in the training camp

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.360 
get the chemistry in the training camp
and<00:02:44.240> later<00:02:44.450> on<00:02:44.860> it's<00:02:45.860> not<00:02:45.980> going<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.280> be

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
and later on it's not going to be

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.000 
and later on it's not going to be
perfect<00:02:46.580> but<00:02:47.120> i<00:02:47.510> think<00:02:48.020> if<00:02:48.440> we<00:02:48.500> stick<00:02:48.860> together

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
perfect but i think if we stick together

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.330 
perfect but i think if we stick together
and<00:02:49.520> if<00:02:49.700> we<00:02:49.910> play<00:02:50.090> as<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.239> team<00:02:51.010> we<00:02:52.010> should<00:02:52.190> be

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and if we play as a team we should be

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.230 
and if we play as a team we should be
able<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.790> make<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.360> lot<00:02:53.600> of<00:02:53.660> people<00:02:53.959> happy
