according<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> video<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.079> put<00:00:52.350> up

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
according to the video that you put up

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.549 
according to the video that you put up
but<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.730> does<00:00:53.969> kind<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.420> leave<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.050> actual

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
but it does kind of leave the actual

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.979 
but it does kind of leave the actual
thought<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.010> GTA<00:00:56.789> 5<00:00:57.090> zombies<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.840> there's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
thought of GTA 5 zombies and there's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.560 
thought of GTA 5 zombies and there's
also<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.559> little<00:00:59.219> bit<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.550> script<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.149> was

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
also a little bit of the script that was

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.349 
also a little bit of the script that was
on<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> forums<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:02.340> actually<00:01:02.520> says<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.210> can

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.080 
where you had limited amount of ammo you
had<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.260> scavenge<00:01:57.800> for<00:01:57.980> everything<00:01:58.490> vehicles

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
had to scavenge for everything vehicles

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.570 
had to scavenge for everything vehicles
maybe<00:01:59.360> don't<00:01:59.660> work<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.620> only<00:02:00.920> like<00:02:01.160> a<00:02:01.190> few<00:02:01.520> of

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
maybe don't work you only like a few of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.250 
maybe don't work you only like a few of
them<00:02:01.790> work<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.030> have<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.420> find<00:02:02.750> like<00:02:02.930> certain

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
them work you have to find like certain

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.370 
them work you have to find like certain
cars<00:02:03.760> and<00:02:04.760> I<00:02:05.150> felt<00:02:05.420> like<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.840> would<00:02:06.050> be<00:02:06.230> the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
cars and I felt like that would be the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.340 
cars and I felt like that would be the
best<00:02:06.620> type<00:02:07.010> of<00:02:07.040> zombies<00:02:07.760> now<00:02:08.000> also<00:02:08.270> just<00:02:09.170> like

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
best type of zombies now also just like

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.750 
best type of zombies now also just like
on<00:02:09.500> his<00:02:09.710> video<00:02:10.010> where<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.160> can<00:02:10.369> see<00:02:10.580> like

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
on his video where you can see like

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.240 
on his video where you can see like
there's<00:02:10.910> some<00:02:11.150> sort<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.570> secret<00:02:11.900> menu<00:02:12.440> it's

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
there's some sort of a secret menu it's

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.920 
there's some sort of a secret menu it's
really<00:02:13.580> cool<00:02:13.880> because<00:02:13.940> it's<00:02:14.330> not<00:02:14.540> like<00:02:14.750> you're

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
really cool because it's not like you're

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.720 
really cool because it's not like you're
forced<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.530> play<00:02:15.650> zombies<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:16.520> there's

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
forced to play zombies like there's

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.730 
forced to play zombies like there's
going<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.000> be<00:02:17.030> at<00:02:17.600> least<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:18.290> would<00:02:18.440> be<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.560> good

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
going to be at least it would be a good

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.590 
going to be at least it would be a good
idea<00:02:18.860> what<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.460> seems<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:19.820> on<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.360> menu

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
idea what it seems like on that menu

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.260 
idea what it seems like on that menu
based<00:02:21.020> off<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.500> menu<00:02:21.890> there<00:02:22.580> would<00:02:22.910> be<00:02:22.940> a

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
based off of the menu there would be a

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.690 
based off of the menu there would be a
regular<00:02:23.600> just<00:02:24.200> like<00:02:24.350> GTA<00:02:24.740> online<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.370> there

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
regular just like GTA online is there

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.400 
regular just like GTA online is there
would<00:02:25.850> also<00:02:26.000> be<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.330> menu<00:02:26.840> where<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.050> can<00:02:27.140> go

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
would also be a menu where you can go

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.410 
would also be a menu where you can go
and<00:02:27.440> do<00:02:27.740> like<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.250> zombies<00:02:28.640> type<00:02:28.880> which<00:02:29.120> I

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
and do like the zombies type which I

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.990 
and do like the zombies type which I
think<00:02:29.990> would<00:02:30.080> be<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> brilliant<00:02:30.620> idea<00:02:30.980> if<00:02:31.640> they

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
think would be a brilliant idea if they

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.090 
think would be a brilliant idea if they
did<00:02:32.209> do<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.420> this<00:02:32.660> way<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.230> know<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:33.620> just<00:02:33.650> um

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
did do it this way you know so just um

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.920 
did do it this way you know so just um
and<00:02:34.340> also<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> background<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.420> just<00:02:35.720> got<00:02:35.900> a

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
and also in the background I just got a

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.510 
and also in the background I just got a
little<00:02:36.050> bit<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.440> zombie<00:02:36.650> gameplay<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.220> got

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
little bit of a zombie gameplay I got

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.930 
little bit of a zombie gameplay I got
and<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:39.530> thought<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.130> was<00:02:40.310> really<00:02:40.670> cool<00:02:40.880> to

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
and I thought this was really cool to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.130 
and I thought this was really cool to
have<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.420> playing<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.930> background

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
have that playing in the background

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.780 
have that playing in the background
considering<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:42.980> one<00:02:43.160> we're<00:02:43.430> talking<00:02:43.700> about

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
considering that one we're talking about

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.780 
considering that one we're talking about
zombies<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.800> whole<00:02:46.010> like<00:02:46.280> thing<00:02:46.489> I

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.280 
zombies and to this whole like thing I
got<00:02:46.970> going<00:02:47.000> on<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.630> back<00:02:47.780> was<00:02:47.989> pretty
