went that route
um<00:00:14.720> that<00:00:15.050> ain't<00:00:15.260> very<00:00:15.320> pretty<00:00:15.699> but<00:00:16.699> I<00:00:16.759> can<00:00:17.390> see

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
um that ain't very pretty but I can see

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.970 
um that ain't very pretty but I can see
it's<00:00:19.329> pretty<00:00:20.329> much<00:00:20.449> six<00:00:20.779> of<00:00:20.929> my<00:00:21.050> old<00:00:21.230> trunk

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
it's pretty much six of my old trunk

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.130 
it's pretty much six of my old trunk
it's<00:00:22.400> 212<00:00:22.909> on<00:00:23.390> 1500<00:00:24.320> watts<00:00:25.929> actually<00:00:26.929> what<00:00:27.079> it

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
it's 212 on 1500 watts actually what it

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.019 
it's 212 on 1500 watts actually what it
does<00:00:27.289> I<00:00:27.529> haven't<00:00:28.009> done<00:00:28.339> a<00:00:28.400> video<00:00:28.579> in<00:00:28.759> a<00:00:28.880> while

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
does I haven't done a video in a while

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.529 
does I haven't done a video in a while
to<00:00:29.300> actually<00:00:31.119> show<00:00:32.119> what<00:00:32.329> kind<00:00:32.449> of

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
to actually show what kind of

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.029 
to actually show what kind of
performance<00:00:32.989> I<00:00:33.109> got<00:00:33.140> out<00:00:33.320> of<00:00:33.440> it<00:00:33.590> it's<00:00:33.920> only

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
performance I got out of it it's only

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.549 
performance I got out of it it's only
been<00:00:34.219> here<00:00:34.309> for<00:00:34.489> a<00:00:34.520> couple<00:00:34.670> days<00:00:34.789> but<00:00:35.559> anyway

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
been here for a couple days but anyway

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.810 
been here for a couple days but anyway
from<00:00:36.739> here<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.010> is<00:00:37.570> you<00:00:38.570> said<00:00:38.840> to<00:00:39.350> 12s<00:00:39.829> on<00:00:39.980> 1500

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
from here it is you said to 12s on 1500

00:00:40.820 --> 00:02:50.620 
from here it is you said to 12s on 1500
watts

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.840 

you<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.780> see<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.410> crazy<00:02:52.709> efficient<00:02:53.220> I'll

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
you can see it's crazy efficient I'll

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.960 
you can see it's crazy efficient I'll
actually<00:02:54.030> run<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.600> uh<00:02:55.400> my<00:02:56.400> faz

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
actually run that uh my faz

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.750 
actually run that uh my faz
1500<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.810> half<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.170> um<00:02:58.290> they're<00:02:58.470> uh<00:02:58.549> dual<00:02:59.549> 2-ohm

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
1500 a half and um they're uh dual 2-ohm

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.800 
1500 a half and um they're uh dual 2-ohm
12<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.500> course<00:03:01.739> running<00:03:02.250> parallel<00:03:02.810> showing

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
12 so of course running parallel showing

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.240 
12 so of course running parallel showing
that<00:03:03.959> amp<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.290> half<00:03:04.470> um<00:03:04.650> actually<00:03:04.860> it's<00:03:05.130> like

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
that amp a half um actually it's like

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.190 
that amp a half um actually it's like
0.6<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:06.060> think<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.420> what<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.690> amps<00:03:06.870> actually

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
0.6 I think is what the amps actually

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.250 
0.6 I think is what the amps actually
seen<00:03:07.410> but<00:03:07.650> still<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.700> don't<00:03:09.060> have<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.359> throttle

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
seen but still I don't have to throttle

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.580 
seen but still I don't have to throttle
it<00:03:10.500> up<00:03:10.650> I'll<00:03:10.890> have<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.160> increase<00:03:11.579> my<00:03:11.640> rpms<00:03:12.590> with

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
it up I'll have to increase my rpms with

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.930 
it up I'll have to increase my rpms with
the<00:03:13.709> mech<00:03:13.890> man<00:03:14.100> hundred<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.579> seventy<00:03:14.910> eight

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
the mech man hundred and seventy eight

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.250 
the mech man hundred and seventy eight
ball<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.500> excess<00:03:17.450> $5,100<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.720> front<00:03:18.989> and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
ball and excess $5,100 in the front and

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.340 
ball and excess $5,100 in the front and
an<00:03:19.769> excess<00:03:20.269> XP<00:03:21.269> mm<00:03:22.230> in<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.620> back<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:25.140> barely

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
an excess XP mm in the back it barely

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.860 
an excess XP mm in the back it barely
drops<00:03:25.709> I<00:03:26.100> mean<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.850> saw<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.450> wasn't<00:03:27.630> even

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
drops I mean you saw that it wasn't even

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.199 
drops I mean you saw that it wasn't even
a<00:03:27.930> full<00:03:28.109> volt<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.650> dropped<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.970> me

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
a full volt that it dropped so to me

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.640 
a full volt that it dropped so to me
that's<00:03:30.359> pretty<00:03:30.570> good<00:03:30.780> without<00:03:30.930> having<00:03:31.560> to

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
that's pretty good without having to

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.699 
that's pretty good without having to
throttle<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.040> up<00:03:32.190> or<00:03:32.340> anything<00:03:32.519> like<00:03:32.760> that

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
throttle it up or anything like that

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.110 
throttle it up or anything like that
