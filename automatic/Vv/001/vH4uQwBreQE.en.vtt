00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.010
 but to his law-abiding citizens 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.590
 queue need to remember exactly when 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.510
 them the same water meter appeared in 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.940
 that from time to time all similar 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.650
 devices need to be checked for sure 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.480
 know consider not exactly I took a resident 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.480
 the meter turned out was a prescription 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.359
 change the counter or believe everything 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.310
 Alexander has not made a reservation 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.859
 it is such a term though it will still be 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.100
 check whether the device is lying, the time has come 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.750
 verification is regular and extraordinary 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.420
 regular calibration or so -called 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.690
 planned it is produced for all 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.450
 water meters for hot water meter 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.340
 4 years after their factory calibration 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.469
 for cold water meters after 6 years 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.570
 after their factory calibration, that is, when 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.820
 making and then like knights on 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.469
 a crossroads that time or money is more expensive 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.289
 pay less means carry 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.579
 water meter to the metrological service 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.379
 it is natural to dismantle it 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.390
 the master so that the apartment does not remain without 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.860
 because the water can check the device 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.860
 several days turn 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.789
 and which way can be wrong 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.560
 counter counter may be wrong in favor 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.840
 consumer benefit provider 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.100
 but we are his marriage oem if he 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.619
 exceeds the allowed value 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.390
 errors are usually counters 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.399
 wrong all the same not in favor 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.439
 consumers here are visible numbers someone's 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.479
 home appliance as it passed through 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:37.270
 yourself more water than benchmark 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:39.460
 money pipe can be calibrated 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.530
 counters right at home the staff will come 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.569
 with special equipment in general how to understand 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.520
 Do you need verification or not in Moscow 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.009
 water meters were massively installed in 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.409
 2008 is now just four years passed 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.399
 those who bought themselves need to look in 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.189
 Passport products 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.569
 although who keeps them in this case 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.000
 build on the act of entering into 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.479
 operation if it is not necessary 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.429
 contact the settlement center where this 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.259
 information they can provide 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.190
 turn on hot and cold water 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.140
 appear there blocked the simplest 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.239
 way to put new water meters 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.959
 the mistress of the apartment and entered the 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.920
 do not waste time on leading 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.489
 counter 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.010
 wait for him to believe me very much 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.780
 it was convenient we took the average Moscow 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.920
 prices dismantle the meter what is it 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.440
 about 200 rubles 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.930
 checking about 500 set back 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.120
 200 rubles again the device can not just 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.639
 fasten you need to issue an entry certificate 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.889
 operation of another 500 and about 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.019
 one and a half thousand rubles roughly 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.030
 there is a new water meter in the store 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.639
 and the most offensive if the money for all this 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.819
 spent appliance recognize unfit 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.000
 somewhere in 20 percent of the total mass 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.340
 are resting 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.500
 by the way if you look at the testimony of this 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.209
 water meter almost did not work for four 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.329
 of the year just thirty-five cubes came running 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.850
 hot water is very little usually 150 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.040
 200 and still the owner is obliged to hold 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.019
 verification or public utilities will remove this 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.359
 metering device in such a case it will 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.040
 pay according to the norm he 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.440
 sets for example some volume 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.269
 consumption per day no matter consumed 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.250
 the person has not consumed this volume he will 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.169
 pay exactly for this standard if you 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.639
 put new water meters utility 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.799
 the company is obliged to give you everything 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.370
 documents on what finished existence 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.470
 old device where does it start 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.750
 new if not only zeros on it 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.190
 Normal red numbers error 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.700
 After all, the meter was tested at the factory 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.700
 we pay only for black and even if 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.129
 water meters no fill there are cracks like 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.299
 here or in some other way 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.640
 mechanically damaged to bear 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.980
 it is not necessary to throw it away 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.049
 suitable for work it is still not 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.879
