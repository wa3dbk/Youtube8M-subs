is a concept bike even a builder on my
server<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.370> together<00:00:11.880> with<00:00:12.120> myself<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
server and together with myself and

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.589 
server and together with myself and
Veneman<00:00:13.380> we<00:00:13.830> built<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.340> contraption<00:00:14.790> so

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
Veneman we built this contraption so

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.540 
Veneman we built this contraption so
here<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.870> one<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.080> key<00:00:16.320> vans<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:16.859> houses<00:00:17.340> is

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
here is one of key vans one houses is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.910 
here is one of key vans one houses is
very<00:00:17.970> pretty<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:18.810> see<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.230> if<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:19.770> go

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
very pretty as you can see and if we go

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980 
very pretty as you can see and if we go
inside<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.580> will<00:00:20.760> find<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:21.270> looks<00:00:21.539> like<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
inside we will find what looks like a

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.200 
inside we will find what looks like a
normal<00:00:22.380> sink<00:00:22.650> using<00:00:22.890> cauldrons<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.730> represent

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
normal sink using cauldrons to represent

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.390 
normal sink using cauldrons to represent
the<00:00:24.300> sinks<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.689> leave<00:00:25.350> us<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.590> represent<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the sinks and leave us to represent the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.330 
the sinks and leave us to represent the
taps<00:00:26.699> however<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.080> no<00:00:28.289> ordinary<00:00:28.590> sink<00:00:29.189> if

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
taps however this is no ordinary sink if

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.429 
taps however this is no ordinary sink if
we<00:00:29.820> hop<00:00:30.000> inside<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.570> cauldron<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.109> hit<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
we hop inside the cauldron and hit the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.770 
we hop inside the cauldron and hit the
levers<00:00:31.800> twice<00:00:32.099> then<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.030> will<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.329> shifted

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
levers twice then we will be shifted

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.860 
levers twice then we will be shifted
through<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.140> floor<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.620> into<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.430> secret<00:00:36.000> area

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.660 

so<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> contraption<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.430> see

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
so here is the contraption you can see

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.639 
so here is the contraption you can see
it<00:00:41.910> doesn't<00:00:42.120> take<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.780> lot<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> space<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.559> is

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it doesn't take up a lot of space it is

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.920 
it doesn't take up a lot of space it is
only<00:00:43.829> seven<00:00:44.250> blocks<00:00:44.399> wide<00:00:44.730> four<00:00:45.390> blocks<00:00:45.629> tall

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
only seven blocks wide four blocks tall

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
only seven blocks wide four blocks tall
and<00:00:46.170> two<00:00:46.559> blocks<00:00:46.860> deep<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:47.640> makes<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> ideal

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and two blocks deep which makes it ideal

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
and two blocks deep which makes it ideal
for<00:00:48.329> building<00:00:48.809> inside<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> small<00:00:49.680> modern<00:00:49.860> house

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
for building inside a small modern house

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.220 
for building inside a small modern house
like<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.760> over<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.270> now<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.989> works

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
like this one over here now this works

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
like this one over here now this works
by<00:00:52.469> using<00:00:52.500> shifting<00:00:53.399> floors<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.940> Pistons<00:00:54.360> are

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
by using shifting floors the Pistons are

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.150 
by using shifting floors the Pistons are
going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> push<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> blocks<00:00:55.260> across<00:00:55.949> that

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
going to push the blocks across that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
going to push the blocks across that
side<00:00:56.550> then<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> Pistons<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.840> side<00:00:58.079> will

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
side then the Pistons on this side will

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
side then the Pistons on this side will
push<00:00:58.440> them<00:00:58.649> back<00:00:58.770> across<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.309> when<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
push them back across and when the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
push them back across and when the
player<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.539> standing<00:01:00.719> inside<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.199> cauldron

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
player is standing inside the cauldron

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.139 
player is standing inside the cauldron
that<00:01:01.859> means<00:01:02.340> they're<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> fall<00:01:02.879> through

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
that means they're going to fall through

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.640 
that means they're going to fall through
the<00:01:03.270> cauldron<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> half<00:01:04.140> slab<00:01:04.409> down

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the cauldron and the half slab down

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.740 
the cauldron and the half slab down
below<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.519> because<00:01:05.820> we're<00:01:05.970> using<00:01:06.119> half<00:01:06.390> slabs

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
below now because we're using half slabs

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
below now because we're using half slabs
and<00:01:06.930> cauldrons<00:01:07.439> neither<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.920> these<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.340> full

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
and cauldrons neither of these are full

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.700 
and cauldrons neither of these are full
blocks<00:01:08.939> which<00:01:09.210> means<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.990> player<00:01:10.229> won't<00:01:10.470> take

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
blocks which means the player won't take

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
blocks which means the player won't take
any<00:01:10.890> damage<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.549> fall<00:01:11.790> through<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.689> you

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
any damage when they fall through so you

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.330 
any damage when they fall through so you
can<00:01:12.930> stand<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.439> either<00:01:13.650> cauldron<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.130> won't

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
can stand in either cauldron you won't

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.980 
can stand in either cauldron you won't
take<00:01:14.520> damage<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> can<00:01:15.270> also<00:01:15.450> activate

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
take damage and you can also activate

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.770 
take damage and you can also activate
this<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.830> evil<00:01:17.159> even<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.759> well<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> let's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
this with evil even as well so let's

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
this with evil even as well so let's
take<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> look<00:01:22.320> at<00:01:22.439> how<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> Redstone<00:01:23.310> works

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
take a look at how the Redstone works

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.280 
take a look at how the Redstone works
this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> fairly<00:01:24.240> simple<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.720> understand

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
this is fairly simple to understand

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.570 
this is fairly simple to understand
although<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> couple<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.490> things

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
although there are a couple of things

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.190 
although there are a couple of things
going<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.180> may<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.450> understand<00:01:27.869> straight

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
going on you may not understand straight

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440 
going on you may not understand straight
away<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.130> piston<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.939> appears<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
away so this piston here it appears to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
away so this piston here it appears to
be<00:01:30.600> doing<00:01:30.840> nothing<00:01:31.229> however<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.159> two

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
be doing nothing however we have two

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.789 
be doing nothing however we have two
inputs<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.780> machine<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.650> use

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
inputs for this machine so if we use

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.380 
inputs for this machine so if we use
this<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.549> directly<00:01:35.670> power<00:01:36.240> this

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
this one here we directly power this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.660 
this one here we directly power this
piston<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> fine<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.340> use<00:01:38.490> this

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
piston which is fine and if we use this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.160 
piston which is fine and if we use this
one<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> side<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> we're<00:01:39.780> only<00:01:39.930> going

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
one to the side of it we're only going

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.710 
one to the side of it we're only going
to<00:01:40.259> bud<00:01:40.560> power<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.009> piston<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.329> directly

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
to bud power this piston so we directly

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.990 
to bud power this piston so we directly
power<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.220> extends<00:01:44.850> which

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
power this one and then it extends which

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.730 
power this one and then it extends which
provides<00:01:45.420> an<00:01:45.659> update<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.619> this

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
provides an update to the one on this

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.010 
provides an update to the one on this
side<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.549> piston<00:01:47.970> means<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.810> can

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
side so this piston means that you can

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.170 
side so this piston means that you can
use<00:01:49.200> either<00:01:49.470> input<00:01:50.009> now<00:01:50.490> when<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.759> power<00:01:50.970> this

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
use either input now when we power this

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.270 
use either input now when we power this
one<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:52.200> unn<00:01:52.530> power<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.979> you're<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
one and I unn power it you're going to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
one and I unn power it you're going to
see<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> block<00:01:53.790> goes<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.990> gets

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
see the block goes up and then it gets

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.679 
see the block goes up and then it gets
pushed<00:01:55.439> back<00:01:55.560> down<00:01:55.890> again<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.270> when<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.630> gets

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
pushed back down again so when it gets

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.539 
pushed back down again so when it gets
pulled<00:01:58.020> up<00:01:58.140> its<00:01:58.409> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> create<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> one<00:01:59.340> tick

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
pulled up its going to create a one tick

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.340 
pulled up its going to create a one tick
pulse<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.000> goes<00:02:00.060> off<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.570> side<00:02:00.899> here<00:02:00.930> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
pulse that goes off to the side here and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350 
pulse that goes off to the side here and
it's<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.100> tick<00:02:02.280> pulse<00:02:02.549> because<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.119> thing

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it's a one tick pulse because this thing

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.940 
it's a one tick pulse because this thing
gets<00:02:03.570> powered<00:02:03.899> again<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.439> see<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
gets powered again you can see here the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.350 
gets powered again you can see here the
redstone<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.820> power<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.119> block

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
redstone is going to power this block

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.419 
redstone is going to power this block
which<00:02:06.570> powers<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> piston<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.530> because<00:02:08.280> it's

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
which powers the piston and because it's

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.010 
which powers the piston and because it's
just<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.819> one<00:02:09.000> tick<00:02:09.209> pulse<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.690> will<00:02:09.750> then

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
just the one tick pulse it will then

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.350 
just the one tick pulse it will then
push<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.470> redstone<00:02:10.890> block<00:02:11.129> back<00:02:11.819> down<00:02:12.090> again

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
push the redstone block back down again

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.730 
push the redstone block back down again
so<00:02:12.390> let's<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.959> one<00:02:13.080> more<00:02:13.200> time

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
so let's see that one more time

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.380 
so let's see that one more time
it's<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.550> get<00:02:14.640> pulled<00:02:14.820> up<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.240> then

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
it's going to get pulled up and then

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.820 
it's going to get pulled up and then
that<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.720> tick<00:02:15.900> pulse<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.320> going<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.560> push<00:02:16.710> it

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
that one tick pulse is going to push it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.830 
that one tick pulse is going to push it
back<00:02:16.980> down<00:02:17.250> again<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.660> tick

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
back down again and so that one tick

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.690 
back down again and so that one tick
pulse<00:02:19.080> also<00:02:19.380> goes<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.100> Pistons<00:02:20.520> here

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
pulse also goes to the Pistons here

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.520 
pulse also goes to the Pistons here
which<00:02:20.850> pushes<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.270> blocks<00:02:21.630> across<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.260> front

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
which pushes the blocks across the front

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.070 
which pushes the blocks across the front
and<00:02:22.740> then<00:02:23.700> on<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> slight<00:02:24.270> delay<00:02:24.480> from<00:02:24.900> this

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
and then on a slight delay from this

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.900 
and then on a slight delay from this
repeater<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:26.010> pass<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.430> ones<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
repeater and then pass the ones on the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.550 
repeater and then pass the ones on the
other<00:02:27.060> side<00:02:27.330> which<00:02:27.900> push<00:02:28.140> them<00:02:28.350> back<00:02:28.500> across

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
other side which push them back across

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.810 
other side which push them back across
so<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.620> build<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.310> are<00:02:32.400> going<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.610> need<00:02:32.760> a

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
so to build this you are going to need a

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.790 
so to build this you are going to need a
few<00:02:33.150> conditions<00:02:33.360> for<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.020> location<00:02:34.590> where

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
few conditions for the location where

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.620 
few conditions for the location where
you<00:02:34.980> build<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.370> now<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.820> floor<00:02:36.210> is<00:02:36.240> going<00:02:36.570> to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
you build it now the floor is going to

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.630 
you build it now the floor is going to
need<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.990> be<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.260> same<00:02:37.500> material<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.340> these

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
need to be the same material so these

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.220 
need to be the same material so these
need<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.910> be<00:02:39.030> half<00:02:39.360> slabs<00:02:39.660> which<00:02:39.870> kind<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
need to be half slabs which kind of

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.020 
need to be half slabs which kind of
limits<00:02:40.500> your<00:02:40.620> options<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.730> reason<00:02:42.000> for

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
limits your options and the reason for

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.850 
limits your options and the reason for
this<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.360> because<00:02:43.020> when<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.380> have<00:02:43.410> your<00:02:43.530> cold

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
this is because when you have your cold

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.830 
this is because when you have your cold
runs<00:02:44.040> here<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.610> see<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.030> block<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.780> is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
runs here you can see the block that is

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.350 
runs here you can see the block that is
underneath<00:02:46.410> them<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.860> if<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.430> had<00:02:47.730> say<00:02:48.150> a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
underneath them so if you had say a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.880 
underneath them so if you had say a
different<00:02:48.570> material<00:02:49.170> out<00:02:49.260> here<00:02:49.470> which<00:02:49.620> didn't

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
different material out here which didn't

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.800 
different material out here which didn't
have<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> half<00:02:50.250> slab<00:02:50.520> form<00:02:50.820> someone<00:02:51.630> may<00:02:51.780> be

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
have a half slab form someone may be

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.480 
have a half slab form someone may be
able<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.200> spot<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> secret<00:02:52.920> entrance<00:02:53.040> by

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
able to spot the secret entrance by

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.010 
able to spot the secret entrance by
looking<00:02:53.850> at<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> bottom<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.570> cauldrons

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
looking at the bottom of the cauldrons

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.660 
looking at the bottom of the cauldrons
now<00:02:55.560> also<00:02:55.740> you're<00:02:56.040> going<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.220> need<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.460> walls

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
now also you're going to need the walls

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.310 
now also you're going to need the walls
to<00:02:56.850> be<00:02:57.000> nearby<00:02:57.240> as<00:02:57.630> well<00:02:57.660> because<00:02:58.020> we<00:02:58.110> can<00:02:58.200> have

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
to be nearby as well because we can have

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.080 
to be nearby as well because we can have
the<00:02:58.470> Pistons<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.950> other<00:02:59.130> side<00:02:59.400> at<00:02:59.610> them<00:02:59.820> and

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
the Pistons the other side at them and

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.420 
the Pistons the other side at them and
they<00:03:00.480> need<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.870> be<00:03:01.020> hidden<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.070> build<00:03:02.220> this

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
they need to be hidden but to build this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.950 
they need to be hidden but to build this
you're<00:03:02.730> going<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> need<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.240> materials<00:03:03.780> in

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
you're going to need the materials in

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.750 
you're going to need the materials in
this<00:03:04.170> chest<00:03:04.530> you'll<00:03:04.800> need<00:03:04.950> four<00:03:05.190> half<00:03:05.400> slabs

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
this chest you'll need four half slabs

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.600 
this chest you'll need four half slabs

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
two cauldrons and two levers so let's

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.300 
two cauldrons and two levers so let's
build<00:03:16.020> this<00:03:16.290> we<00:03:16.590> are<00:03:16.680> going<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.890> start<00:03:17.100> off<00:03:17.130> by

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
build this we are going to start off by

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.130 
build this we are going to start off by
placing<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.880> pistons<00:03:18.300> that<00:03:18.480> shift<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.840> floor

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
placing the pistons that shift the floor

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.660 
placing the pistons that shift the floor
now<00:03:19.410> we're<00:03:19.560> going<00:03:19.710> to<00:03:19.770> need<00:03:19.860> blocks<00:03:20.160> in<00:03:20.460> these

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
now we're going to need blocks in these

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.580 
now we're going to need blocks in these
two<00:03:20.880> positions<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.690> we<00:03:21.810> need<00:03:21.960> our<00:03:21.990> pistons<00:03:22.500> to

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
two positions and we need our pistons to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.830 
two positions and we need our pistons to
be<00:03:22.830> behind<00:03:23.100> them<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:23.610> we<00:03:24.120> come<00:03:24.300> down<00:03:24.330> here<00:03:24.540> and

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
be behind them so we come down here and

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.840 
be behind them so we come down here and
put<00:03:24.960> a<00:03:25.020> piston<00:03:25.410> here<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.770> one<00:03:25.890> below<00:03:26.070> then<00:03:26.700> you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
put a piston here and one below then you

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.460 
put a piston here and one below then you
can<00:03:27.030> put<00:03:27.180> your<00:03:27.210> half<00:03:27.510> slab<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.050> your<00:03:28.260> block

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
can put your half slab and your block

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.740 
can put your half slab and your block
back<00:03:28.710> and<00:03:28.980> then<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.610> this<00:03:29.820> side<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.360> needs<00:03:30.570> to

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
back and then on this side it needs to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.450 
back and then on this side it needs to
be<00:03:30.900> one<00:03:31.110> block<00:03:31.350> further<00:03:31.620> back<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.010> we're<00:03:32.370> going

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
be one block further back so we're going

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.520 
be one block further back so we're going
to<00:03:32.520> place<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> block<00:03:32.940> there<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.630> then<00:03:34.290> when<00:03:34.440> we

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
to place a block there and then when we

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.230 
to place a block there and then when we
go<00:03:34.680> down<00:03:34.860> here<00:03:35.130> we<00:03:35.250> can<00:03:35.400> place<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.790> piston<00:03:36.180> on

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
go down here we can place the piston on

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.420 
go down here we can place the piston on
that<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.930> one<00:03:37.110> below<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.280> can

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
that and one below it and then you can

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.550 
that and one below it and then you can
put<00:03:38.550> your<00:03:38.580> half<00:03:38.820> slab<00:03:39.120> back<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.690> put<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> block

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
put your half slab back and put a block

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.590 
put your half slab back and put a block
on<00:03:40.830> top<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.460> now<00:03:41.970> when<00:03:42.120> you've<00:03:42.240> done<00:03:42.390> that

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
on top of it now when you've done that

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.940 
on top of it now when you've done that
we're<00:03:42.780> going<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.930> go<00:03:43.080> around<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.440> back<00:03:43.650> we're

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
we're going to go around the back we're

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.740 
we're going to go around the back we're
going<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.100> place<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.670> block<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.330> side<00:03:45.600> of

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
going to place a block to the side of

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.900 
going to place a block to the side of
this<00:03:45.900> piston<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.920> side<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.520> one<00:03:47.730> as

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
this piston to the side of that one as

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.170 
this piston to the side of that one as
well

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
well

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.090 
well
and<00:03:48.330> then<00:03:48.750> remove<00:03:49.020> these<00:03:49.260> free<00:03:49.560> blocks<00:03:49.830> here

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
and then remove these free blocks here

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.410 
and then remove these free blocks here
we're<00:03:50.370> going<00:03:50.520> to<00:03:50.580> put<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.790> sticky<00:03:51.240> piston

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
we're going to put a sticky piston

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.930 
we're going to put a sticky piston
facing<00:03:51.990> downwards<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.590> then<00:03:53.160> one<00:03:53.370> facing<00:03:53.790> to

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
facing downwards and then one facing to

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.760 
facing downwards and then one facing to
the<00:03:53.970> side<00:03:54.300> like<00:03:54.600> this<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.110> then<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.590> need<00:03:55.740> to

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
the side like this and then you need to

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.570 
the side like this and then you need to
place<00:03:56.070> blocks<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.700> these<00:03:57.150> positions<00:03:58.340> so<00:03:59.340> just

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
place blocks in these positions so just

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.070 
place blocks in these positions so just
like<00:03:59.790> that<00:04:00.030> now<00:04:00.180> let's<00:04:00.390> come<00:04:00.570> back<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.050> a

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
like that now let's come back and have a

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.900 
like that now let's come back and have a
look<00:04:01.290> at<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.860> then<00:04:02.490> when<00:04:02.640> you've<00:04:02.760> done

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
look at that and then when you've done

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.790 
look at that and then when you've done
that<00:04:03.120> put<00:04:03.150> your<00:04:03.390> redstone<00:04:03.630> block<00:04:04.080> here<00:04:04.350> pay

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
that put your redstone block here pay

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.700 
that put your redstone block here pay
dust<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.460> redstone<00:04:05.790> there<00:04:06.330> there<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.380> over

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
dust of redstone there there and over

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.290 
dust of redstone there there and over
here<00:04:07.890> as<00:04:08.010> well<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.370> then<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:08.850> need<00:04:09.120> a

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
here as well and then you need a

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.360 
here as well and then you need a
repeater<00:04:09.720> here<00:04:10.020> on<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.590> default<00:04:10.920> setting

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
repeater here on the default setting

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.100 
repeater here on the default setting
another<00:04:11.640> one<00:04:11.910> there<00:04:12.180> need<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.810> right-click

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
another one there need to right-click

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.990 
another one there need to right-click
that<00:04:13.350> one<00:04:13.710> twice<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.370> then<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:14.760> should<00:04:14.970> be

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
that one twice and then this should be

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.940 
that one twice and then this should be
done<00:04:15.360> so<00:04:15.870> we<00:04:15.900> come<00:04:16.200> around<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.530> front<00:04:16.680> and

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
done so we come around the front and

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.710 
done so we come around the front and
place<00:04:17.130> our<00:04:17.370> two<00:04:17.520> levers<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.150> then<00:04:18.239> test<00:04:18.510> both

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
place our two levers and then test both

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.900 
place our two levers and then test both
of<00:04:18.870> them<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.170> thing<00:04:19.380> should<00:04:19.560> work<00:04:19.760> there<00:04:20.760> we

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
of them this thing should work there we

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.610 
of them this thing should work there we
go<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:22.590> is<00:04:22.950> how<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.160> build<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:24.350> so<00:04:25.350> as<00:04:25.470> I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
go and that is how you build it so as I

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.590 
go and that is how you build it so as I
said<00:04:25.860> earlier<00:04:26.250> in<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.550> tutorial<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:27.210> puzzle

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
said earlier in the tutorial is puzzle

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.420 
said earlier in the tutorial is puzzle
to<00:04:27.780> make<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.050> longer<00:04:28.380> as<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.620> can<00:04:28.950> see<00:04:29.160> here

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
to make this longer as you can see here

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.100
