00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.100
 hey yeah ma 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480
 today i am going to make my thumb that nice 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.040
 deal with arie 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.870
 This already looks a long time also it is 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.010
 really been a few weeks ago since me 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.740
 did it 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.450
 is here also again to bite off and leave 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.370
 I shoot that I see this is what 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.260
 made, there was also not very 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.790
 nice more because you look it now 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.340
 been on a while when i went to it 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.989
 work ben year it just gets uglier 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.550
 but I still wanted on my thumb 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.280
 also make something like that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.070
 so we made you a black overflow 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.259
 to purple a little pink 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.240
 so i'm gonna take this off of what's going on 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.110
 now the mail is finished, it is already there 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.940
 off 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.560
 add some colors to the parking and then 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.860
 I am so you are not only using 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.810
 a number of different 40 active 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.960
 this is black with a bit of purple and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.119
 glitter and this is with your role spas 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.950
 and here is a very nice pink click 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.290
 yet a new one I make a beautiful one 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.930
 make a landing on my nail 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.729
 so that the geeter overflow from whole 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.030
 dark from the black to the light 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.030
 pink 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.270
 start with black 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:48.030
 I apply this to the top of the nail 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.920
 end of the nail as the black 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.110
 color is on the edge I move on to 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.420
 the middle color and that is one 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.729
 bit and your purple pink color with 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.180
 glitter and I go over it 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.180
 to let go 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.970
 these are beautiful coarse glitter in this one 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.970
 blend well into each other 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.459
 finally i put the other chain on the at the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.989
 light pink 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.290
 in that still brings this aside 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.930
 I leave the cuticle on that gently 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.550
 flowing out towards the cuticle and 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.290
 thereby 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.580
 those sparkles actually swirl 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.549
 bit by 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.319
 and then you will not see the growth now 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.269
 applies another translucent acrylic 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.580
 and then actually him in model I have 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.440
 my navel felled in model and now it 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.330
 time for the mail art 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.620
 I think again something with 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.940
 is going to be flowers 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.489
 but not the flowers that you then 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.530
 often see but I am now one 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.959
 try a different kind of flower and 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.660
 I use these things for that 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.470
 I think I will use these colors 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.500
 slightly grolsch 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.170
 it is dark purple and white and I have too 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.000
 got some strass stones 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.790
 this time I'm going to make flowers with 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.950
 pointed leaves 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.390
 very often I make those round leaves 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.299
 they are also very nice to see 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.000
 gentlemen that luck out but now I go for it 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.870
 leaves that with a yes actually just 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.069
 the other way round then ending in a dot 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.380
 I will call him out to be very nice 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.790
 to make the holidays because those 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.690
 it kind of looks like you 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.670
 Christmas stars say those flowers like 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.190
 you do this in red or in silver 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.750
 or with thea with white gold 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.109
 it immediately looks very Christmasy 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.109
 from 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.090
 I made three flowers on the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.180
 nail two they two flowers that 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.920
 little ones are just two leaves 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.630
 yes to that so quite full so 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.060
 I don't go there too much 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.709
 I think busy making things now 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.560
 I go around the leaves 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.660
 draw a line a line one 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.539
 dark color 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.610
 with that you create kind of shadow lines 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.610
 anti a little depth in the nail art 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.730
 I always try the lines a little 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.460
 a bit graceful so try it 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.590
 a bit of a twist or a bow 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.930
 to make 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.920
 just a little extra accent 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.720
 add 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.340
 I also do a little bit with the 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.140
 white striper 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.140
 for example , very thin fine lines 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.870
 then i am in the middle of the 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.009
 flowers and larger white dots 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.030
 here will be another one later 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.030
 strass stone 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.509
 and because you now have a white dot here 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.610
 make falls that rhinestones will just be 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:39.650
 slightly better that there is still a bit 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.690
 put white on the edges I can do it 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.210
 of course not to let up anything extra 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.710
 add white dots 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.699
 so after this I just put what little one is 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.699
 always gives a nice effect 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.570
 the way a little bit of lyme 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.460
 applied to those little white dots 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.460
 and now the rhinestones are coming up 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.889
 wedding just be careful with 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.889
 my so far 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.530
 so for me the nail art is ready 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.240
 Go there now Sale over 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.330
 and then you will like it 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.500
 see the end result and this is it 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.840
 become 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.050
 it is a battery surface with black and 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.940
 purple and some pink and over it I have 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.560
 the flowers made with the pink and what 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.210
 dark purple and in the middle 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.710
 rhinestones 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.570
 you sit on it is not even a whole 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.670
 difficult nail art and you just need the 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.290
 flour it tastes to you and some of the 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.420
 fine lines in addition but it is 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.460
 not so very difficult I do nothing 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.080
 super precise to do so I think 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.650
 it you also what i am going now i come to 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.550
 to make 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.140
 I am very curious what you think of it 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.000
 if you like it then 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.140
 just give your thumbs up 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.520
