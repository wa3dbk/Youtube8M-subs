00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
say is that the looks like it's only the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.610 
say is that the looks like it's only the
Japanese<00:00:43.469> blog<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.670> down<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.059> moment

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
Japanese blog that is down at the moment

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.260 
Japanese blog that is down at the moment
the<00:00:46.620> English<00:00:46.920> blog<00:00:47.160> still<00:00:47.430> works<00:00:47.579> fine<00:00:47.670> I've

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the English blog still works fine I've

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.490 
the English blog still works fine I've
heard<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.600> try<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:48.989> into<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
heard you can try to get into the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
heard you can try to get into the
Japanese<00:00:49.649> block<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.910> cached<00:00:51.390> form<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.989> my

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
Japanese block in cached form of my

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.959 
Japanese block in cached form of my
temperature<00:00:52.469> how<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.770> works<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.820> think

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
temperature how that works but I think

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.000 
temperature how that works but I think
it<00:00:54.059> flows<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.620> had<00:00:55.770> whatever

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it flows of what you had whatever

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.099 
it flows of what you had whatever
previously<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.149> nobody<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:58.020> get

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
previously was but nobody really can get

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.369 
previously was but nobody really can get
into<00:00:58.320> an<00:00:58.620> updated<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.309> even<00:01:00.379> loaded

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
into an updated on can even loaded

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.900 
into an updated on can even loaded
unless<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:02.010> he<00:01:02.219> opened<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.699> form

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.569 
out for me the smell video there's some
of<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> teams<00:01:42.229> but<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.070> characters

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
of the teams but not for the characters

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.999 
of the teams but not for the characters
that's<00:01:44.790> really<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.329> really<00:01:46.140> balls<00:01:46.860> my

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that's really really really balls my

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.590 
that's really really really balls my
mind<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.340> i<00:01:47.399> I'm<00:01:47.850> pretty<00:01:48.119> sure<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.479> they

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
mind I i I'm pretty sure that they

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.740 
mind I i I'm pretty sure that they
actually<00:01:48.689> go<00:01:48.960> into<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.170> game<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:50.490> those

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
actually go into the game and get those

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.780 
actually go into the game and get those
PNG<00:01:51.750> files<00:01:51.960> themselves<00:01:52.250> I'm<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:53.460> percent

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
PNG files themselves I'm not one percent

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.120 
PNG files themselves I'm not one percent
sure<00:01:53.850> about<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.890> even<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:55.950> they<00:01:56.040> don't

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
sure about that but even if they don't

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.950 
sure about that but even if they don't
like<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.180> kind<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.390> mind-boggling<00:01:57.750> so

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
like just it's kind of mind-boggling so

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.850 
like just it's kind of mind-boggling so
hopefully<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.469> something<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:58.740> not

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
hopefully this is something that's not

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
hopefully this is something that's not
going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.189> blow<00:01:59.310> over<00:01:59.460> soon<00:01:59.700> hopefully

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
going to blow over soon hopefully

Japan<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.489> then<00:02:32.580> global<00:02:33.030> definitely<00:02:33.360> helped

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
Japan and then global definitely helped

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.640 
Japan and then global definitely helped
me<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.750> rule<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.110> like<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> said<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> goal

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.589 
still down i believe at the moment and I
mean<00:02:41.700> that's<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.970> pretty<00:02:42.090> much<00:02:42.239> leave<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
mean that's it pretty much leave the
