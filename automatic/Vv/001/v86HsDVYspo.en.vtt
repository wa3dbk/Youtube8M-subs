00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 yes ladies gentlemen welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.520
 update video and today we will 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.870
 have about costumes and now who i want you 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.150
 so tell that there is a lot of fun 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.420
 update none has come from the new one 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.250
 blog of roller coaster tycoon dot com 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.139
 I can report that costumes and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.300
 louis is totally coming back in the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.760
 new roller coaster tycoon world 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.590
 and the building becomes completely freeform 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.930
 that means building a bit like you 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.789
 no limits am used to building 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.230
 you no longer pay for a roller coaster 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.000
 piece of the job 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.949
 what we are used to part 1 2 and 3 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.660
 but you first build it in a sandbox 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.520
 like editor 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.040
 And then you can determine if you have a place 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.940
 if you have money or populated later if you 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.000
 spared on it 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.399
 that is a very cool future and you can 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 so you also make endless roller coasters 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.760
 but if you put them in your park and put it 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.710
 depends on how much money you make 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.559
 come in three types of roller coasters 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.239
 steel wood and hanging are just the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.190
 roller coaster type so that doesn't mean that 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.750
 you don't notice wing coaches or anything like that 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.489
 because you can still different 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.620
 place different types of carts on every track 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.480
 which makes it a completely different kind 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.580
 roller coaster becomes the new chose to portray 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.970
 is made so that you no longer have to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.010
 to build 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.680
 according to a grab like that was in roller 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.700
 coaster 3 is the only thing that matters 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.590
 the station 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.320
 and furthermore you can go ahead and go 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.549
 make the coaster as crazy as you want 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.560
 this is due to the new system from 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.080
 build that lets you with simple through it 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.369
 dragging your mouse and building direction 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.259
 you probably already know this from no 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.189
 limits that's just an example 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.259
 natural 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.350
 no limits can of course be your own choice 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.299
 what we make which way you track 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.030
 is of course not all people find 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.619
 it's nice to work in this 3d free 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.000
 shape tool 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.950
 that's why the old-fashioned tools are 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.049
 Available as you also and roller 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.280
 coaster 1 2 and 3 actually roll out 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.009
 chose 3 that you could guess the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.540
 closest of these looked they have 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.579
 they have a system that is accessible to 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.180
 both advanced builders and start and 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.070
 the builders 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.630
 It is also confirmed that you are tasty 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.310
 can create another onride in you 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.710
 building 'the roller coaster the imagine you 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.570
 have made a wonderful chose step 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.180
 right in the cart and make it yourself 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.710
 in first person fell last 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.570
 to have 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.080
 a very nice screen namely this one 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.970
 screenshot has been published on the website 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.800
 and as you can see it is a new one 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.020
 attractions that reunite with fire it 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.490
 are therefore two barns so you 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.830
 like a hanging one 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.170
 yes and then the hanging trolley over 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.420
 wounds are turning and so to speak 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.150
 the fire will rise higher so that the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.230

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.819

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.010
 well as you see the count is the 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.830
 very beautiful you also see the shadow 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.930
 I think it's fantastic 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.280
 separately to see the roller coaster on the right 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.400
 wooden roller coaster you don't run 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.890
 all right straight up 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.320
 but maybe that's because he doesn't 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.120

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.560
