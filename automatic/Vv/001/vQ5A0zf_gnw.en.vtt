click this button right here and it

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.760 
click this button right here and it
should<00:02:59.250> bring<00:02:59.400> up<00:02:59.640> more<00:02:59.790> results

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.920 

as<00:03:03.770> you<00:03:04.370> can<00:03:04.489> see<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.730> product<00:03:05.180> one<00:03:05.390> more<00:03:05.569> result

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
as you can see a product one more result

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.839 
as you can see a product one more result
which<00:03:06.140> is<00:03:06.610> deeper<00:03:07.610> into<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.910> network<00:03:08.410> and<00:03:09.849> also

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
which is deeper into a network and also

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.729 
which is deeper into a network and also
now<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.330> you<00:03:11.390> know<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.599> mac<00:03:12.080> address<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.650> a

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
now that you know the mac address of a

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.199 
now that you know the mac address of a
person<00:03:13.160> who<00:03:13.250> has<00:03:13.340> found<00:03:13.520> its<00:03:13.760> way<00:03:13.880> into<00:03:14.060> your

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
person who has found its way into your

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.690 
person who has found its way into your
network<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:15.470> can<00:03:15.590> now<00:03:15.709> filter<00:03:15.980> out<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.489> mac

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
network you can now filter out that mac

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.490 
network you can now filter out that mac
address<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.569> he<00:03:17.599> won't<00:03:17.930> be<00:03:17.989> able<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.260> get<00:03:18.380> its

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
address so he won't be able to get its

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.840 
address so he won't be able to get its
way<00:03:18.769> back<00:03:19.040> into<00:03:19.250> your<00:03:19.519> network

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850
