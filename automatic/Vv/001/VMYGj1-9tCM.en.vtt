sunny day will stay in effect but if

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.449 
sunny day will stay in effect but if
lugia<00:02:40.959> anticipates<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.859> then<00:02:42.129> there's<00:02:42.370> a

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
lugia anticipates this then there's a

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.640 
lugia anticipates this then there's a

attack before sunny day and then the

attack before sunny day and then the
weather<00:02:46.569> becomes<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.019> mess<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.379> let's<00:02:47.590> not

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
weather becomes a mess and let's not

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.920 
weather becomes a mess and let's not
worry<00:02:47.980> about<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:49.120> right<00:02:49.329> off<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.510> bat<00:02:49.629> I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
worry about that so right off the bat I

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.199 
worry about that so right off the bat I
want<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.200> look<00:02:50.379> at<00:02:50.530> who<00:02:50.920> would<00:02:51.099> win<00:02:51.340> sacred

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
want to look at who would win sacred

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.720 
want to look at who would win sacred
fire<00:02:52.420> versus<00:02:52.989> eres<00:02:53.440> la<00:02:53.620> add<00:02:53.859> arrow<00:02:54.280> blast

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
fire versus eres la add arrow blast

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.190 
fire versus eres la add arrow blast
right<00:02:54.970> there<00:02:55.239> because<00:02:55.420> if<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:55.989> arrow

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
right there because if you have arrow

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.229 
right there because if you have arrow
blasts<00:02:56.500> that's<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.370> signature<00:02:57.700> move<00:02:57.909> versus

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
blasts that's the signature move versus

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.509

about the strongest moves now there's

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.629 
about the strongest moves now there's
another<00:04:29.139> way<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.350> work<00:04:29.560> around<00:04:29.680> this<00:04:29.979> Oh<00:04:30.160> a

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
another way to work around this Oh a

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.360 
another way to work around this Oh a
sacred<00:04:31.240> fire<00:04:31.419> sacred<00:04:31.930> fire<00:04:32.110> has<00:04:32.320> a<00:04:32.350> 50%<00:04:33.310> chance

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
sacred fire sacred fire has a 50% chance

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.730 
sacred fire sacred fire has a 50% chance
to<00:04:33.699> burn<00:04:33.880> if<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.660> burns<00:04:34.870> lugia<00:04:35.350> then<00:04:35.560> that

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
to burn if it burns lugia then that

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.800 
to burn if it burns lugia then that
means<00:04:36.010> lugia<00:04:36.520> is<00:04:36.580> taking<00:04:36.910> extra<00:04:37.240> damage<00:04:37.419> that

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
means lugia is taking extra damage that

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.870 
means lugia is taking extra damage that
you<00:04:37.900> probably<00:04:38.470> can't<00:04:38.740> survive<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.370> then<00:04:39.790> it

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
you probably can't survive and then it

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.070 
you probably can't survive and then it
also<00:04:40.030> has<00:04:40.389> the<00:04:41.310> 50%<00:04:42.310> attack<00:04:42.790> drop<00:04:43.060> so<00:04:43.720> choice

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080

band is going to lead with that

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.680 
band is going to lead with that
waterfall<00:04:46.350> hit<00:04:47.350> hard<00:04:47.650> for<00:04:48.210> lugia<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.510> then

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
waterfall hit hard for lugia and then

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.990 
waterfall hit hard for lugia and then
sacred<00:04:50.229> fire<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.740> going<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.190> burn<00:04:51.430> Loog<00:04:51.639> it<00:04:51.820> if

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
sacred fire is going to burn Loog it if

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.510 
sacred fire is going to burn Loog it if
it<00:04:52.330> burns<00:04:52.570> on<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:52.930> first<00:04:53.169> turn<00:04:53.470> sacred<00:04:54.340> fire

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
it burns on that first turn sacred fire

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.939 
it burns on that first turn sacred fire
is<00:04:54.639> going<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.880> win<00:04:55.090> out<00:04:55.240> because<00:04:55.600> now

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
is going to win out because now

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.290 
is going to win out because now
waterfall<00:04:56.949> is<00:04:57.039> doing<00:04:57.310> reduced<00:04:57.610> damage<00:04:57.880> and

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
waterfall is doing reduced damage and

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.990 
waterfall is doing reduced damage and
then<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:59.289> sacred<00:04:59.860> fire<00:05:00.010> does<00:05:00.370> bonus<00:05:00.820> damage

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
then the sacred fire does bonus damage

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.210 
then the sacred fire does bonus damage
because<00:05:01.419> it<00:05:01.570> breaks<00:05:01.810> breaks<00:05:02.770> wood<00:05:03.070> gives

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.260 
because it breaks breaks wood gives
multiscale<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.090> now<00:05:04.900> it's<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:06.010> KO<00:05:06.190> so<00:05:07.000> if<00:05:07.150> we

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
multiscale and now it's a KO so if we

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.210 
multiscale and now it's a KO so if we
look<00:05:07.449> at<00:05:07.510> this<00:05:07.690> just<00:05:08.050> a<00:05:08.139> bit<00:05:08.410> more<00:05:08.620> so<00:05:08.860> because

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
look at this just a bit more so because

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.770 
look at this just a bit more so because
of<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.520> multi<00:05:09.729> scale<00:05:09.940> sacred<00:05:10.300> fires<00:05:10.479> doing

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.140 
25% but lugia is down to sixty two point
five<00:05:14.320> percent<00:05:14.710> because<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.460> burn<00:05:15.669> damage

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
five percent because the burn damage

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.900 
five percent because the burn damage
then<00:05:17.020> there's<00:05:17.320> also<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.740> 50%<00:05:18.220> that<00:05:18.610> sacred
