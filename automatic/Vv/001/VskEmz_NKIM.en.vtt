10<00:04:54.980> minutes<00:04:55.280> is<00:04:55.430> now<00:04:55.580> elapsed<00:04:55.910> so<00:04:56.360> we<00:04:56.480> can

10 minutes is now elapsed so we can

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.220 
10 minutes is now elapsed so we can

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
compare the ammonia test we can clearly

compare the ammonia test we can clearly
see<00:05:00.560> this<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:00.800> giving<00:05:01.130> us<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.370> zero<00:05:01.640> reading

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
see this is giving us a zero reading

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.350 
see this is giving us a zero reading
which<00:05:02.360> is<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.630> correct<00:05:02.990> level
