lipsticks you know at the bottom

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.109 
lipsticks you know at the bottom
and<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:01.090> way<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.420> I<00:02:01.450> did<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:03.460> makeup<00:02:03.700> case

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
and the way that I did this makeup case

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.850 
and the way that I did this makeup case
is<00:02:04.299> pretty<00:02:04.479> much<00:02:04.689> how<00:02:04.900> I<00:02:04.930> did<00:02:05.200> my<00:02:05.320> makeup<00:02:05.500> kit

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
is pretty much how I did my makeup kit

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.059 
is pretty much how I did my makeup kit
so<00:02:06.549> it's<00:02:06.729> like<00:02:07.349> everything<00:02:08.349> is<00:02:08.590> sectioned<00:02:09.009> off

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
so it's like everything is sectioned off

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.940 
so it's like everything is sectioned off
these<00:02:09.369> are<00:02:09.399> lips<00:02:09.789> this<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:10.689> face<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.830> then

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
these are lips this is face and then

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.560 
these are lips this is face and then
we're<00:02:12.069> gonna<00:02:12.159> go<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.659> the<00:02:13.659> next<00:02:13.689> one<00:02:14.200> here

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
we're gonna go to the next one here

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.810 
we're gonna go to the next one here
so<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:17.140> don't<00:02:17.560> really<00:02:17.650> use<00:02:18.040> these<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.610> just

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
so I don't really use these I just

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.010 
so I don't really use these I just
wanted<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.300> put<00:02:20.080> something<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.650> these<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:22.020> see

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020
