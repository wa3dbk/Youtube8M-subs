00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
one out of three runs remember we were

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.619 
one out of three runs remember we were
shortened<00:01:00.430> by<00:01:00.519> one<00:01:00.730> session<00:01:01.180> because<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.539> the

shortened by one session because of the
rain<00:01:01.839> and<00:01:02.170> I<00:01:03.129> think<00:01:03.519> that<00:01:03.670> probably<00:01:03.909> been<00:01:04.210> them

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
rain and I think that probably been them

rain and I think that probably been them
they<00:01:04.420> just<00:01:04.449> missed<00:01:04.809> on<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.170> Senate<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.890> might

they just missed on the Senate it might

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.710 
they just missed on the Senate it might
have<00:01:06.250> been<00:01:06.340> a<00:01:06.400> little<00:01:06.580> bit<00:01:06.790> too<00:01:06.970> aggressive<00:01:07.119> as

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
have been a little bit too aggressive as

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.039 
have been a little bit too aggressive as
you<00:01:07.869> go<00:01:07.990> on<00:01:08.110> board<00:01:08.350> with

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
you go on board with

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.450 
you go on board with
see<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.200> truck<00:01:10.439> spun<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.829> tires<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.189> little<00:01:11.280> bit

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460

farther<00:01:11.700> down<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.149> racetrack<00:01:12.360> he<00:01:12.719> was<00:01:12.840> back

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
farther down the racetrack he was back

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.899

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
felling that flash of fire was pushing

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.340 
felling that flash of fire was pushing
those<00:01:15.060> head<00:01:15.270> gaskets<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:15.960> back<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
those head gaskets out of the back to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
those head gaskets out of the back to
flop<00:01:16.560> those<00:01:16.829> are<00:01:17.039> the<00:01:17.130> gaskets<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.670> he

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
flop those are the gaskets that he

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.490 
flop those are the gaskets that he
sealed<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> cylinder<00:01:18.960> head<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.649> the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
sealed the cylinder head to the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.900 
sealed the cylinder head to the
when<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:20.890> get<00:01:21.010> too<00:01:21.130> much<00:01:21.250> cylinder<00:01:21.640> pressure

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
when you get too much cylinder pressure

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.020 
when you get too much cylinder pressure
it<00:01:22.420> wants<00:01:22.810> to<00:01:22.900> push<00:01:23.110> those<00:01:23.350> out<00:01:23.650> now<00:01:23.730> Cory<00:01:24.730> I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
it wants to push those out now Cory I

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.700 
it wants to push those out now Cory I
think<00:01:25.480> he<00:01:25.570> might<00:01:25.780> just<00:01:25.990> overpowered<00:01:26.590> it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
think he might just overpowered it

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.260 
think he might just overpowered it
earlier<00:01:27.010> did<00:01:27.250> he<00:01:27.310> get<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.760> shake<00:01:28.000> zone

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
earlier did he get to the shake zone

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.200 
earlier did he get to the shake zone

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.120 
yeah oh we did a quick little pedal but
the<00:01:31.660> car<00:01:31.930> didn't<00:01:32.200> settle<00:01:32.440> down<00:01:32.680> and<00:01:32.920> look<00:01:33.070> at

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
the car didn't settle down and look at

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
I'm trying to look at him working them

our Matco tools teams been sticking with

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.350 
our Matco tools teams been sticking with
it<00:02:14.980> right<00:02:15.400> when<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:15.580> got<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.880> figure<00:02:16.030> out<00:02:16.209> for

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
it right when we got to figure out for

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.510 
it right when we got to figure out for
last<00:02:16.540> qualifying<00:02:17.080> session<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:17.920> had<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.100> we<00:02:18.400> had

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
last qualifying session we had a we had

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.250 
last qualifying session we had a we had
a<00:02:18.550> mechanical<00:02:19.090> part<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.510> failed<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.959> us<00:02:20.110> so

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
a mechanical part that failed on us so

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.210 
a mechanical part that failed on us so
that's<00:02:20.380> why<00:02:20.560> we<00:02:20.680> didn't<00:02:20.830> make<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.010> down<00:02:21.070> and

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
that's why we didn't make it down and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.530 
that's why we didn't make it down and
track<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.490> time<00:02:21.640> off<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.910> start<00:02:22.120> line<00:02:22.300> so

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
track that time off the start line so

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.000 
track that time off the start line so
that<00:02:23.080> was<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> first<00:02:23.440> row<00:02:23.590> pass<00:02:23.800> down<00:02:23.980> a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
that was a first row pass down a

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.040 
that was a first row pass down a
racetrack<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.580> we<00:02:24.700> saw<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.390> track<00:02:25.600> once<00:02:25.840> we<00:02:25.930> go

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
racetrack so we saw the track once we go

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.640 
racetrack so we saw the track once we go
back<00:02:26.230> analyze<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.860> data<00:02:26.920> but<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:28.420> just<00:02:28.650> want

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650
