00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi all the guys are az willings 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.120
 today I am here with or gt5 video in which 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.460
 veloster or how to increase the ability of the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.040
 your character on online trips the most 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.750
 quickly the abilities are 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.880
 statistics that indicate how rea 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.859
 precisely your character a 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.520
 do a certain thing 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.420
 the ability is seven the resistance the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.340
 power 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.420
 apnea stealth drives you the flight e 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.070
 the aim 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.750
 let's move on to resistance as mental 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.050
 as quickly as possible resistance 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.920
 as every 17 meters you run noticed 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.030
 rides 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.370
 obviously one percent 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.210
 of existence I advise you to do 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.829
 activities with the bike especially the races 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.340
 with the bike it doesn't matter the facades 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.129
 alone or with other players e 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.100
 enough that you do them anyway because 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.829
 pedaling compared to running or noticing is 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.930
 much faster then do these 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.510
 seventeen meters at a time much more 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.239
 quickly the bike that I recommend 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.220
 they are the white hat the tricycle or 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.640
 lendu the ex are all the same changes 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.049
 only the graphics of the bicycle 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.790
 in the video you will surely notice that the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.310
 mere existence will not fall ah well with that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.490
 because the sky resistance at most a 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.220
 another piece of advice I give you as you do 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.229
 cycling is to hold rb 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.430
 your player will be riding a lot more 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.130
 quickly 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.170
 then with regard to aiming each 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:34.979
 bullet centered and every action there 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.860
 increase your aim especially if you do one 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.960
 chat to increase much faster 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.329
 the pasta branches changed at the point where 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.850
 I showed you on the map and do this 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.549
 sort of web glitch of the video for how 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.640
 enter the texture in the wall I don't know 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.930
 good to say because a little difficult 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.369
 explain it in words 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.829
 once you enter here you have to 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.259
 try to make the stars or better know 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.689
 be wanted by the police 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.610
 in this way you can shoot 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.229
 cops without them resuming e 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.780
 therefore it will increase the aim much more 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.390
 easily another advice I give you 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.590
 to increase the aim is to do 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.970
 survival is a lot more fun 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.340
 but at the same time much more 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.950
 hard 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.840
 anyway if you want to overcome a lot 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.040
 easily all 10 dates in 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.260
 survival 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.900
 I made a video on a strategy on 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.239
 how to overcome the dozens very easily 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.879
 given in human waste so you will unlock 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.849
 also the trophy selection goal 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.709
 natural if you have n't unlocked it 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.590
 let's move on to strength to make strength is 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.330
 very very simple as yours 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.160
 friend gets into a vehicle and you have to 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.769
 kick the car you notice that for 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.630
 there must necessarily be a person 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:52.130
 inside the vehicle in less than ten 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.099
 minutes you will be able to make the strength there 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.620
 guide to get up faster 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.810
 Possible driving skills you need 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.629
 press the start button go online 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.299
 activity hosts activities created by 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.730
 rockstar gare and you have to choose 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.680
 circuit criminal record 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.569
 you can choose all the rides you want 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.870
 all the vehicle classes you want 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.760
 all the weather all you want 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.470
 in short, as long as these activities 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.690
 facet alone because you have to set up 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.980
 many g we say that the turns depend on 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.370
 how many skills you need to 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.269
 example one who has recently played gta 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.540
 online you will need 48 laps because every 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:42.349
 around twelve rounds equals 20 per 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.780
 one hundred of skills we pass to the ability 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.269
 longer to do or flight every 10 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.150
 minutes in the air without doing neither stunt nor 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.130
 landings counts for one percent therefore 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.609
 you'll have to do a thousand minutes to do the 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.410
 one hundred percent to complete the most 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.530
 quickly this ability 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.049
 you need to make multiple multiple landings like 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.109
 see in the video just take a 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.209
 plane with the landing gear that 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.470
 you can find it at sandy shores point 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.139
 in the map I showed in 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.769
 video to go to the airport and go 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.789
 up and down up and down continuously 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.049
 remember that anyway lario must 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.049
 contain the landing gear 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.280
 and here we are at the penultimate skill 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.870
 shown in the video or stealth 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.900
 stealth in practice serves 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.780
 to let a circle expand 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:39.320
 present in the radar plus this circle 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.120
 great and here we are at the penultimate skill 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.460
 shown in the video 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.400
 you have to walk for like 40 minutes where 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.380
 do you want garage apartment in mou nation 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.470
 for san andreas 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.560
 so on in stealth mode to go 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.800
 stealth mode just press ls in the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.310
 xbox or l3 in the playstation 3 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.169
 it would be the left analog stick 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.539
 once stealth mode you have to 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.210
 find a time when you don't play 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:11.770
 in your console and as in the picture 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.510
 place two books in the peaks 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.180
 left stick to the right lever 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.430
 right to left so that yes 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.010
 keep things pressed and then the 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.330
 your character will turn around 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.990
 to infinity regarding 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.850
 the last skill or apnea is little 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.470
 to say there are no tricks to do it 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.330
 you have to go only underwater 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.220
 come back on so underwater 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:40.400
 go back up so away for 40 50 minutes 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.780
