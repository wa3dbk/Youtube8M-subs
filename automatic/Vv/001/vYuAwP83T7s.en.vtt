 5.5 inch screen carrying the 4.3 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:34.210
 you are followed 24 points 4.2 is worth this kat kit

 a quad-core processor lmt of 6 582 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.800
 It takes 1.3 day of exercises and one 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:46.719
 screen makes the functions of 1280 x 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:50.620

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.719
 seller according to the manufacturer of 3 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.280
 megapixels but let's see if that is 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.190
 true 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.710

 storage and 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 and let's see 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
 everyone 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.460

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.909
 hamas is more interactive 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.909
 Y 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 do not 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.790
 we're 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.790
 practice it 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.210
 and here we have the phone 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.210
 here we have something more 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.940
 well 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.600
 a gift from him 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.450
 let's see 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.450
 this is typical 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.719
 I have come 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.099
 yes 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.360
 for all 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.360
 of the helmets 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.610
 then in the end we do not like this matter 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.600
 of additional screen reader so that 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.910
 have already got one inside here we can not here 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.080
 I think one 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.080
 antinori men 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.760
 the specifications 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.580
 android 4.4 points the dimensions and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.390
 you say leagues there are versions worth 2 gb 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.900
 a version of a giga the version of 2 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:11.010
 gigas is carrying a stem core processors 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.010
 go 14 more simple 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.400
 of 3 megapixels those are the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.350
 frequencies that the phone works and 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.790
 nothing 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.790
 starts 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.790
 here 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.440
 it looks 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.900
 i 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.900
 here for sure 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.680
 already comes with an east or european connector 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.420
 for the Chinese in Europe and if not 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.960
 surely for others 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.360
 sites but they sent an adapter 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.980
 one 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.390
 here we owe nothing else 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.359
 I 'm not catching 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.460
 Y 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.550
 we are going to what really interests us 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.540
 what is the determined 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.680
 and we achieve 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.100
 aside 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.919
 he is very, very good is a phone 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.449
 big as you can see large of 5.5 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.880
 inches 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.350
 a camera 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.070
 from the boisterous 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:51.050
 the edges of the terminal and this is 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.050
 metal alloy 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.069
 open the phone 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.069
 what we found inside 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.340
 Market Stall 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.190
 a little April 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.530
 but no 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:26.199
 the big but narrow battery 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:30.390
 the terminal installed the battery is of 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:32.340
 2,400 here 2 thousand 430 min empires 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.280
 this 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.090
 with ours 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.090
 terminal 

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:52.120
 it's like that 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:55.860
 1 I think the micro 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.860
 and the micro sd 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.690
 we have the logo 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.310
 details 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.980
 the buttons of the pair to raise the volume 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.650
 very, very good 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:52.350
 determined was a regio of 240 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:54.449
 140 dollars 113 about 100 euros more or 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.470
 less and the truth that is very very very 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:59.940
 good that ending 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.940
 the rich are not great 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.090
 and as this would be more or less what 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:10.300
 make 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.300
 in finishing the flashy buttons 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.960
 I will surely see some 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.960
 I do this 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.380
 even the 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.120
 I do not like it 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.120
 I do not get used to it 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.140
 this having come to the screen is of 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:39.370
 5.5 inches but still the quality is 

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:43.390
 good can be seen just unlike 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:48.070
 the pixels and nothing because this is all 

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:50.260
 What is nom boxing? I will do a review of 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.660
 this phone that will be more more detailed 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:56.110
 interest a camera the bed in front of the 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.790
 back camera is worth and nothing this is all 

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.690
 with my part if you liked the video 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.340
 on-line 

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.770
 share it and so you know if you 

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.390
 interest the terminal in the description 

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.940
 as always you will have the edge of 

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.920
 purchase is worth it if you want to buy it and 

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.430
 nothing, I say goodbye until the meeting 

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.430
 we
