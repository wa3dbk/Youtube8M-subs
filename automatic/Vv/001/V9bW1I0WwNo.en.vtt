00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.819 
a lot more with it but Sheamus is a
natural<00:01:39.570> heel<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.049> feel<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
natural heel and I feel that this is a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.580 
natural heel and I feel that this is a
good<00:01:41.250> move<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.150> WWE<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.079> Sheamus

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
good move on the WWE because Sheamus

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.710 
good move on the WWE because Sheamus
could<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:43.860> thrust<00:01:44.189> into<00:01:44.310> new<00:01:44.939> matches<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> new

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
could be thrust into new matches and new

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.300 
could be thrust into new matches and new
programs<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.950> could<00:01:47.159> definitely

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
programs and this could definitely

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.789 
programs and this could definitely
changed<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> course<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.720> WWE<00:01:49.350> history<00:01:49.680> in
