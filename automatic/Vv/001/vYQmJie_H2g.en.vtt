00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello everyone, Andrei Andreich 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.050
 Andreev my site all-all dot ru 1440 5 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.179
 the task to perform and the division exactly 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.480
 I need to perform the division I have already told 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.980
 in 44 in the forty third number 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.720
 can see 44 forty-third number 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.420
 there in detail and explained how to do 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.810
 seals let us from this number I will perform 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.039
 not all numbers are not all letters but only one 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.769
 any letter let's solve the letter c 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.329
 letter u just especially i will be here 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.610
 such a nuance that I have not told 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.469
 in the forty-fourth forty- third therefore 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.750
 I will perform 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.760
 the letter q if this is not enough for 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.160
 all other solutions see another 44 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.390
 43 numbers 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.579
 try to do the rest yourself because 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.610
 that but they are all the same to me boring it 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.930
 decide in a row they are all about the same 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:03.690
 only the numbers change and so the letter c 46, 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:05.670
 0 8 divided by zero , 384 nuance 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.820
 here is what else is not 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.210
 told in previous rooms here 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.500
 we will give a comma for 3 characters 1 2 3 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.450
 put a comma here to become 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.400
 integer 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.790
 then we divide the divisible comma 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:29.250
 also 3 digits three digits 1 2 3 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.890
 is there still let them not division 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.920
 and there still need to enter an empty figure 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.500
 is if we divide by 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.869
 384 if given or we transfer 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.420
 a comma for three signs two two three here 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.340
 here to again integer then and 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.670
 this number we need a comma 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.799
 move also three times on three numbers 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:03.719
 two and one more time here it was, time 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.820
 two and one more time in the empty space in 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.560
 empty space we enter 0 of this we 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.020
 not yet 1 2 3 in the empty space 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.560
 we enter 0 and now we divide already here 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.280
 number 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:25.819
 here it is still here and will write the answer 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.620
 below let's count in 102 460 80 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:34.050
 divide by 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.670
 384 same task on our task to here 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.019
 was an integer because we can't 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.160
 fractional 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.050
 so the fraction is transferable 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.140
 as many times as necessary 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:52.340
 transfer the comma as many times let's 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.340
 Already calculate the reception one by one 384 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.260
 occupy and subtract from ten 4 floor 6 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.069
 of the six occupied left five 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.319
 take out of 15 subtract 8 this is seven of 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:12.180
 Fours occupied left to three 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:15.440
 minus 30 eight we demolish so on 2 I here 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:22.760
 I think you can take it or not, you can probably 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:30.959
 2 to 2 to 4 8 2 to 8 16 6 we write 1 in mind 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:34.739
 2 to 3 6 to 1 knead if already turned 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.769
 0 the remaining this zero we are demolishing 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.810
 not immediately take a look right over here that is 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.630
 if here already turned out 0 then this 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:49.859
 zero we bring down here and immediately here the answer 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:52.200
 120 here look like about three minutes 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.060
 I have been deciding long and if I will be all letters 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.850
 I will not know it for a whole hour 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.880
 I will solve all the letters so try 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.440
 by decide on your own if you want 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.200
 check yourself you check yourself 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.000
 you can always using a calculator here 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.310
 but best of all, practice a 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.989
 then check don't count right on 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.989
 calculator on this all all bye
