okay here we have the BMW 5-series which

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.099 
okay here we have the BMW 5-series which
has<00:00:03.810> been<00:00:03.990> with<00:00:04.230> us<00:00:04.259> for<00:00:04.380> very<00:00:04.740> long<00:00:04.920> time<00:00:05.310> now

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109

my<00:00:07.109> initial<00:00:07.820> reaction<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.510> car<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.230> that

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
my initial reaction to this car is that

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.789 
my initial reaction to this car is that
it<00:00:11.210> seems<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.509> lost<00:00:12.660> its<00:00:12.870> bad-boy<00:00:13.530> image

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
it seems to have lost its bad-boy image

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.790 
it seems to have lost its bad-boy image
but<00:00:14.370> at<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.519> same<00:00:14.700> time<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:16.080> still<00:00:16.170> carries

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
but at the same time it still carries

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.849 
but at the same time it still carries
the<00:00:17.070> luxury<00:00:17.580> saloon<00:00:18.500> finesse

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the luxury saloon finesse

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.189 
the luxury saloon finesse
now<00:00:20.460> let's<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:20.910> auto<00:00:21.090> 60<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.020> not

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
now let's do an auto 60 this is not

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:34.639 
now let's do an auto 60 this is not
automatic<00:00:23.090> three<00:00:24.090> two<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:32.329> 0-60<00:00:33.500> well<00:00:34.500> it's

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
automatic three two one 0-60 well it's

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.430 
automatic three two one 0-60 well it's
pretty<00:00:34.800> quick<00:00:35.190> I'll<00:00:35.399> give<00:00:35.579> her<00:00:35.700> that

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
pretty quick I'll give her that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
pretty quick I'll give her that
obviously<00:00:37.440> once<00:00:37.739> these<00:00:37.890> things<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.340> been

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
obviously once these things have been

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.220 
obviously once these things have been
handed<00:00:38.820> down<00:00:38.850> through<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.360> few<00:00:39.629> owners<00:00:39.840> they

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
handed down through a few owners they

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.520 
handed down through a few owners they
start<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.649> get<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:41.719> modified<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> certain

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
start to get a bit modified in a certain

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
start to get a bit modified in a certain
way<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> exhaust<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> wheels<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
way with the exhaust and the wheels and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.990 
way with the exhaust and the wheels and
what<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.649> they<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.489> start<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
what have you and they do start to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.549 
what have you and they do start to

develop that that bad-boy image but this

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.900 
develop that that bad-boy image but this
one<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.309> beautifully<00:00:54.559> luxurious<00:00:55.760> it's<00:00:56.760> got

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
one is is beautifully luxurious it's got

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.020 
one is is beautifully luxurious it's got
the<00:00:57.000> paddle<00:00:57.360> shift<00:00:58.910> beautifully<00:00:59.910> laid<00:01:00.000> out

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the paddle shift beautifully laid out

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.389 
the paddle shift beautifully laid out
console<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.870> fact<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.350> wasn't<00:01:01.739> even<00:01:01.949> too<00:01:02.160> sure

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
console in fact I wasn't even too sure

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.770 
console in fact I wasn't even too sure
whether<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.789> was<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.120> plastic<00:01:03.660> at

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
whether that was a little plastic at

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.270 
whether that was a little plastic at
first<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:06.470> hard<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.619> tell<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
first but it's hard to tell but it is

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.330 
first but it's hard to tell but it is
plastic<00:01:08.700> improve<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.500> center<00:01:10.500> console<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
plastic improve it center console to the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.620 
plastic improve it center console to the
dolls<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.790> little<00:01:12.030> bit<00:01:12.150> too<00:01:12.360> small<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
dolls a little bit too small and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.460 
dolls a little bit too small and
possibility<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.900> might<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> bit

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
possibility that this might be a bit

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.940 
possibility that this might be a bit
bland<00:01:16.799> actually<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.619> Center

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
bland actually you have your Center

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.240 
bland actually you have your Center
controls<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.880> console<00:01:21.810> sat-nav<00:01:22.259> radio<00:01:23.100> etc

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
controls or console sat-nav radio etc

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.719 
controls or console sat-nav radio etc
etc<00:01:24.530> everything<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.650> very<00:01:25.890> easily<00:01:26.130> laid<00:01:26.490> out

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
etc everything is very easily laid out

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.190 
etc everything is very easily laid out
despite<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> fact<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.750> got<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.049> many

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
despite the fact it's got so many

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
despite the fact it's got so many
features<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:29.299> think<00:01:30.299> maybe<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.810> might<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.200> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
features I think maybe this might be a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.830 
features I think maybe this might be a
bit<00:01:31.579> confusing<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.880> differentiate<00:01:33.689> between

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
bit confusing to differentiate between

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.080 
bit confusing to differentiate between
the<00:01:34.290> button<00:01:34.710> when<00:01:34.920> you're<00:01:35.040> driving<00:01:35.220> along

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
the button when you're driving along

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.120 
the button when you're driving along
and<00:01:37.750> it's<00:01:37.899> certainly<00:01:38.079> not<00:01:38.229> easier<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.890> control

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
and it's certainly not easier to control

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.929 
and it's certainly not easier to control
the<00:01:39.340> heating<00:01:39.520> when<00:01:39.790> it's<00:01:39.880> just<00:01:40.090> three<00:01:40.509> dials

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the heating when it's just three dials

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.020 
the heating when it's just three dials
the<00:01:42.939> rearview<00:01:43.119> vision<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:44.020> not<00:01:44.110> too<00:01:44.320> bad<00:01:45.030> not

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
the rearview vision is not too bad not

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.880 
the rearview vision is not too bad not
too<00:01:46.240> bad<00:01:46.270> at<00:01:46.600> all<00:01:46.780> slightly<00:01:47.170> obstructed<00:01:47.799> by

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
too bad at all slightly obstructed by

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.469 
too bad at all slightly obstructed by
the<00:01:47.920> headrest<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.729> I<00:01:48.789> can<00:01:49.000> see<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.329> with

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
the headrest and I can see that with

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.740 
the headrest and I can see that with
people<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.079> back<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:52.119> probably<00:01:52.270> wouldn't

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
people in the back you probably wouldn't

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.539 
people in the back you probably wouldn't
see<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> lot<00:01:53.200> going<00:01:53.500> on<00:01:53.590> out<00:01:53.649> there<00:01:53.860> but<00:01:54.399> the

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
see a lot going on out there but the

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.669 
see a lot going on out there but the
wing<00:01:54.729> mirrors<00:01:55.060> offer<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.420> lot<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.600> vision<00:01:56.020> it's

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
wing mirrors offer a lot of vision it's

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:57.810 
wing mirrors offer a lot of vision it's
definitely<00:01:57.009> no<00:01:57.100> problem<00:01:57.429> seeing<00:01:57.670> where

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
definitely no problem seeing where

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.450 
definitely no problem seeing where
you've<00:01:58.000> been<00:01:58.210> now<00:01:58.990> as<00:01:59.229> usual<00:01:59.530> the<00:02:00.009> steering

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
you've been now as usual the steering

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.960 
you've been now as usual the steering
with<00:02:00.579> BMWs<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.420> spot-on<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:03.369> accurate<00:02:03.610> its

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
with BMWs is spot-on it's accurate its

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.359 
with BMWs is spot-on it's accurate its
agile<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:05.380> just<00:02:05.679> responds<00:02:06.280> immediately

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
agile and it just responds immediately

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.130 
agile and it just responds immediately
this<00:02:07.259> ever<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:08.619> slight<00:02:09.600> lag<00:02:10.600> there<00:02:10.929> in<00:02:11.049> the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
this ever so slight lag there in the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.809 
this ever so slight lag there in the
steering<00:02:11.620> wheel<00:02:11.860> which<00:02:12.160> surprises<00:02:12.790> me

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
steering wheel which surprises me

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.270 
steering wheel which surprises me
actually<00:02:13.319> it's<00:02:14.319> not<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.860> turn<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
actually it's not like I turn the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.559 
actually it's not like I turn the
steering<00:02:15.489> wear<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.880> wheels<00:02:16.060> immediately

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
steering wear on the wheels immediately
