it looks normal but look where he makes

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.450 
it looks normal but look where he makes
impact<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:44.870> look<00:00:45.050> where<00:00:45.230> I<00:00:45.260> am<00:00:45.620> I'm<00:00:46.250> not

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
impact and look where I am I'm not

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.240 
impact and look where I am I'm not
jumping<00:00:47.270> far<00:00:47.629> enough<00:00:47.870> into<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.260> court<00:00:48.590> it's

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
jumping far enough into the court it's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.780 
jumping far enough into the court it's
probably<00:00:49.610> short<00:00:49.940> by<00:00:50.180> about<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.720> step<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:51.830> I'm

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
probably short by about a step and I'm

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.850 
probably short by about a step and I'm
not<00:00:52.940> getting<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:53.390> as<00:00:53.540> fast<00:00:53.870> as<00:00:54.110> possible<00:00:54.680> so

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
not getting in as fast as possible so

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
the air and come to net but a lot of

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.640 
the air and come to net but a lot of
times<00:01:38.000> baseliners<00:01:38.630> don't<00:01:39.049> volley<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.409> well

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
times baseliners don't volley that well

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.190 
times baseliners don't volley that well
and<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:39.860> was<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:40.040> bit<00:01:40.190> tough<00:01:40.400> volley<00:01:40.930> this<00:01:41.930> is

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
and that was a bit tough volley this is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.180 
and that was a bit tough volley this is
a<00:01:42.260> bad<00:01:42.590> shot<00:01:43.000> I'm<00:01:44.000> trying<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.450> run<00:01:44.630> him<00:01:45.070> but<00:01:46.070> all

that happens is I'm going to his
forehand<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.380> is<00:01:48.470> another<00:01:48.680> problem

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950

it for him hits a really good roller

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.420 
it for him hits a really good roller
here<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.650> now<00:02:06.799> I'm<00:02:06.920> just<00:02:06.950> playing<00:02:07.250> defense

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.270 
end so I'm putting to the weaker side
ideally<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.019> want<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.350> run<00:02:15.560> him<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:16.130> won't

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
ideally you want to run him you won't

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.860 
ideally you want to run him you won't
play<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.430> corner<00:02:16.850> but<00:02:16.970> he's<00:02:17.090> lefty<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:17.630> can't

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
play a corner but he's lefty so I can't

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.319 
play a corner but he's lefty so I can't
for<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.110> corner<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.610> now<00:02:19.730> I'm<00:02:19.880> just<00:02:20.000> playing

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
for the corner so now I'm just playing

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.040 
for the corner so now I'm just playing
defense<00:02:20.510> again

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
defense again

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.470 
defense again
if<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.470> see<00:02:24.709> this<00:02:25.040> on<00:02:25.370> my<00:02:25.670> side<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.150> see<00:02:26.269> I'm

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
if you see this on my side you see I'm

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.420 
if you see this on my side you see I'm
basically<00:02:27.110> totally<00:02:27.890> on<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.010> defense<00:02:28.310> I'm

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
basically totally on the defense I'm

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.009 
basically totally on the defense I'm
backing<00:02:28.760> off<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.000> baseline<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.750> as<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
backing off the baseline you as the

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.170 
backing off the baseline you as the
attacker<00:02:30.319> must<00:02:30.560> come<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.769> net<00:02:30.950> another<00:02:31.940> good

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
attacker must come to net another good

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.449 
attacker must come to net another good
shot<00:02:32.450> I'm<00:02:32.690> totally<00:02:33.080> struggling<00:02:33.620> I'm<00:02:34.250> just<00:02:34.370> in

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
shot I'm totally struggling I'm just in

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.750

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
the ball back come to the net cuz you

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.670 
the ball back come to the net cuz you
would<00:02:37.849> get<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.000> pretty<00:02:38.330> easy<00:02:38.690> volley<00:02:39.049> this<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.530> a

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
would get a pretty easy volley this is a

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.309 
would get a pretty easy volley this is a
pretty<00:02:40.010> easy<00:02:40.099> volley<00:02:40.720> but<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.810> let<00:02:41.959> bounce

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
pretty easy volley but you let bounce

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.030 
pretty easy volley but you let bounce
you<00:02:42.410> play<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.590> forehand

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
you play the forehand

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.800 
you play the forehand
that's<00:02:43.220> good<00:02:43.580> tennis<00:02:43.879> and<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.120> go<00:02:44.390> back<00:02:44.629> to<00:02:44.720> my

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
that's good tennis and you go back to my

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.500 
that's good tennis and you go back to my
backhand<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.129> you<00:02:46.190> basically<00:02:46.430> hit<00:02:46.849> four<00:02:47.209> good

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
backhand so you basically hit four good

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.770 
backhand so you basically hit four good
shots<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.650> can't<00:02:48.920> do<00:02:49.040> anything<00:02:49.780> when

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
shots and I can't do anything when

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.539 
shots and I can't do anything when
you're<00:02:50.959> on<00:02:51.110> defense<00:02:51.319> like<00:02:51.650> this<00:02:51.769> throw<00:02:52.280> the

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
you're on defense like this throw the

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.729 
you're on defense like this throw the
LOB<00:02:52.760> if<00:02:53.209> they<00:02:53.360> come<00:02:53.569> in<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.870> hair<00:02:54.019> body<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.590> be

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
LOB if they come in the hair body so be

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.920

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
it I've been on defense for most of this

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.500 
it I've been on defense for most of this
point<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:59.260> like<00:03:00.879> ironically<00:03:01.879> my<00:03:02.180> D<00:03:02.239> has<00:03:02.480> a

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
point and like ironically my D has a

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.290 
point and like ironically my D has a
shot<00:03:02.750> wins<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.079> point
