00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
view at the stage as well so except for

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.460

that<00:00:31.679> we've<00:00:31.800> talked<00:00:32.070> about<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.550> I'd<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that we've talked about that I'd like to

I<00:01:31.220> don't<00:01:32.220> think<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.759> any<00:01:33.530> more<00:01:34.530> refer<00:01:34.890> them

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
I don't think we can any more refer them

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.340 
I don't think we can any more refer them
to<00:01:35.909> them<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:36.900> they're<00:01:37.049> not<00:01:37.200> an

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to them as they because they're not an

amorphous mass there are different
species<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.829> consequently<00:01:41.549> may<00:01:41.820> have

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
species and consequently may have

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.780 
species and consequently may have
different<00:01:42.780> agendas<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> don't<00:01:43.680> think<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.640> can

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
different agendas I don't think we can

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.670 
different agendas I don't think we can
say<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> they<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> same<00:01:46.259> agenda

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
say that they all have the same agenda

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.230 
say that they all have the same agenda

any more than that we could say that the

the same agenda our real interests may
be<00:01:54.000> very<00:01:54.360> similar<00:01:55.340> but<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:56.759> our
