that power drain in case someone decides
to<00:00:53.940> charge<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> upper<00:00:55.199> hand

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
to charge you so you have the upper hand

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.020 
to charge you so you have the upper hand
also<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.719> you're<00:00:58.710> playing<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.460> RS<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.940> not

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
also if you're playing in a RS and not

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760 
also if you're playing in a RS and not
be<00:01:00.239> ours<00:01:00.449> you'll<00:01:01.020> always<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> upper

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
be ours you'll always have the upper

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.670 
be ours you'll always have the upper
hand<00:01:01.920> because<00:01:02.570> chances<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.290> only<00:01:04.409> time

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
hand because chances are the only time

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
hand because chances are the only time
people<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> go<00:01:05.339> after<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.450> when

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
people are going to go after you is when

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.109 
people are going to go after you is when
they<00:01:06.780> spawn<00:01:07.110> near<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.760> they<00:01:08.880> just

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
they spawn near you and if they just

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.700 
they spawn near you and if they just
spawned<00:01:09.390> they're<00:01:09.570> not<00:01:09.720> gonna<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.020> BR<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.590> if

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
spawned they're not gonna have BR and if

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.500 
spawned they're not gonna have BR and if
you're<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.189> BR<00:01:11.610> versus<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.119> are<00:01:12.299> you're

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
you're going BR versus they are you're

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.249 
you're going BR versus they are you're
probably<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.080> win<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:15.750> almost<00:01:15.869> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
probably going to win so it's almost a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.550 
probably going to win so it's almost a
foolproof<00:01:17.070> strategy<00:01:18.049> it's<00:01:19.049> really<00:01:19.350> really

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
foolproof strategy it's really really

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.649 
foolproof strategy it's really really
easy<00:01:20.060> um<00:01:21.979> I'm<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.189> playing<00:01:23.490> gods<00:01:23.790> or<00:01:24.180> three
