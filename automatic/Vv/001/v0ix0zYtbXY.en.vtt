00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
although I'm sure everybody has seen it

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.680 
although I'm sure everybody has seen it
it's<00:05:08.640> just<00:05:08.940> a<00:05:09.060> 90-second<00:05:09.870> video<00:05:11.300> it<00:05:12.300> doesn't

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
it's just a 90-second video it doesn't

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.200 
it's just a 90-second video it doesn't
really<00:05:12.780> do<00:05:13.200> much<00:05:13.230> it<00:05:13.830> just<00:05:14.010> um<00:05:14.310> search<00:05:15.030> and

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
really do much it just um search and

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.960 
really do much it just um search and
destroy<00:05:15.390> it<00:05:16.020> just<00:05:16.230> talks<00:05:16.440> about<00:05:16.740> masks<00:05:17.370> really

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
destroy it just talks about masks really

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.250 
destroy it just talks about masks really
and<00:05:18.650> then<00:05:19.650> I<00:05:19.770> DeAngelis<00:05:20.510> some<00:05:21.510> guy<00:05:21.690> pulls<00:05:22.050> the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
and then I DeAngelis some guy pulls the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.850 
and then I DeAngelis some guy pulls the
mask<00:05:22.470> over<00:05:22.950> his<00:05:23.010> head<00:05:23.280> but<00:05:23.960> I<00:05:24.960> guess<00:05:25.560> that's

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
mask over his head but I guess that's

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.130 
mask over his head but I guess that's
the<00:05:25.950> main<00:05:26.220> character<00:05:26.820> I<00:05:27.030> don't<00:05:27.780> know<00:05:27.870> who<00:05:28.050> it

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
the main character I don't know who it

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.050 
the main character I don't know who it
is<00:05:28.260> doesn't<00:05:28.950> look<00:05:29.010> familiar<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.520> me<00:05:29.640> but<00:05:29.790> I

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
is doesn't look familiar to me but I

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.250 
is doesn't look familiar to me but I
don't<00:05:30.300> really<00:05:30.390> pay<00:05:30.630> attention<00:05:30.660> to<00:05:31.170> the

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
don't really pay attention to the

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.540 
don't really pay attention to the
characters<00:05:31.710> so

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.649
