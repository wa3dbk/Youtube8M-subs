 in the mid 70's 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.870

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.870
 80 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.620

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.750

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.360
 imaginative models as they will be given 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.300
 account are not based on any in 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.250
 no model real life rather 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.350
 they are cars that have a lot of imagination 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.560
 how can you see the design of the frog 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.550
 renÃ© looks like a flap of looks like a 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.190
 frog letter 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.230
 the animal truck has its distinctive 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.870
 Wait chain surrounds like chain 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.640
 that surrounds the animal's neck and so that 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.800
 I can tell you of joy is as long as 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.650
 the nose of the gonzo himself 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.200
 and within another series also of this 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.920
 imagination of this series imagination of 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.760

 sponge and make your best friend calamardo 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.079
 As I repeat, they are not vehicles based 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.390
 in some real model they are rather 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.250
 vehicles to which the designers 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.280
 he has put a lot of imagination they have given 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.170
 finishes or shapes to resemble or 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.360
 remember the characters 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.220
 Within this same collection are the 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.569
 high d 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.690
 that they represent Mr. Crab and 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.150
 apart and its star 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.770
 There is a seedling to saplings in fact this 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.530
 collection in particular include the 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.360
 three models that would be calamargo 'bob 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.970
 sponge 'and plant saplings not what 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.690
 we have at this time but it is also 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.420
 a very showy and good model bob 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.280
 sponge is one of the hormones not 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.800
 we can say that it is the most 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.550
 successful that nickelodeon has had since 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.330
 that exists with more than 13 years of 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.870
 uninterrupted and good production 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.239
 been this one 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.540
 It was created by the stephen biologist 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.340
 hillenburg a marine biologist who in 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.489
 instead of wanting to do a series like 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.860
 to educate the children and take them to 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.470
 learn more about marine life the oei 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.570
 he wanted to make a 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.740
 or silly considering that the 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.500
 children who are interested is 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.190
 have fun and good little sponge has been 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.070
 a great success since then already with his 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.740
 seasons of the series his movie 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.050
 as well 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.260
 many of the animators that work or 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.260
 that produces the episodes of bob sponja 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.870
 Believe it or not, they have worked on this 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.610
 animated series called ren and 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.000
 stimpy one of the most animations 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.960
 grotesque and visceral that the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.030
 mtv 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.700
 remember that nickelodeon and mtv are from 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.070
 the same corporation so that's not 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.110
 to surprise anyone these models 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.230
 They are designed for the collector 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.200
 adult are totally made in metal 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.260
 and well, it does not open any 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.130
 Adding either trunk door 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.060
 absolutely nothing but they are very 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.950
 fun for 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.540
 and to begin a collection that 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.540
 leave the regular parameters
