00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
what I've done I hope that key club will

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.220 
what I've done I hope that key club will
be<00:02:26.500> very<00:02:27.400> much<00:02:27.640> expanded<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.300> numbers<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.750> would

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
be very much expanded in numbers I would

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.270 
be very much expanded in numbers I would
love<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.410> see<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> lot<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:29.860> international

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.800 
love to see a lot of international
growth<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.940> think<00:02:31.060> there's<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.630> lot<00:02:31.660> of

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
growth I think there's a lot of

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.949 
growth I think there's a lot of
possibility<00:02:32.620> there<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:34.390> i<00:02:34.420> also<00:02:34.600> like<00:02:34.780> to

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
possibility there and but i also like to

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.290 
possibility there and but i also like to
say<00:02:35.200> just<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.500> quality<00:02:36.310> experience<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.270> each

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.330 
say just the quality experience for each
member<00:02:37.600> i<00:02:37.870> think<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.290> sometimes<00:02:38.800> we<00:02:39.100> can

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
member i think that sometimes we can

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.880 
member i think that sometimes we can
focus<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.239> lot<00:02:40.360> on<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.600> international<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.590> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
focus a lot on the international and the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.260 
focus a lot on the international and the
numbers<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.610> that's<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.910> know<00:02:42.940> those<00:02:43.150> are

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
numbers and that's you know those are

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.360 
numbers and that's you know those are
very<00:02:43.570> important<00:02:43.989> things<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:44.590> if<00:02:44.830> we<00:02:45.250> don't

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
very important things but if we don't

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.090 
very important things but if we don't
really<00:02:46.269> enhance<00:02:46.989> that<00:02:47.260> quality<00:02:47.650> experience
