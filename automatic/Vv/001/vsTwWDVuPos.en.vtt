00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.210
 Austrian has been in the country for 20 years 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.869
 renn circus active countless times he stood 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.869
 on the podium 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:31.590
 1993 at home my front door then some 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.020
 been highlights as well as a German 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.930
 Master title tens of times Austrian 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.380
 master title and best privateer in 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.120
 the superbike wm andy meklau is one 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.280
 fighter he can not be beaten down 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.360
 He remembers the blackest day 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.720
 his career 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.060
 that one needs me 1997 the final to 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.890
 great championship and has one 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.270
 intended vibration and have since 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.990
 really three months actually then 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.150
 Hospital spent beautiful 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.560
 comeback celebrated 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.340
 1998 and must first German 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.220
 become master 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.939
 today he must not go far to the limit 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.939
 play 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.829
 with the absolute gsx r 600 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.740
 Yes 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.030
 the 600 class is fiercely competitive here 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.520
 it is about absolute perfection, the 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.710
 magic formula is torque and accurate 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.570
 then the susi has gained the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.240
 Peak performance of the Japanese lies behind 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.119
 as before at 125 ps at one 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.740
 dry weight of 163 kilograms andy 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.170
 Meklau is very satisfied 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.270
 extremely revving and also very easy 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.310
 to drive you just notice that weight 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.149
 from this motorcycle and also a lot 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.429
 performance for falcon monday starts at 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.000
 3000 that it already nice 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.280
 drive 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.649
 that is to say of curves with the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.909
 Vertex does not go from the gas 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.539
 very nice 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.360
 and if I'm constantly too 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.849
 the fourth super 10,000 so the area 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.459
 Markets that are reminiscent of 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.689
 Tachometer somewhere at 16,000 and 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.510
 sagan red area 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:24.650
 that has a huge 3 band and that 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.650
 torque ideal 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.300
 unlike some competitors wears 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.010
 the gsx r600 the end silencer 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.780
 persistently on the side of a pipe that way 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.570
 not at all to the petite silhouette of the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.560
 bikes fits why no one else sees 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.480
 exhaust system 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.010
 we ask for 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.100
 The man tried the supersportler 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.650
 Naturally 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.430
 the best for the race track 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.340
 to get a motorcycle out 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.680
 and there it is completely unfavorable if 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.390
 the heaviest part of the engine to the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.460
 set highest point of the motorcycle 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.360
 that's actually gif for the handling 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.160
 and 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.530
 other motorcycle is pretty good though 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.100
 certainly not for the motorcycle itself 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.260
 advantageous 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.410
 Andy's machine is usually 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.480
 a gsx r1000 now interested us 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.550
 Of course what a 600 can do what 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.120
 Thousands can not be one is not 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.010
 I have to overstrain a normal 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.020
 driver on the street or on the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.750
 race track already a certain experience 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.850
 have and that is very much with this 600 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.560
 easy one has a lot of fun with this 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.190
 motor without a big risk 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.190
 received 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.590
 Andy Meklau is still profi 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.210
 racer 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.800
 but he is already thinking about it 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.800
 the time after the active career 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.379
 stay free racing and I have 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.390
 a big project currently in hungary am 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.090
 pannoniaring dearest a motor 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.650
 sports center and thereby one the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.950
 next few years the future 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.950
 dedicate
