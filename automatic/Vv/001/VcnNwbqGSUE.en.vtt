00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
this collection but I thought it would

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899

to<00:03:49.959> have<00:03:50.200> one<00:03:50.890> of<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.549> eyeshadows<00:03:52.209> this<00:03:52.569> is

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
to have one of the eyeshadows this is

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.890 
to have one of the eyeshadows this is
bao<00:03:53.290> gray<00:03:53.790> really<00:03:54.790> pretty<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:55.209> like<00:03:55.569> Grey's<00:03:55.870> a

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
bao gray really pretty I like Grey's a

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.320 
bao gray really pretty I like Grey's a
lot<00:03:56.200> because<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:56.769> feel<00:03:56.950> like<00:03:56.980> they're<00:03:57.310> kind<00:03:58.209> of

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
lot because I feel like they're kind of

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.839 
lot because I feel like they're kind of
easier<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.810> work<00:03:58.959> with<00:03:59.019> than<00:03:59.500> black<00:04:00.250> sometimes

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
easier to work with than black sometimes

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.490 
easier to work with than black sometimes
I<00:04:01.319> put<00:04:02.319> this<00:04:02.470> next<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:03.030> copper<00:04:04.030> plate<00:04:04.330> and<00:04:04.720> I

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
I put this next to copper plate and I

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.600 
I put this next to copper plate and I
thought<00:04:05.680> they<00:04:05.799> would<00:04:05.950> be<00:04:05.980> similar<00:04:06.280> they're

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
thought they would be similar they're

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.610 
thought they would be similar they're
really<00:04:06.909> not<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.540> one<00:04:07.750> definitely<00:04:07.989> has<00:04:08.290> more

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
really not this one definitely has more

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.220 
really not this one definitely has more
of<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.829> grain<00:04:09.280> cast<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.209> so<00:04:10.659> I<00:04:10.690> think<00:04:10.930> it's

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
of a grain cast to it so I think it's

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.220 
of a grain cast to it so I think it's
pretty<00:04:11.409> unique<00:04:11.709> I<00:04:12.510> thought<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.659> packaging<00:04:14.110> on

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
pretty unique I thought the packaging on

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.690 
pretty unique I thought the packaging on
the<00:04:14.349> eyeshadows<00:04:14.829> was<00:04:14.950> kind<00:04:15.190> of<00:04:15.280> neat<00:04:15.489> just

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
the eyeshadows was kind of neat just

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.759 
the eyeshadows was kind of neat just
because<00:04:16.000> each<00:04:16.209> one<00:04:16.389> had<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.600> different<00:04:16.769> flower

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
because each one had a different flower

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.860 
because each one had a different flower
on<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.130> different<00:04:18.729> color<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.690> other

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
on a different color the other

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.870 
on a different color the other
eyeshadows<00:04:20.139> they<00:04:21.040> had<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:22.380> famous<00:04:23.380> desire

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
eyeshadows they had a famous desire

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.790 
eyeshadows they had a famous desire
which<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.180> think<00:04:25.840> came<00:04:26.050> out<00:04:26.229> with<00:04:26.410> Dame<00:04:26.620> Edna

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
which I think came out with Dame Edna

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.850 
which I think came out with Dame Edna
it's<00:04:27.580> this<00:04:27.760> purple<00:04:28.240> color<00:04:28.470> pretty<00:04:29.470> much<00:04:29.680> the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
it's this purple color pretty much the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.740 
it's this purple color pretty much the
exact<00:04:30.220> same<00:04:30.460> as<00:04:30.820> satellite<00:04:31.300> dreams<00:04:31.690> so<00:04:32.229> man

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
exact same as satellite dreams so man

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.560 
exact same as satellite dreams so man
