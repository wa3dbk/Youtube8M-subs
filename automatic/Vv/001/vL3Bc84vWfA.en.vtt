00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.510
 so be all three so the bets to animate it yahoo 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.250
 we will end up 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.649
 to witness the birth to characters is 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.649
 besides a silo 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.659
 it is alcohol is involved in this work 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.619
 if she is not cold 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.099
 it's annoying but for 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.750
 but this proud sum 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.149
 try 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.429
 many things he says it's an order forbidding the initiation 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.250
 it's a united states 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.070
 b 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.430
 for that he passed in five points 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.000
 for her part she is inventing herself about a story I make 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.380
 35 hours with age the scene was blowing 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.830
 and it will be cold 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.680
 so it's pretty natural liquefied 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.620
 I hope you like it 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
 here 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.740
 my father 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.410
 the final 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.820
 in this place 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.820
 2 9% previously 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.780
 in the world 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 still 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.010
 Why 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.560
 still 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.060
 among my father's guests 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.430
 no matter 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.430
 1:30 p.m. 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 mm 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.280

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
 published 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:21.189
 minimal 1 the busy person has died but two characters 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.389
 it was the first expertise for whom it will be the source 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:34.209
 it is actually a risk history report and up from 1 5% in 2011 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.169
 I'm touched 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.249
 I already have a funny character 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:43.059
 then come the sectors 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.389
 the Sunni militias 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.990
 if doctors worry about not being able to 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.429
 a ceasefire 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.429
 for some more 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.189
 Saturday 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.109
 she adds m 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.799

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.799
 2 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.279
 a long time but no 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.759
 Despite him 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:51.739
 There you go
