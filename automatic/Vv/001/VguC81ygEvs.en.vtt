00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.040
 the bioclimatic architecture consists of 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.559
 the design of buildings taking into 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.549
 account weather conditions 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.770
 taking advantage of natural resources 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.230
 available to reduce the impacts 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.750
 environmental initiatives trying to reduce 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.800
 Energy consumption using materials 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.800
 last generation 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.310
 biojÃ³ has set me up its 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.289
 pilot experience in lanzarote the island 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.630
 reserve of the biosphere with a 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.699
 l-shaped construction based on the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.730
 traditional architecture of lanzarote la 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.570
 house is one where the shortest side 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.140
 it is the north and the longest side of the 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.739
 is the celestial is to say all the wind 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.110
 predominant throughout the year which are the 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.500
 trade winds always come from the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.870
 back of the house following the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.760
 bioclimatic philosophy bio home has 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.679
 built this house with materials 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.570
 that do not consume resources of the island 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.699
 built with three containers 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.250
 maritime that constitute the skeleton 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.350
 of the property these containers do not 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.929
 they support directly on the ground some 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.539
 shoes elevate it leaving a cavity 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:14.500
 Useful and easily accessible for the framework 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.500
 Plumbing and electricity 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.190
 once the structure is firmly anchored 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.290
 that will shape the housing is coated 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.600
 with polyurethane sprayed in order to 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.430
 waterproof isolate thermally and 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.430
 acoustically condition the property 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.450
 the facade and the roof are ventilated 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.149
 on the facade of the building anchors 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.640
 a substructure designed to support 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.770
 the outer finishing sheet as well as a 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.079
 insulation layer the substructure 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.850
 leave an air chamber in the 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.819
 insulation and finishing plates 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.530
 allowing the air flow this we 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.390
 allows to be cool in summer and 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.240
 save the heat in winter although the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.189
 outside temperature is very low 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.170
 a bioclimatic dwelling can 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.239
 get great savings and even 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.459
 become fully sustainable 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.030
 has been implanted 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.890
 a lot of renewable energies for the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.940
 sanitary hot water all the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.099
 lighting was only with plates 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.989
 photovoltaic also housing 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.420
 Take advantage of rainwater and even 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.670
 of dew for your use of the system 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.700
 the toilets generating a remarkable saving 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.040
 in the tanks and bring the bomb one 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.910
 submerged pump what we do is 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.670
 contain that noise in the water and what 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.769
 which makes cushion and is a contribution 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.080
 to have a house also at a sound level 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.330
 quite optimal the interior of the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.640
 housing maintains the comfort and luxury of 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.920
 details the floors are chlorine rubber 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.360
 material created with the recovery of 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.700
 the debris from the roofs of the 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.100
 vehicles and offering a high 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.750
 impermeability 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.450
 thinking about the maximum use 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.060
 of the interior space bio home has created 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.340
 a system of non-invasive windows 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.020
 the end result is a house 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.440
 bioclimatic of energy efficiency 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.900
 with a healthier house category 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.910
 and comfortable for its occupants and more 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.300
 Respectful and in accordance with the environment 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.300
 ambient
