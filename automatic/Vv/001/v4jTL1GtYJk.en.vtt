your<00:03:00.330> eye<00:03:00.540> contact<00:03:01.050> with<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.320> property

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
your eye contact with the property

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.990 
your eye contact with the property
because<00:03:01.830> your<00:03:01.950> eyes<00:03:02.100> may<00:03:02.370> have<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.550> tendency<00:03:02.970> to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
because your eyes may have a tendency to

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.820 
because your eyes may have a tendency to
track<00:03:03.330> left<00:03:03.540> or<00:03:03.690> right<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.290> your<00:03:04.530> reading<00:03:04.740> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
track left or right is your reading the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.990 
track left or right is your reading the
copy<00:03:05.010> because<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.430> see<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:05.700> still<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
copy because you see it's still the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.820 
copy because you see it's still the
screen<00:03:06.330> though<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.110> text<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.440> gone<00:03:07.620> now

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
screen though the text is gone now

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.140 
screen though the text is gone now
alright<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.550> those<00:03:08.670> are<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.880> couple<00:03:09.090> of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
alright so those are the couple of

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.100 
alright so those are the couple of
things<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.390> have<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.540> practice<00:03:09.900> reading

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
things you have to practice reading

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.750 
things you have to practice reading
naturally<00:03:10.710> sounding<00:03:11.130> like<00:03:11.250> yourself<00:03:11.640> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
naturally sounding like yourself and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.400 
naturally sounding like yourself and
then<00:03:12.120> making<00:03:12.330> sure<00:03:12.510> your<00:03:12.630> eyes<00:03:12.840> are<00:03:13.140> staying

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
then making sure your eyes are staying

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.050 
then making sure your eyes are staying
focused<00:03:13.860> on<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.130> lens<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.580> camera<00:03:14.610> that

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
focused on the lens of the camera that

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.400 
focused on the lens of the camera that
they're<00:03:15.300> not<00:03:15.420> tracking<00:03:15.690> back<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.170> forth

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
they're not tracking back and forth

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.199 
they're not tracking back and forth
alright<00:03:16.950> but<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.250> prompter<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:17.910> great

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
alright but a prompter is a great

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.000 
alright but a prompter is a great
solution<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:19.110> know<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.470> put<00:03:19.590> your

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
solution you know you just put your

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.010 
solution you know you just put your
camera<00:03:20.489> right<00:03:20.970> behind<00:03:21.270> in<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.600> little<00:03:21.840> area

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
camera right behind in this little area

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.510 
camera right behind in this little area
here<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.410> you're<00:03:22.650> reading<00:03:22.860> right<00:03:23.220> into<00:03:23.400> the
