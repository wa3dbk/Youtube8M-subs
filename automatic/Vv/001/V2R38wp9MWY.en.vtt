00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.130 
usually get any hair off of the wefts I
did<00:04:08.460> however<00:04:09.180> still<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.660> left's<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:09.990> this

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
did however still the left's of this

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.830 
did however still the left's of this
hair<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.620> ran<00:04:11.490> out<00:04:11.640> of<00:04:11.670> what<00:04:12.000> sealer<00:04:12.360> so<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:12.660> think

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
hair I ran out of what sealer so I think

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.380 
hair I ran out of what sealer so I think
the<00:04:13.230> 14<00:04:13.680> inch<00:04:13.890> is<00:04:14.190> not<00:04:14.520> all<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.910> way<00:04:15.030> sealed

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
the 14 inch is not all the way sealed

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.740 
the 14 inch is not all the way sealed
and<00:04:16.070> maybe<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.220> 16<00:04:17.640> inch<00:04:17.850> but<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.210> 18<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.570> 20

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
and maybe the 16 inch but the 18 and 20

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.750 
and maybe the 16 inch but the 18 and 20
I<00:04:18.989> believe<00:04:19.320> both<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.920> still<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.580> left

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
I believe both I still the left

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.760 
I believe both I still the left
completely<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.390> those<00:04:21.570> two<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.350> haven't

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
completely on those two so I haven't

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.010

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
I work on a consistent basis which by

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.800 
I work on a consistent basis which by
the<00:05:04.610> way<00:05:04.789> guys<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.150> have<00:05:05.330> been<00:05:05.509> wearing<00:05:05.750> the

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
the way guys I have been wearing the

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.279 
the way guys I have been wearing the
league<00:05:05.960> on<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.080> consistent<00:05:06.409> basis<00:05:07.000> so<00:05:08.139> yeah<00:05:09.139> I'm

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
league on a consistent basis so yeah I'm

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.760 
league on a consistent basis so yeah I'm
getting<00:05:09.560> really<00:05:09.740> used<00:05:09.919> to<00:05:10.130> it<00:05:10.310> now<00:05:11.740> but<00:05:12.740> I

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
getting really used to it now but I

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.270 
getting really used to it now but I
think<00:05:12.860> that's<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:14.120> guess<00:05:14.620> like<00:05:15.620> I<00:05:15.770> said<00:05:16.069> I

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
think that's it I guess like I said I

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.219 
think that's it I guess like I said I
don't<00:05:17.030> have<00:05:17.180> shedding<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:17.810> tangling

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
excessively it doesn't tangle it just

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.809 
excessively it doesn't tangle it just
isn't<00:05:20.990> table<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:21.530> I<00:05:21.680> don't<00:05:21.710> have<00:05:22.400> shedding

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
isn't table and I don't have shedding

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.930 
isn't table and I don't have shedding
excessively<00:05:23.330> I<00:05:23.449> should<00:05:23.750> say<00:05:24.039> my<00:05:25.039> hair<00:05:25.310> just

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
anybody who's curious and hasn't watched

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:29.499 
anybody who's curious and hasn't watched
new<00:05:28.130> previous<00:05:28.460> videos<00:05:28.729> I<00:05:28.789> have<00:05:28.909> not<00:05:29.090> died<00:05:29.300> this

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
new previous videos I have not died this

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.110 
new previous videos I have not died this
hair<00:05:29.720> or<00:05:29.900> process<00:05:30.289> -<00:05:30.440> anyway<00:05:31.009> the<00:05:31.729> only<00:05:31.969> thing

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
hair or process - anyway the only thing

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.060 
hair or process - anyway the only thing
I've<00:05:32.240> done<00:05:32.509> that<00:05:33.199> might<00:05:33.409> affect<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.860> hair

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
I've done that might affect the hair

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.370 
I've done that might affect the hair
mostly<00:05:34.580> is<00:05:34.789> the<00:05:34.940> fact<00:05:35.180> that<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.630> I<00:05:36.349> do<00:05:37.090> curl<00:05:38.090> it

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
mostly is the fact that I I do curl it

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.029 
mostly is the fact that I I do curl it
but<00:05:39.380> I<00:05:39.409> normally<00:05:39.860> use

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
but I normally use

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.909 
but I normally use
Tresemme<00:05:40.669> heat<00:05:40.699> protector<00:05:41.360> before<00:05:42.139> I<00:05:42.380> curl<00:05:42.770> it

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
Tresemme heat protector before I curl it

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.730 
Tresemme heat protector before I curl it
um<00:05:43.400> also<00:05:44.389> when<00:05:44.750> I<00:05:44.780> curl<00:05:44.870> the<00:05:45.199> hair<00:05:45.380> after<00:05:45.710> I

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
um also when I curl the hair after I

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.499 
um also when I curl the hair after I
curl<00:05:46.039> it<00:05:46.070> it's<00:05:46.280> so<00:05:46.520> much<00:05:46.729> hair<00:05:46.969> sometimes<00:05:47.360> the

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
curl it it's so much hair sometimes the

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:48.909 
curl it it's so much hair sometimes the
curls<00:05:47.750> start<00:05:47.990> to<00:05:48.080> fall<00:05:48.259> before<00:05:48.440> I'm<00:05:48.650> done<00:05:48.800> with

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
curls start to fall before I'm done with

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.680 
curls start to fall before I'm done with
the<00:05:48.979> other<00:05:49.039> side<00:05:49.310> so<00:05:49.909> a<00:05:49.940> lot<00:05:50.180> of<00:05:50.300> times<00:05:50.479> I'll

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
the other side so a lot of times I'll

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.689 
the other side so a lot of times I'll
curl<00:05:51.110> it<00:05:51.320> and<00:05:51.500> then<00:05:51.680> I<00:05:51.770> put<00:05:51.949> it<00:05:52.039> in<00:05:52.159> flexi<00:05:52.520> rods

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
curl it and then I put it in flexi rods

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.249 
curl it and then I put it in flexi rods
to<00:05:52.849> kind<00:05:53.030> of<00:05:53.090> hold<00:05:53.300> it<00:05:53.419> while<00:05:53.599> I<00:05:53.630> do<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.080> rest

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
to kind of hold it while I do the rest

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.409 
to kind of hold it while I do the rest
of<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.500> hair<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.860> then<00:05:55.370> let<00:05:55.550> it<00:05:55.639> all<00:05:55.759> out

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419

here for a while because I do plan on

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.820 
here for a while because I do plan on
like<00:06:07.009> I<00:06:07.130> said<00:06:07.310> making<00:06:07.520> a<00:06:07.729> new<00:06:07.849> unit<00:06:08.419> and<00:06:08.830> I

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
like that but if I don't do any

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.749 
like that but if I don't do any
processing<00:06:23.630> on<00:06:24.110> it<00:06:24.289> which<00:06:24.800> I<00:06:24.949> honestly<00:06:25.280> don't

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
processing on it which I honestly don't

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.790 
processing on it which I honestly don't
know<00:06:25.940> that<00:06:26.120> I<00:06:26.150> will<00:06:26.419> but<00:06:27.229> if<00:06:27.319> I<00:06:27.380> don't<00:06:27.440> do<00:06:27.620> any
