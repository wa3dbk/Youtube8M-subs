the pain and then the QB stove will go

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.260 
the pain and then the QB stove will go
away<00:01:37.250> using<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.369> logic<00:01:38.549> maybe<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.119> should

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
away using that logic maybe you should
