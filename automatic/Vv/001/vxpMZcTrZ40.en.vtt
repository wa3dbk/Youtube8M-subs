pyramid to differentiate the planet from
the<00:01:45.780> pyramid<00:01:46.290> seeing<00:01:46.920> how<00:01:47.040> we're<00:01:47.250> using<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the pyramid seeing how we're using the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.999 
the pyramid seeing how we're using the
same<00:01:47.790> colors<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.210> textures<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.720> both<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.950> i

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
same colors and textures for both and i

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.280 
same colors and textures for both and i
also<00:01:50.159> put<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> small<00:01:50.840> plant<00:01:51.840> sense<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
also put a small plant sense on the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.499 
also put a small plant sense on the
outside<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.149> we're<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
outside of that we're going to do the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.810 
outside of that we're going to do the
same<00:01:54.659> thing<00:01:54.840> with<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.020> other<00:01:55.049> side<00:01:55.200> add<00:01:55.820> some

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
same thing with the other side add some

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.780 
same thing with the other side add some
black<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.240> shading<00:01:58.040> plant<00:01:59.040> stencil<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.610> then

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
black for shading plant stencil and then

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.219 
black for shading plant stencil and then
i'm<00:02:00.030> putting<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.869> outside<00:02:01.140> as

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
i'm putting that one on the outside as

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.300 
i'm putting that one on the outside as
well<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.009> fold<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
well so it's like if you fold the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.800 
well so it's like if you fold the
painting<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.640> half<00:02:02.820> your<00:02:03.090> planet<00:02:03.420> stencils

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
painting in half your planet stencils

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.109 
painting in half your planet stencils
would<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:04.590> match<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.640> with<00:02:05.759> each<00:02:05.909> other

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
would you know match up with each other

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.050 
would you know match up with each other
and<00:02:06.680> as<00:02:07.680> always<00:02:07.950> we're<00:02:08.220> covering<00:02:08.819> everything

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
and as always we're covering everything

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.460 
and as always we're covering everything
with<00:02:09.270> black<00:02:09.450> when<00:02:09.629> our<00:02:09.750> stencils<00:02:10.349> and

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
with black when our stencils and

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.490 
with black when our stencils and
everything<00:02:10.739> are<00:02:10.860> down<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.870> as<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.020> can<00:02:13.140> see<00:02:13.170> I

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
everything are down and as you can see I

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.910 
everything are down and as you can see I
mad

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
in quite a bit of pain and you know the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.170 
in quite a bit of pain and you know the
colors<00:02:17.130> just<00:02:17.280> aren't<00:02:17.670> really<00:02:17.849> wanting<00:02:18.120> to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
colors just aren't really wanting to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.240 
colors just aren't really wanting to
stay<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.020> why<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.349> rustoleum<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
stay this is why I like rustoleum the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.040 
stay this is why I like rustoleum the
colors<00:02:20.580> are<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.819> lot<00:02:21.000> more<00:02:21.030> vibrant<00:02:21.569> use<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.930> you

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
colors are a lot more vibrant use it you

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.540 
colors are a lot more vibrant use it you
actually<00:02:22.170> use<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> lot<00:02:22.770> less<00:02:22.800> pain<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.459> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
actually use a lot less pain so in the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.740 
actually use a lot less pain so in the
long<00:02:23.670> run<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.940> think<00:02:24.000> you're<00:02:24.239> actually<00:02:24.390> saving

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
long run I think you're actually saving

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.330 
long run I think you're actually saving
money<00:02:25.080> even<00:02:25.349> though<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.560> paint<00:02:25.770> cost<00:02:26.010> more

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
money even though the paint cost more

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.339 
money even though the paint cost more
and<00:02:26.580> that's<00:02:27.120> warmer<00:02:27.510> brand<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.959> doesn't<00:02:27.989> work

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
and that's warmer brand it doesn't work

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.610 
and that's warmer brand it doesn't work
with<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> poops<00:02:29.569> I<00:02:30.569> used<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.080> lot<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.319> pain<00:02:31.470> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
with the poops I used a lot of pain it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.540 
with the poops I used a lot of pain it
didn't<00:02:31.770> really<00:02:31.860> work<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.220> that's<00:02:32.280> where

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
didn't really work and that's where

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.590 
didn't really work and that's where
strolling<00:02:32.910> them<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:33.420> goes

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
strolling them and it just goes

shimmer like I just painted and this is

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.620 
shimmer like I just painted and this is
where<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.700> black<00:04:56.850> comes<00:04:57.120> in<00:04:57.270> then<00:04:57.390> we<00:04:57.480> lay

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
where the black comes in then we lay

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.140 
where the black comes in then we lay
down<00:04:57.810> for<00:04:58.110> our<00:04:58.260> base<00:04:58.620> coat<00:04:58.890> it's<00:04:59.850> going<00:05:00.090> to

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
down for our base coat it's going to

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.540 
down for our base coat it's going to
make<00:05:00.270> it's<00:05:00.570> a<00:05:00.750> kind<00:05:01.740> of<00:05:01.830> tie<00:05:01.980> everything<00:05:02.280> in

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
make it's a kind of tie everything in

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.910 
make it's a kind of tie everything in
together<00:05:02.670> so<00:05:03.030> it's<00:05:03.180> not<00:05:03.270> just<00:05:03.330> like<00:05:03.630> a<00:05:04.020> big

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920
