00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
other packets patterns provide it inside

00:00:48.329 --> 00:01:06.080 
other packets patterns provide it inside
so<00:00:48.690> let's<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.829> started<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:05.090> that

so let's get started so here is the that

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.390 
so let's get started so here is the that
step<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.869> got<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:07.890> spoon<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.400> packet

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
step I got one spoon you have a packet

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.470 
step I got one spoon you have a packet
of<00:01:11.520> cat<00:01:12.330> and

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
of cat and

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.560 
of cat and
cause<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:16.560> you'll<00:01:17.560> have<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.130> packet<00:01:18.700> lung<00:01:19.090> I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
cause so you'll have the packet lung I

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.760 
cause so you'll have the packet lung I
just<00:01:20.410> blew<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:21.220> then<00:01:21.970> pack<00:01:22.150> up<00:01:22.180> to<00:01:22.600> is<00:01:23.730> um<00:01:24.730> re
