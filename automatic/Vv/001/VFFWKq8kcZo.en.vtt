00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.220 

okay<00:04:11.460> let's<00:04:11.700> increase<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.240> tone<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.780> just

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
okay let's increase the tone to just

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:28.100 
okay let's increase the tone to just
below<00:04:13.500> halfway

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.600 

yeah<00:04:29.110> warm<00:04:29.530> sounding<00:04:29.980> this<00:04:30.100> is<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.370> max

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
yeah warm sounding this is the max

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:45.680 
yeah warm sounding this is the max
setting<00:04:30.940> of<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.150> time

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.510 

still<00:04:46.690> pretty<00:04:47.380> usable<00:04:47.620> because<00:04:47.980> it's<00:04:48.310> not

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
still pretty usable because it's not

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.460 
still pretty usable because it's not
shrill<00:04:48.970> sounding<00:04:49.450> on<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.990> higher<00:04:50.170> tone

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
shrill sounding on the higher tone

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.760 
shrill sounding on the higher tone
settings<00:04:51.120> just<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.330> quick<00:04:52.930> thing<00:04:53.140> if<00:04:53.410> you'll

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
settings just a quick thing if you'll

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:02.640 
settings just a quick thing if you'll
check<00:04:54.550> my<00:04:55.060> clean<00:04:55.990> signal<00:05:00.240> just<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:02.350> pedal

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
check my clean signal just to the pedal

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.500 
check my clean signal just to the pedal
doesn't<00:05:03.310> take<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.520> lot<00:05:03.730> of<00:05:03.880> low-end<00:05:04.000> just<00:05:04.420> a

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
doesn't take a lot of low-end just a

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.510 
doesn't take a lot of low-end just a
tiny<00:05:04.780> bit<00:05:07.620> but<00:05:08.620> that's<00:05:08.770> also<00:05:09.160> good<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:09.400> have

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
tiny bit but that's also good to have

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.630 
tiny bit but that's also good to have
because<00:05:10.170> to<00:05:11.170> cut<00:05:11.380> through<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.680> mix<00:05:11.860> it's<00:05:12.460> not

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
because to cut through the mix it's not
