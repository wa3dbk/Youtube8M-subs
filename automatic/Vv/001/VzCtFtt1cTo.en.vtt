00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
here's my personal list of the top 5

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:46.890 
here's my personal list of the top 5
worst<00:00:33.300> taking<00:00:33.840> care

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:57.090 

Oh

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.610 

sure<00:00:57.520> ogre<00:00:57.880> is<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.300> biggest<00:00:58.810> and<00:00:59.320> largest

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
sure ogre is the biggest and largest

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.710 
sure ogre is the biggest and largest
character<00:01:00.190> in<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.340> Tekken<00:01:00.640> series<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.570> I'm

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
character in the Tekken series and I'm

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.049 
character in the Tekken series and I'm
guessing<00:01:02.200> that<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.800> was<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:03.160> big<00:01:03.460> that<00:01:03.760> they

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
guessing that it was so big that they

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.550 
guessing that it was so big that they
couldn't<00:01:04.300> properly<00:01:04.570> add<00:01:04.839> in<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.050> background<00:01:05.440> of

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
couldn't properly add in a background of

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.130 
couldn't properly add in a background of
Tekken<00:01:05.830> 3<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:07.180> meaning<00:01:07.510> is<00:01:07.570> a<00:01:07.660> why<00:01:07.810> I<00:01:07.840> don't

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
Tekken 3 the meaning is a why I don't

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.230 
Tekken 3 the meaning is a why I don't
like<00:01:08.320> him<00:01:08.530> is<00:01:08.979> because<00:01:09.040> he's<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:09.580> big<00:01:09.910> that<00:01:10.180> you

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
like him is because he's so big that you

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.630 
like him is because he's so big that you
can't<00:01:10.479> see<00:01:10.660> his<00:01:10.750> moves<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:12.220> also<00:01:12.340> have<00:01:12.550> to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
can't see his moves you also have to

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.160 
can't see his moves you also have to
make<00:01:12.760> adjustments<00:01:12.880> during<00:01:13.360> your<00:01:13.540> combo<00:01:13.869> so<00:01:14.050> it

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
make adjustments during your combo so it

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.370 
make adjustments during your combo so it
doesn't<00:01:14.440> do<00:01:14.530> that<00:01:14.680> short<00:01:15.070> fly<00:01:15.310> out<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:17.080> the
