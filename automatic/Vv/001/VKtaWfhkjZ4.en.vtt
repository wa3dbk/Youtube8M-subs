this<00:00:33.860> one<00:00:34.040> is<00:00:34.160> plugged<00:00:34.430> into<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:37.750> oxygen

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
this one is plugged into the the oxygen

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.630 
this one is plugged into the the oxygen

number<00:00:40.760> one<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:42.309> this<00:00:43.309> one<00:00:43.809> is<00:00:44.809> just<00:00:45.470> just

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
number one and this one is just just

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
number one and this one is just just
wired<00:00:46.550> out<00:00:46.730> through<00:00:46.940> vacuum<00:00:48.130> so<00:00:49.130> we're<00:00:50.090> going

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
wired out through vacuum so we're going

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.960 
wired out through vacuum so we're going
to<00:00:50.570> just<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.200> little<00:00:51.410> demonstration<00:00:51.970> the

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
to just a little demonstration the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.670 
to just a little demonstration the
reason<00:00:53.239> they're<00:00:53.360> both<00:00:53.480> reading<00:00:53.780> 14:1<00:00:54.440> is<00:00:54.650> a

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
reason they're both reading 14:1 is a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.300 
reason they're both reading 14:1 is a
reading<00:00:56.410> for<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.470> first<00:00:57.650> 30<00:00:57.860> seconds<00:00:58.190> they

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
reading for the first 30 seconds they

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.790 
reading for the first 30 seconds they
read<00:00:58.490> battery<00:00:58.910> voltage<00:00:59.360> or<00:00:59.660> amps<00:01:00.320> you<00:01:00.680> know

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
read battery voltage or amps you know

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.640 
read battery voltage or amps you know
when<00:01:01.490> the<00:01:01.640> car's<00:01:02.000> running<00:01:02.390> then<00:01:03.230> after<00:01:03.530> 30

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
when the car's running then after 30

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.810 
when the car's running then after 30
seconds<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:04.160> can<00:01:04.250> see<00:01:04.280> they<00:01:04.460> just<00:01:04.490> both

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
seconds you can see they just both

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.150 
seconds you can see they just both
switch<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:05.420> this<00:01:05.600> one<00:01:05.780> now<00:01:05.960> is<00:01:06.200> showing<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
switch so this one now is showing the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.390 
switch so this one now is showing the
voltage<00:01:08.170> reading<00:01:09.170> from<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.560> primary<00:01:09.979> oxygen

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
voltage reading from the primary oxygen

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.600 
voltage reading from the primary oxygen
sensor<00:01:11.229> and<00:01:12.229> this<00:01:12.650> one<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:12.950> reading<00:01:13.160> vacuum

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
sensor and this one is reading vacuum

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.680 
sensor and this one is reading vacuum
right<00:01:13.790> now<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:16.460> we'll<00:01:17.119> just<00:01:17.270> go<00:01:17.420> around<00:01:17.479> the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
right now so we'll just go around the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:29.140 
right now so we'll just go around the
block<00:01:17.780> here<00:01:18.759> what<00:01:19.759> do<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:19.880> guys<00:01:20.030> see<00:01:20.300> these

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.160 

this<00:01:29.720> one<00:01:29.930> pegs<00:01:30.170> off<00:01:30.410> at<00:01:30.590> 15<00:01:31.990> that's<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
this one pegs off at 15 that's the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.190 
this one pegs off at 15 that's the
highest<00:01:33.500> value<00:01:33.980> for<00:01:34.450> vacuum<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:35.960> it's

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
highest value for vacuum so it's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.890 
highest value for vacuum so it's
probably<00:01:36.680> up<00:01:36.800> somewhere<00:01:37.220> around<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.910> would<00:01:38.750> say

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
probably up somewhere around I would say

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.100 
probably up somewhere around I would say
21<00:01:39.560> 20<00:01:40.430> 21<00:01:40.730> probably<00:01:41.300> like<00:01:41.390> a<00:01:41.480> normal<00:01:41.780> Honda

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
21 20 21 probably like a normal Honda

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.210 
21 20 21 probably like a normal Honda
it's<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.620> little<00:01:42.920> low<00:01:43.100> at<00:01:43.280> idle<00:01:44.860> but<00:01:45.860> I'm<00:01:46.100> not

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
it's a little low at idle but I'm not

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.320 
it's a little low at idle but I'm not
too<00:01:46.400> worried<00:01:46.610> about<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.910> it's<00:01:47.030> got<00:01:47.180> almost

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
too worried about it it's got almost

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.750 
too worried about it it's got almost
300,000<00:01:48.200> miles<00:01:48.320> on<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.620> so<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:52.010> white<00:01:52.220> I'm

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
300,000 miles on it so the white I'm

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.550 
300,000 miles on it so the white I'm
sorry<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.180> narrowband<00:01:53.720> gauge<00:01:53.990> over<00:01:54.230> here<00:01:54.410> you

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
sorry the narrowband gauge over here you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.760 
sorry the narrowband gauge over here you
can<00:01:54.680> see<00:01:54.890> it's<00:01:55.100> it's<00:01:55.490> fairly<00:01:56.270> useless<00:01:56.810> most

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
can see it's it's fairly useless most

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.200 
can see it's it's fairly useless most
people<00:01:58.240> think<00:01:59.240> I<00:02:00.220> I'm<00:02:01.220> sorry<00:02:01.490> I<00:02:01.760> don't<00:02:02.000> think

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
people think I I'm sorry I don't think

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.719 
people think I I'm sorry I don't think
it's<00:02:02.450> useless<00:02:02.720> but<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.290> lot<00:02:03.530> of<00:02:03.560> people<00:02:03.800> that

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
it's useless but a lot of people that

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.750 
it's useless but a lot of people that
like<00:02:04.910> to<00:02:04.940> spend<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.630> know<00:02:06.190> tens<00:02:07.190> of<00:02:07.340> thousands

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
like to spend you know tens of thousands

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.359 
like to spend you know tens of thousands
of<00:02:07.820> dollars<00:02:08.119> on<00:02:08.270> turbo<00:02:08.570> systems<00:02:08.990> will<00:02:09.140> say

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
of dollars on turbo systems will say

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.820 
of dollars on turbo systems will say
it's<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.490> junk<00:02:10.760> gage<00:02:11.030> and<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.870> disagree<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.620> mean

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
it's a junk gage and I disagree I mean

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.550 
it's a junk gage and I disagree I mean
first<00:02:13.540> first<00:02:14.540> what<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:14.840> tells<00:02:14.990> you<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.200> if<00:02:15.440> your

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
first first what it tells you is if your

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.710 
first first what it tells you is if your
oxygen<00:02:15.890> sensors<00:02:16.340> are<00:02:16.490> working<00:02:16.610> um<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:17.600> that's

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
oxygen sensors are working um so that's

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.230 
oxygen sensors are working um so that's
worth<00:02:17.959> something<00:02:18.550> but<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.670> second<00:02:20.000> thing<00:02:20.120> it

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
worth something but the second thing it

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.210 
worth something but the second thing it
tells<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.709> know<00:02:21.830> when<00:02:22.070> you're<00:02:22.190> on

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
tells you is you know when you're on

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.300 
tells you is you know when you're on
throttle<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:24.230> will<00:02:24.470> tell<00:02:24.740> you<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.070> know<00:02:25.160> it

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
throttle it will tell you you know it

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.760 
throttle it will tell you you know it
should<00:02:25.700> go<00:02:25.850> -<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.209> should<00:02:26.450> go<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.630> full<00:02:26.930> rich<00:02:27.170> or

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
should go - it should go to full rich or

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.350 
should go - it should go to full rich or

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
optimal range and if it's not in your

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.820 
optimal range and if it's not in your
under<00:02:34.700> boost<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.959> know<00:02:36.050> get<00:02:36.260> off<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.530> pedal

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
under boost you know get off the pedal

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.650 
under boost you know get off the pedal
because<00:02:36.980> you're<00:02:37.280> running<00:02:37.400> lean<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.390> that's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
because you're running lean so that's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.540 
because you're running lean so that's
why<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.870> got<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.320> can<00:02:39.410> see<00:02:39.620> as<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:40.130> put<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
why I got it you can see as I put the

going<00:02:43.160> up<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:43.370> hill<00:02:43.640> you'll<00:02:44.209> see<00:02:44.390> how<00:02:44.480> it

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
going up this hill you'll see how it

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.670 
going up this hill you'll see how it
goes<00:02:44.720> into<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.019> green<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.440> stays<00:02:45.650> there

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
goes into the green and stays there

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.520 
goes into the green and stays there
almost<00:02:46.450> see<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.570> it<00:02:47.660> stays<00:02:47.930> more<00:02:48.290> in<00:02:48.410> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
almost see that it stays more in the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.220 
almost see that it stays more in the
green<00:02:48.769> well<00:02:49.700> let<00:02:49.910> off<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.150> gas<00:02:50.180> there<00:02:50.600> but<00:02:50.780> now

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
green well let off the gas there but now

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.050 
green well let off the gas there but now
that<00:02:51.380> I'm<00:02:51.470> back<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:51.830> load<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.310> stays<00:02:52.580> optimal

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
that I'm back on load it stays optimal

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.509 
that I'm back on load it stays optimal
to<00:02:53.180> green<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.780> that's<00:02:54.410> only<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.430> know

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
to green and that's only it you know

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.600 
to green and that's only it you know
maybe<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.880> quarter<00:02:56.239> throttle<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.590> wide<00:02:58.250> open

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
maybe a quarter throttle so it wide open

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.850 
maybe a quarter throttle so it wide open
throttle<00:02:59.019> you<00:03:00.019> know<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.260> should<00:03:00.470> be<00:03:00.590> fully

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
throttle you know that should be fully

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.440 
throttle you know that should be fully
in<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.160> green<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.820> can<00:03:01.970> basically<00:03:02.150> use

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
in the green and you can basically use

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.090 
in the green and you can basically use
it<00:03:02.750> as<00:03:02.870> an<00:03:02.989> idiot<00:03:03.410> light<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.900> let<00:03:06.080> you<00:03:06.260> know<00:03:06.470> hey

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
it as an idiot light to let you know hey

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.070 
it as an idiot light to let you know hey
you<00:03:07.550> know<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.940> car<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.540> not<00:03:08.630> getting<00:03:08.780> enough

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
you know the car is not getting enough

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.039 
you know the car is not getting enough
fuel<00:03:09.860> now<00:03:10.430> for<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.670> normally<00:03:11.120> aspirated<00:03:11.420> car

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
fuel now for a normally aspirated car

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.259 
fuel now for a normally aspirated car
like<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:12.709> one<00:03:12.950> right<00:03:13.160> now<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.970> doesn't

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
like this one right now it doesn't

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.000 
like this one right now it doesn't
matter<00:03:14.450> but<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.840> reason<00:03:15.350> I'm<00:03:15.470> installing

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
matter but the reason I'm installing

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.729 
matter but the reason I'm installing
these<00:03:16.130> now<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:17.269> because<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:17.870> about<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> week<00:03:18.530> or

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
these now is because in about a week or

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.360 
these now is because in about a week or
so<00:03:18.769> I'm<00:03:19.580> going<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.030> start<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.420> turbo<00:03:20.750> valve<00:03:20.930> on

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
so I'm going to start the turbo valve on

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.670 
so I'm going to start the turbo valve on
so<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:22.000> wanted<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.330> have<00:03:22.480> all<00:03:22.510> these<00:03:22.989> gauges<00:03:23.349> in

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
so I wanted to have all these gauges in

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.449 
so I wanted to have all these gauges in
place<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.910> anyway<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.629> is<00:03:25.690> just<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:27.129> just<00:03:27.340> a

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
place so anyway this is just a is just a

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.380 
place so anyway this is just a is just a
quick<00:03:27.700> video<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:29.019> went<00:03:29.590> with<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.640> eBay<00:03:30.970> gauges

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
quick video I went with the eBay gauges

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.220 
quick video I went with the eBay gauges
not<00:03:32.230> because<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:32.860> cost<00:03:33.569> but<00:03:34.569> because<00:03:34.840> I<00:03:34.870> liked

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
not because of cost but because I liked

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.780 
not because of cost but because I liked
him<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:35.470> best<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.010> closest<00:03:36.459> one<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.760> I

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
him the best and the closest one that I

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.240 
him the best and the closest one that I
could<00:03:36.970> find<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.330> operated<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:37.989> way<00:03:38.250> were

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
could find that operated this way were

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.280 
could find that operated this way were
was<00:03:39.970> an<00:03:40.090> auto<00:03:40.239> meter<00:03:40.450> gauge<00:03:40.750> there<00:03:41.170> was<00:03:41.260> a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
was an auto meter gauge there was a

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.220 
was an auto meter gauge there was a
couple<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.590> high-end<00:03:41.769> gauges<00:03:42.370> like<00:03:43.239> these<00:03:43.510> but

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
couple of high-end gauges like these but

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.229 
couple of high-end gauges like these but
they<00:03:44.349> were<00:03:44.440> like<00:03:44.620> $300<00:03:45.250> apiece<00:03:45.549> and<00:03:45.879> and<00:03:46.120> you

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
they were like $300 apiece and and you

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.880 
they were like $300 apiece and and you
know<00:03:46.330> I'm<00:03:46.569> not<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:47.019> mean<00:03:47.230> I'm<00:03:47.500> gonna<00:03:47.620> be<00:03:47.769> running

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
know I'm not I mean I'm gonna be running

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.949 
know I'm not I mean I'm gonna be running
five<00:03:48.280> pounds<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:48.730> boost<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.569> know<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:49.720> don't

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
five pounds of boost you know I don't

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.960 
five pounds of boost you know I don't
it's<00:03:50.500> not<00:03:50.590> like<00:03:50.830> I'm<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.310> know<00:03:51.340> 1200

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
it's not like I'm you know 1200

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.330 
it's not like I'm you know 1200
horsepower<00:03:52.349> drag<00:03:53.349> car<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.040> need<00:03:54.220> to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
horsepower drag car that I need to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.819 
horsepower drag car that I need to
monitor<00:03:54.549> it<00:03:54.819> that<00:03:55.090> well<00:03:55.269> so<00:03:55.870> anyway<00:03:56.680> these

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
monitor it that well so anyway these

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.680 
monitor it that well so anyway these
work<00:03:57.069> for<00:03:57.280> me<00:03:57.459> I've<00:03:57.700> tested<00:03:58.209> this<00:03:58.390> one<00:03:58.540> with

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
work for me I've tested this one with

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.059 
work for me I've tested this one with
the<00:03:58.750> air<00:03:58.870> compressor<00:03:59.319> as<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.560> can<00:03:59.709> see<00:03:59.890> in<00:03:59.980> the

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
the air compressor as you can see in the

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.960 
the air compressor as you can see in the
other<00:04:00.099> video<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.810> test<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.200> out<00:04:02.260> good

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
other video and you test it out good

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.400 
other video and you test it out good
obviously<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.269> can't<00:04:04.480> test<00:04:04.690> boost<00:04:05.019> right<00:04:05.200> now

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
obviously I can't test boost right now

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.080 
obviously I can't test boost right now
cuz<00:04:05.650> I'm<00:04:05.769> not<00:04:05.950> turbo<00:04:07.319> but<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.860> air<00:04:09.489> fuel<00:04:09.790> gauge

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
cuz I'm not turbo but the air fuel gauge

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.930 
cuz I'm not turbo but the air fuel gauge
I<00:04:10.480> just<00:04:11.170> got<00:04:11.319> finished<00:04:11.470> hooking<00:04:12.069> into<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.549> ECU

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
I just got finished hooking into the ECU

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.759 
I just got finished hooking into the ECU
as<00:04:13.329> close<00:04:13.569> as<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.840> could<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.170> get<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.620> most

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
as close as I could to get the most

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.699 
as close as I could to get the most
accurate<00:04:14.980> voltage<00:04:15.870> because<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.620> know

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
accurate voltage because you know

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.710 
accurate voltage because you know
they're<00:04:17.979> they<00:04:18.700> operate<00:04:19.090> on<00:04:19.120> such<00:04:19.329> a<00:04:19.359> narrow

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
they're they operate on such a narrow

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.930 
they're they operate on such a narrow
band<00:04:20.079> of<00:04:20.229> voltage<00:04:20.650> that's<00:04:21.400> why<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:21.639> lot<00:04:21.760> of

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
band of voltage that's why a lot of

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.370 
band of voltage that's why a lot of
people<00:04:22.060> think<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.600> they're<00:04:22.780> useless<00:04:23.080> but

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
people think that they're useless but

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.640 
people think that they're useless but
they're<00:04:23.500> not<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:24.430> me<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.850> use<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.210> as<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.360> as<00:04:25.960> an

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
they're not to me you use it as a as an

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.430 
they're not to me you use it as a as an
idiot<00:04:26.950> gauge<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:28.510> basically<00:04:28.840> let<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.229> know

lene<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:46.839> obviously<00:04:47.439> the<00:04:47.589> computer<00:04:47.949> is<00:04:48.009> doing

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:48.249 
lene and obviously the computer is doing

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:50.459 
lene and obviously the computer is doing
that<00:04:48.339> for<00:04:48.399> gas<00:04:48.759> economy<00:04:49.149> so<00:04:49.719> anyway<00:04:50.319> that's
