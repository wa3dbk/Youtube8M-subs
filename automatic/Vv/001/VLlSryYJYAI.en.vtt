hours just looking through the responses

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.450 
hours just looking through the responses
and<00:00:49.110> replacing<00:00:49.680> some<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.100> didn't<00:00:50.370> think

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and replacing some that we didn't think

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.520 
and replacing some that we didn't think
were<00:00:50.610> good<00:00:50.820> enough<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.809> took<00:00:52.020> such<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> long

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
were good enough so it took such a long

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.959 
were good enough so it took such a long
time<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.280> I'm<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.760> say<00:00:53.910> this

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
time but I'm just going to say this

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.389 
time but I'm just going to say this
right<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.329> every<00:00:55.079> single<00:00:55.469> person's<00:00:55.980> response

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
right now every single person's response

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.000 
right now every single person's response
or<00:00:57.000> every<00:00:57.239> single<00:00:57.539> person's<00:00:57.930> response<00:00:58.350> was

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
or every single person's response was

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
or every single person's response was
looked<00:00:59.250> at<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.730> did<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.059> skip<00:01:00.539> one

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
looked at like we did not skip one

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.150 
looked at like we did not skip one
response<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.739> that's<00:01:01.949> something

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
response and I think that's something

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160 
response and I think that's something
really<00:01:02.760> cool<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.030> thought<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.960> were<00:01:04.049> gonna

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
really cool I thought they were gonna

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.899 
really cool I thought they were gonna
skip<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> few<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.040> stuff<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.640> just

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
skip a few and stuff because they just

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.039 
skip a few and stuff because they just
didn't<00:01:06.150> want<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> look<00:01:06.689> through<00:01:06.840> so

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
didn't want to have to look through so

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.210 
didn't want to have to look through so
many<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.380> would<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.619> taken<00:01:07.710> way<00:01:07.979> too<00:01:08.040> long

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
many it would have taken way too long

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.460 
many it would have taken way too long
but<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.270> look<00:01:09.510> through<00:01:09.689> every<00:01:10.260> single

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
but we look through every single

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.770 
but we look through every single
response<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.340> thought<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.640> was<00:01:11.880> incredible<00:01:12.570> I

in<00:04:17.580> general<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.239> for<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:18.870> series

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
in general but for this series

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.199 
in general but for this series
specifically<00:04:20.160> we've<00:04:20.430> been<00:04:20.580> getting<00:04:20.669> so<00:04:21.060> much

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
specifically we've been getting so much

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.610 
specifically we've been getting so much
amazing<00:04:21.540> feedback<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.169> it's<00:04:22.260> been<00:04:22.410> growing

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
amazing feedback and it's been growing

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.170 
amazing feedback and it's been growing
each<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.010> every<00:04:23.280> week<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.910> what<00:04:24.030> I've<00:04:24.150> been

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
each and every week so what I've been

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.820 
each and every week so what I've been
thinking<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:24.750> we<00:04:24.900> can<00:04:25.169> make<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:25.440> series

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
thinking is that we can make this series

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.110 
thinking is that we can make this series
even<00:04:26.280> better<00:04:26.580> and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
even better and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.670 
even better and
this<00:04:27.240> means<00:04:27.510> that<00:04:27.600> we<00:04:27.810> could<00:04:27.990> make<00:04:28.139> an<00:04:28.290> extra

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
this means that we could make an extra

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.560 
this means that we could make an extra
thing<00:04:28.979> at<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.220> end<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.490> this<00:04:29.580> video<00:04:29.790> or<00:04:30.210> at<00:04:30.419> the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
thing at the end of this video or at the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.629 
thing at the end of this video or at the
end<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.750> any<00:04:30.960> video<00:04:31.290> on<00:04:31.350> this<00:04:31.530> series<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.040> it's

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
end of any video on this series and it's

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.159 
end of any video on this series and it's
basically<00:04:33.000> going<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.270> be<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.510> aftermath<00:04:34.139> of

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
basically going to be the aftermath of

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.020 
basically going to be the aftermath of
teams<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.740> we've<00:04:34.949> actually<00:04:35.220> done<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.850> for

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
teams that we've actually done it for

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.670 
teams that we've actually done it for
before<00:04:36.419> like<00:04:36.930> say<00:04:37.110> there<00:04:37.260> was<00:04:37.350> a<00:04:37.410> team<00:04:37.590> that

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680

they actually blew the fuck up we could

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.340 
they actually blew the fuck up we could
do<00:04:41.880> an<00:04:41.970> aftermath<00:04:42.419> video<00:04:42.750> with<00:04:42.990> like<00:04:43.199> the
