00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:10.979
 from this 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:14.099
 To go nuts just after the lead 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:17.909
 on wow there is some kind of straight 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:20.969
 a ball in the form of a planet and we are now again in 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:24.270
 some kind of tunnel charge we drive in 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.780
 epic tunnel are we really cave now 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.979
