00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello everyone, I'm Rodrigo Oliveira and today 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.380
 I will teach you how to altar with the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.380
 rollerblades 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.349
 Good, I 'll split in three parts. 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.719
 and jumping and bending in flexing you 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.699
 prepare your body in position to do 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.890
 a boost up 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.710
 then you flex your knees shoulders 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.570
 aligned with the feet 10 slightly 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:30.390
 and reins on the ground and on the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.290
 does not throw the body to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.890
 forward and not far behind try to play 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.309
 Up in the air even you pull your feet 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.140
 Up you pick your legs and you have two 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.730
 types of shrugs to jump 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.379
 taller and rearing the legs straight and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.710
 blues the street the staff generally 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.050
 pulls legs and dj format that looks good 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.449
 more team and I'll leave it on the screen for you 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.370
 to see how it is 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.090
 in the message that you will cushion the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 which gives 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.260
 flexing the knees is not landed 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.619
 with straight body and a stick always with 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.350
 flexed knees and do not 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.140
 put boxes of graffiti bottles or 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.030
 backpack to jump over beauty because 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.430
 putting some obstacle on you will have a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.439
 reduced time to prepare your body 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.049
 to give that course up and go 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.840
 end up jumping at the last minute planting 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.820
 Any way, and it will end up falling and going. 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.250
 increasing the height as you 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.979
 practice reminding staff to practice 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.480
 train hard enough that you can not 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.160
 learn from one day 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.290
 and when you go skipping a backpack one 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.800
 bike or even your friend lying on the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.170
 floor 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.640
 make sure that you can 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.520
 reach that height 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.530
 a hint you jump on the obstacle side and 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.690
 ask a person to look at the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.720
 height was enough to pass 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.160
 obstacles and then you try and 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.830
 forgetting personal 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.020
 protection when you jump drops or you 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.960
 clap your butt and chat 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.150
 floor or falls forward and puts his hand 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.399
 to protect and make very important the 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.980
 wristband to protect the time to 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.110
 You train cars. 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.000
 That 's it folks I hope I have helped 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.190
 click on the two videos you liked 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.110
 video is a gem that subscribes to the channel 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.220
 that will have enough content like this 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.220
 It's for you, he said.
