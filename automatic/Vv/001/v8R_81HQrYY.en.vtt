and it's a little bit different than

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
and it's a little bit different than
what<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.270> expect<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.050> said<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:47.039> way

what you to expect like I said the way
you're<00:00:47.309> gonna<00:00:47.399> do<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.910> you're<00:00:48.059> first

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you're gonna do this is you're first

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.389 
you're gonna do this is you're first
going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> tap<00:00:48.780> into<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> Nintendo<00:00:49.710> eShop<00:00:49.739> so

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
going to tap into the Nintendo eShop so

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.369 
going to tap into the Nintendo eShop so
you<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.670> need<00:00:50.820> an<00:00:50.940> online<00:00:51.180> connection<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you do need an online connection and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.959 
you do need an online connection and
your<00:00:52.500> 3ds<00:00:52.860> should<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.340> connected<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.850> your

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
your 3ds should be connected to your

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.020 
your 3ds should be connected to your
Wi-Fi<00:00:54.149> network<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.820> once<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
Wi-Fi network to do this once it

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.389 
Wi-Fi network to do this once it
connects<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.050> process<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:59.160> bit

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
connects the process is a little bit

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.590 
connects the process is a little bit
different<00:00:59.879> than<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.420> would<00:01:00.539> expect

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
different than what you would expect

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.049 
different than what you would expect
what<00:01:01.320> Nintendo<00:01:01.859> has<00:01:02.039> essentially<00:01:02.640> done<00:01:02.670> is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
what Nintendo has essentially done is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.969 
what Nintendo has essentially done is
they've<00:01:03.270> pre-loaded<00:01:03.989> these<00:01:04.140> games<00:01:04.439> into<00:01:04.830> your

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
they've pre-loaded these games into your

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.920 
they've pre-loaded these games into your
account<00:01:05.309> history<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> you'll<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.720> able<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
account history and you'll be able to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.170 
account history and you'll be able to
redownload<00:01:07.409> them<00:01:07.920> even<00:01:08.850> though<00:01:08.970> you've<00:01:09.150> never

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
redownload them even though you've never

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
redownload them even though you've never
downloaded<00:01:09.930> them<00:01:10.049> before<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:10.860> that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
downloaded them before and I think that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
downloaded them before and I think that
that's<00:01:11.369> their<00:01:11.729> way<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> being<00:01:12.330> able<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's their way of being able to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.570 
that's their way of being able to
maintain<00:01:13.049> control<00:01:13.320> over<00:01:13.830> who<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.400> this

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
maintain control over who is in this

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.330 
maintain control over who is in this
program<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.240> who<00:01:15.689> gets<00:01:15.900> those<00:01:16.140> games<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
program and who gets those games so the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.499 
program and who gets those games so the
first<00:01:17.549> thing<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:17.850> gonna<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.270> you're
