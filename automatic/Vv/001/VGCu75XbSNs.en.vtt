little middle section and then the shaft
they're<00:02:27.739> almost<00:02:27.920> identical<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.610> like<00:02:30.160> I'm

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
they're almost identical to like I'm

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.360 
they're almost identical to like I'm
talking<00:02:31.370> about<00:02:31.519> this<00:02:31.760> part<00:02:32.060> here<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.510> here

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
talking about this part here and here

obviously<00:02:34.370> unfold<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.420> morts<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.930> kind<00:02:36.500> of

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
obviously unfold the morts is kind of

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.490 
obviously unfold the morts is kind of
has<00:02:36.739> like<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.069> black<00:02:37.340> texturing<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.450> but<00:02:39.230> I

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
has like the black texturing on it but I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.930 
has like the black texturing on it but I
thought<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.069> was<00:02:40.310> interesting<00:02:40.459> just

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
thought that was interesting just

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.960 
thought that was interesting just
another<00:02:41.180> way<00:02:41.390> they're<00:02:41.569> similar<00:02:42.850> but<00:02:43.850> we'll

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
another way they're similar but we'll

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.540 
another way they're similar but we'll
put<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.180> aside<00:02:44.440> move<00:02:45.440> up<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.830> shaft<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.489> you

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
put that aside move up the shaft and you

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.979 
put that aside move up the shaft and you
have<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:47.769> licensing<00:02:52.510> it's<00:02:53.510> hard<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.780> focus
