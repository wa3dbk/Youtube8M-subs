00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.950
 Know the chariot 

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.800
 by 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.460
 Chariot museum 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.950
 Launched in collaboration with Challenger Richard Cutland 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.850
 TOG II* chariot. 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.950
 The monster behind me is called TOG. 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.080
 Correctly speaking, it should be called TOG II. 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.850
 Wargaming came again this time. 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.610
 Bloomington, England 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.810
 Famous chariot museum 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.250
 In the world of chariots 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.500
 Conduct another unique in-depth report 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.440
 Let me try for you. 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.300
 Explain the role of this monster 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.000
 The prompt is in the name of TOG 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.920
 Actually it is 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.500
 Short name for the alias "old partner" 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.840
 This group of old partners 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.650
 It was in the UK in 1939. 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.970
 One named 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.820
 Special Vehicle Development Committee 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.170
 Stern, Tritton, Ricardo 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.180
 Wilson, Swinton and D'Eyncourt 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.480
 The first batch of these 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.520
 The first batch of chariot pioneers 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.270
 Chariot pioneer 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.030
 TOG I 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.680
 They worry about the upcoming war 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.800
 Will compare one battle 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.090
 Hard to use 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.880
 Huge and substantial 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.200
 Line of defense 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.980
 Come on 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 So they went to the British Army 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.350
 Proposed a reason for them to the British Army 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.850
 proposed a 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.120
 New super heavy tank plan 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.120
 Can be on uneven ground 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.480
 Horizontal and unobstructed 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.690
 Infantry to support offense 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.800
 Can break through the enemy defenders 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.910
 Surrounded by 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.200
 Oversized "land battleship" 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.320
 This is really a monster 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.800
 First prototype chariot 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.860
 Factory in 1940 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.680
 Weighs 81 metric tons 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.360
 Far more than a tiger 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.760
 Also weighs 25 metric tons 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.270
 Even 11 metric tons more than Tiger II 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.850
 Original design 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.380
 Is similar to Char B1 Bis 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.760
 With the first Churchill chariot 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.860
 Carrying a 75-mm howitzer in the body 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.550
 And in the small turret 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.880
 Plus originally installed in the Mardi two 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 2 pound gun 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.500
 Two more two-pound guns 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.860
 Then mounted on the side protrusion 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.860
 With more than four machine guns 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.460
 Provides a full range of firepower 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.110
 Chariot armor has nearly 75 mm thick 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.050
 Enough to withstand 100 meters 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.390
 47 mm anti-war gun 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.920
 And 105 mm 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 Shell impact 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.240
 Track used 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.460
 Similar to the early design of World War I 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.170
 Around the entire body 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.520
 On the wheel 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.590
 There are no suspension systems 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.980
 The chariot is 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.630
 Oil and electricity configuration drive 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.140
 A 600 brake horsepower diesel engine 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.880
 Drive generator 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.820
 Then start the drive drive sprocket 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.450
 Motor 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.850
 Due to the prototype chariot 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.370
 Generator 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.370
 Burned out due to overheating and did not start the name 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.920
 Such a configuration 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.600
 With Ferdinand Porsche later 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.370
 Yuhu-type prototype chariot 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.810
 Wrong setting 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.650
 Almost like a trip 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.720
 Have easy to catch fire 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720
 Fatal loss 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.670
 TOG II 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.050
 Represented by flash warfare 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.090
 Chariot technology and 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.740
 Tactical new style 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.080
 Has become a trend 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.310
 To support the redesigned TOG II 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.690
 I have to take TOG I down. 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.960
 This one in front of you 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.760
 Is the only remaining real car 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.580
 It and the prototype 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.800
 As thick 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.780
 But after some improvement 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.240
 Discard the idler before 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.100
 All the way through the passage 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.000
 Direct rear drive sprocket 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.640
 World War I track form 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.200
 The protruding parts on the side are also cancelled. 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.500
 Changed on the track channel 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.240
 Install the side door used by the six team members 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.240
 Suspension system 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.960
 And two 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.260
 Seems to be functioning properly 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.440
 Generator 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.760
 Just such power 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.280
 Still not enough 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.960
 Chariot speed 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.880
 Only 14 kilometers per hour 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.640
 Turret, in this volumetric chariot 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640
 It seems very ridiculous 2 pound gun 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.040
 Finally got taken off 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.100
 I tried many forms of turrets during this period. 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.820
 And this loaded 17-pound gun 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.920
 Is the top equipment 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.180
 Such specifications are mass imitations 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.020
 Challenger 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.800
 Beautiful name 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.640
 17-pound gun 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.940
 Cromwell Cruiser 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.160
 That 75-degree howitzer 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.080
 Also removed 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.700
 Replaced by a 7.92 mm BESA machine gun 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.160
 Simply put, this chariot 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.620
 Outdated design that has been out of battle 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.960
 Start a bit of World War II style 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.460
 internal 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.760
 Let's see 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.080
 The interior of this monster 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.820
 Facing the front in the center of the chariot 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.940
 First position 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.600
 obviously 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.860
 Is the driving position 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.860
 On the right side of the drive 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.960
 There should be a 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.520
 7.92 mm BESA machine gun 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.720
 Can see the porthole over there 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.080
 Is the original position of the machine gun frame 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.120
 And just behind that 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.560
 can be seen 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.720
 Very large turret basket 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.200
 It should have been removed at the beginning. 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.860
 Because itâ€™s obviously not with the turret 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.480
 Then go up to the turret 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.740
 At the beginning, there was a chariot 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.480
 gunner 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.280
 One of the two filling hands 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.280
 As for the second loader 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.820
 Actually no one can 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.040
 Point out his exact location 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.720
 So we can only guess 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.720
 He should be at 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.400
 In this spacious space 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.060
 Occupy the position of one side 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.300
 engine 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.200
 Look at this car 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.180
 Rear cabin 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.860
 Huge space 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.360
 Really beyond imagination 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.320
 I think this is already 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.480
 Can be used as a meeting place. 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.920
 can be seen 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.800
 Right in front of me 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.680
 This 600 horsepower 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.480
 Powerful diesel engine 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.580
 Rear of engine 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.000
 There are two generators 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.700
 Behind the generator 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.300
 There are two drive rear sprocket teeth 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.900
 Electric motor 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.920
 End 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.780
 Even if TOG enters mass production 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.440
 Will only make it a battlefield 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.180
 The target of the public 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.000
 People can't help but TOG 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.100
 Practicality on the battlefield 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.540
 Suspicion 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.580
 the question is that 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.540
 More excellent chariot 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.620
 Successive 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.620
 These chariots 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.880
 Better than TOG in every respect 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.860
 Or equal 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.940
 Churchill's chariot has solid armor 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.440
 And can be qualified as infantry support 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.380
 Sherman Chariot 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.260
 Speed, maneuverability 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.180
 Firepower is even stronger 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.720
 TOG will eventually escape the fate of being classified as an odd number. 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.600
 a war-type shift 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.540
 Still sticking to it 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.980
 Old thinking chariot 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.120
 Also for the war 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.320
 Innovating 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.040
 Not just blind evolution 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.680
 a warning
