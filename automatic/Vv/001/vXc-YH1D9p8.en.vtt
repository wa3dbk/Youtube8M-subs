00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:13.790

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.210
 Now that it has arrived, I would like to do the opening video, so I 'll get in right away. 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.990
 I think 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.990
 Tei was 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.530
 This 2 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.560
 It's a game shop 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.630
 Hey Well I'd recently new. Are crazy changed 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.800
 that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.800
 I was worried about it so much 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.060
 It is a camouflage to say 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.380
 Oh 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:53.470
 It is this one this time 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.470
 Call of Duty World to say that head 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.770
 The price is quite 1,940 yen 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.150
 It is cheap 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.250
 It becomes 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.110
 Yes because the imported version is not sold in Japan 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.120
 The fact that that import version 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.120
 It feels like the best edition of overseas 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.120
 I think that I would like to raise some of you as soon as possible 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.820
 The 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.110
 Four 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.450
 It is such a feeling about yes 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.450
 Phew 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:14.640
 It's just vinyl and it looks almost the same 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.750
 I think that want to go 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.750
 Well, it looks like this 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.840
 I think I am not particularly interested in the manual 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.150
 Yup 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.890
 Oh dear 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.890
 It looks like this time 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:36.650
 I wonder why Oh it is to say whether I bought this 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.760
 Well hey lately hey 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.050
 This Call of Duty Modern Large Puncher Fall Duty 4 Modern 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.430
 In terms of warfare 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.030
 I bought this but 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.640
 That Well 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.240
 Before this much 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.000
 In the game 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:00.360
 It is tan with or seen something sound review of those who recently purchased it also Well evaluative in Son 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.090
 Maa's 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:10.970
 Sheet is many original Toka or was you can not both be online 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:13.959
 It is before you'll said selfishness when a person takes a great time in marching because there are few 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.959
 I was worried but 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.990
 You're actually doing it, but even if it 's such a thing , people are usually 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.630
 There were also two people in the time zone 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.380
 It is said Well I am after 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.940
 I still have a cheat 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:38.190
 Even though I have never met 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:44.230
 Actually I think that the review and the impression I actually made are different depending on people 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:48.760
 Personally, it's a game that can be done at all 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.390
 But this is pretty goldie t series 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.630
 N Well I've done roughly ways one 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:59.000
 that 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:02.150
 You say in your imitate this is told the most interesting, but I saw a Tteyuu I wish seen amazing 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.290
 Really hey, that kill streak Hey hey 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:10.349
 There are only three 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:15.299
 So you have to bring it to the root to take that kill streak too. 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:17.590
 You know, as has been said by and I after I Is Toka that modern 2 is not apparent so much 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.220
 U 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.070
 Of explosives 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:30.310
 Because there is no ion unusual strength such thing 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.750
 Quite So it Uchiai much I have in the also not those who have so main a good addition 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.280
 Hey 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.370
 I'm sorry I'm not coming 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.420
 that 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.440
 Can go online 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:50.230
 Yes, because I was able Naoneyaru 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:50.230
 It sounds like it's a reputation, but it's a fairly old game, but it's quite interesting at all, isn't it? 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.800
 So I here it is quite recommended 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.150
 It it is a Well here 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:08.180
 Modern people and hey 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:10.600
 At first, I was asked to buy a cat or a dog, but I'm pretty much as the sleeping reputation is pretty 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.600
 that 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.940
 There is a place according to reputation 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:21.310
 Ne of it such a negative is Toka in many cheat 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:26.420
 It is also here because it was quite interesting and reviews see also actually doing it, regardless of the there was a 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:30.050
 To wind Tteyuu Toka that many many Toka You know people and hackers were often not 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:32.680
 The game itself wings I'd had a view 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.639
 It's pretty funny 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.270
 Furthermore, it yet that I was a by Rutteyuu in the Japanese army gold 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.480
 That's fine 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.920
 That means that literally I modern large Fair 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:50.190
 It's a kind of weapon like you 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.190
 It was mainly such a thing , but it should be sold 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.110
 Old weapons Gane, such as using it the old Japan Japanese soldiers gold 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.030
 Appeared 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.070
 that 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.190
 Ne of Japan 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:09.320
 As there is also a map of the day on which the stage was set 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.870
 I was pretty anxious but yes I 'm going to buy another one if it goes wrong 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.040
 In feeling 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.590
 It is 1,940 yen 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:20.529
 I think it 's quite affordable 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.950
 There is no problem even after Japan ps 3 ア カ ウ ン ト account online 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:26.720
 I can do it 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:30.340
 I now I'm useless like a that there is no Hey overseas account if you want to buy a map 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.730
 I'm not going to buy a map 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.730
