up<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:55.110> use<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> hypothetical<00:00:56.160> 100k<00:00:56.820> account<00:00:57.660> we

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
up we use a hypothetical 100k account we

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.099 
up we use a hypothetical 100k account we
assume<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.379> always<00:00:59.010> 100k<00:00:59.579> even<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.899> the

out there though where i show quarterly
compounding<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.700> check<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.689> get

protective stop in this case it was two

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.100 
protective stop in this case it was two
points<00:01:22.259> away<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.670> divide<00:01:23.970> two<00:01:24.540> thousand

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
points away and you divide two thousand

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.030 
points away and you divide two thousand
by<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.560> number<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.070> 2000<00:01:26.869> /<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.080> obviously

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
by that number so 2000 / to obviously

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.060 
by that number so 2000 / to obviously
equals<00:01:29.520> 1,000<00:01:30.329> by<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.509> way<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.650> math<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
equals 1,000 by the way the math is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.719 
equals 1,000 by the way the math is
already<00:01:32.369> done<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.640> me<00:01:33.200> down<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:35.490> what<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
already done for me down here and what I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.330 
already done for me down here and what I
do<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.180> split<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.750> into<00:01:37.409> two<00:01:37.770> positions

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
do is I split that into two positions

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.499 
do is I split that into two positions

portfolio<00:04:11.479> down<00:04:11.750> here<00:04:12.379> because<00:04:12.799> everything

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
portfolio down here because everything

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.199 
portfolio down here because everything
is<00:04:14.810> tracked<00:04:15.139> on<00:04:15.379> a<00:04:15.440> mechanical<00:04:15.979> basis<00:04:16.340> so<00:04:16.820> even

is tracked on a mechanical basis so even

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.719 
is tracked on a mechanical basis so even
if<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.389> comes<00:04:17.630> just<00:04:17.989> nine<00:04:18.320> our<00:04:19.190> drops<00:04:19.519> are

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
if it comes just nine our drops are

if it comes just nine our drops are
right<00:04:19.880> around<00:04:20.000> nine<00:04:20.389> and<00:04:20.690> then<00:04:20.750> takes<00:04:20.989> off

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
right around nine and then takes off

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.570 
right around nine and then takes off
again<00:04:21.349> and<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:22.070> should<00:04:22.219> stay<00:04:22.400> with<00:04:22.550> the

again and you should stay with the

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.159 
again and you should stay with the
position<00:04:23.000> i<00:04:23.180> actually<00:04:23.840> track<00:04:24.050> it

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
position i actually track it

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.680 
position i actually track it
mechanically<00:04:24.830> as<00:04:25.150> big

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
mechanically as big

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.270 
mechanically as big
doubt<00:04:26.900> for<00:04:27.170> instance<00:04:27.500> there<00:04:27.620> was<00:04:27.650> one<00:04:27.950> just

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
doubt for instance there was one just

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.300 
doubt for instance there was one just
two<00:04:28.430> days<00:04:28.610> ago<00:04:28.790> that<00:04:29.570> got<00:04:29.810> within<00:04:30.080> 3<00:04:30.590> cents<00:04:31.040> or

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
two days ago that got within 3 cents or

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.800 
two days ago that got within 3 cents or
actually<00:04:31.610> four<00:04:31.820> days<00:04:31.940> ago<00:04:32.180> three<00:04:32.390> cents<00:04:32.720> of

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
actually four days ago three cents of

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.870 
actually four days ago three cents of
the<00:04:32.900> profit<00:04:33.230> target<00:04:33.590> personally<00:04:34.580> I<00:04:34.610> think

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
the profit target personally I think

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.150 
the profit target personally I think
that's<00:04:35.300> really<00:04:35.960> close<00:04:36.260> enough<00:04:36.440> go<00:04:36.830> ahead<00:04:36.950> take

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
that's really close enough go ahead take

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.790 
that's really close enough go ahead take
profits<00:04:37.670> but<00:04:38.360> mechanically<00:04:39.170> it<00:04:39.440> actually

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
profits but mechanically it actually

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.060 
profits but mechanically it actually
stopped<00:04:40.070> out<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:41.750> portfolio<00:04:42.080> anything<00:04:42.920> in

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
stopped out of the portfolio anything in

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.390 
stopped out of the portfolio anything in
orange<00:04:43.550> is<00:04:43.670> new<00:04:43.880> action<00:04:44.450> these<00:04:44.720> positions

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
orange is new action these positions

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.700 
orange is new action these positions
didn't<00:04:46.400> hit<00:04:46.550> new<00:04:46.730> highs<00:04:47.020> so<00:04:48.020> there<00:04:48.290> was<00:04:48.380> no<00:04:48.530> do

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
didn't hit new highs so there was no do

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.090 
didn't hit new highs so there was no do
action<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.610> be<00:04:49.760> taken<00:04:50.290> over<00:04:51.290> here<00:04:51.530> so<00:04:51.800> it's

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
action to be taken over here so it's

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.280 
action to be taken over here so it's
basically<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.700> maintain<00:04:53.180> stop<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.840> should

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
basically a maintain stop and should

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.260 
basically a maintain stop and should
have<00:04:54.380> maintained<00:04:54.770> stop<00:04:55.040> down<00:04:55.280> here<00:04:55.520> on<00:04:55.730> this

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
have maintained stop down here on this

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.540 
have maintained stop down here on this
one<00:04:56.960> too<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.410> again<00:04:57.620> this<00:04:57.800> is<00:04:57.950> new<00:04:58.100> positions

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
one too and again this is new positions

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.130 
one too and again this is new positions
down<00:04:58.760> here<00:04:59.030> I've<00:04:59.120> got<00:04:59.270> a<00:04:59.300> text<00:04:59.660> I'll<00:04:59.780> because

down here I've got a text I'll because

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.900
