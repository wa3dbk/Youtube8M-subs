means remember to you're going to make
your<00:00:57.370> own<00:00:57.489> tension<00:00:57.909> wrenches<00:00:58.269> or<00:00:58.449> even<00:00:58.899> if<00:00:59.049> you

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
your own tension wrenches or even if you

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.200 
your own tension wrenches or even if you
buy<00:00:59.379> one<00:00:59.789> taper<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:01.179> end<00:01:01.359> a<00:01:01.539> little<00:01:01.780> because

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
buy one taper the end a little because

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.720 
buy one taper the end a little because
you<00:01:09.540> may<00:01:10.540> be<00:01:10.600> jumping<00:01:11.170> from<00:01:11.530> a<00:01:11.800> keyway<00:01:12.310> this

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
you may be jumping from a keyway this

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.570 
you may be jumping from a keyway this
size<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:14.530> which<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:15.010> fits<00:01:15.220> in

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
size right which it fits in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.550 
size right which it fits in
and<00:01:16.790> then<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:17.570> may<00:01:17.720> want<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.020> pick<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.440> lock

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
and then you may want to pick a lock

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.120 
and then you may want to pick a lock
which<00:01:19.040> is<00:01:19.220> like<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:19.670> size<00:01:20.110> which<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:21.650> also

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
which is like this size which it also

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.820 
which is like this size which it also
goes<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.340> little<00:01:22.610> deeper<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.960> still<00:01:24.230> still

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
goes a little deeper and is still still

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.630 
goes a little deeper and is still still
functional<00:01:25.400> whereas<00:01:27.310> eliminating<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.430> need

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
functional whereas eliminating the need

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.060 
functional whereas eliminating the need
for<00:01:29.530> multiple<00:01:31.060> tension<00:01:32.060> riches<00:01:32.650> okay<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:34.540> next

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
for multiple tension riches okay so next

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.780 
for multiple tension riches okay so next
we<00:01:37.070> will<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.490> different<00:01:37.790> types<00:01:38.770> more

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
we will to the different types more

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.110 
we will to the different types more
there's<00:01:40.790> your<00:01:41.360> twist<00:01:41.900> flex<00:01:42.350> which<00:01:42.980> is<00:01:43.430> twisted

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
there's your twist flex which is twisted

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.920 
there's your twist flex which is twisted
I<00:01:45.640> don't<00:01:46.640> really<00:01:46.820> care<00:01:47.150> for<00:01:47.390> them<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:47.750> then

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
I don't really care for them and then

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.350 
I don't really care for them and then
you<00:01:48.020> got<00:01:48.170> your<00:01:48.200> rigid<00:01:48.650> which<00:01:49.400> is<00:01:49.610> just<00:01:49.940> simply

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
you got your rigid which is just simply

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.530 
you got your rigid which is just simply
an<00:01:50.570> L<00:01:50.780> bend<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.890> piece<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.540> flexible

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
an L bend and a piece of flexible

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.730 
an L bend and a piece of flexible
stainless<00:01:53.870> and<00:01:55.330> then<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.479> have<00:01:56.630> your<00:01:56.740> larger

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
stainless and then you have your larger

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.350 
stainless and then you have your larger
twist<00:01:58.130> flex<00:01:58.490> for<00:01:58.820> I<00:02:00.369> don't<00:02:01.369> know<00:02:01.490> larger<00:02:02.030> locks

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
twist flex for I don't know larger locks

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.410 
twist flex for I don't know larger locks
and<00:02:02.810> again<00:02:03.140> with<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.860> taper<00:02:04.220> makes<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.270> highly

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
and again with the taper makes it highly

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:14.680 
and again with the taper makes it highly
versatile<00:02:08.290> very<00:02:09.290> useful<00:02:09.820> I<00:02:12.850> always<00:02:13.850> have<00:02:14.510> on

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
versatile very useful I always have on

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.850 
versatile very useful I always have on
hand<00:02:14.770> multiple<00:02:16.150> thicknesses<00:02:17.150> length<00:02:17.930> taper

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
hand multiple thicknesses length taper

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.570

done<00:02:19.310> tapered<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:22.850> one<00:02:23.090> here<00:02:23.300> has<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:24.580> diamond

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
done tapered this one here has a diamond

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.560 
done tapered this one here has a diamond
on<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.390> end<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.980> jon<00:02:27.980> handy<00:02:28.280> dandy<00:02:28.580> but<00:02:28.940> he

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.960 
can't use both hands at the same time
actually

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.840 

I<00:02:34.030> don't<00:02:34.720> know<00:02:34.780> some<00:02:34.990> people<00:02:35.260> like<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.680> put<00:02:35.950> a

I don't know some people like to put a

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.440 
I don't know some people like to put a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
don't like it it cushions the response

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.460 
don't like it it cushions the response
too<00:02:48.610> much<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:49.150> don't<00:02:49.510> get<00:02:49.630> enough<00:02:49.810> deal<00:02:50.110> with<00:02:50.290> it

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
too much I don't get enough deal with it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:59.760 
too much I don't get enough deal with it
