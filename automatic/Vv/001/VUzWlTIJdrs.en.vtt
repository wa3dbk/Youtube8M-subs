this either by doing it on a hem line or
as<00:00:30.340> part<00:00:30.699> of<00:00:30.760> the<00:00:30.880> tuck<00:00:31.150> now<00:00:31.420> a<00:00:31.449> tuck<00:00:31.779> is<00:00:31.990> just<00:00:32.439> a

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
as part of the tuck now a tuck is just a

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.349 
as part of the tuck now a tuck is just a
fold<00:00:32.980> in<00:00:33.100> your<00:00:33.219> fabric<00:00:33.430> so<00:00:33.789> if<00:00:33.879> you<00:00:33.969> fold<00:00:34.239> it

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:34.359 
fold in your fabric so if you fold it

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.479 
fold in your fabric so if you fold it
evenly<00:00:34.660> like<00:00:34.870> this<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.260> pin<00:00:35.440> it<00:00:35.559> you<00:00:36.129> can<00:00:36.340> do

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
evenly like this and pin it you can do

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.090 
evenly like this and pin it you can do
it<00:00:36.609> right<00:00:36.850> along<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.539> edge<00:00:37.719> of<00:00:37.989> that<00:00:38.199> fold<00:00:38.620> I'm

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
it right along the edge of that fold I'm

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.430 
it right along the edge of that fold I'm
going<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.429> be<00:00:39.550> doing<00:00:39.789> it<00:00:40.149> along<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.170> hem<00:00:41.409> line

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
going to be doing it along the hem line

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.709 
going to be doing it along the hem line
so<00:00:41.949> my<00:00:42.069> hem<00:00:42.219> line<00:00:42.399> is<00:00:42.609> already<00:00:42.879> pinned<00:00:43.449> into

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
so my hem line is already pinned into

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.389 
so my hem line is already pinned into
place<00:00:43.839> you<00:00:44.319> can<00:00:44.440> see<00:00:44.589> I<00:00:44.620> folded<00:00:44.949> it<00:00:45.069> and<00:00:45.280> then

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
place you can see I folded it and then

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.009 
place you can see I folded it and then
fold<00:00:45.609> it<00:00:45.729> against<00:00:45.999> of<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.300> clean<00:00:46.539> edge<00:00:46.690> on<00:00:46.839> the

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
fold it against of a clean edge on the

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.899 
fold it against of a clean edge on the
inside<00:00:47.319> and<00:00:47.469> I'm<00:00:47.589> looking<00:00:47.889> at<00:00:48.069> the<00:00:48.280> right<00:00:48.519> side

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
inside and I'm looking at the right side

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.239 
inside and I'm looking at the right side
now<00:00:49.690> these<00:00:49.989> little<00:00:50.319> blue<00:00:50.710> marks<00:00:51.039> that<00:00:51.190> I

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:51.249 
now these little blue marks that I

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.299 
now these little blue marks that I
placed<00:00:51.639> are<00:00:51.909> spaced<00:00:52.809> 3/8<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.769> an<00:00:53.920> inch<00:00:53.949> apart

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
placed are spaced 3/8 of an inch apart

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.759 
placed are spaced 3/8 of an inch apart
just<00:00:55.299> because<00:00:55.479> I<00:00:55.690> want<00:00:55.929> to<00:00:56.019> make<00:00:56.199> sure<00:00:56.229> that

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
just because I want to make sure that

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.759 
just because I want to make sure that
each<00:00:57.069> shell<00:00:57.609> is<00:00:57.909> evenly<00:00:58.659> spaced<00:00:59.170> so<00:00:59.589> they're

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
each shell is evenly spaced so they're

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.449 
each shell is evenly spaced so they're
all<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.219> same<00:01:00.459> size<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:02.079> it's<00:01:02.469> best<00:01:02.859> I<00:01:03.069> think

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:03.459 
all the same size now it's best I think

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:05.730 
all the same size now it's best I think
if<00:01:03.729> you<00:01:03.999> use<00:01:04.180> a<00:01:04.390> matching<00:01:04.809> color<00:01:05.199> thread<00:01:05.530> I'm

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
if you use a matching color thread I'm

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.219 
if you use a matching color thread I'm
actually<00:01:05.950> going<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.369> be<00:01:06.520> using<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:07.229> contrasting

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
actually going to be using a contrasting

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.960 
actually going to be using a contrasting
thread<00:01:08.290> so<00:01:09.160> to<00:01:09.220> stand<00:01:09.490> out<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.670> little<00:01:09.820> bit

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
thread so to stand out a little bit

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.910 
thread so to stand out a little bit
better<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.420> you<00:01:10.480> can<00:01:10.690> see<00:01:10.870> exactly<00:01:11.290> how<00:01:11.620> I'm

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
better and you can see exactly how I'm

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.320 
better and you can see exactly how I'm
sewing<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:12.430> you<00:01:12.820> just<00:01:12.970> want<00:01:13.120> to<00:01:13.150> make<00:01:13.300> sure

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
sewing it you just want to make sure

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.390 
sewing it you just want to make sure
that<00:01:13.630> you're<00:01:13.780> using<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:14.230> good<00:01:14.260> quality<00:01:15.220> thread

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
that you're using a good quality thread

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.280 
that you're using a good quality thread
so<00:01:16.210> it<00:01:16.450> doesn't<00:01:16.900> break<00:01:17.170> easily<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.900> can<00:01:20.050> see

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
so it doesn't break easily you can see

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.930 
so it doesn't break easily you can see
that<00:01:20.470> I've<00:01:20.590> already<00:01:20.860> started

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
that I've already started

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.030 
that I've already started
now<00:01:22.210> this<00:01:22.420> tends<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.140> work<00:01:23.320> better<00:01:23.560> if<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:24.010> use

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
now this tends to work better if you use

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.220 
now this tends to work better if you use
a<00:01:24.520> lightweight<00:01:24.970> fabric<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:26.050> it's<00:01:26.170> a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
a lightweight fabric and it's a

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.140 
a lightweight fabric and it's a
combination<00:01:26.500> between<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:27.250> running<00:01:27.640> stitch<00:01:27.850> and

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
combination between a running stitch and

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.480 
combination between a running stitch and
a<00:01:28.210> whip<00:01:28.450> stitch<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.590> you're<00:01:29.980> going<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.250> come<00:01:30.460> up

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
a whip stitch so you're going to come up

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.640 
a whip stitch so you're going to come up
from<00:01:30.910> behind<00:01:31.120> on<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:31.570> wrong<00:01:31.750> side<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.290> then

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
from behind on the wrong side and then

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.140 
from behind on the wrong side and then
come<00:01:32.830> up<00:01:32.860> on<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.250> right<00:01:33.460> side<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:33.880> you're<00:01:34.000> not

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
come up on the right side so you're not

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.510 
come up on the right side so you're not
going<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.450> be<00:01:34.540> hidden<00:01:34.660> behind<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:36.340> you're

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
going to be hidden behind then you're

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.300 
going to be hidden behind then you're
going<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.700> do<00:01:36.910> a<00:01:36.940> series<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.660> running<00:01:38.020> stitches

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
going to do a series of running stitches

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.620 
going to do a series of running stitches
so<00:01:39.310> I'm<00:01:39.400> going<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.580> do<00:01:39.640> my<00:01:39.760> first<00:01:39.790> stitch<00:01:40.360> and

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
so I'm going to do my first stitch and

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.690 
so I'm going to do my first stitch and
I'm<00:01:41.140> doing<00:01:41.530> them<00:01:41.680> about<00:01:42.040> a<00:01:42.070> quarter<00:01:42.550> of<00:01:42.640> an

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
I'm doing them about a quarter of an

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.150 
I'm doing them about a quarter of an

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
inch away from the folded edge so that's

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.950 
inch away from the folded edge so that's
this<00:01:45.430> running<00:01:45.760> stitch<00:01:45.970> right<00:01:46.180> here<00:01:46.240> quarter

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
of an inch away from this edge I'm going

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.570 
of an inch away from this edge I'm going
to<00:01:49.420> go<00:01:49.510> down<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:52.650> then<00:01:53.650> I'm<00:01:53.890> going<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.130> come<00:01:54.400> up

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.430 
so in between each of my blue marks I
can<00:02:04.240> fit<00:02:04.479> about<00:02:04.900> two<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:05.950> three<00:02:05.979> stitches<00:02:07.440> so

one more time to kind of secure it

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.780 
one more time to kind of secure it
usually<00:03:11.410> what<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.800> to<00:03:11.920> do<00:03:12.070> is<00:03:12.250> I'll<00:03:12.459> pull

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
fingers to hold it when I do my second

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.199 
fingers to hold it when I do my second
one<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:20.110> don't<00:03:20.200> want<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.500> pull<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.680> too<00:03:20.830> tight

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
one you don't want to pull it too tight

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.600 
one you don't want to pull it too tight
because<00:03:22.209> then<00:03:22.600> it'll<00:03:22.959> start<00:03:23.380> really<00:03:24.130> pulling

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
because then it'll start really pulling

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.370 
because then it'll start really pulling
at<00:03:24.820> these<00:03:25.180> other<00:03:25.360> running<00:03:25.600> stitches<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.260> then

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
at these other running stitches and then

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.680 
at these other running stitches and then
it'll<00:03:26.620> start<00:03:26.800> cinching<00:03:27.340> together<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.090> it'll

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
it'll start cinching together and it'll

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.560 
it'll start cinching together and it'll
create<00:03:28.870> creases<00:03:29.200> like<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.450> just

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
create creases like that so you just

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.970 
create creases like that so you just
want<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.750> be<00:03:31.840> very<00:03:32.050> gentle<00:03:32.320> with<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.590> all<00:03:32.890> right

it's<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.880> little<00:03:52.150> bit<00:03:53.370> more<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.959> can<00:03:55.989> see<00:03:56.410> the

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
it's a little bit more you can see the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.880 
it's a little bit more you can see the
mistakes<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.100> little<00:03:57.370> bit<00:03:57.660> easier<00:03:58.660> with<00:03:59.049> a<00:03:59.320> non

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
mistakes a little bit easier with a non

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.170 
mistakes a little bit easier with a non
matching<00:04:00.220> thread<00:04:00.610> but<00:04:00.850> if<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.030> use<00:04:01.150> a

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
matching thread but if you use a

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.699 
matching thread but if you use a
matching<00:04:01.600> thread<00:04:01.630> it's<00:04:02.170> definitely<00:04:02.560> going<00:04:02.650> to

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
matching thread it's definitely going to

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.720 
matching thread it's definitely going to
look<00:04:02.860> a<00:04:02.950> lot<00:04:03.070> better<00:04:04.920> okay<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.160> then<00:04:06.519> when<00:04:06.700> I

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
look a lot better okay and then when I

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.180 
look a lot better okay and then when I
come<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.030> my<00:04:07.120> blue<00:04:07.330> mark<00:04:07.739> I'm<00:04:08.739> going<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:08.980> come

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.469 
goes around to the back up to the front
about<00:04:23.979> right<00:04:24.280> where<00:04:24.550> that<00:04:24.820> thread<00:04:25.120> is<00:04:25.150> coming
