00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
with the the jt8d - 219 engine so it's

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.889 
with the the jt8d - 219 engine so it's
really<00:00:35.579> quite<00:00:35.910> conventional<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.719> we've

really quite conventional and we've

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
really quite conventional and we've

and then from that time it'll be a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.620 
and then from that time it'll be a
five-year<00:01:43.680> program<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.610> market<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.180> don't

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
five-year program to market I don't

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.569 
five-year program to market I don't
expect<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.350> under<00:01:46.649> these<00:01:46.770> conditions<00:01:47.399> we're

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
expect that under these conditions we're

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.210 
expect that under these conditions we're
going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.000> announce<00:01:48.329> an<00:01:48.899> OEM<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.530> probably<00:01:49.829> at

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
going to announce an OEM for probably at

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.539 
going to announce an OEM for probably at
least<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.579> year<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.380> would<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.710> about<00:01:53.490> a

least a year so that would be about a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.139 
least a year so that would be about a

the fuselage out of conventional metal

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.250

we've<00:02:41.769> limited<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.489> speed<00:02:42.790> 21.6<00:02:43.480> Mach<00:02:43.930> and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
we've limited the speed 21.6 Mach and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.290 
we've limited the speed 21.6 Mach and

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.690 
manufacturers it would be very unbiased
to<00:03:37.329> have<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.750> bad<00:03:38.680> experience<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.430> think

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
to have that bad experience so I think

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.190 
to have that bad experience so I think
it<00:03:39.760> does<00:03:39.910> speak<00:03:40.030> well<00:03:40.359> for<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.720> interest<00:03:41.079> in

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
it does speak well for the interest in

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.880 
it does speak well for the interest in
the<00:03:41.290> airplane
