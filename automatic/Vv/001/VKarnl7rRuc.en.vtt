00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.820
 look at the new game from the company 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.370
 gameplay called tank battles bye 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.280
 game insight wargaming are working on 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.320
 for their large scale projects 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.289
 dedicated to the battle of tanks gay loft decided 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.170
 don't bother and did enough 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.000
 simple but interest some kind of tank 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.590
 online or car 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 and so let's see what we have here 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.960
 There is generally on style main menu she 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.649
 reminds other games of this company 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.129
 and we have a world war here it 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.219
 such kind of fights that like me 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.370
 understood last week and it is announced there 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.829
 some strongest character and that is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.840
 the player can continue to watch the leaders 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.879
 you can see your friends 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.120
 Login with facebook or 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.910
 google plus and the save will not 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.559
 will be synchronous and will be separate if 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.390
 you will play through google plus you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.000
 will be some save if through 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.100
 facebook then others so if you 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.040
 want to have friends there and there 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.040
 unfortunately then you have to have different 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.020
 preservation of this very sad could not 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.060
 how do you integrate further with us 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.630
 There is a section of the company in which you 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.000
 about 80 missions to go even 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.610
 a little more and then there is a section 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.220
 skirmish is also multiplayer mode 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.290
 but here you yourself create a map or 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.869
 You can join already created 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.329
 battles you have goals that you 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.939
 can go and get it 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.650
 extra reward 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.820
 further there is naturally a shop here you 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.600
 can buy different types of weapons 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.520
 sets for tank turret guns more precisely 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.720
 caterpillar hull 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.070
 and of other weapons and here 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.460
 such a number of different guns 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.820
 shells and tracks that you can create 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.580
 a combination of more precise combinations can be 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.800
 about 90 thousand but it is so stated 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.340
 developers but it was calculated 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.200
 by simple mathematical 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.570
 computing but i guess i got the message 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.330
 lingered let's look at the company 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.670
 then how implemented 10 grams and here on 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.709
 the map you have displayed your friends hto 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.709
 what mission are you on 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.590
 and you can see them immediately her 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.230
 compete with her screw on ber typing 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.980
 more points than they can here 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.989
 also play your friend's tank for 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.600
 it is necessary to choose him go and 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.720
 press a special type button there 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.700
 play a tank game with a friend so 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.880
 control to communicate using the joystick 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.250
 on the left side of the screen and using tapas 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.280
 where are we going to dig in that direction will 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.430
 shoot our tank accordingly your 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.890
 aim to destroy all tanks on this 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.380
 locations and collect as many coins as possible 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.530
 and there are also tasks allowed 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.930
 destroy all all buildings that are 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.269
 are available and meet at a certain time 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.400
 that's what I didn't like about this game 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:14.890
 so this control if the graphics itself 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.130
 gameplay possible and interesting 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.250
 especially if you play all these bands 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.070
 multiplayer 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.430
 but management terribly grieved me 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.890
 the joystick seemed to me terribly uncomfortable and 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.549
 it would be better for shooting done 2 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.100
 joystick and would make as if zubastik 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:37.870
 shooter but no developers decided what 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.450
 it will be easier to shoot with tapas in that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.670
 direction where we want to shoot me 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.370
 it seems erroneous and in vain so 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.739
 the developers have done in this game to you 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.890
 necessary as for money 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.099
 protect the eagle so its tanks your 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.480
 the enemies did not destroy well 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.209
 multiplayer mode which i probably 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.980
 I will not show you because for 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.290
 it just doesn't make sense to you 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.200
 need for some time to fill 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.959
 as many frags here such here 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.480
 a toy called the battle of tanks from 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.910
 gameplay seems to us she 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.000
 free on google play market 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.340
 you pass the company open new types 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.280
 armor caterpillars armor towers and make 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.520
 your tank just invulnerable compete 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.350
 with friends, well, I guess I think 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.190
 there are lovers who this game 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.770
 like, but how can I have a good toy 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.770
 but the management is extremely grieving
