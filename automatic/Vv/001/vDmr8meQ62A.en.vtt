what<00:01:43.049> 90<00:01:43.350> pound<00:01:43.590> pull-ups<00:01:44.130> will<00:01:44.310> feel<00:01:44.520> like

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
what 90 pound pull-ups will feel like

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.999 
what 90 pound pull-ups will feel like
once<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.619> back<00:01:46.649> to

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
once I do that and then I go back to

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.889 
once I do that and then I go back to
doing<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> weights<00:01:47.520> I'm<00:01:47.729> used<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> using<00:01:48.270> even

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
doing the weights I'm used to using even

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
doing the weights I'm used to using even
a<00:01:49.049> 45<00:01:49.470> pound<00:01:49.680> plate<00:01:50.009> or<00:01:50.220> god<00:01:50.369> forbid<00:01:50.579> body

weight on the pull-ups I can let my body

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.399 
weight on the pull-ups I can let my body
fly<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:54.000> I've<00:01:54.149> got<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.540> confidence<00:01:55.049> in

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
fly because I've got the confidence in

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.109 
fly because I've got the confidence in
my<00:01:55.979> ability<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> lift<00:01:56.549> more<00:01:56.759> than<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.090> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
my ability to lift more than what I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.700 
my ability to lift more than what I
thought<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.390> could<00:01:57.689> they've<00:01:58.140> got<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> ability

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
thought I could they've got the ability

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.620 
thought I could they've got the ability
to<00:01:58.890> actually<00:01:59.219> feel<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.850> I'm<00:02:00.270> stronger<00:02:00.600> than

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
to actually feel like I'm stronger than

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.749 
to actually feel like I'm stronger than
it<00:02:00.840> was<00:02:00.869> because<00:02:01.829> I'm<00:02:01.950> lifting<00:02:02.250> far<00:02:02.490> less<00:02:02.729> than

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it was because I'm lifting far less than

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.209 
it was because I'm lifting far less than
my<00:02:03.030> subsequent<00:02:03.360> work<00:02:03.659> sets<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.979> most

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
my subsequent work sets so the most

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.249 
my subsequent work sets so the most
important<00:02:05.640> thing<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.360> start

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
important thing you can do is start

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.690 
important thing you can do is start
allowing<00:02:07.500> your<00:02:07.710> body<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.039> feel<00:02:08.310> what<00:02:08.489> strong

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
allowing your body to feel what strong

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.729 
allowing your body to feel what strong
is<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:09.509> stronger<00:02:10.020> than<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.410> think<00:02:10.619> you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
is be stronger than what you think you

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.050 
is be stronger than what you think you
are<00:02:10.830> by<00:02:11.489> allowing<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.970> by<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.480> feel

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
are by allowing you by to feel

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.490 
are by allowing you by to feel
how<00:02:13.150> strong<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.599> really<00:02:13.630> are<00:02:13.900> take<00:02:14.470> a

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
how strong you really are take a

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.440 
how strong you really are take a
slightly<00:02:14.890> heavier<00:02:15.099> weight<00:02:15.459> utilize<00:02:16.270> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
slightly heavier weight utilize the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.910 
slightly heavier weight utilize the
isometric<00:02:16.840> position<00:02:17.470> remember<00:02:17.680> guys

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
isometric position remember guys

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.320 
isometric position remember guys
isometric<00:02:18.610> strength<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:19.000> going<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.239> be

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
isometric strength is going to be

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.910 
isometric strength is going to be
greater<00:02:19.599> than<00:02:19.750> your<00:02:20.110> concentric<00:02:20.680> strength

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
greater than your concentric strength

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.949 
greater than your concentric strength
ever<00:02:21.099> will<00:02:21.340> be<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:21.970> take<00:02:22.270> advantage<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.870> that

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
ever will be so take advantage of that

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.930 
ever will be so take advantage of that
give<00:02:23.620> strong<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.190> your<00:02:24.280> isometric<00:02:24.819> position

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
give strong in your isometric position

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.880 
give strong in your isometric position

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
hold it you're in a usually a safe

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.710 
hold it you're in a usually a safe
position<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.489> bail<00:02:27.700> if<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:27.970> have<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.270> bail<00:02:28.480> and

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
position to bail if you have to bail and

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.630 
position to bail if you have to bail and
then<00:02:29.290> go<00:02:29.440> back<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.650> perform<00:02:30.130> your<00:02:30.190> concentric

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
then go back and perform your concentric

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.070 
then go back and perform your concentric
sets<00:02:30.880> it's<00:02:31.300> going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.510> make<00:02:31.599> a<00:02:31.630> big<00:02:31.900> difference

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
sets it's going to make a big difference

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.650 
sets it's going to make a big difference
in<00:02:32.500> how<00:02:32.680> fast<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.430> start<00:02:33.700> bumping<00:02:34.510> up<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
in how fast you can start bumping up the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.120 
in how fast you can start bumping up the
weights<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.050> you're<00:02:35.200> using<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.709> therefore

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
weights that you're using and therefore

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.370 
weights that you're using and therefore
start<00:02:36.580> packing<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> lot<00:02:37.239> more<00:02:37.269> size<00:02:37.630> guys

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
start packing on a lot more size guys
