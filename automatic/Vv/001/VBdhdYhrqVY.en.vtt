00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:12.570
 when we will need two pictures of 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.420
 these are me I made it a cardboard 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.630
 dunk a lot of these that look 12 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.490
 x 12 and 1 of this that I have done in 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.289
 cardboard that could also be in 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 cardboard perfectly but I 've done it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.800
 in cardboard that measures 12 by 12 equal 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.029
 but have 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.340
 one centimeter on each side and what 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.210
 we will cut 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.570
 we will also need sticks 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.920
 of pallets or cones or of what 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.750
 you obviously find a picture 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.420
 any decoration that you 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.719
 want to put you 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.879
 and I bought this spray that is with 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.380
 the turquoise color that I'm going to 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.430
 paint the sticks 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.970
 and we will need also 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.000
 a silicone gun 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.160
 Let's start with the first thing 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.460
 we will answer our little box 12 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.080
 by 12 that has one centimeter of each 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.610
 side which has a hole in the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.740
 half this is the one that we will start 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.520
 what we will start doing is putting 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.520
 the sticks 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.789
 two sticks 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.950
 On each side 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.800
 ah 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.930
 Y 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.030
 well now the next thing I'll do 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.950
 it will be 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.630
 the back that will just hit the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.410
 top part we will not stick it just the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.510
 downstairs 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.510
 we will start to stop this 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.319
 Y 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.390
 thus 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.040
 for the next thing I do will be 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:00.569
 paste this back 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.569
 thus 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.109
 d 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.520
 what's left, boy? 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.550
 Now what I 'm going to do will be 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.920
 paint it I paint it and I return the many 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.230
 As I'm getting good here, I've already 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.550
 finished in the end I decided to paint it 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:50.550
 as well as old as I have done with 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:55.849
 paint a black I've tapped 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:05:00.529
 for everything so the institute that quotes 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.869
 and it has left a very old style 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.020
 pretty and I've put the two butterflies 

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:07.599
 that give a little color 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.229
 as there was as you see that it transmits 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.940
 spray color that is here that I already know 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.099
 I have shown but I did not like how 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.030
 it was then already I decided to paint it of 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.630
 black 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.030
 and I stay this way 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.740
