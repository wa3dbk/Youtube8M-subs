two<00:02:06.789> so<00:02:07.789> this<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.390> thrown<00:02:09.020> unto<00:02:09.229> them<00:02:09.379> which<00:02:10.310> is

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
two so this is thrown unto them which is

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.770 
two so this is thrown unto them which is
you<00:02:10.640> know<00:02:10.729> it's<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:10.879> good<00:02:11.000> thing<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.540> long

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
you know it's a good thing it's a long

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.990 
you know it's a good thing it's a long
dagger<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.500> can't<00:02:12.770> really<00:02:12.980> go<00:02:13.310> wrong<00:02:13.340> with

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
dagger you can't really go wrong with

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.229 
dagger you can't really go wrong with
that<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.420> makes<00:02:14.629> it<00:02:14.840> very<00:02:15.080> easy<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.590> use<00:02:16.010> as<00:02:16.879> far

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
that it makes it very easy to use as far

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.819 
that it makes it very easy to use as far
as<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.629> know<00:02:17.720> using<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.080> as<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.200> main<00:02:18.410> weapon<00:02:18.560> it

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
as you know using it as a main weapon it

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.619 
as you know using it as a main weapon it
makes<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.129> lot<00:02:19.219> easier<00:02:19.579> than<00:02:19.790> say<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.269> normal

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
makes it a lot easier than say a normal

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.509 
makes it a lot easier than say a normal
dagger<00:02:21.049> because<00:02:21.349> it's<00:02:21.620> longer<00:02:21.859> it<00:02:22.159> makes<00:02:22.340> it

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
dagger because it's longer it makes it

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.880 
dagger because it's longer it makes it
you<00:02:23.180> know<00:02:23.209> easier<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.930> hit<00:02:24.049> with<00:02:24.200> make<00:02:24.530> sense

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
you know easier to hit with make sense

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.940 
you know easier to hit with make sense
right<00:02:25.099> um<00:02:25.939> I<00:02:26.689> would<00:02:26.989> have<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.140> say<00:02:27.409> that<00:02:27.739> the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
right um I would have to say that the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.670 
right um I would have to say that the
biggest<00:02:28.370> row<00:02:28.939> of<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:29.480> weapon<00:02:29.870> like<00:02:30.469> all

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
biggest row of this weapon like all

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.679 
biggest row of this weapon like all
daggers<00:02:31.159> would<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.700> won't<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.269> aim<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.599> say

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
daggers would of won't like aim and say

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.030 
daggers would of won't like aim and say
all<00:02:32.870> because<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.230> mithras<00:02:33.620> bent<00:02:33.829> blade

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
all because of mithras bent blade

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.770 
all because of mithras bent blade
although<00:02:35.019> anyway<00:02:37.060> anyway<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.180> biggest<00:02:38.480> pro

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
although anyway anyway the biggest pro

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.630 
although anyway anyway the biggest pro
of<00:02:39.019> this<00:02:39.319> dagger<00:02:39.590> would<00:02:39.950> definitely<00:02:40.459> be

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
of this dagger would definitely be

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.780 
of this dagger would definitely be
without<00:02:40.999> a<00:02:41.209> doubt<00:02:41.540> it's<00:02:41.840> critical<00:02:42.409> damage

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
without a doubt it's critical damage

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.970 
without a doubt it's critical damage
most<00:02:43.790> daggers<00:02:44.239> have<00:02:44.599> stupidly<00:02:45.290> high<00:02:45.560> critical

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
most daggers have stupidly high critical

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.459 
most daggers have stupidly high critical
damage<00:02:46.219> I<00:02:46.549> don't<00:02:47.329> know<00:02:47.480> why<00:02:47.629> it<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.900> poison<00:02:48.290> moss

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:48.469 
damage I don't know why it a poison moss

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.059 
damage I don't know why it a poison moss
there<00:02:48.829> and<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.930> critical<00:02:51.349> damage<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.859> what

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
there and that critical damage is what

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.949 
there and that critical damage is what

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
other than backstab fishing so that's

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.270 
other than backstab fishing so that's
always<00:03:25.609> a<00:03:25.730> good<00:03:25.790> thing<00:03:26.739> yes<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.099> damage

the<00:03:30.829> biggest<00:03:31.249> pro<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.969> the<00:03:32.090> weapon

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
the biggest pro of the weapon

the biggest pro of the weapon
I<00:03:32.620> hit<00:03:33.620> easily<00:03:34.400> easily<00:03:35.260> 1500<00:03:36.260> damage<00:03:36.379> on<00:03:36.680> a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
critical so you know it's kind of

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.080 
critical so you know it's kind of
something<00:03:39.499> that<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.739> don't<00:03:40.040> want<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.519> really

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
something that you don't want to really

you know be hit with other than that the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.920 
you know be hit with other than that the
fact<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.099> this<00:03:46.219> is<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.939> third<00:03:47.510> longest

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930

dagger<00:03:48.200> in<00:03:48.379> the<00:03:48.499> game<00:03:48.680> would<00:03:48.980> definitely<00:03:49.430> be<00:03:49.609> a

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
dagger in the game would definitely be a

its damage output

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.950 
its damage output
really

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
really

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.629 
really
in<00:04:30.169> comparison<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.919> other<00:04:31.039> daggers<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
in comparison to the other daggers the

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.760 
in comparison to the other daggers the
more<00:04:31.789> damaging<00:04:32.150> ones<00:04:32.360> is<00:04:32.570> quite<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.470> bit<00:04:33.620> lower

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
more damaging ones is quite a bit lower

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.070 
more damaging ones is quite a bit lower
with<00:04:34.729> the<00:04:34.759> shadow<00:04:35.060> dagger<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.690> with<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.900> normal

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.659 
with the shadow dagger and with a normal
dagger<00:04:36.440> actually<00:04:36.710> I've<00:04:36.979> gotten<00:04:37.250> attack

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
dagger actually I've gotten attack

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.650 
dagger actually I've gotten attack
rating<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.150> right<00:04:38.419> around<00:04:38.740> 280<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:41.090> that's

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
rating of right around 280 so that's

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.810 
rating of right around 280 so that's
kind<00:04:42.169> of<00:04:42.380> saying<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:42.949> bet<00:04:43.130> I<00:04:43.160> mean<00:04:43.370> those<00:04:43.580> have

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
kind of saying a bet I mean those have

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.120 
kind of saying a bet I mean those have
about<00:04:44.270> 60<00:04:44.690> more<00:04:44.780> damage<00:04:45.139> which<00:04:45.320> in<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.860> long

about 60 more damage which in the long

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.430 
about 60 more damage which in the long
run<00:04:46.400> will<00:04:46.639> end<00:04:46.970> up<00:04:47.120> being<00:04:47.360> quite<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.780> bit<00:04:48.050> if<00:04:48.229> you

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
run will end up being quite a bit if you

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.550 
run will end up being quite a bit if you
do<00:04:48.710> get<00:04:49.100> a<00:04:49.130> critical<00:04:49.639> I<00:04:49.870> mean<00:04:50.870> that<00:04:51.020> 60<00:04:51.410> damage
