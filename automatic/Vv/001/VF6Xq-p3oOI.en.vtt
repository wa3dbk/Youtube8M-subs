00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.980
 now because short fuvest that the 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.940
 today things just 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.160
 to happen 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.260
 one of the things that involves biology 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.880
 in this area were the Olympiads of 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.010
 London leads people already said 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.800
 before then something and athletes 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.840
 drive is and fuvest like to see and 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.600
 interaction between biological systems 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.769
 in the part of human and animal physiology 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.540
 compared 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.449
 so we are betting on 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.780
 nervous system and muscular system 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.600
 Beauty is fast, crying if you remember the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.440
 nervous system is based on the neuron 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.229
 neuron is formed by well shouts 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.879
 cell body and this axon 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.070
 large extension here 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.960
 generally the axon sony is coated by 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.470
 that the vanilla sheath cells 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.790
 certain myelin that is not continuous 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.299
 there are some holes in it here that are 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.340
 the nodules and rangers and this increases the 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.119
 pulse propagation velocity 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.460
 nervous 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.270
 remembering nervous impulse it comes from a 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.259
 neuron to another give us britos pass 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.170
 by the cell body and follows the axon 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.659
 in the final direction beauty then what 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.270
 people have in the nervous system neurons and 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.549
 do not forget the neighboring cells to 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.490
 others that help the neurons called 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.149
 of microblog cells or cells from the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:58.490
 glia beauty with regard to the impulse 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:01.100
 nervous look what you do, my handle 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.640
 here we have a certain neuron in two 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.159
 situations positively charged from the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.500
 on the outside and negatively on the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.319
 inside the sonic axn membrane beauty 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.990
 that you are seeing the neuron here 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.400
 Resting neurons without doing anything else 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.150
 This my name he does not stay like that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.140
 it works and it 's not a blond neuron it 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.370
 go to work 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.470
 that's where it starts coming here 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.640
 in the cell body a stimulus 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.250
 I believe that this stimulus 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.350
 giving really coming and going and 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.819
 he will growing stimulus is growing 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.590
 growing up 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.600
 when he arrives at a certain moment 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:49.770
 it hits what we call threshold 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.200
 and spread nervous impulse forward 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.100
 how does this pump out sodium and 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.400
 potassium 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.510
 they open their sodium channels 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:04.830
 large amount of sodium in the membrane 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:08.970
 and this from here reverses the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.970
 right polarity we say it occurs 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.970
 a decolonization of the axn membrane 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.200
 sony stays positive in here and 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:23.160
 negative that was the beauty and this is 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.170
 spreads in this sense here in the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.420
 sense here why it goes 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.330
 happening because immediately 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.140
 after the only keyway sodium channels 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.900
 to enter 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.630
 they block it from occurring 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.060
 process again 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.700
 immediately after such treatment the 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.140
 potassium channels open and potassium 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.260
 is present in large amounts 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.670
 here inside the sony membrane begins to 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.570
 leave 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.180
 this exit causes the repolitization of 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.269
 the membrane and then the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.360
 excess sodium also returning to normal 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.870
 resting resting potential is the 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.380
 action potential for potential loss of 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:12.570
 potential rest of action and so on. 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:15.269
 The impulse will travel, it will travel until 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.910
 get there at the end of axn nih 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.539
 neodi it will spread itself or to another 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:25.380
 neuron oprah some organ effect to pain 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.760
 such as muscles speaking of 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.220
 muscles 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:34.289
 let's talk about it specifically the 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.470
 musician in case here what we want 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.710
 skeletal striated muscle is formed 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.849
 by elongated cells called fibers 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.340
 muscle 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.889
 they are premiered because they have 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.330
 this sad 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.770
 see right salts located here in 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.139
 of muscle cell 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.479
 these striations are therefore due to the 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.849
 positioning of the proteins of 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.379
 sets already time the zina that stay there 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.659
 within the cell that are responsible 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:06.919
 by the process of muscle contraction 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:11.389
 garden is not for that and thanks to 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:14.090
 nervous system stimulus that you are 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:18.699
 of the bustling there much 2 more 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.979
 understood how this bagasse works 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:23.270
 So here we have one. 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.120
 relaxed muscle 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.180
 I have two groups of molecules to 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.120
 mozilla comprising filaments 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.000
 and actin comprising the 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.419
 filaments being the active ones 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.270
 linked by a network 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.110
 protect beauty by enlarging people here 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.449
 see this 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.050
 You see that the little heads of myosin 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:51.139
 they are wilted then doing nothing 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.659
 hence a stimulus happens a 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.009
 release of calcium and large amounts 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:58.719
 from atp 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:03.710
 calcium leaves the myosin bum 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:07.279
 She got tatinha and then she gets up is 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:12.669
 Tadinho raises the mozilla molequinha 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:16.509
 raised she pulls the tub to fit 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:20.949
 understood it's a muscle 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:25.399
 relaxed muscle contracted muscle 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:28.659
 relaxed contracted muscle raises 

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:33.379
 small heads pulls the chitin molecules 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:37.099
 to top it're seeing O compares here 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:39.169
 the size of the contraction unit 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:43.699
 muscle that we call charkh the 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:46.189
 number is less 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:48.939
 the smallest here are millions of 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:51.800
 times in your cells consequently 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:54.889
 when you get the musician he goes 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:58.190
 increase in volume and decrease in size 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.750
 good beja contracted muscle that goes 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.810
 happen now 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.930
 releasing potassium into the cell 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:10.760
 muscular that will give a bicam each in the 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:15.550
 calcium and pull the muse head 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:19.480
 and then she releases actin in the muscle relaxes 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:22.460
 beauty but now who has to relax is 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:26.300
 your head then puts your nervous system 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:30.530
 to operate the muscular system 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:37.250
 there in the proof of the right fuvest and there it will give 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:38.600
 Someone detonates their own beauty a hug to 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.740
 you 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.990
 I hope we have contributed 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:45.080
 for you to improve your performance 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:48.110
 in the fuvest test because it is not a 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.680
 seven- headed animal and can rely on 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:52.810
 the people 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.810
 A hug for you until the next
