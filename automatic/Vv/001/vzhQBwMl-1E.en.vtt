00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
basically for the PC games I look at the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.709 
basically for the PC games I look at the
game<00:00:11.040> settings<00:00:11.580> options<00:00:12.000> first<00:00:12.210> because<00:00:12.540> my

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
game settings options first because my

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.690 
game settings options first because my
channel<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.349> very<00:00:13.620> focused<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:14.130> PC<00:00:14.549> hardware

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
channel is very focused on PC hardware

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.640 
channel is very focused on PC hardware
and<00:00:15.089> whatnot<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.719> really<00:00:16.109> look<00:00:16.260> at<00:00:16.379> how<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
and whatnot I really look at how the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.470 
and whatnot I really look at how the
game<00:00:16.920> runs<00:00:17.250> how<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:17.940> kind<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.180> different

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
game runs how what kind of different

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.760 
game runs how what kind of different
settings<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.840> game<00:00:19.050> has<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.740> know

the consoles the developers are usually

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.279 
PC I'm right here this is kind of
depressing<00:00:47.250> graphics<00:00:47.940> let's<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.200> can

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
depressing graphics let's see if we can

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.709 
depressing graphics let's see if we can
get<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.559> again<00:00:49.829> low<00:00:50.219> medium<00:00:50.789> high<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.030> extra

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
get it again low medium high and extra

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.840 
get it again low medium high and extra
that<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:51.930> piss-poor<00:00:52.770> there's<00:00:53.250> nothing<00:00:53.730> like

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that is piss-poor there's nothing like

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.119 
that is piss-poor there's nothing like
anti-aliasing<00:00:54.840> there's<00:00:55.050> nothing<00:00:55.469> like<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
anti-aliasing there's nothing like you

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.490 
anti-aliasing there's nothing like you
know<00:00:56.160> textures<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.809> vague<00:00:58.199> it's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
know textures it's just so vague it's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.930 
know textures it's just so vague it's
low<00:00:58.680> medium<00:00:59.039> high<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.219> extra<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> really

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
low medium high and extra and I really

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.310 
low medium high and extra and I really
don't<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.510> game<00:01:00.690> developers<00:01:01.199> do

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
don't like that one game developers do

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
don't like that one game developers do
that<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> real<00:01:02.100> rush<00:01:02.399> job<00:01:02.760> from<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.329> from

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that it's a real rush job from the from

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.719 
that it's a real rush job from the from
the<00:01:04.140> developers<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.979> really<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the developers and I really like one a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.520 
the developers and I really like one a
game<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.150> know<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.450> graphics<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.439> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
game you know has graphics but then it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
game you know has graphics but then it
goes<00:01:07.650> more<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:07.950> depth<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:08.520> texture

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
goes more in depth with like texture

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.899 
goes more in depth with like texture
shadows<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.380> high-res<00:01:11.100> textures<00:01:11.729> do

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
shadows you know a high-res textures do

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.800 
shadows you know a high-res textures do
you<00:01:12.000> want<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:14.479> physics<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.689> know

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you want this that a a physics you know

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840 
you want this that a a physics you know
all<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.140> stuff<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.520> sorely

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
all this stuff and this is sorely

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.370 
all this stuff and this is sorely
missing<00:01:18.270> from<00:01:18.450> Deadpool<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.960> was<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.259> be

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
missing from Deadpool it was to be

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.340 
missing from Deadpool it was to be
expected<00:01:19.590> because<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> game's<00:01:20.630> very<00:01:21.630> low

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
expected because of the game's very low

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
expected because of the game's very low
budget<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.850> know<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.180> disappointing

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
budget and you know it's disappointing

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
budget and you know it's disappointing
and<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> how<00:01:25.439> good<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> game<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.250> think

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
and because of how good the game I think

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.179 
and because of how good the game I think
is<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.869> them's<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> brakes

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
is but you know it's them's the brakes

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.280 
is but you know it's them's the brakes
the<00:01:29.490> game<00:01:29.640> had<00:01:29.880> such<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> low<00:01:30.329> budget<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.930> the

they're kind of the same thing it's just

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.450 
they're kind of the same thing it's just
mainly<00:02:58.080> upgrades<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.770> do<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.220> have
