 February 4 third day in the garden the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.700
 second that we are working and being 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.179
 currando let's go we've come for 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.240
 come home because you know that day 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.819
 of the year and it snows in bilbao day of the year 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.279
 that snows in bilbao and curds is the day 

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:22.949
 that we had programmed to come and finish 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.520
 to be cutting the garden and you can see that 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.560
 it is impossible to take a dip 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.210
 nothing that we move something is going to eat us 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.830
 mud is going to eat us the snow is going to 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.180
 eating the cold will eat us rita the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.490
 demon 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.560
 and whoever else wants to come then 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.150
 well tomorrow we will come to do each 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.970
 download and download materials 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.640
 and you could see we will try to come tomorrow 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.680
 and have improved the thing or the day that 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.840
 it snows in bilbao it becomes the two 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.840
 days that deny in bilbao come to art 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.980
 good as you can see there have been some small 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.840
 modifications here in the garden the other 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.250
 day by climatological issue we could not 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.620
 do any kind of video is 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.040
 It's raining snowing, organizing this 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.690
 looked like 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.360
 a fight zone and good as 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:24.390
 we would have bought around 15 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:28.770
 240 long pallets we have made a 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.460
 little tourism that better not teach if 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.730
 that's better to teach, there's a lot more 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.890
 rust that we would like for later 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:42.650
 complete the theme of the terraces by 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.940
 another side we have 225 liters here 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.100
 that weighs his own why he has stayed 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.040
 in the ditch on the other hand we have bought 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.570
 this paragraph in this video to be done 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.140
 some bolos cars and many do not forgive 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.110
 for water of 210 liters 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.630
 with proposals of sheets to make 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.969
 our little ones 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.360
 rest areas and water recovery 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.870
 caught we have bought 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.250
 the bales of straw one was dismantled in 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.750
 the way but nothing happens 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.670
 a taste comes to your site 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.860
 some will be thinking so that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.319
 we want the pallets then we go to 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.010
 ask jurgen why the 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.870
 we want and in what to which destination it ends 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.760
 In what destination do they end? 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.310
 well as was mentioned before much 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.760
 commented before which are 240 of 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.340
 long for 1 20 and well here we have the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.799
 measure of 120 and this is to generate the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.629
 balkans to notice nailing and others 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.740
 somehow we have saved ourselves the 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.140
 more dirty work 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.470
 then when cutting in a certain way 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.190
 the pallet we got what would be the side 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.630
 short and with the stringers with half 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.250
 from one we would make a side and another 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.250
 cost more 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.040
 cutting we have saved in time 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.660
 and in money because this if you buy it at 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.760
 you have to buy all the 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.680
 slats load them have them already measured 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.960
 from home change if the design is 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.150
 based on 120 and multiples on 120 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:28.430
 x 240 that are our firewood terraces 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.430
 catch cut it would nail more at a good price 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.280
 of the ballet 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.940
 in this way 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.780
 to visualize the terrain that we have 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.780
 of plantation as you see we have used 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.260
 a panel 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.900
 two pallets 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.900
 the corners would be the 3rd voucher 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.800
 begin to 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.490
 staking nothing to do about 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.920
 holes for 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.380
 the woods in intermediate and if 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.390
 I would place 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.010
 then we want to put a geotextile 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.760
 in such a way that makes us this 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.850
 enclosure and the earth does not go 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.270
 and well the principle this is what 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.270
 we have 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.740
 every camera 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.360
 I dream if I see myself 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.129
 but here 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.259
 but it also brings a couple of corpses 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.259
 make it clear that we have bought everything
