to<00:01:53.000> extract<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:53.480> I<00:01:53.720> suggest<00:01:54.350> getting<00:01:54.560> wins

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
to extract this I suggest getting wins

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.500 
to extract this I suggest getting wins
it<00:01:54.890> cuz<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.160> looks<00:01:55.280> cooler<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.120> once<00:01:56.300> you<00:01:56.420> have

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
it cuz it looks cooler so once you have

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.410 
it cuz it looks cooler so once you have
one<00:01:56.720> zip<00:01:56.960> right<00:01:57.290> click<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.650> that's<00:01:57.830> w7<00:01:58.460> SBC<00:01:58.970> and

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
one zip right click on that's w7 SBC and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.540 
one zip right click on that's w7 SBC and
click<00:01:59.600> on<00:01:59.750> winzip<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:00.530> click<00:02:01.010> extract<00:02:01.400> to

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
click on winzip and click extract to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.130 
click on winzip and click extract to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
viewing this right now I'll try this one

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.089 
viewing this right now I'll try this one
now<00:03:05.599> when<00:03:06.019> it<00:03:06.140> does<00:03:06.319> it<00:03:06.500> he<00:03:06.650> restarts
