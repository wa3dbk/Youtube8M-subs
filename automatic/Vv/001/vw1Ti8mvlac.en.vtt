spider-man movie six-inch line this is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.090 
spider-man movie six-inch line this is
probably<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.160> most<00:00:42.290> underwhelming<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
probably the most underwhelming not a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.819 
probably the most underwhelming not a
terrible<00:00:44.760> figure<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> great<00:00:46.289> figure

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
terrible figure but not a great figure

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.160 
terrible figure but not a great figure
either<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.550> understand<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> movie<00:00:48.840> figure

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
either I understand as a movie figure

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.950 
either I understand as a movie figure
they've<00:00:49.320> gone<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.800> more<00:00:49.950> realistic

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
they've gone for more realistic

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.020 
they've gone for more realistic
proportions<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.680> yeah<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> don't<00:00:53.670> remember

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
proportions to it yeah I don't remember

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.619 
proportions to it yeah I don't remember
Andrew<00:00:54.989> Garfield<00:00:55.890> looking<00:00:56.789> quite<00:00:57.239> this

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
Andrew Garfield looking quite this

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.610 
Andrew Garfield looking quite this
slight<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.949> costume<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.590> personally<00:01:01.590> I

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
slight in the costume and personally I

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
slight in the costume and personally I
think<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.309> figure<00:01:02.699> would<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:02.969> benefited

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
think the figure would have benefited

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.740 
think the figure would have benefited
from<00:01:03.930> being<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.439> bit<00:01:04.710> more<00:01:04.920> stylized<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
from being a bit more stylized in the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.850 
from being a bit more stylized in the
sculpted<00:01:07.560> proportion<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.640> terms<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.210> realism

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
sculpted proportion in terms of realism

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.460 
sculpted proportion in terms of realism
the<00:01:10.860> sculpted<00:01:11.610> textured<00:01:12.360> detail<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the sculpted textured detail to the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.899 
the sculpted textured detail to the
figure<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.070> very<00:01:14.520> well<00:01:15.049> observed<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.909> if

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
figure is very well observed and if

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.380 
figure is very well observed and if
you're<00:01:18.439> inclined<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.009> way<00:01:20.159> of

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
you're inclined in the way of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.480 
you're inclined in the way of
customizing<00:01:21.390> I'm<00:01:21.600> sure<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.290> wash<00:01:22.680> over<00:01:23.040> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
customizing I'm sure a wash over this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.090 
customizing I'm sure a wash over this
figure<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.090> bring<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.100> detail

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
figure would bring out the detail

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.480 
figure would bring out the detail
patterned<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.360> costume<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.439> well<00:01:28.920> not

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
patterned in the costume really well not

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.569 
patterned in the costume really well not
quite<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:30.060> big<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> bone<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.140> contention<00:01:31.280> as<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
quite as big a bone of contention as the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.880 
quite as big a bone of contention as the
lizards<00:01:32.939> lack<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.450> snow<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.290> movie<00:01:34.680> but

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
lizards lack of snow in the movie but

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.450

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
watching the movie I didn't notice them

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.889 
watching the movie I didn't notice them

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
why are running through its length to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.660 
why are running through its length to
make<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.660> poseable<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:17.130> alas<00:02:17.600> no<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:19.490> guess<00:02:20.490> an

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
make it poseable but alas no I guess an

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.700 
make it poseable but alas no I guess an
option<00:02:21.240> for<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.600> whipping<00:02:21.930> web<00:02:22.110> line<00:02:22.320> is<00:02:22.530> you

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
option for the whipping web line is you

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.560 
option for the whipping web line is you
could<00:02:22.860> always<00:02:23.070> hang<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.790> spider-man<00:02:24.240> and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
could always hang the spider-man and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.350 
could always hang the spider-man and
figure<00:02:24.900> from<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.490> create<00:02:26.730> some<00:02:27.210> of

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
figure from it so you can create some of

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.160 
figure from it so you can create some of
that<00:02:27.510> infamous<00:02:28.170> web<00:02:29.070> swinging<00:02:29.700> action<00:02:30.170> so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
that infamous web swinging action so

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.510 
that infamous web swinging action so
I'll<00:02:31.350> just<00:02:31.530> quickly<00:02:31.860> go<00:02:32.220> over<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
I'll just quickly go over the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520 
I'll just quickly go over the
articulation<00:02:33.300> on<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.720> figure<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.230> head

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
articulation on the figure the head
