00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.109
 facing the aja 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.529
 18 hours 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:15.019
 facing this kind of urgency 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.220
 guided tour or less than half an hour of visit 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.220
 its amount will be his weapon and without violence 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.220
 he's a helicopter pilot 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.220
 but who was mercenaries probably before 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.880
 the German who will reconstitute a small team to make a robbery 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.600
 a gold mine that will not happen as planned obviously not taken 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.630
 this is where we are a little kepler 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.490
 that the galley begins there will still be class and after they have gold 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.300
 what are you doing 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.090
 of this gold cooper in the jungle walk it must go all the way said 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.250
 everyone dependents tributary except that 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.010
 my character they were a little more greedy side cruel and cynical but 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.930
 he has an excuse he was a great man 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.890
 but totally disillusioned and disillusioned 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.670
 and the people we are ideals who lost in June are making 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.190
 conformity to wheat and misanthropes in general for machine-back ramon 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.930
 so so I'm the bed is obviously bastard of the movie but if you come across a 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.100
 little do you realize 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.700
 the character will have passed disorder now uncertain the future 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.290
 his very very compromised voice maybe this little withdrawal 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.600
 the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.780
 the restaurateur in the tarn 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.010
 a little bit 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.470
 and then decides to transform in August anyway and decides to make a 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.720
 new puzzle before pretending that he was still robbers have 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.550
 open ringers of blows stuffed around the world 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.160
 whether it was mainly 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.300
 the communal bomba 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.990
 the only genre film like Jerome Fillol proposes to win 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.670
 seats 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.799
 she resumes service to make a robbery of one another at the end of 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.020
 morning at afp 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 via 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.960
 speed 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.559
 team 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.559
 the tragedy is proposed 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:21.959
 I went through this film 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.649
 in a happiness in a total serenity 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.249
 even though I was vigilant towards myself vis-à-vis other years of 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.939
 solidarity 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.040
 who yesterday again for the general at all filming 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.389
 and even more because we have a mutual help 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:36.749
 because we have the roma 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.779
 hornain I am a little more even when we eat at home I was barely missed 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.979
 karate club confessed to china for people and that the interview has brought 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:48.290
 pictures bédarieux for people and that around between salies cinema and not 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:52.409
 just in trench floor with justice that come who will quote with 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.839
 the years and not idir is exposed in China 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.289
 the 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:00.739
 so all that in reality still quite respectable things 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:03.779
 che 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.609
 and more days ferrier 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.609
 for the head of state 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.059
 but if it's not the president 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.059
 propose to test 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.959
 if it happens quickly 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.319
 physically we spoke with the staff I always felt that the 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.939
 their 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.749
 jungle and rainforest 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.779
 but something did not feel like an aspect not for me 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:31.739
 but for 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.540
 in e skin there were no arguments 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.060
 there was a draw and a comrade khider 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.420
 declined to a memory that is a type but for whom I have a lot 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.649
 admiration 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:43.950
 because he's one of the people who can write the script 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.069
 m he is 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.739
 as ambitious as this one he had to realize that is to say to arrive at the 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.899
 do it because it's not the cold breeze that sowed 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.599
 be something or see guys 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.589
 we women who are able to make laugh 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.219
 he is part of it 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:59.089
 likewise nothing else 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.629
 it's been rich 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.329
 I liked a lot of scenarios 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.879
 all the many characters 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.700
 and I knew I had to understand myself 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.019
 this forest 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.559
 we go around in circles as we hoped we would go everywhere 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:12.089
 that is to say 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.389
 all the serious studies it's so complicated it's so 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.949
 the different you are so 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:18.859
 in the midst of them 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.079
 of a nature that is hostile finds is not done to reach 106 8 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:22.969
 hours 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.520
 since a solidarity in the group to 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.949
 and you live a little 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.969
 what are you going to think of them when you decided to do this job? 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.859
 that is to say having a solidarity of a group who live an adventure still 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.719
 that you can live elsewhere but it is especially true in 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.129
 sundance jean-dominique I think patrick oak has fallen since not bad 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.770
 years had passed by estimating these formidable 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.300
 all companies will have the choice according to him 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.349
 Side Teen Santamaria I may be a match at the mans him because he is handsome 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.669
 as a god and colored alain and married which I respect but that I 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.370
 finds that she has extraordinary courageous actions because 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.830
 she first did a beating a year ago 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.270
 and go there she never complained pursue the rebels refuse to go 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.270
 go out 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.559
 it is also not the money service appreciable 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.139
 the story 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.770
 that's for sure is that those who have not had the opportunity and who have not been 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.949
 occasionally 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.080
 to take a trip to the region 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.610
 in any case face Parisians 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.009
 a pillar it is the firm because not having spent these two and a half months 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.439
 really in the jungle 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.710
 at the beginning of the screening of the film itself 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.129
 I'm going from a lesson 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.110
 the work that was done 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.180
 that's exactly what we experienced 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.350
 the first league and traveling miramont it's a human adventure and 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.520
 scientist 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.440
 % and unique cinematic j always want to see the movies I 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.050
 play 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.290
 but I was never so excited to see a movie I had played 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:56.619
 I am Swiss 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.619
 if the civil party 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:04.479
