00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.640

there's a purple LED inside will cycle

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.870 
there's a purple LED inside will cycle
through<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.490> button<00:02:09.940> press<00:02:10.149> sounds<00:02:11.880> crack

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
through the button press sounds crack

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.370 
through the button press sounds crack
open<00:02:13.650> crack<00:02:14.650> close<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:17.020> clicky<00:02:17.260> noises<00:02:17.350> again

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.340 
open crack close the clicky noises again
alternate<00:02:20.380> clicky<00:02:20.740> noises<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.480> then<00:02:23.080> it

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
alternate clicky noises and then it

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.090 
alternate clicky noises and then it
repeats<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.910> pretty<00:02:25.360> simple<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:28.920> there's<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
repeats so pretty simple and there's the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.560 
repeats so pretty simple and there's the
button<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.490> wasn't<00:02:30.850> ready<00:02:31.000> for<00:02:31.060> but<00:02:31.420> we'll

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
button that wasn't ready for but we'll

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.870 
button that wasn't ready for but we'll
go<00:02:31.690> ahead<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.960> for<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.260> anyway<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.190> is<00:02:36.250> 15

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
go ahead and for it anyway so this is 15

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.270 
go ahead and for it anyway so this is 15
and<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:38.020> is<00:02:38.260> its<00:02:38.590> let's<00:02:38.890> bring<00:02:39.070> in<00:02:39.190> our

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
and that is its let's bring in our

00:02:39.280 --> 00:03:02.429 
and that is its let's bring in our
single<00:02:39.700> key<00:02:39.820> driver

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.880 

so<00:03:03.439> there's<00:03:03.590> actually<00:03:03.799> no<00:03:04.069> 15<00:03:05.000> arms

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
so there's actually no 15 arms

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.589 
so there's actually no 15 arms
announcement<00:03:06.890> because<00:03:07.269> 15<00:03:08.269> doesn't<00:03:08.480> really

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
announcement because 15 doesn't really

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.539 
announcement because 15 doesn't really
have<00:03:08.870> arms<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.409> skull<00:03:09.709> falls<00:03:10.010> on<00:03:10.220> his<00:03:10.370> head

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
have arms the skull falls on his head

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.809 
have arms the skull falls on his head
and<00:03:10.790> then<00:03:10.939> he<00:03:11.390> becomes<00:03:12.140> common<00:03:12.950> at<00:03:13.159> 15<00:03:13.579> so

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
and then he becomes common at 15 so

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.610 
and then he becomes common at 15 so
there's<00:03:14.000> no<00:03:14.120> actual<00:03:14.480> like<00:03:14.569> arms<00:03:14.900> unfolding<00:03:15.500> or

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
there's no actual like arms unfolding or

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.460 
there's no actual like arms unfolding or
anything<00:03:15.769> like<00:03:16.069> that<00:03:16.099> so<00:03:17.090> he<00:03:17.750> doesn't<00:03:18.379> really

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
anything like that so he doesn't really

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.589 
anything like that so he doesn't really
have<00:03:18.620> any<00:03:19.220> sort<00:03:19.519> of<00:03:19.579> arms<00:03:19.939> even<00:03:20.120> though<00:03:20.269> he<00:03:20.359> can

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
have any sort of arms even though he can

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.420 
have any sort of arms even though he can
use<00:03:20.810> arm<00:03:21.079> changes<00:03:21.620> with<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.859> legend<00:03:22.159> riders

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
use arm changes with the legend riders

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.920 
use arm changes with the legend riders
but<00:03:22.730> that's<00:03:22.909> a<00:03:23.060> completely<00:03:23.420> different<00:03:23.659> topic

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
but that's a completely different topic

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.899 
but that's a completely different topic
he<00:03:24.680> does<00:03:24.829> have<00:03:25.040> these<00:03:25.159> three<00:03:25.430> standard

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
he does have these three standard

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:57.000 
he does have these three standard
finishers

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.470 

and<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:58.490> is<00:03:58.870> that<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:01.790> course<00:04:02.090> having<00:04:02.450> the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
and that is that of course having the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.720 
and that is that of course having the
faceplate<00:04:03.050> we<00:04:03.230> can<00:04:03.410> now<00:04:03.530> officially<00:04:03.950> make

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
faceplate we can now officially make

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:22.720 
faceplate we can now officially make
this<00:04:04.940> look<00:04:05.239> correct<00:04:21.310> so<00:04:22.310> that's<00:04:22.370> always<00:04:22.639> fun

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
this look correct so that's always fun

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.030 
this look correct so that's always fun
as<00:04:23.030> well<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.840> course<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.169> 15<00:04:24.440> Moxie<00:04:24.800> does

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
as well and of course the 15 Moxie does

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.710 
as well and of course the 15 Moxie does
have<00:04:25.310> compatibility<00:04:25.940> with<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.180> mousou<00:04:26.480> Sabre

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720

and other such weapons and of course

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.310 
and other such weapons and of course

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
just because these mix forms are always

00:04:51.320 --> 00:05:17.700 
just because these mix forms are always
fun

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.559

the Toki's you're special which wasn't
really<00:05:49.039> canon<00:05:49.789> anyway<00:05:50.409> so<00:05:51.409> it<00:05:51.889> really<00:05:52.039> comes

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
really canon anyway so it really comes

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.469 
really canon anyway so it really comes
down<00:05:52.370> one<00:05:52.639> of<00:05:52.699> those<00:05:52.789> things<00:05:52.969> that<00:05:53.150> it's<00:05:53.360> not

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
down one of those things that it's not

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.240 
down one of those things that it's not
entirely<00:05:53.990> necessary<00:05:54.319> for<00:05:54.860> an<00:05:54.949> in<00:05:55.069> show

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
entirely necessary for an in show

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.709 
entirely necessary for an in show
collection<00:05:55.490> but<00:05:55.939> it's<00:05:56.090> always<00:05:56.240> well<00:05:56.479> I<00:05:56.509> think

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:56.719 
collection but it's always well I think

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:58.689 
collection but it's always well I think
that's<00:05:56.870> really<00:05:56.990> cool<00:05:57.229> to<00:05:57.409> have<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:58.009> I<00:05:58.219> really

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
that's really cool to have and I really

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.369 
that's really cool to have and I really
dig<00:05:58.909> it<00:05:59.060> like<00:05:59.479> I<00:05:59.569> said<00:05:59.750> the<00:05:59.870> sounds<00:06:00.139> are<00:06:00.229> neat

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
dig it like I said the sounds are neat

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.350 
dig it like I said the sounds are neat
and<00:06:00.529> then<00:06:01.279> it's<00:06:01.460> probably<00:06:01.759> worth<00:06:01.909> taking<00:06:02.330> a

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
and then it's probably worth taking a

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.119 
and then it's probably worth taking a
look<00:06:02.539> at<00:06:02.719> if<00:06:02.960> you<00:06:03.080> can<00:06:03.199> find<00:06:03.439> it<00:06:03.590> for<00:06:03.740> a<00:06:03.800> pretty

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:04.129 
look at if you can find it for a pretty

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.700
