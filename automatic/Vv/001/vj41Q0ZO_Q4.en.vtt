I<00:01:50.530> bet<00:01:50.920> there's<00:01:51.190> people<00:01:51.369> out<00:01:51.610> there<00:01:51.820> that<00:01:51.940> feel

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
I bet there's people out there that feel

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.510 
I bet there's people out there that feel
the<00:01:52.180> same<00:01:52.479> way<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:53.229> this<00:01:54.010> was<00:01:54.160> my<00:01:54.310> first

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
the same way so this was my first

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.969 
the same way so this was my first
experience<00:01:54.880> with<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.240> craft<00:01:55.570> booth<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.200> I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
experience with a craft booth and I

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.620 
experience with a craft booth and I
never<00:01:57.460> felt<00:01:57.910> like<00:01:57.970> I<00:01:58.119> would<00:01:58.270> have<00:01:58.360> enough

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
never felt like I would have enough

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.210 
never felt like I would have enough
stuff<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:58.930> fill<00:01:59.110> one<00:01:59.440> up<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.800> I<00:01:59.890> would<00:02:00.040> never

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
stuff to fill one up and I would never

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.490 
stuff to fill one up and I would never
have<00:02:00.400> enough<00:02:00.610> time<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:01.270> stockpile<00:02:01.720> enough<00:02:01.990> to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
have enough time to stockpile enough to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.520 
have enough time to stockpile enough to
fill<00:02:02.800> up<00:02:03.040> one<00:02:03.310> by<00:02:03.490> myself<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.630> when<00:02:05.110> my<00:02:05.260> friend

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
fill up one by myself so when my friend

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.750 
fill up one by myself so when my friend
and<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.740> came<00:02:05.920> up<00:02:05.979> with<00:02:06.040> this<00:02:06.250> idea<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.610> do<00:02:06.729> it

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
and I came up with this idea to do it

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.130 
and I came up with this idea to do it
together<00:02:06.940> I<00:02:07.240> thought<00:02:07.510> oh<00:02:07.660> I<00:02:07.720> could<00:02:07.990> actually

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
together I thought oh I could actually

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.590 
together I thought oh I could actually
probably<00:02:08.770> do<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:09.070> and<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.000> we<00:02:10.119> kind<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.420> set

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
probably do that and so we kind of set

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.699 
probably do that and so we kind of set
out<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.899> do<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:13.030> know<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:14.170> turns<00:02:14.440> out

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
out to do it and you know it turns out

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.770 
out to do it and you know it turns out
maybe<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.880> was<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> wrong<00:02:16.240> venue

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
maybe it was the wrong venue

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.190 
maybe it was the wrong venue
maybe<00:02:17.550> our<00:02:18.550> type<00:02:19.060> of<00:02:19.090> things<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:20.050> were

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
maybe our type of things that we were

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.070 
maybe our type of things that we were
selling<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.769> had<00:02:21.190> some<00:02:21.550> box<00:02:22.360> couches<00:02:22.810> zip
