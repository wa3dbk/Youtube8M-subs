grapevine and I have a quick video today

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.680 
grapevine and I have a quick video today
to<00:00:06.240> share<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.990> really<00:00:07.230> big<00:00:07.560> AHA<00:00:08.069> that<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.639> had<00:00:09.000> in

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
to share a really big AHA that I had in

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.200 
to share a really big AHA that I had in
regards<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.530> questions<00:00:11.250> being<00:00:11.519> asked<00:00:12.120> about

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
regards to questions being asked about

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.330 
regards to questions being asked about
the<00:00:12.480> difference<00:00:12.630> between<00:00:13.070> far<00:00:14.070> infrared

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the difference between far infrared

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.820 
the difference between far infrared
saunas<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.770> conventional<00:00:16.770> saunas<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.779> I

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
saunas and conventional saunas and I

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.029 
saunas and conventional saunas and I
realized<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.449> probably<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> most

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
realized that probably the most

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.040 
realized that probably the most
significant<00:00:23.039> difference<00:00:23.730> between<00:00:24.390> these<00:00:24.660> two

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
significant difference between these two

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.759 
significant difference between these two
therapies<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.970> fact<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.420> as<00:00:27.810> soon<00:00:28.590> as

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
therapies is the fact that as soon as

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.880 
therapies is the fact that as soon as
you<00:00:28.920> turn<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.730> far<00:00:30.090> infrared<00:00:30.140> unit<00:00:31.140> you

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you turn on a far infrared unit you

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.770 
you turn on a far infrared unit you
immediately<00:00:32.759> begin<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> get<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> health

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
immediately begin to get the health

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.680 
immediately begin to get the health
benefits<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.059> especially<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.390> sauna

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
benefits of it and especially in a sauna

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.530 
benefits of it and especially in a sauna
situation<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.590> lot<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.920> folks<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.270> know

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
situation a lot of folks we we know

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.979 
situation a lot of folks we we know
already<00:00:40.020> we're<00:00:40.320> associating<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.219> idea<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
already we're associating the idea that

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.410 
already we're associating the idea that
sweating<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.260> toxins<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:45.030> good<00:00:45.210> for

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
sweating out toxins is really good for

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.270 
sweating out toxins is really good for
us<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.260> true<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.129> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
us and this is true this is this is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.950 
us and this is true this is this is
being<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:47.969> proven<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.629> very

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
being you know proven to be very

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.299 
being you know proven to be very
beneficial<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
beneficial so we think that we have to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.040 
beneficial so we think that we have to
get<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> sauna<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> just

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
get in the sauna and we have to just

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.950 
get in the sauna and we have to just
sweat<00:00:55.500> bucket<00:00:56.070> loads<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.550> water<00:00:56.820> off<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.480> then

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
sweat bucket loads of water off and then

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
sweat bucket loads of water off and then
during<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.440> time<00:00:58.829> we're<00:00:59.430> releasing<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
during that time we're releasing the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.689 
during that time we're releasing the
toxins<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.649> true<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
toxins and that's true for the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.560 
toxins and that's true for the
conventional<00:01:03.359> sauna<00:01:03.750> model<00:01:04.379> however<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.909> far

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
that in the idea that's becoming toxic

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.120 
that in the idea that's becoming toxic
and<00:02:21.920> unwell<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.180> sick<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.320> full<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.590> disease

down and overloaded with toxins okay if

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.570 
down and overloaded with toxins okay if
we<00:02:33.440> flush<00:02:33.820> those<00:02:34.820> toxins<00:02:35.500> every<00:02:36.500> day<00:02:36.740> then

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
we flush those toxins every day then

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.180 
we flush those toxins every day then
they<00:02:38.330> then<00:02:38.810> it's<00:02:38.990> not<00:02:39.170> sticking<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.860> us<00:02:40.010> it's

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
they then it's not sticking to us it's

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.420 
they then it's not sticking to us it's
not<00:02:40.340> accumulating<00:02:41.300> overtime<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.190> adding<00:02:43.190> to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
the body burden of what we have to go

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.960 
the body burden of what we have to go

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
through and live in this toxic world so

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.540 
through and live in this toxic world so
as<00:02:50.720> soon<00:02:51.020> as<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.290> flip<00:02:51.530> my<00:02:51.560> switch<00:02:51.710> put<00:02:52.430> my

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
as soon as I flip my switch put my

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.090 
as soon as I flip my switch put my
heating<00:02:52.790> pad<00:02:52.940> on<00:02:53.090> boom<00:02:53.600> nice<00:02:54.080> low<00:02:54.470> temperature

so<00:02:55.370> I'm<00:02:55.610> not<00:02:55.790> getting<00:02:55.970> hot<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:56.450> sweaty<00:02:56.720> while

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
so I'm not getting hot and sweaty while

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.840 
so I'm not getting hot and sweaty while
I<00:02:57.050> sit<00:02:57.320> here<00:02:57.350> I'm<00:02:57.950> gonna<00:02:58.310> get<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.670> health

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
I sit here I'm gonna get the health

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.780 
I sit here I'm gonna get the health

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
heating us up or in the case of a sauna

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.870 
heating us up or in the case of a sauna
it's<00:03:33.560> going<00:03:33.740> to<00:03:33.800> heat<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.160> air<00:03:34.190> up<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:34.790> then

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
it's going to heat the air up and then

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.960 
it's going to heat the air up and then
that<00:03:35.030> becomes<00:03:35.650> convection<00:03:36.650> heat<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.370> then

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
that becomes convection heat and then

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.200 
that becomes convection heat and then
that<00:03:38.300> stimulates<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.440> more<00:03:40.340> sweating<00:03:40.790> and

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
that stimulates a more sweating and

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.170 
that stimulates a more sweating and
flushing<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.500> it's<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.220> completely<00:03:43.850> different

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
flushing so it's a completely different

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.070 
flushing so it's a completely different
principle<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.080> it<00:03:45.530> needs<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.610> heat<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.450> order

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
principle and it needs the heat in order

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.220 
principle and it needs the heat in order
