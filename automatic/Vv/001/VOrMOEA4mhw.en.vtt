00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.879
 elevation then go gambled 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.379
 the first leg of this final of 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:16.269
 promotion does not complicate the situation for 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.269
 the emerald team in this first game 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:26.430
 it is an enchantment to find the goal 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:29.140
 the equipment is important 11 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.140
 the team is prepared for these 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.540
 party things and that's why the people 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.900
 loses is the most important game of 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.900
 your career 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.660
 one worked hard all year 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.930
 to get to this instance and it happens to me 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.930
 this 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.350
 in the strength and desire that you have to 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.870
 I'll play to support him and good 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.020
 generates anger in the chest and more if obvious 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.110
 what do you think young to the last 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.640
 match of the tournament the part of yesterday 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.020
 I thought the coincidence that I did not face 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.400
 the first game and it was the last in 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.310
 road tower 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.680
 and this and nothing are things that happen to 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.560
 Sometimes I do not know if it was or was not for 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.370
 redirect as they say but like him 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.960
 said that I'm going away from the power of time 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.150
 I think I tell you a little bit so that 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.030
 Cast when you go through this you can 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.630
 sleep sebastian 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.850
 that is, I do not know how to tell you 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.590
 I want to cry 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.820
 but you can not put yourself in that moment 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.070
 because this moment when bad team 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.990
 you need everyone's support and when 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.470
 strength that we have and we have to take in 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.090
 team at this time and the team is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.170
 prepared apart from that we all have 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.170
 a desire to play 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:57.259
 the people the real fans 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.840
 do not apologize because you never 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.549
 await this situation and to support the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.229
 support team a team that the team 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.920
 have to take it out and with the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.720
 support is what they think of as fans and 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.910
 what they do is give it back 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.080
 lion that do not want you to hacienda that no 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.630
 come to the court that stays in the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.280
 house and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.130
 and that really the people who have 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.140
 feelings for the team that comes to 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.420
 football the first time not of this series 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.280
 of the final of the ascent there is a goal of 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.230
 disadvantage but I was commenting it and the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.630
 confidence not to come back lion so what 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.830
 has shown in the tournament 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.960
 and I think it's a moment 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.600
 of reflection on our part especially 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.740
 by 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.520
 in a match that was not there 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.520
 we have done better 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.160
 and knowing that we come to play at home 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.750
 with friends is a tough rival 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.130
 although we are already at the head of life 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.030
 and that's the first thing he thinks when 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.030
 happens the sebastian more 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.800
 the earthquake is easy at 200 beats 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.150
 has evidently been brought a 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.150
 fatigue of several parties 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.230
 that it's hard to hold back with so many 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.610
 accusations 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.510
 but the first thing that comes to mind 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.340
 more 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.090
 many thanks seve for bringing them 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.090
 traffickers
