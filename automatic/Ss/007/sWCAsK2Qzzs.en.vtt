00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello dear, I would have half a day today 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.799
 kilo i've been asked why 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.020
 I do not consume dairy products 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.170
 Niklas also has his james today 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.030
 started or half talent 30 days 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.410
 long to dispense with dairy products 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.730
 I've been doing it since faith 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.270
 I'm four years old, I do that because of it 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.260
 I do not like to eat dairy products 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.430
 first of all what namely products namely 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.039
 everything that belongs to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.240
 and if I do not tell dairy products 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 I constantly get the questions also no 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.989
 cheese no quark, no yes everything 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.910
 What dairy products or anything 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.640
 Do not imagine what many products are 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.040
 Of course not that with dairy products 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.790
 I do not eat and why I 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.500
 at least try to try 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.070
 So to let a certain time directly 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.200
 is or can be very diverse 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.540
 once it is that it is the well-known 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.590
 lactose behind intolerance like many 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.930
 can then affect the milk intolerance 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.259
 lifestyle milk protein or casein 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.189
 intolerance and to the third and whole 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.389
 certainly the last one the hormones 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:13.350
 cow's milk is contained in the man 

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:17.279
 not from can or others 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.179
 hormonal processes then in the body 

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:21.479
 occur 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.439
 which is not created for that is so 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.969
 hard to explain you will notice yourself 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.159
 easily stammer 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:27.959
 There are many many arguments for that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.490
 There are many arguments that speak 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:34.229
 on the other hand, dairy products also speak 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.679
 to refrain from doing so 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.659
 Therefore my call or my tip 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.029
 So make a little one 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.859
 reduction diet , that's what it means 

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:46.319
 you're not sure if you mind 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.389
 is allergic or not or whether one 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.999
 this product or food 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:53.630
 may or not easy 30 days is one 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:56.489
 good 100 period to give up 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.319
 omit completely and then after 30 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.609
 For the first time, how are you? 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.349
 as it is in these days 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:03.989
 initial performance lead a small diary 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.549
 and then slowly after and this 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:09.240
 life pictures of this product again like 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.920
 once for the diet if you 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.910
 determines that one 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.220
 the first day after the 30 days 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.310
 problem gets whatever 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.980
 maybe allergic symptoms otherwise 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.599
 how uncomfortable gastroenterology damisch 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.430
 be headache or him like that 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.050
 Of course there may be other reasons as well 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.310
 but most likely it is 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.140
 then this product is what you call it 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.459
 has omitted for the time being the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.430
 body comes down again and that there 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.170
 so again that introduces a very complete 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.000
 big tip not only milk products 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.160
 but also other products in which one 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.630
 I'm not sure I'm allergic 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.100
 however, or I can ever times 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.510
 leave out and then reintroduce 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.420
 with me is what so I have the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.150
 left out products with it went afterwards 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.530
 actually better than ever 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.940
 That's why I said it okay 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.110
 no dairy anymore that's quasi 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.299
 with me as I said so I come 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.709
 she can tell you to let her go 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.840
 every case but what i do on everyone 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.549
 case can say is makes a little 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.420
 reduction target or 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.900
 leave it for a certain period of time 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.260
 away that will help you 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.819
 I hope that's what it was from me 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.380
 So that's the only reason 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.450
 why I'm the world class just this 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.950
 if much much better without it 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.810
 so I have no problems 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.359
 no cheese first no yoghurt quark 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.579
 that's all that's all one 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.410
 One certainly likes to get used to everything I have 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.760
 that helps, I hope that 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.549
 Responsible ask why I at 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.180
 Consume dairy products and we see 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.180
 us next time
