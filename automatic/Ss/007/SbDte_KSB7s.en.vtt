right<00:01:03.300> now<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.450> think<00:01:03.570> has<00:01:04.050> probably<00:01:04.410> got<00:01:04.680> more

more<00:01:06.360> grit<00:01:06.720> mid-corner<00:01:07.350> than<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> Ford<00:01:08.120> just

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
more grit mid-corner than the Ford just

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.490 
more grit mid-corner than the Ford just
seems<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.600> really<00:01:10.440> nicely<00:01:10.680> poised<00:01:12.500> where

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500

is<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.710> focus
