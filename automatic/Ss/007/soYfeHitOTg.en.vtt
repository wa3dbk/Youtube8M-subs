00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
336 so it's not too terribly high but

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.339 
336 so it's not too terribly high but
this<00:02:08.220> thing<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.580> still<00:02:08.759> capable<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.300> giving

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
this thing is still capable of giving

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.860 
this thing is still capable of giving
now<00:02:10.769> as<00:02:11.280> far<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.579> being<00:02:11.760> able<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.209> stun<00:02:12.629> with

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
now as far as being able to stun with

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.530 
now as far as being able to stun with
this<00:02:13.019> weapon<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:14.489> able<00:02:14.999> to<00:02:15.209> stun<00:02:15.389> people

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
this weapon it is able to stun people

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.599 
this weapon it is able to stun people
relatively<00:02:16.230> easily<00:02:16.409> stun<00:02:16.920> locking<00:02:17.400> them

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
relatively easily stun locking them

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.580 
relatively easily stun locking them
though<00:02:17.939> is<00:02:18.150> actually<00:02:18.510> quite<00:02:18.749> a<00:02:18.780> bit<00:02:18.959> more

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
though is actually quite a bit more

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.229 
though is actually quite a bit more
difficult<00:02:20.129> than<00:02:20.219> it<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.519> with<00:02:20.790> any<00:02:20.969> of<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
difficult than it is with any of the

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.599 
difficult than it is with any of the
lighter<00:02:21.480> faster<00:02:21.900> weapons<00:02:22.439> just<00:02:23.249> due<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.519> the

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
lighter faster weapons just due to the

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.300 
lighter faster weapons just due to the
fact<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:24.030> when<00:02:24.900> your<00:02:25.019> stun<00:02:25.290> locking<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:25.889> say

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
fact that when your stun locking in say

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.179 
fact that when your stun locking in say
Dark<00:02:26.639> Souls<00:02:26.849> 1<00:02:27.409> you<00:02:28.409> need<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.829> have<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> weapon

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
Dark Souls 1 you need to have a weapon

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.369 
Dark Souls 1 you need to have a weapon
with<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.609> right<00:02:29.790> swing<00:02:30.090> speed<00:02:30.420> you're<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.719> got

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
with the right swing speed you're it got

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.140 
with the right swing speed you're it got
to<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.530> able<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.769> do<00:02:31.859> a<00:02:31.889> combo<00:02:32.340> with<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.639> with

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
to be able to do a combo with it with

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.629 
to be able to do a combo with it with
this<00:02:33.389> it's<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:34.170> bit<00:02:34.409> more<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.159> challenge

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
this it's a bit more of a challenge

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.039 
this it's a bit more of a challenge
because<00:02:35.790> people<00:02:36.209> have<00:02:36.329> different<00:02:36.689> levels<00:02:36.959> of

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
because people have different levels of

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.899 
because people have different levels of
adaptability<00:02:37.620> they<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.129> roll<00:02:38.310> out<00:02:38.340> faster

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
adaptability they can roll out faster

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.000 
adaptability they can roll out faster
they<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.060> raise<00:02:39.299> their<00:02:39.329> shields<00:02:39.810> faster<00:02:40.290> or

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
they can raise their shields faster or

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.940 
they can raise their shields faster or
slower<00:02:41.370> depending<00:02:41.639> so<00:02:42.359> really<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.439> uh<00:02:43.560> it's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
slower depending so really it's uh it's

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.039 
slower depending so really it's uh it's
kind<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.340> hard<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.609> say<00:02:44.849> if<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.659> weapon<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:45.959> able

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
kind of hard to say if a weapon is able

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.530 
kind of hard to say if a weapon is able
to<00:02:46.200> stun<00:02:46.500> lock<00:02:46.650> or<00:02:46.919> not<00:02:47.159> at<00:02:47.579> least<00:02:47.819> with<00:02:48.030> this

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
to stun lock or not at least with this

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.809 
to stun lock or not at least with this
one<00:02:48.840> simply<00:02:49.650> due<00:02:49.919> to<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.400> fact<00:02:50.579> that<00:02:50.639> people

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
one simply due to the fact that people

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.449 
one simply due to the fact that people
have<00:02:51.030> different<00:02:51.150> adaptability<00:02:51.810> levels

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
have different adaptability levels

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.250 
have different adaptability levels
overall<00:02:53.459> though<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:54.060> would<00:02:54.719> say<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.989> this<00:02:55.079> is

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
overall though I would say that this is

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.189 
overall though I would say that this is
a<00:02:55.290> pretty<00:02:55.859> good<00:02:56.250> weapon<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.879> mean<00:02:57.329> I<00:02:57.569> don't<00:02:57.900> know

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:58.199 
a pretty good weapon I mean I don't know

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.270 
a pretty good weapon I mean I don't know
if<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:58.409> just<00:02:58.469> the<00:02:58.620> fact<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.889> I've<00:02:59.040> got<00:02:59.189> it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
if it's just the fact that I've got it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.360 
if it's just the fact that I've got it
at<00:02:59.370> +10<00:02:59.849> maybe<00:03:00.239> I'm<00:03:00.419> decent<00:03:00.659> at<00:03:00.870> PvP<00:03:01.409> but<00:03:02.069> I

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
at +10 maybe I'm decent at PvP but I

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.360 
at +10 maybe I'm decent at PvP but I
think<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.389> weapon<00:03:03.780> does<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.319> good<00:03:04.769> job<00:03:04.829> I

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
think that this weapon does a good job I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.399 
think that this weapon does a good job I
mean<00:03:06.000> yeah<00:03:06.359> I'm<00:03:06.510> getting<00:03:06.719> a<00:03:06.810> lot<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:06.959> criticals

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
mean yeah I'm getting a lot of criticals

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.439

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:09.449 
I mean I'm getting a lot of criticals

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.170 
I mean I'm getting a lot of criticals
they<00:03:09.659> are<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> huge<00:03:10.379> huge<00:03:11.219> factor<00:03:11.579> in<00:03:11.790> Dark

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
they are a huge huge factor in Dark

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.879 
they are a huge huge factor in Dark
Souls<00:03:12.359> 2<00:03:12.449> PvP<00:03:13.159> but<00:03:14.159> you<00:03:14.790> know<00:03:14.909> I<00:03:15.709> don't<00:03:16.709> really

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
Souls 2 PvP but you know I don't really

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.429 
Souls 2 PvP but you know I don't really
know<00:03:17.159> what<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.579> say<00:03:17.729> about<00:03:17.849> that<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.479> mean<00:03:19.049> there

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
know what to say about that I mean there

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.920 
know what to say about that I mean there
were<00:03:19.530> already<00:03:19.699> backstabs<00:03:20.699> parries<00:03:21.239> or<00:03:21.479> posts

were already backstabs parries or posts
and<00:03:22.109> all<00:03:22.199> that<00:03:22.439> but<00:03:23.040> then<00:03:23.159> they<00:03:23.250> had<00:03:23.370> them<00:03:23.519> in

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
and all that but then they had them in

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.069 
and all that but then they had them in
the<00:03:23.699> guard<00:03:23.909> break<00:03:24.120> or<00:03:24.329> post<00:03:24.509> sort<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:24.959> thing

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
the guard break or post sort of thing

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.960 
the guard break or post sort of thing
that<00:03:25.199> they've<00:03:25.319> got<00:03:25.470> going<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.129> you<00:03:26.849> know

that they've got going on and you know

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.140 
that they've got going on and you know
just<00:03:27.359> it's<00:03:30.349> kind<00:03:31.349> of<00:03:31.500> easier<00:03:32.340> if<00:03:32.639> you<00:03:32.790> are<00:03:32.970> able

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
just it's kind of easier if you are able

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.640 
just it's kind of easier if you are able
to<00:03:33.389> actually<00:03:33.540> do<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.109> guard<00:03:34.290> break<00:03:34.439> right

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650

to actually do the guard break right
there<00:03:34.859> I<00:03:34.889> was<00:03:35.009> trying<00:03:35.159> to<00:03:35.310> get<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.459> jumpin

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
there I was trying to get a jumpin

there I was trying to get a jumpin
plunge<00:03:36.329> attack<00:03:36.599> it<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:36.930> possible<00:03:37.379> to<00:03:37.409> do<00:03:37.590> it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
plunge attack it is possible to do it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.589 
plunge attack it is possible to do it
you'll<00:03:38.489> see<00:03:38.759> that<00:03:38.790> later<00:03:39.120> on<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.449> the<00:03:39.509> video

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
you'll see that later on in the video

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.469 
you'll see that later on in the video
and<00:03:39.959> that's<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.169> spoil<00:03:40.530> anything<00:03:40.769> but<00:03:41.479> one

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
and that's a spoil anything but one

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.969 
and that's a spoil anything but one
thing<00:03:42.659> I've<00:03:42.780> noticed<00:03:42.959> with<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.409> lot<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.680> people

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:43.979 
thing I've noticed with a lot of people

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.589 
thing I've noticed with a lot of people
and<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.519> know<00:03:44.579> this<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.909> turning<00:03:45.180> more<00:03:45.299> into<00:03:45.359> a

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
and I know this is turning more into a

damage this weapon did when two-handed
that's<00:04:58.789> something<00:04:59.120> that<00:04:59.240> needs<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.479> little<00:04:59.659> bit

00:04:59.769 --> 00:04:59.779 
that's something that needs a little bit

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.420 
that's something that needs a little bit
of<00:04:59.870> research<00:05:00.199> done<00:05:00.469> on<00:05:00.529> it<00:05:00.770> because<00:05:01.009> in<00:05:01.340> the

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
of research done on it because in the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.490 
of research done on it because in the
next<00:05:01.669> fight<00:05:01.819> you'll<00:05:02.029> see<00:05:02.599> what<00:05:02.870> happens<00:05:02.900> I<00:05:03.379> was

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500
