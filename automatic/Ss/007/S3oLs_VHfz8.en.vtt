going to be outside or traveling outside
for<00:00:35.969> any<00:00:36.059> length<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.450> time<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.680> way<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> go

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
for any length of time is the way to go

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.569

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
so butter creams are really good the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.040 
so butter creams are really good the
American<00:00:42.090> buttercream<00:00:42.270> which<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> real

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
American buttercream which is a real

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.490 
American buttercream which is a real

sweet rich rich heavy buttercream or you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.630 
sweet rich rich heavy buttercream or you
can<00:00:46.680> do<00:00:46.770> something<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.280> Swiss

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
can do something like a Swiss

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.760 
can do something like a Swiss
buttercream<00:00:47.879> which<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.510> very<00:00:49.050> heat<00:00:49.350> stable

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
buttercream which is very heat stable

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.319 
buttercream which is very heat stable
considering<00:00:50.579> how<00:00:50.700> light<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.149> is

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
considering how light it is

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.910 
considering how light it is
it's<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> meringue<00:00:51.960> base<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.649> really

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
it's a meringue base so it's really

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520 
it's a meringue base so it's really
light<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.250> fluffy<00:00:53.600> but<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.140> cook

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
light and fluffy but because you cook

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.779 
light and fluffy but because you cook
the<00:00:55.890> egg<00:00:56.070> whites<00:00:56.750> first<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.640> creates<00:00:59.640> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the egg whites first that creates that

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.369 
the egg whites first that creates that
stable<00:01:00.539> atmosphere<00:01:01.489> for<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.390> buttercream<00:01:03.750> in

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
stable atmosphere for the buttercream in

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
stable atmosphere for the buttercream in
Texas<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.400> tend<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> go<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> little

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
Texas we tend to go a little

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.760 
Texas we tend to go a little
half-and-half<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> butter<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
half-and-half on the butter and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.910 
half-and-half on the butter and
shortening<00:01:08.610> route<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.689> regular<00:01:10.560> butter

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
shortening route because regular butter

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.490 
shortening route because regular butter
just<00:01:11.460> amounts<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.570> falls<00:01:12.840> apart<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
just amounts it just falls apart and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.710 
just amounts it just falls apart and
melts<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:13.979> too<00:01:14.189> hot<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.540> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
melts it's too hot here so we have to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
melts it's too hot here so we have to
incorporate<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.290> little<00:01:16.439> bit<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.770> shortening

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
incorporate a little bit of shortening

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.670 
incorporate a little bit of shortening
into<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:18.960> stable

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
into it so that it's it's stable

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.399 
into it so that it's it's stable
fondants<00:01:20.670> another<00:01:20.909> good<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.810> when

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
fondants another good way to go when

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.760 
fondants another good way to go when
you've<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:23.210> heat<00:01:24.210> issues<00:01:24.720> fun<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> holds<00:01:25.650> up

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
you've got heat issues fun and holds up

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
you've got heat issues fun and holds up
really<00:01:26.040> really<00:01:26.369> well<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> heat<00:01:27.090> because

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
really really well in the heat because

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.710 
really really well in the heat because
there's<00:01:28.790> nothing<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.180> melt

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
there's nothing in it to melt

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.380 
there's nothing in it to melt
it's<00:01:30.930> basically<00:01:31.500> sugar<00:01:31.829> play-doh<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:33.180> it's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it's basically sugar play-doh so it's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.350 
it's basically sugar play-doh so it's
very<00:01:33.630> strong<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.500> very<00:01:34.530> stable<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.150> put

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
very strong it's very stable then we put

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.060 
very strong it's very stable then we put
that<00:01:36.390> over<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> buttercream<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.860> kind<00:01:38.040> of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that over the buttercream so it kind of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.370 
that over the buttercream so it kind of
insulates<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.180> inside<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> cake<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
insulates the inside of the cake and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.300 
insulates the inside of the cake and
keeps<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.860> cooler<00:01:41.130> also<00:01:41.909> doing<00:01:42.509> low<00:01:43.170> cakes

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
keeps it cooler also doing low cakes

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.929 
keeps it cooler also doing low cakes
the<00:01:44.759> taller<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.329> cake<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.170> more<00:01:46.939> problems

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the taller the cake the more problems

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.210 
the taller the cake the more problems
you<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.689> stability<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.979> heat

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you have with stability with the heat

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.539 
you have with stability with the heat
and<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.390> lot<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> weight<00:01:52.250> even<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.399> you

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and that's a lot of weight even if you

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.039 
and that's a lot of weight even if you
have<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:53.939> supports<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.840> lot

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
have your supports in there that's a lot

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.719 
have your supports in there that's a lot
of<00:01:55.110> weight<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.250> those<00:01:56.399> bottom

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
of weight to be going on those bottom

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.310 
of weight to be going on those bottom
tiers<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:58.100> heat<00:01:59.100> tends<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.820> work<00:02:00.479> against<00:02:01.079> you
