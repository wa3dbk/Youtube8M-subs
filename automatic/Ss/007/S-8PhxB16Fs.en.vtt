00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.810
 i 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.250
 the people who need plans 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.350
 food we can take from a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.460
 person who needs you transmitting and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.330
 he left it at 2 thousand 800 or 2500 and I can 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.340
 bring another one that needs 6000 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.610
 low food plans in 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.220
 carbohydrates and high in proteins are 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.220
 Nefarious for elite athletes 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.829
 they need a huge amount of 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.190
 carbohydrates normo protein and low 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.890
 fats but also afterwards they are heard 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.960
 saying good the cute sportsman but 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.700
 this will involve people who do not 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.830
 they do elite and they train all the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.530
 days for health or base need to go down 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.470
 of weight to feel healthy in that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.170
 is the problem is also serious because 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.020
 what is not known is not said is that 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.240
 people do not need plans and order 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.479
 coal to two but they have to be standard 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.570
 hydrocarbon and non - hydrocarbon to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.820
 what we call hydrocarbon standard 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.039
 let's do more or match with the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.470
 carbohydrates that consume or carry 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.300
 some example an athlete choose 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.200
 to twice a day or once a day 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.940
 every week you need between 75 and 10 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.580
 grams of carbohydrates per kilo of weight 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.280
 per day about two-thirds of them 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.060
 they are coal these complex bread dough 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.290
 rice and cereals 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:42.030
 oat flour is also in the fruits and 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.850
 vegetables and a third less than 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.100
 we could fine sugar that's our 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.170
 plan 8 7 8 11 and 10 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.259
 the type that you go to exercise to download 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.290
 of weight do not leave it below 45 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.500
 grams of carbohydrates kilos days and 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.040
 who give in the keys of the diets 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.330
 of slimming 152 grams of 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.130
 carbohydrates kilo days later what 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.280
 disguise with percentages 60 to 30 to 15 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.580
 40 30 30 what you want do not talk to me anymore 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.730
 of percentages tell me how many grams of 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.459
 kilo day weight carbohydrates fall into 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.400
 the food that I give him I will tell him what 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.550
 destination you have if you are a sportsman of 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.709
 moderate or high competition and has 7 5 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.540
 8 and 10 grams that the kilo kilo cat is 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.680
 with food supplementation 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.780
 carbohydrates will train and compete 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.540
 healthily for life if it 's a 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.730
 adult who exercises with overweight 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.190
 and I do train three or four times 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.950
 per week so low intensity 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.620
 column no intensity lower fat burning 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.300
 do not need so much coal lying for a 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.880
 reason the type does not have 60 50 or 45 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.520
 Minute kilogram of oxygen consumption weight 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.680
 time for being overweight has 20 25 and 30 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.740
 minutes milliliters and the fish with that 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.210
 oxygen consumption so low by more than 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.740
 you lower the intensity and burn 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.650
 predominantly fat what he is 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.510
 true is going to be glycogen liz and use of 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.250
 glucose and if you replace it with 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.680
 345 grams and the weights day after to 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.900
 keep healthy will allow you 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.140
 Do more exercise and you will lose weight 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.300
 rationally if you give 15 2 the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.070
 time will go down very fast in weight 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.970
 but it's going to melt and empty 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.930
 gene and hypoglycemia are the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.930
 cancer of abandonment 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.940
 and in terms I'll sing it if he wants to 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.900
 I predict 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:49.129
 12 14 16 20 weeks 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.560
 are three four or five months start at 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.689
 continue to follow up seriously what 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.470
 who make those plans how many support 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:59.870
 exercise happens this was not trap 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.250
 five times ago and now or three because 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.110
 it will not break 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.680
 under the meat 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.460
 I did not abandon him because I had a little twitch 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.990
 a 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.750
 basement groups I'm not very tired not 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.590
 I recover but I go less group births 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.410
 gene and few m 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.770
 that is enough to lie to the symptoms 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.830
 and signs are a sovereign if you have 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.070
 fever look for the cause of fever 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.430
 If you have headache look for the cause of 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.310
 the headache you're going after will lie now subject 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.120
 important 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.410
 those diets and pedro carbo anything 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.120
 logically convert to diets 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.300
 hyperproteic 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.270
 it's very difficult to give very high protein like this 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.300
 that does not get fat 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.790
 second problem are hyper protests and 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.710
 the world today says every population 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.960
 sports has a quantity of 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.510
 proteins needed to maintain 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.030
 biological condition but proteins 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.100
 they are not sources of muscle contraction 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.540
 the proteins serve as a trophy driver 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.880
 muscular maintenance to the mass 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:18.170
 muscle hormones enzymes and 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.390
 transporters if the proteins provide 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.040
 to muscle contraction during the 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.340
 exercise and training 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.980
 any type between 3 and 5 by 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.009
 percent of the caloric value the rest you 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.809
 says fat and coal 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.800
 so they do not play with proteins 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:36.770
 as a source of energy 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.759
 that is not true then the diets 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.460
 hyperproteinics do not collaborate now if there 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.680
 a problem much lower the charges 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.740
 type of fattest bags that's true 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.479
 but it will break proteins diets 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.849
 hydrocarbons multiply 150 200 the 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.680
 protein catabolism for which rupture 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.050
 protein the type will lose weight 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.639
 low part of fat part dehydrates 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.310
 because when glycogen falls there is less 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.520
 water but a lot of the weight loss is 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.229
 protein biological material eyepiece 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.050
 who can think that this is 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.460
 compatible low weight with health 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.710
 of the subject 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.120
 that's what they have to discuss a 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.800
 thing is science else thing the 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.680
 industry 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.949
 the industry has to sell and walk 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.560
 to the market where there are more problems and 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:30.289
 where more your product can be channeled 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.819
 economically then the problem does not 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.069
 is the industry the problem of 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:35.629
 professionals that support the industry 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:39.220
 or that allow the industry 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:42.229
 invade us with a food or 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.909
 product that I do not like or that the 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:46.430
 problem have not only made the fault of 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.440
 the industry industry you know that 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.530
 there is an industry that sells products 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.590
 rich in sugar- rich chocolates and 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.449
 there are no products there are entire lines of 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.009
 companies that produce things that for the 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.500
 obesity, metabolic syndrome and 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.270
 diabetes are state terrorism and without 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.400
 But they have a marketing and a power 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.360
 fantastic economic the problem of the 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.699
 professionals that do not analyze what is 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.840
 and what is it for and if it is advisable 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.840
 use it in using it
