00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
which I kind of thought thought was

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.250 
which I kind of thought thought was
really<00:00:14.849> really<00:00:15.089> funny<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.049> gameplay

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
really really funny but this gameplay

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.750 
really really funny but this gameplay
that<00:00:16.529> you're<00:00:16.650> watching<00:00:16.800> right<00:00:16.980> here<00:00:17.250> kind<00:00:17.609> of

I<00:00:18.060> don't<00:00:18.359> know<00:00:18.690> every<00:00:19.170> time<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.380> would<00:00:19.470> go<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
I don't know every time I would go on a

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.109 
I don't know every time I would go on a
streak<00:00:20.010> there's<00:00:20.279> two<00:00:20.490> people<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> lobby

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.179 
streak there's two people in the lobby
and<00:00:21.420> they<00:00:21.570> both<00:00:21.810> had<00:00:22.050> snipers<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.619> maybe<00:00:22.980> just

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and they both had snipers and maybe just

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.089 
and they both had snipers and maybe just
snipe<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.760> shit<00:00:24.359> out<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.570> me<00:00:24.810> every<00:00:25.230> single

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
snipe the shit out of me every single

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.140 
snipe the shit out of me every single
time<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.369> got<00:00:26.580> no<00:00:26.670> strict<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.000> would<00:00:27.090> just

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
time I got no strict it would just

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.820 
time I got no strict it would just
sniped<00:00:27.449> me<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.320> probably<00:00:28.439> one<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
sniped me and it was probably one of the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.960 
sniped me and it was probably one of the
most<00:00:28.920> frustrating<00:00:29.160> games<00:00:29.609> I've<00:00:29.760> ever<00:00:29.789> played

most frustrating games I've ever played
because<00:00:30.560> 133<00:00:31.560> kills<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.070> only<00:00:32.189> call<00:00:32.399> me<00:00:32.460> my

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
because 133 kills and I only call me my

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.090 
because 133 kills and I only call me my
killstreaks<00:00:33.000> once<00:00:33.750> i<00:00:33.989> believe<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.829> kind<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
killstreaks once i believe so it kind of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.270
