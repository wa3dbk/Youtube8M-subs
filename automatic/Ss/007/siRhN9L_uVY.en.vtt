beautiful 24 by 48 greenhouse and you
just<00:00:20.279> plant<00:00:20.609> flowers<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.570> greenhouse<00:00:21.900> just

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
just plant flowers in a greenhouse just

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.620 
just plant flowers in a greenhouse just
like<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.619> would<00:00:22.769> outside<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.420> very

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
see I love my pineapple lilies this is

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.950 
see I love my pineapple lilies this is
au<00:00:27.990> comas<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.119> plant<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.630> bulbs

au comas and so I just plant the bulbs

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.900 
au comas and so I just plant the bulbs
in<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> spring<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.399> throw<00:00:32.610> them<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
in the spring and I throw them in the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.630 
in the spring and I throw them in the
greenhouse<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:34.079> come<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.680> bloom<00:00:34.980> by

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
greenhouse and they come up and bloom by

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.180 
greenhouse and they come up and bloom by
late<00:00:36.059> summer<00:00:36.329> into<00:00:36.719> fall<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.620> because<00:00:38.010> it's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
late summer into fall and because it's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.790 
late summer into fall and because it's
gonna<00:00:38.340> start<00:00:38.550> freezing<00:00:38.850> outside<00:00:39.590> they<00:00:40.590> would

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
gonna start freezing outside they would

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.410 
gonna start freezing outside they would
die<00:00:40.980> back<00:00:41.219> if<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.489> left<00:00:41.700> them<00:00:41.850> outside<00:00:42.030> at<00:00:42.390> night

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
die back if I left them outside at night

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
die back if I left them outside at night
so<00:00:42.870> by<00:00:43.170> leaving<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.770> greenhouse<00:00:44.100> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
so by leaving them in the greenhouse I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.360 
so by leaving them in the greenhouse I
get<00:00:45.059> an<00:00:45.180> extra<00:00:45.510> couple<00:00:45.750> months<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.440> growth<00:00:46.739> so

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
get an extra couple months of growth so

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.459 
get an extra couple months of growth so
a<00:00:47.399> lot<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.789> things<00:00:47.969> won't<00:00:48.180> die<00:00:48.360> back<00:00:48.690> I'm<00:00:49.200> not

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.080 
a lot of things won't die back I'm not
heating<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:50.010> greenhouse<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.640> all<00:00:50.760> just

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
heating my greenhouse at all just

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.939 
heating my greenhouse at all just
because<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> incredible<00:00:52.140> expense<00:00:52.680> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
because the incredible expense of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.400 
because the incredible expense of
heating<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> greenhouse<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.140> live<00:00:55.320> in

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
heating a greenhouse but if you live in

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.400 
heating a greenhouse but if you live in
a<00:00:55.500> milder<00:00:55.890> climate<00:00:56.039> or<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> large

a milder climate or you have a large
production<00:00:58.829> than<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.520> worth<00:01:00.050> heating<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
production than it is worth heating the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.779 
production than it is worth heating the
greenhouse<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:01.859> anymore<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.460> colder

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
greenhouse but anymore in colder

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.969

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
handle the expense of heating it but

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.390 
handle the expense of heating it but
there's<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> lot<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.500> different<00:01:07.799> options<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.310> a

little<00:01:45.329> slug<00:01:45.720> bites<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.290> some<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> foliage

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
little slug bites on some of the foliage

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.770 
little slug bites on some of the foliage
I<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.759> been<00:01:47.790> lucky<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.540> had<00:01:48.750> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
I really have been lucky and not had a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.710 
I really have been lucky and not had a
lot<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.049> issues<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:50.220> any<00:01:50.579> kinds<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.090> bugs<00:01:51.390> or

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
lot of issues with any kinds of bugs or

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.800 
lot of issues with any kinds of bugs or
insects<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.280> try<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.670> dry<00:01:54.030> everything<00:01:54.450> out

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
insects and I try to dry everything out

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.260 
insects and I try to dry everything out
periodically<00:01:55.710> too<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.969> slugs

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
periodically too just because the slugs

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.760 
periodically too just because the slugs
and<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.570> lot<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> bugs<00:01:57.990> needs<00:01:58.290> them<00:01:58.500> need

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and a lot of the bugs needs them need

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.340 
and a lot of the bugs needs them need
the<00:01:58.890> moisture<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.939> by<00:02:00.299> drying<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.840> out

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the moisture so by drying it out

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.550 
the moisture so by drying it out
then<00:02:01.829> everything<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:03.180> lot<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.049> bugs<00:02:04.259> don't

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
then everything a lot of the bugs don't

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.289 
then everything a lot of the bugs don't
seem<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.040> problem<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.850> are<00:02:05.880> in

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
seem to be the problem that they are in

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.139 
seem to be the problem that they are in
the<00:02:06.780> early<00:02:07.079> spring<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.310> another<00:02:08.610> trick<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:09.000> as

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
the early spring so another trick is as

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.150 
the early spring so another trick is as
soon<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.420> everything<00:02:09.810> turns<00:02:10.170> brown<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.679> chop

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
soon as everything turns brown I chop

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.280 
soon as everything turns brown I chop
them<00:02:11.370> down<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.420> leave<00:02:12.810> everything

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
them down and I just leave everything

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.020 
them down and I just leave everything
dry<00:02:13.530> over<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
dry over the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.820 
dry over the
and<00:02:14.510> then<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:14.900> start<00:02:15.140> watering<00:02:15.290> them<00:02:15.710> in

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and then I just start watering them in

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.920 
and then I just start watering them in
the<00:02:15.950> spring<00:02:16.130> again<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:17.240> whether<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.660> plant

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
the spring again so whether you plant

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.430 
the spring again so whether you plant
plants<00:02:18.890> inside<00:02:19.280> or<00:02:19.520> outside<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:20.750> very<00:02:21.140> easy

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
plants inside or outside it's very easy

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.610 
plants inside or outside it's very easy
to<00:02:21.740> grow<00:02:21.860> them<00:02:22.130> in<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.400> greenhouse
