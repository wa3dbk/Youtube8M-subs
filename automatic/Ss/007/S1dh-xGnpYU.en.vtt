00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.410 
condensation this simple answer this
question<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.469> now<00:00:13.679> when<00:00:14.400> condensation<00:00:15.059> forms

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
question is now when condensation forms

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.939 
question is now when condensation forms
you<00:00:15.750> might<00:00:15.929> think<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.260> it's<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> windows

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you might think that it's the windows

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.980 
you might think that it's the windows
fault<00:00:17.220> after<00:00:17.730> all<00:00:18.150> that's<00:00:18.600> where<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
fault after all that's where the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.349 
fault after all that's where the
moisture<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.529> however<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.820> not<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.000> case

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
moisture is however this is not the case

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.720 
moisture is however this is not the case
in<00:00:21.630> fact<00:00:22.279> condensation<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> sign<00:00:23.699> that

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
in fact condensation is a sign that

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.570 
in fact condensation is a sign that
