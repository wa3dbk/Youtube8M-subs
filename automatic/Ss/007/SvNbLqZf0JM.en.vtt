 Hey hey pay system 4 high pass byeonhyeongtae is yiseongwon today 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.799
 Let me explain how to celebrate the iPad factory. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.490
 If you need to factory reset your iPad is the iPad was first stretched gum axis 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:23.160
 Anyway, the second is iPad Bilbo. 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.109
 The third is that when you try to sell the iPad to someone else, 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.710
 Good for 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:36.239
 But I do not know if I can save myself from the factory store , 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:39.030
 When you sell or transfer their age, you must know the iPad before the factory 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.420
 You have to turn off Find. 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.720
 I hope you can refer to the explanation below on YouTube. 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:53.750
 How to turn off your iPad 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:56.930
 You have the iCloud on the left. 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.440
 How did you become more like my item skills? 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.020
 But if you get it, you do not have to do this . 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.190
 If you are following the touch 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:12.860
 We will then turn simyeon it.I thought that Apple Balance 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:17.060
 For no matter how you enter highs calendar days hagetdamyeon size usually pushes 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.570
 That's my r I'm turning it off right now Now I'm looking for my sickness 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.270
 So, we will proceed to the beginning of the performance. 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.610
 I will actually add the performance to the range. 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.940
 To factory choke first, the iPad and computer must have a cable connected 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:37.280
 And then you must be running My Queen. 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:42.080
 If you search, you can press the Off button and Home button for a long time. 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:46.130
 When the Apple logo out there this no more explanation is almost gotta do this 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.479
 AIDED does not turn on qualitatively now or only when it does. 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:54.770
 If your iPad is normal, it is convenient if you use it like this 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:58.190
 i If you are connected to the Feather iq, the icon appears here 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.570
 However, I will touch on here then here to see the iPad started Instruments 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:06.720
 I'll write this. 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:11.400
 So what if you want to restore the iPad to its default settings? 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.910
 And extracting the data will be erased When Can I do this, then of course the show axis 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:19.670
 If you know that the data is gone. 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:23.980
 First of all, it's a backup . I'll try it first . 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.980
 Oh, I'll reboot automatically. 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.440
 4 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.340
 If it just breaks like this , the factory is automatically completed. 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.060
 So now you can use it after the betrayal. 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.819
 If you can keep it after that, you can keep it. 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.819
 I explained how to start the factory today. Thank you.
