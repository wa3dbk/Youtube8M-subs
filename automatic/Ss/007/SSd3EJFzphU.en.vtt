00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 well hello everyone dear friends with 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.660
 you cornell and i arrived with a very important 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.670
 information concerning fnaf 4 yes guys 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.620
 Now there was an update on the site 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.109
 scott and we can now see new 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.199
 completely different picture they are depicted 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.150
 Freddy in his right hand he has a hat and how 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.230
 see on his body very much 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:30.470
 heads and also bottom left we have 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.880
 letters if if we light these letters 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.880
 more precisely this component 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.850
 one word from english is 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.719
 nightmar translated from English this 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.690
 nightmare 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.940
 so there are so many different 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.489
 cool things for example here personally 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.579
 i have a theory that's what 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.399
 this word means it exactly 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.930
 such a freddy we will see when our 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.390
 the guard will fall asleep most likely 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.250
 after the first night he will fall asleep and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.270
 see exactly this kind of freddy we will 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.850
 try to squeeze it out of him now 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:13.159
 This is the first such first such theory from 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.530
 let's say so the second is what now 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.080
 written file chips in translation from 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.939
 English again this is the last part 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.369
 so this will be the last part of five 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.509
 nights at freddy's and in it we have already 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.640
 find out what happened to the children we find out 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 absolutely everything we didn't know 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 then 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.680
 then we can see the numbers yes namely 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.340
 10 31 15 is a completely different format doc a 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.360
 More precisely, the date format in America first goes 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.580
 a month later a day and then a year later 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.100
 therefore our game will be 10 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.619
 of the month of the 15th day of the 3rd of the first day 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.440
 2015 exactly this will be October 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.840
 yes guys in october we will wait already 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.869
 a new part of fight nights at freddy's it 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.000
 already there will be a quarter of the guys and 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.970
 look carefully here to be honest 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.690
 it seems to me that something will happen 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.459
 new 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.560
 what you have not exactly seen here a hundred 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.640
 percent will be a springtrap which 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.420
 ran away from that restaurant he turns out 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.310
 escaped because of the fire and I think he us 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.760
 will again pray for the second time 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.519
 mercy either already will say let's fear so 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.530
 most freddie imagine appears 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.510
 such multiple heads in froydis 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.360
 myself on the body of a springtrap well of course 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.760
 the purple man himself he did not survive in 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.040
 him in the springtrap sharpened soul and 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.370
 get springtrap let us say 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.110
 what are you guys going 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.480
 tele please release me like he 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.160
 did with those animatronics but our 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.799
 guard when I did not understand it I think 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.459
 Here in this part we are all accurately detailed 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.540
 I find out but for now all the guys thanks for that 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.340
 watched this video with you 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.810
 magazine subscribe to channel leave 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.150
 comments put your thumbs up 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.680
 and wait for new theories of facts and its me them 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.850
 I will now let out very often to all 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.430
 good luck everyone bye 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.760
 oh yes I almost forgot to say those who 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.500
 have not yet closed this video scott site on 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.570
 This moment probably put it 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.980
 associated with either a new site update 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.110
 either already 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.570
 hackers have tried and 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.930
 hacked the site well or maybe because 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:35.360
 large flow of the site itself is overloaded and 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.360
 so the server is currently unavailable
