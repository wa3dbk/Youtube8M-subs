00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.980
 Thank you, I am Daling. 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.080
 This time, or use Photoshop photos to handle from the usual hobbies 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.580
 The settings suggest those who are or draw illustrations will be constantly rolled out. 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 Since the recommended settings are here 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.140
 Or, you can't concentrate on the work of adding photoshop performance, while working, 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.060
 To create a more comfortable environment 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.160
 Who is the hardware surface, I said that you want to focus on the people who produce the work, 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.120
 I want to talk about the recommended environment, at the same time in terms of software, or settings. 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.120
 It should be noted that 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.600
 For the premise of coming from the market, the laptops passed after about three to four years 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.380
 Since the introduction to the center setting 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.760
 For those who have been using advanced equipment, the most advanced high performance computer 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.960
 We have the right to refuse a possible improvement that may not be so significant. 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.880
 Let us be okay, please continue to describe the hardware first. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.220
 If you say a laptop a decade ago, if something can't be connected to the Mac's memory expansion, 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.220
 MacBook Air, I use 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.340
 In that case, only 4GB is fully loaded, and it is not suitable for production. 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.200
 When dealing with large amounts of data becoming unstable, I can say that I behave from time to time. 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.700
 If these pressures can be implemented through hardware improvements 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.960
 I want to ask you to try first, the most important thing is to use external storage. 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.680
 This is not a story, unique to Photoshop, 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.380
 Instead, operate natively for most business applications on the machine, 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.920
 By connecting other devices with various external storage 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.220
 It has become a mechanism to improve its performance. 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.420
 Of course, but you can continue to work on the PC alone. 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.300
 It concentrates on the will of the load built into the memory in the PC, 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.280
 Not only the worst degradation 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.360
 Because it doesn't, it can be a matter that will shorten the shelf life. 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.900
 It is highly recommended to connect to the smallest use in external storage. 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.960
 And storage that ends working as an external hard drive with ideal data, 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.980
 The SSD is as high or high speed as possible, and will be described later in the "Virtual Memory Disk". 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.180
 An extra high-speed storage only saves the data for possible work, 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.080
 It is perfect if you can prepare three totals. 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.880
 By the way, but my environment uses the 12 core model of Mac Pro2013 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.760
 After all the operations are not yet 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.380
 Concurrently save data in high-speed HDD "virtual memory disk" working in RAID configuration, 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.500
 The slow hard drive to save your work is through the data, we use two. 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.520
 Then we will explain the settings in the application. 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.080
 First, to display the "Preferences" screen. 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.700
 Recent work in Photoshop to speed up 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.460
 It takes advantage of the GPU's response acceleration. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.620
 If you use this feature for a full GPU, 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.660
 Because the cache level is too low, perform on this issue 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.620
 You may need to set the default of 4 or higher not a bit high from the environment settings. 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.260
 If the lower cache level 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.500
 Despite the improved performance when you make a small image of a web page, for example, 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.100
 Due to such a gentle difference in the work of the PC, I canâ€™t feel it now. 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.680
 To the default to a large extent, as long as it is not, 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.520
 Or, it adds more features than I think. 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 Next, in "Setting the Graphics Processor." 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.680
 However, we will continue to set up processing using the GPU, 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.900
 If this is installed here in the PC GPU for a few years 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.260
 With the exception of "Use OpenCL", I think this is the check in the rest of the checkbox. 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.220
 One place, pay attention here 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.860
 In the "drawing mode" setting items "Basic", "Standard", "Details" 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.920
 Most of the actions are light "basic", while "multi" is the heaviest, 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.580
 For the most part, as long as you don't use the "standard" of low-performance GPUs, 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.160
 Or it's ok in the "More Information" section. 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.620
 If in the case, such as reluctant actions are in daily operations, such as zooming and rotating on the screen 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.480
 This is a good thing and is set to "basic". 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.080
 Then we will set up "memory usage". 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.700
 Here is the percentage item that determines whether or not to use the memory you have installed, however, 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.300
 Because there is no performance in which the performance is set to increase to or from the reverse 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.500
 To about 70%, if the person is called "more than just working in Photoshop", 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.800
 If anyone who "also uses other apps at the same time, as well as Photoshop's work" 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.940
 You may want to try and set a low of 50% to 60%. 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.900
 Then we will set the "cache tile size". 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.100
 When you edit large pictures and illustrations 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.180
 It can better increase its size to attract more performance. 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.420
 However, due to the consumption of memory becomes severe 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.460
 Is the PC full of so many memories, 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.680
 For example, it is about 2GB and 4GB on PC. 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.540
 Please pay attention when working on such a personal computer. 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.060
 And among them, the cache block size is 1024K try 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.760
 We tried to use what is set to 128K compared to 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.780
 In the time consumption memory read test image ya 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.600
 In the difference you can see in the paint performance has come out. 

00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:38.371
 What is more here will be 1024K 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.760
 More paint consumption in memory has already led to better performance. 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.760
 There is no special feature this time, but it is "historical figures". 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.180
 Because it doesn't affect performance so 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.660
 Also, if it is reduced to your environment, there is no problem with the extent of the incident. 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.400
 Then set up the "virtual memory hard disk". 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.840
 The virtual memory disk that works here, 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.740
 When the memory of the PC appears to be in short supply 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.260
 Those applications use PC storage as a place for memory 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.320
 It has become a small PC for important things about memory. 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.800
 If used here, the default built-in storage 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.400
 Performance is reduced, of course, 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.280
 Because it can also be a matter that will shorten the shelf life 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.340
 Please set to external storage without failing. 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.100
 But I don't need to worry about it, if you are loaded into memory about 16GB, 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.440
 Otherwise, it's not, if your PC not only goes up about 4GB 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.740
 We expect significant performance and as much as possible I will specify the high speed storage. 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.640
 At last, 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.640
 This is a small part, but hides the thumbnails that appear in the Layers panel. 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.740
 By default, but there is a convenience check object has been displayed 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.560
 Turn off thumbnail updates by turning off this feature 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.880
 It enhances performance. 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.620
 The important thing is that it has already been said too far. 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.960
 And, the storage is dispersed by the built-in storage load by preparing the plural'll 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.160
 In order to achieve performance improvement, some memory is needed. 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.660
 If there is not enough memory 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.240
 How is it able to provide high speed external storage to make up for it. 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.000
 The important factor in using Photoshop's first "CPU", 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.480
 Subsequent "memory" 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.800
 Then you have come next to the external storage and GPU becomes like this. 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.460
 If used in one of the desktop PCs 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.260
 Because parts such as CPU and memory can also 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.720
 Although the upgrade is easy, 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.660
 Because it doesn't go in the notebook, so one, "memory", 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.760
 Then I thought, I have to go to the extra "external storage". 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.280
 It is over. 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.120
 The old days of Photoshop are not too expensive and expensive. 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.360
 Also, now about 2,000 yen per month is available. 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.020
 Except those used in business 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.600
 But I think that in terms of its users and information are increasing, 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.040
 I think that many users are not satisfied with the simple and superficial features. 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.480
 This is the best tool for the trouble of image editing software. 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.480
 If you can remember Photoshop I think, if Moraere takes it seriously by all means of mastery, 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.520
 First of all, I want to include the construction theme in the production environment of this project, without accumulating pressure. 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.840
 Although not setting this up, there are still a few other small parts of this launch, 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.200
 First of all, what you might want to try is to check your environment. 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.460
 So, see you next week, goodbye. 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.060
 The delivery is also on the podcast not only on Yasamu on YouTube. 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.560
 YouTube's program and has been talking about it will be oh Dako and members of different themes. 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.520
 Convenient podcasts can be automatically made if registration is received, 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.640
 Delivery date every Tuesday, now visit from here!
