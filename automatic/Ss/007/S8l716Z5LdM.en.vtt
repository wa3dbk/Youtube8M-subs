it first thing I would do is I would
take<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> Blazer<00:01:42.780> off<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
take the Blazer off because that

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
take the Blazer off because that
obviously<00:01:44.700> makes<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.149> look<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.390> little<00:01:45.570> bit

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
obviously makes it look a little bit

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.609 
obviously makes it look a little bit
more<00:01:46.460> more<00:01:47.460> constructed<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.450> corporate<00:01:48.960> so

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
more more constructed and corporate so

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.210 
more more constructed and corporate so
we'll<00:01:49.770> take<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.159> off<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.560> then<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.920> next

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
we'll take that off and then the next

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
we'll take that off and then the next
thing<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.549> will<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.960> silk<00:01:55.229> top

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
thing I will do is this is a silk top

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.679 
thing I will do is this is a silk top
and<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:55.770> pretty<00:01:56.009> long<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:57.360> has<00:01:57.509> this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
and it's pretty long and it has this

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.069 
and it's pretty long and it has this
nice<00:01:57.930> little<00:01:58.850> snap<00:01:59.850> button<00:02:00.299> I'm<00:02:00.479> leaving<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
nice little snap button I'm leaving that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.859 
nice little snap button I'm leaving that
that's<00:02:01.530> pretty<00:02:01.799> much<00:02:01.950> staying<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> same<00:02:02.869> but

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
that's pretty much staying the same but

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.550 
that's pretty much staying the same but
what<00:02:04.200> I'm<00:02:04.350> doing<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.490> am<00:02:06.079> now<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.170> couldn't

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
what I'm doing is I am now you couldn't

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
what I'm doing is I am now you couldn't
keep<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.950> belt<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:09.030> actually<00:02:09.239> going<00:02:09.539> to

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
keep the belt on I'm actually going to

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.880 
keep the belt on I'm actually going to
keep<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.110> show<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.590> then<00:02:10.709> show

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
keep it on and show you it and then show

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.340 
keep it on and show you it and then show
you<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.099> with<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.370> off<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:12.360> untucked

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
you it with it off but untucked

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.460 
you it with it off but untucked
I<00:02:14.180> mean<00:02:15.180> it's<00:02:15.300> really<00:02:15.510> simple<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:16.110> deconstruct

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
I mean it's really simple to deconstruct

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.900 
I mean it's really simple to deconstruct
an<00:02:16.770> outfit<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.160> think<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.460> easier<00:02:17.760> to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
an outfit I think it's easier to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.080 
an outfit I think it's easier to
deconstruct<00:02:18.270> one<00:02:18.630> than<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.900> construct<00:02:19.320> one

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
deconstruct one than to construct one

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.280 
deconstruct one than to construct one
but<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.340> would<00:02:23.760> probably<00:02:24.000> go<00:02:24.810> without<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
but so I I would probably go without the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.750 
but so I I would probably go without the
belt<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.680> because<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.160> shirt<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.550> very

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
belt just because this shirt is very

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.530 
belt just because this shirt is very
like<00:02:27.030> full<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:29.430> have<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> belt<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.180> like

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
like full and to have a belt on like

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.950 
like full and to have a belt on like
this<00:02:30.920> kind<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.180> keeps<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> little<00:02:33.600> bit<00:02:33.720> more

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
this kind of keeps it a little bit more

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.990 
this kind of keeps it a little bit more
pulled<00:02:34.380> together<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.310> now<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.550> can<00:02:35.700> see<00:02:35.880> it's

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
pulled together so now you can see it's

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.390 
pulled together so now you can see it's
a<00:02:36.090> looser<00:02:36.420> top<00:02:36.630> now<00:02:37.290> because<00:02:37.710> this<00:02:37.950> skirt<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.250> a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
a looser top now because this skirt is a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.840 
a looser top now because this skirt is a
pencil<00:02:38.730> skirt<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.360> am<00:02:40.200> are<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.950> bandage<00:02:41.580> skirt

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
look you can do this with a white little

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.760 
look you can do this with a white little
button-down<00:03:00.750> top<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.110> can<00:03:01.230> do<00:03:01.320> with<00:03:01.410> anything

button-down top you can do with anything

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.380 
button-down top you can do with anything
but<00:03:01.950> because<00:03:02.340> these<00:03:02.700> skirts<00:03:03.030> are<00:03:03.180> kind<00:03:03.360> of

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
but because these skirts are kind of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.780 
but because these skirts are kind of
flexible<00:03:03.900> with<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.140> height<00:03:04.380> all<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.460> sudden

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
flexible with the height all of a sudden

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.790 
flexible with the height all of a sudden
it<00:03:05.880> changes<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.390> height<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.900> makes<00:03:07.560> this

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
it changes the height and makes this

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.950 
it changes the height and makes this
look<00:03:08.100> more<00:03:08.430> like<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> playful<00:03:09.240> little<00:03:09.660> dress

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
look more like a playful little dress

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.470 
look more like a playful little dress
rather<00:03:10.230> than<00:03:10.580> your<00:03:11.580> corporate<00:03:12.060> look<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.420> I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
rather than your corporate look and I

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.180 
rather than your corporate look and I
still<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.780> my<00:03:12.870> shoes<00:03:13.080> on<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.770> had<00:03:13.920> tights
