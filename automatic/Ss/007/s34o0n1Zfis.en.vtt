00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
and if I doing it wrong that's just

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.490 
and if I doing it wrong that's just
because<00:03:49.700> that's<00:03:50.120> how<00:03:50.450> I<00:03:50.480> think<00:03:51.050> it's<00:03:51.230> supposed

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
because that's how I think it's supposed

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.790 
because that's how I think it's supposed
to<00:03:51.650> be<00:03:51.800> done<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.910> what<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.180> do<00:03:53.360> is<00:03:53.570> and<00:03:53.900> it's

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
kind of not playing out I just do it but

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.340 
kind of not playing out I just do it but
because<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:58.070> might<00:03:58.850> not<00:03:59.030> work<00:03:59.060> sometimes<00:03:59.810> play

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350
