 4 but the monsanto 810 him it's a bit of a corn making his own 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.359
 insecticide 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.359
 so we do as we call corn bt and because the young 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.960
 what was it produced in this email is a young of a soil bacterium 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.579
 whose initials are described above storage act 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.810
 and in this soil bacterium so a ground screen 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.000
 to bejaia and who hold the secret of making protein effect 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.630
 Protein insecticides toulouse of insects 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.659
 and especially 

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:37.249
 tomorrow chain that holds the secret of making a killer protein from 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:41.069
 borer the borer being a twilit butterfly in the chain it makes 

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:42.970
 damage in the stem of my list 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.720
 so the idea was to take the young of this bacterium that allows to 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.160
 make this toxin all of hack to put it in corn 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.850
 and as the only language is universal in all the living world 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.250
 well maize france young bacteria on its own account the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.230
 decodes it manufactures itself the corresponding insecticidal toxin 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.780
 and therefore we do not need anyone any more to fight 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.780
 against this insect pest that piracy 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 the rare l 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.020
 so far and these bodies have never finally demanded studies 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.369
 greater than three months on a single animal species 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.850
 in other words and pefc one is a bank 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.370
 in a lack of health evaluation 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.630
 and what's more for reasons of industrial secrecy these assessments are made 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.210
 by laboratories chosen by the seed companies which 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.570
 inevitably cause 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.630
 problems 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.330
 e of transparency accessibility 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.180
 and whenever we wanted to have access to the raw data made in the 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.500
 part of his studies it was at the price of administrative legal battles 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.580
 monstrous to precisely overcome 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.140
 this famous industrial secret and whenever we had access to 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.670
 studies via another including hepatic and renal disturbances in 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.220
 count animals fed with ogm compared you animate others have not 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.860
 summer 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.430
 so of course these studies were able to judge me we speak of 40 I speak of deficiency 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.330
 so that means that these studies if they are not enough to show the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.930
 non-dangerousness are also not to show the dangerousness so we do not 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.670
 not say his studies allow to assert that scelzo gm are toxic 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.209
 for health we are told 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.489
 than 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.539
 these studies are sufficiently disturbing 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:19.559
 the best 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.909
 apply the precautionary principle could say that remains in the closet 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.529
 opener 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.599
 in the other case is the CEO and the studies 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.639
 complementary ones be made by independent laboratories 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.349
 no conflict of interest with the seed companies until there is no 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.009
 more 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.949
 therefore started whether in the sense of toxicity or in the sense of 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.289
 safety 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.289
 the rare l 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.159
 in Argentina the elected representatives of the various monstrous stations 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.059
 to grow soy already in terms of impact on the environment is good 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.779
 sure anais pact a director the best it is directly related 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.939
 of course the intensive cultivation of these objects 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.150
 because indeed she for the farmer this type of plant does 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.939
 present of interest 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.709
 than percent at the scale of field crops 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.269
 emc soy are not sojas that makes a toxin to fight 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.309
 insects are soya that have been rendered 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:16.359
 tolerant to a particular herbicide tier 2 passes so-called plans 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.179
 32 predicts that is to say plants that instead of dying because they are watered 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:23.069
 with durandal pubis remains rather than they can absorb in others 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.450
 would seem to accumulate 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.759
 in their cell what I was explaining to you are afraid 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.609
 well she saw them amended 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.450
 it's catastrophic for the environment why because 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.379
 we are told that these plants will help reduce the amount of 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.359
 pesticides we must not fool ourselves 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.659
 when we make plans of this type 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.219
 it's not completely forbidden above to be able to 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.769
 spray herbicides without the risk of killing the plant 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.379
 and how is it going in these countries and well and as in all countries where they 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.039
 do this type of culture 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.100
 in large scale 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.400
 but it sprays by seaplane by helicopter and you can imagine that 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.149
 with such methods allowed to reach the back of the spoon 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:02.099
 and so that the more one puts herbicides more formatted the next because more 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.909
 the tolerance threshold of bad habits et cetera it's a circle 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:05.719
 vicious 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:09.149
 and for my people it's catastrophic for the environment 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.559
 spraying so that this herbicide excess and obviously we have 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.000
 also catastrophic environmental challenges say 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.530
 q all who can see them in this role 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.419
 we deplete soils in terms of 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.690
 the prince of earthworms microorganisms et cetera and so that's 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.969
 the whole chain that is who could particular to Brazil there is a state that 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:28.729
 wants to backtrack that the para north state is extremely difficult 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:29.949
 because they are 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.639
 they are so good that in a very advanced process 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.620
 khelil his friend tapping soils 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.520
 catastrophic and very difficult for them to backtrack to 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.650
 to cultivate something other than this type of plant 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.790
