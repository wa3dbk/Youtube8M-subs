00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.640
 a second likewise the royal bird of prey which nests in the rocks above 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.309
 Is he different? 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.509
 this bold one is smaller and more agile than the golden eagle 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.499
 he hits his serves escape 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.899
 ple 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.570
 However, the hawk eagle does not contest the golden eagle's prey 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.390
 Shire feeds completely differently as we just saw 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.990
 Each species has its own role in maintaining balance in this species 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.990
 the nature 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.119
 e on 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.270
 It is about half the size of the golden eagle that I have theater 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.680
 and this is a female about 6 to 8 years old 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.350
 the hawk eagles are throughout the Mediterranean and North Africa 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.600
 native to Spain, they have become rare 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.629
 Her plumage is also shifting according to age and gender 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.069
 he will react 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.449
 is not it a beautiful animal 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:20.739
 Take a look at the light chest of the cross-country skiers with powerful swinging 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.439
 but the hawk can also beat big prey 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.959
 Daimler Dr 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.189
 the GDR 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.900
 from there it goes on this is a younger Stadler 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.849
 about three years old 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.669
 its plumage still has the salmon tint that characterizes the young 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.149
 per reli 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:48.499
 The ATMs will make the system significantly salmon-colored plumage 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:50.989
 I have a very young defense 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.869
 he also has a hood on 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:57.159
 because we are not sure if the young, shy animal can manage without them 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.029
 can october 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:04.209
 Probably the fastest hunter among our birds of prey is the hawk eagle 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:09.659
 if he has spotted a prey he flies almost horizontally 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.700
 and just before the finish line CAD descend 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.150
 for us it was interesting to note that this animal he 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.869
 first learned to fly and hunt us 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:25.829
 Instinctively behaves exactly like his conspecifics from birth in 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.829
 Freedom life 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:41.289
 he is perfect even when hitting the prey 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.529
 that means that he can hunt independently on his own
