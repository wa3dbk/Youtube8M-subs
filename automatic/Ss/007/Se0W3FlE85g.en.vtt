and<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.760> actually<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:17.620> see<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.010> a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
and this is actually you see it's a

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.340 
and this is actually you see it's a
little<00:02:18.160> rough<00:02:18.880> here<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.480> spots<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.020> the

little rough here in the spots but the

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.430 
little rough here in the spots but the
actual<00:02:21.190> fingerboard<00:02:21.910> will<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.750> coming<00:02:23.050> over

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
actual fingerboard will be coming over

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.200 
actual fingerboard will be coming over
and<00:02:23.530> covering<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.160> part<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.790> up<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.180> you

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
will see this part here by putting a

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.070 
will see this part here by putting a
rosette<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.520> you're<00:02:30.520> actually<00:02:32.370> trying<00:02:33.370> to

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
rosette in you're actually trying to

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.010 
rosette in you're actually trying to
keep<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.650> end<00:02:35.830> grain<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:37.360> here<00:02:37.780> and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
keep the end grain that is here and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.080 
keep the end grain that is here and
around<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.980> edges<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.459> sound<00:02:39.730> hole<00:02:39.850> from

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
around the edges of the sound hole from

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.240 
around the edges of the sound hole from
breaking<00:02:40.480> out<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.080> very<00:02:41.380> it's<00:02:41.800> but<00:02:42.100> it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
breaking out so it's very it's but it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.949 
breaking out so it's very it's but it
really<00:02:42.490> wouldn't<00:02:42.760> go<00:02:42.880> beyond<00:02:43.209> we<00:02:43.420> wouldn't<00:02:43.840> go

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
really wouldn't go beyond we wouldn't go

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.660 
really wouldn't go beyond we wouldn't go
beyond<00:02:44.290> here<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.010> one<00:02:45.160> piece<00:02:45.340> that's<00:02:45.610> missing

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
beyond here the one piece that's missing

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.600 
beyond here the one piece that's missing
now<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.420> actual<00:02:47.110> neck<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:48.370> quite

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
piece of wood it's not about being as

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.850 
piece of wood it's not about being as
resonant<00:02:52.120> as<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.360> drive<00:02:52.660> where's<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.709> neck

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
resonant as the drive where's the neck

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.580

don't usually finish the heel up until

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.960 
don't usually finish the heel up until
the<00:03:02.230> body<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.740> together<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.459> can<00:03:03.640> actually

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
the body is together and I can actually

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.110 
the body is together and I can actually
put<00:03:04.209> this<00:03:04.240> neck<00:03:04.780> on<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.040> body<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.670> see

this<00:03:09.880> will<00:03:10.060> be<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.269> end<00:03:10.450> cap<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.530> is

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
this will be the end cap and this is

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.560 
this will be the end cap and this is
just<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:12.130> sandwich<00:03:12.400> that's<00:03:12.760> made<00:03:13.120> with<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.690 
black fiber mahogany and sycamore
there's<00:03:16.180> about<00:03:16.450> 250<00:03:17.350> steps<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.220> building<00:03:18.550> a

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
there's about 250 steps to building a

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.060 
there's about 250 steps to building a
guitar<00:03:18.880> different<00:03:19.660> little<00:03:19.900> processes<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:20.920> go

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
guitar different little processes you go
