00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.850
 welcome to a new installment of the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.510
 small square of the foundation ours 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.090
 foundation 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.210
 as we have seen yes 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.550
 mainly deals with trains but they are 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.010
 ancient trains that still travel and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.699
 still serve just like a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.970
 time how to keep them how to preserve them 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.120
 for this the foundation has identified 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.659
 about 10 inhabitants on the national territory 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.979
 these are ten ancient workshops 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.430
 now abandoned by the moderns 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.979
 processes that have been dedicated to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.729
 maintenance to the restoration and to the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.539
 conservation of our 200 rolling stock 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.610
 historians and we begin this journey in 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.000
 this is a real one 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.060
 heritage of industrial archeology 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.270
 active from pistoia together we go to 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.560
 discover the crafts and secrets 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.560
 of the ancient workshop 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.390
 the ancient pistoia locomotive depot 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.030
 was conceived and designed to serve the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.150
 old porrettana railway than before 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.790
 of the opening in 1934 of the 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.370
 had direct in the gallery 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.070
 the task of bearing all the 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.930
 traffic between Bologna and Florence 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.300
 and therefore natural that of 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.540
 that important plant today 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.570
 vestiges like this great refer 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.900
 turntable legacy of the old 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.810
 Pre-war exercise allows with the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.209
 its length of 21 meters to turn 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.060
 steam locomotives without the need 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.800
 to separate the tender from the locomotive 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.370
 itself 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.370
 the hydraulic column that allows the 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.200
 water supply the visiting pits 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.620
 that allow the inspection of the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.350
 everything is under the body and the connecting rods 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.200
 short in order to guarantee the 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.960
 maintenance and operation of a 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.450
 category of trains the historical ones that 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.800
 by now he is completely caring for the foundation 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.800
 state Railways 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:54.170
 here the locomotives are built 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.510
 you put your hands on the boilers on the bl in 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.510
 particular way we focus on 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.120
 precision organisms that allow 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.420
 the safety motion of the locomotives a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.599
 steam for example our workers today 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.659
 are able to disturb with term a 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.659
 old and find the boiler of a 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.329
 Steam locomotive are able to 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:20.450
 adjust the transmission of motion a 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.879
 half of gears and connecting rods and they are 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.389
 able to put hand in every part 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:29.000
 that is visible on August visible as 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:33.019
 see you can also enter 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.889
 inside the oven of the locomotive e 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.370
 in this way act manually on the 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:45.459
 organisms and on the parts they hold 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.459
 I would say in continuity the boiler 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.430
 every plant in the foundation has one 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.069
 dedicated vocation 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.700
 here in Pistoia we saw there is the 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.459
 brain that takes care of the engine of 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.439
 steam locomotives in other locations a 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.840
 central Milan for example in the old one 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.450
 raise team we take care of the 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.489
 antique rome carriages terms 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.709
 in the old presidential garage 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.459
 let us pamper those who are i 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.470
 exquisite interiors of the former royal train then 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:20.340
 presidential but others are the locations 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.039
 where we have installations and the competition 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.169
 volunteer of many former railway workers of 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.240
 enthusiasts who join us in 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:31.070
 this conservation work of 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.070
 historical railway heritage
