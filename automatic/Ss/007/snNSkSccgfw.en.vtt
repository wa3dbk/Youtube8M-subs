so things wrong with that is because

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.020 
so things wrong with that is because
you're<00:01:13.950> gonna<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> lot<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.580> trouble<00:01:14.970> with

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you're gonna have a lot of trouble with

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.420 
you're gonna have a lot of trouble with
the<00:01:15.180> crops<00:01:15.560> but<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> good<00:01:16.860> part<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.189> can

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the crops but the good part is you can

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
the crops but the good part is you can
actually<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:18.000> great<00:01:18.420> barracks<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.049> great

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
actually have great barracks and great

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.830 
actually have great barracks and great
stable<00:01:19.650> okay<00:01:20.310> he<00:01:21.119> doesn't<00:01:21.330> even<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.600> those

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
stable okay he doesn't even have those

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.820 
stable okay he doesn't even have those
yet<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.290> don't<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> actually

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
yet so you don't have to actually

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.920 
yet so you don't have to actually
destroy<00:01:23.159> some<00:01:23.400> buildings<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.330> so

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
destroy some buildings and get that so

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.210 
destroy some buildings and get that so
we<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.200> build<00:01:25.320> more<00:01:25.650> troops<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.070> same

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
we can build more troops at the same

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.649 
we can build more troops at the same
time<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.850> crop<00:01:27.150> problems<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:27.630> now

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
time but we have crop problems right now

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.999 
time but we have crop problems right now
so<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.049> don't<00:01:28.110> even<00:01:28.320> want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> build<00:01:28.770> troops

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
so we don't even want to build troops

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.539 
so we don't even want to build troops
anymore

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
basically which I don't like this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.359 
basically which I don't like this
capital<00:01:46.229> at<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.009> see<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.250> got

capital at all but as you can see I got

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.730 
capital at all but as you can see I got
at<00:01:47.520> level<00:01:47.909> 15<00:01:48.299> level<00:01:48.540> 14<00:01:48.960> crop<00:01:49.290> lands<00:01:49.530> which

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.350 
at level 15 level 14 crop lands which
don't<00:01:50.009> really<00:01:50.220> help<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:50.700> because

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
don't really help at all because

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.149 
don't really help at all because
upgrading<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.079> gives<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.500> 300<00:01:53.040> maybe

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.289 
upgrading them gives you like 300 maybe
even<00:01:53.399> 500<00:01:54.680> crop<00:01:55.820> production<00:01:56.820> which<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.149> not

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
even 500 crop production which is not

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.810 
even 500 crop production which is not
that<00:01:57.479> much<00:01:57.780> okay<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.369> good<00:01:59.520> account

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
that much okay but it's a good account

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.399 
that much okay but it's a good account
there's<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> lot<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.420> villages<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.930> there's<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
there's a lot of villages it there's a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.630 
there's a lot of villages it there's a
lot<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.710> villages<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.189> there's<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> lot<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
lot of villages and there's a lot of

lot of villages and there's a lot of
troops<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.990> resources<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.579> don't<00:02:05.729> even

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
know what to do with them because we

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.290 
know what to do with them because we
can't<00:02:07.590> build<00:02:07.740> troops<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.729> consume<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.179> lot

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
can't build troops as they consume a lot

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.510 
can't build troops as they consume a lot
of<00:02:09.420> crops<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.649> did<00:02:10.770> attack<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.220> guy

catalyst<00:02:21.720> only<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:21.989> have<00:02:22.200> no<00:02:22.440> idea<00:02:22.739> why<00:02:22.890> I

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
catalyst only I have no idea why I

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.800 
catalyst only I have no idea why I
should<00:02:23.220> tell<00:02:23.400> him<00:02:23.489> not<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:24.390> he's<00:02:24.569> probably

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
should tell him not to but he's probably

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.509 
should tell him not to but he's probably
watching<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.379> video<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.980> he<00:02:26.129> knows<00:02:26.310> he's

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
watching this video and he knows he's

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.680 
watching this video and he knows he's
not<00:02:26.610> supposed<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.000> 20<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.540> send

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
not supposed to in 20 you can send

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.600 
not supposed to in 20 you can send
around<00:02:27.750> 40<00:02:28.260> because<00:02:28.769> what<00:02:29.129> happens<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.519> when

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
around 40 because what happens is when

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.809 
around 40 because what happens is when
he<00:02:29.730> sent<00:02:29.940> 20<00:02:30.239> catapults<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.769> attack<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
he sent 20 catapults the attack that the

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.890 
he sent 20 catapults the attack that the
amount<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.090> calculation<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.540> actually

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
amount of calculation is actually

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.750 
amount of calculation is actually
actually<00:02:34.230> divided<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.920> when<00:02:35.040> he<00:02:35.099> sent<00:02:35.280> 20<00:02:35.610> that

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
actually divided so when he sent 20 that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.309 
actually divided so when he sent 20 that
means<00:02:35.940> 10<00:02:36.180> for<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.510> building<00:02:36.810> 10<00:02:37.019> for<00:02:37.200> this

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
means 10 for this building 10 for this

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.990 
means 10 for this building 10 for this
building<00:02:37.560> what<00:02:37.709> when<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.890> send<00:02:38.069> 40<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.970> have

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
building what when you send 40 you have

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.550 
building what when you send 40 you have
20<00:02:39.420> for<00:02:39.569> this<00:02:39.690> building<00:02:39.989> 20<00:02:40.290> for<00:02:40.440> this

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
20 for this building 20 for this

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.050 
20 for this building 20 for this
building<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.010> maybe<00:02:41.099> you've<00:02:41.250> sent<00:02:41.489> 60<00:02:41.879> then

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
building or maybe you've sent 60 then

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.449 
building or maybe you've sent 60 then
you<00:02:42.150> know<00:02:42.239> just<00:02:42.420> divided<00:02:42.840> by<00:02:42.959> 2<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.099> on<00:02:44.250> and

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
you know just divided by 2 and so on and

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.300 
you know just divided by 2 and so on and
so<00:02:44.549> on<00:02:44.580> but<00:02:45.540> we<00:02:45.690> got<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.900> 9<00:02:46.110> cropper<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.769> it's

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
so on but we got this 9 cropper and it's

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.920 
so on but we got this 9 cropper and it's
it's<00:02:47.670> not<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.790> capital<00:02:48.030> mine<00:02:48.360> cropper<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:48.840> it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
it's not a capital mine cropper so it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.420 
it's not a capital mine cropper so it
just<00:02:49.110> goes<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.260> level<00:02:49.590> 10<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.829> crop<00:02:50.010> lands<00:02:50.220> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
just goes to level 10 the crop lands and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.890 
just goes to level 10 the crop lands and
I<00:02:50.459> sent<00:02:50.880> some<00:02:51.030> troops<00:02:51.239> here<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.780> bring

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
I sent some troops here just to bring

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.449 
I sent some troops here just to bring
that<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.680> said<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.190> crop

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459
