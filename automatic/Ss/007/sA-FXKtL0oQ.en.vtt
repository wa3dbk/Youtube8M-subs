schematics of 16 Marshall amplifiers
from<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> past<00:00:42.620> lifted<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> schematic<00:00:44.250> and

from the past lifted the schematic and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.229 
from the past lifted the schematic and
recreated<00:00:45.120> those<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> digital<00:00:45.750> domain

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
recreated those in the digital domain

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.790 
recreated those in the digital domain
they've<00:00:48.239> managed<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.469> such<00:00:49.649> an

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
they've managed to do it just such an

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.369 
they've managed to do it just such an
accurate<00:00:50.190> state<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.899> example<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
accurate state that for example the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.850 
accurate state that for example the
jcm800<00:00:53.250> sound<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.510> GMD<00:00:54.840> sounds<00:00:55.620> exactly

we're<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.629> make

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
we're going to do this we have to make

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.180 
we're going to do this we have to make
sure<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.410> best<00:01:01.739> possible<00:01:01.920> way

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
sure we do it in the best possible way

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.870 
sure we do it in the best possible way
that<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:03.140> also<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> amp<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.880> there's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that we can also in the amp is there's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.929 
that we can also in the amp is there's
28<00:01:06.260> preset<00:01:07.260> sounds<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.520> program<00:01:08.729> it

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
28 preset sounds that you can program it

the<00:01:21.450> great<00:01:21.659> thing<00:01:21.689> about<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the great thing about this is the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.800 
the great thing about this is the
flexibility<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.249> gives<00:01:23.609> you<00:01:23.789> we<00:01:24.359> have<00:01:24.509> floor

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
flexibility that gives you we have floor

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.039 
flexibility that gives you we have floor

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
closely with those guys and the sounds

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.480 
closely with those guys and the sounds
are<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.130> there<00:02:50.280> are<00:02:50.459> incredibly<00:02:51.329> accurate
