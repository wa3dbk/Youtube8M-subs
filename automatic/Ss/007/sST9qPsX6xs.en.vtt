00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.519
 hi friends how are we now in this 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.070
 I bring you a liberator of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.970
 single break memory so you can 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.130
 occupy in 796 and well many we occupied 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.320
 it's 10 it's said as a memory liberator 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.320
 and also in some other videos already 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.109
 I've already brought them and some 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.480
 application to free ram but 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.510
 this time this application 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 excludes Slavic the memory liberator 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.080
 What has worked best for me is the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.910
 memory liberator that more memory me 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.530
 has released and super fast 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.320
 this application we find it in the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.659
 appstore is priced at 99 cents 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.460
 I think this application is good 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.110
 it was free is a couple of days in fact 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.019
 it was free when I stopped doing 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.220
 the videos of free apps and good what 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.650
 only that we have to do you go 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.420
 to find the application so the only 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.390
 what we have to do is activate maxion 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.519
 and ready once you finish cooling 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.979
 or to free all our memory is going 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.549
 to vote the sprint board ok 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.930
 next I have 391 free megas we're going to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.000
 good here and give us everything 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.260
 we have free what we have activated what 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.340
 that we have occupied since we have 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.469
 inactive and we give in refor 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 and once I finish releasing all 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:26.710
 our memory will vote us ready 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.530
 we go back to explain and we can see that 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.840
 we already have 723 good going down in accordance 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.210
 is doing the resources but also 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.250
 we can enter here to store and here 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.170
 we can erase everything we do not have or 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.610
 everything that does not serve us directly in 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.799
 our device simply 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.289
 we grab and give for example here you 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.490
 we give in being in many heroes one them 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.039
 I recommend so much simply me 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.520
 I recommend that you give in simply being 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.380
 and ok let's wait for the process 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.689
 go as quickly as possible and we will 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.700
 begin to release that memory is going to 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.340
 release that cache that we have is going to 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.259
 free you can go all that crap that to 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.560
 the best is left in our iphone ipod 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.659
 touch or ipad if we go up for example 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.360
 if we update our to I is for 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.950
 example to 7.0 points 3 directly 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.900
 from our device if we did not 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.280
 a restoration 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.810
 is going to eliminate all that cache that 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.030
 we have the internet for browsing 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.060
 is going to eliminate some applications 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.889
 trash that the same apps leave us 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.610
 will leave so good they will see the camera 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.620
 fast 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.660
 to not leave so quickly to avoid 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.210
 go out so long the video friends are missing 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.780
 approximately two minutes and I come 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.780
 right away 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.010
 good friends we have seen that it has already 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.540
 finished here nothing else we give in ok 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.239
 who says he has already cleaned 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.599
 completely our device will 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:11.159
 we give in ok and it tells us that it has released 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.750
 about 18 gigabytes I do not think so but the 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.930
 last time I released it was like 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.970
 15 days and it took me to release 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.069
 approximately 2 gigas of the application 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.079
 others good when we connect our 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.909
 iphone to point 8 there is no for the 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.099
 computer would make us a huge line 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.650
 that says others I release about 2 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.170
 gigas of garbage that I did not need 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.760
 and we can see that here 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.120
 completely good our memory 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.459
 we still have 659 and here we can go 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.680
 little by little seeing the processes that 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.079
 they have our phone here we see everything 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.720
 what he has cleaned and how is that or good 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.099
 where has he cleaned us the most since 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.170
 I simply recommend that you occupy 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.480
 this if they want to release a bit of 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.099
 Your device's memory depends so much 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.659
 how much garbage they have is how many 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.040
 how much is going to take so good 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.510
