00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.000
 "Our Lord, give us an unexpected gift," what kind of gift? 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 "Min ezvādžinā ve zurrijjātinā kurrete e'ajun." 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 "In our wives and our husbands, our children and our children give us what our eyes make so happy that it makes us wage." (Quran, 25:74) 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Kurrete e'ajun - cools our eyes. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.500
 Do you know what that means? 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.000
 He makes you so happy that he makes you cry. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 When you listen to your child as you teach the Qur'an and when they love to teach the Qur'an, it makes you so happy to cry. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 When you look at your wife and raise your children, it makes you so happy to cry. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 When she looked at her husband who woke up to their children and took them to the mosque, she came to cry. She's so happy. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Our husbands cry and our women cry, but do not cry because they are happy. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Pay for other reasons. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 We pray for the tears of joy. We want to be happy with our families. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 How will we achieve this? 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Every day when you come home, you argue with your husband. Every day. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.500
 "What are you late for?" 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 "And what are you always asking me about? Like you do not know she's out of the crowd !? Take a little look out the window! " 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 And so it starts every day. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 You are so angry that when you look at your child, you begin to kick him. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 "Why are you playing with toys? Why do you look good? There is no luck here! " 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 "Where's your task?" 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 "Aaah ... I have nothing to do with the task." 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.000
 "How are you? I'll regret your school! " 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 God ... 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 This is not the "joy of our eyes". 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 There are people who come to the mosque for submissiveness, and the role of the spread is to give you peace to calm you down. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 And then when those people come home like a tornado fell into the house. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Children are hiding under the bed. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 The woman immediately drops the receiver. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 You must not be the reason your family is scared! 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 You need to be the reason your family will be happy, happy. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Your children should run you and hug you when you get home. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 That's the relationship you should have with your children. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 While I'm on this subject ... 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, the education of children was different. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 It's no longer the same as before. 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 I address my father: you can not afford to be the authority of your children. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 You must be friends and authorize your children. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Our fathers were not friends with us. They were authorities. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 For example, we did not touch our father's back on our back and told him, "Oh, honey, let's play basketball, let's play soccer." 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 But as soon as he entered, we immediately had to correct ourselves. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 "Salaam Alaikum." 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 You bring your shoes. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 It was 20, 30 years ago. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Your children no longer do it and will not. We live in 2013, brothers and sisters. We must accept reality. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Our children are exposed to many things. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 It does not matter if you are in the Muslim world or elsewhere. "Ihtiram" remains, you have to respect your parents. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 But the only one who will give love to your children is Islam. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And you will not be able to provide them with these, if you are the sole authority, if you just gulp and order them without being their friend. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Each father should master the games their children play. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 If you allow your children to play video games, that is, first and foremost, a problem. 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 But if you already allow them and if you do not want to stop them, then you better play with them. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Do not go to see the news, you will not change the world. OK? 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 You checked up enough news, believe me, and nothing has changed. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 You want to know if stock exchanges have jumped or fallen ... so you do not even care about the stock market, why are you watching the news? 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.000
 It has nothing to do with you. 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.500
 Listen to them while you ride in a car. Do not come home and watch TV. Do not come home and watch the news. 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.000
 Come home and play with your children, do the task with them, talk to them, take them with you to the mosque. 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Do it with them. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Make your children love you! 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 I tell you - if the fathers do not do this, we will lose this ummet. We'll lose our next generation. 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 I'm telling you. I guarantee you. 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.500
 We would like to especially thank the generous souls who make our dream possible by their contribution. 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.500
 Please send a special gift for them and their families if you have benefited from these video clips.
