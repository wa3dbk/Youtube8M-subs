00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.610 
championship
so<00:04:42.430> because<00:04:43.360> this<00:04:43.569> is<00:04:43.659> a<00:04:43.719> first<00:04:43.990> step<00:04:44.199> first

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
so because this is a first step first

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.439 
so because this is a first step first
time<00:04:44.889> we<00:04:45.460> joined<00:04:45.699> together<00:04:45.909> with<00:04:46.150> the

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
time we joined together with the

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.420 
time we joined together with the
Australian<00:04:46.960> team<00:04:47.169> we<00:04:47.530> have<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.889> learn<00:04:48.069> their

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
Australian team we have to learn their

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.420 
Australian team we have to learn their
culture<00:04:48.939> about<00:04:49.539> how<00:04:49.810> they<00:04:49.990> improve<00:04:50.560> their

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
culture about how they improve their

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.850 
culture about how they improve their
setting<00:04:51.789> up<00:04:51.939> the<00:04:52.120> by<00:04:52.449> so<00:04:53.259> we<00:04:53.469> learn<00:04:53.620> many

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
setting up the by so we learn many

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.659 
setting up the by so we learn many
things<00:04:53.979> and<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:56.650> progress<00:04:57.009> I<00:04:57.159> think<00:04:57.189> is<00:04:57.490> so

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
things and the progress I think is so

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.330 
things and the progress I think is so
good<00:04:58.289> but<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.409> results<00:04:59.830> did<00:04:59.979> not<00:05:00.009> good

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
good but the results did not good

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.119 
good but the results did not good
because<00:05:00.729> the<00:05:00.909> day<00:05:01.439> they<00:05:02.439> come<00:05:02.680> here<00:05:02.889> in<00:05:03.039> the

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
because the day they come here in the

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:04.770 
because the day they come here in the
first<00:05:03.250> time<00:05:03.520> they<00:05:03.729> have<00:05:03.879> to<00:05:04.030> learn<00:05:04.330> about<00:05:04.539> the

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
first time they have to learn about the

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.070 
first time they have to learn about the
track<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:06.189> think<00:05:06.479> hopefully<00:05:07.479> next<00:05:07.870> year

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
track so I think hopefully next year

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.129 
track so I think hopefully next year
will<00:05:08.319> become<00:05:08.620> better<00:05:09.400> result<00:05:12.930> didn't<00:05:13.930> do<00:05:14.020> any

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
will become better result didn't do any

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.010 
will become better result didn't do any
joint<00:05:14.620> training<00:05:15.370> or<00:05:15.669> testing<00:05:16.000> when<00:05:16.750> it<00:05:16.840> comes
