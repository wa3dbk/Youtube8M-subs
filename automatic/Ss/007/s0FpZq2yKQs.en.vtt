00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.499 
but he sends out the hawlucha and I
don't<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.520> he<00:01:17.670> realized<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.360> he

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
don't think he realized this but he

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.300 
don't think he realized this but he
counters<00:01:18.960> me<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.500> well<00:01:19.740> by<00:01:19.920> sending<00:01:20.220> out

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.030

hawlucha<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:21.479> my<00:01:21.810> Marshtomp<00:01:22.080> only<00:01:22.799> has

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
hawlucha because my Marshtomp only has

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.730 
hawlucha because my Marshtomp only has
earthquake<00:01:23.670> as<00:01:23.909> its<00:01:24.090> only<00:01:24.299> attack<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.439> can't

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
earthquake as its only attack so I can't

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.710 
earthquake as its only attack so I can't
do<00:01:25.890> any<00:01:26.159> damage<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.700> him<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.479> switch

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
do any damage to him at all so I switch

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
right about half damage which is pretty

awesome and then he goes for the high
jump<00:01:50.970> cake<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.110> another<00:01:52.409> time<00:01:52.710> where

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
jump cake and this is another time where

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.300 
jump cake and this is another time where
he<00:01:52.920> gets<00:01:53.040> lucky<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.090> he<00:01:54.659> had<00:01:54.930> exactly<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.890> 6

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
he gets lucky so he had exactly as 6

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.950 
he gets lucky so he had exactly as 6
percent<00:01:56.700> chance<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.119> killing<00:01:57.360> me<00:01:57.570> right<00:01:57.719> here

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
percent chance of killing me right here

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.899 
percent chance of killing me right here
I<00:01:57.990> looked<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.710> Pokemon<00:01:59.340> showdown<00:01:59.369> his

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
I looked it up on Pokemon showdown his

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.120 
I looked it up on Pokemon showdown his
damage<00:02:00.270> calculator<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> yet<00:02:01.500> he<00:02:01.740> gets<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
damage calculator and yet he gets the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.060 
damage calculator and yet he gets the
one<00:02:02.310> shot<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.180> if<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.259> survived<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.860> would<00:02:04.979> have

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
one shot so if I survived I would have

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.340 
one shot so if I survived I would have
killed<00:02:05.310> him<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:05.909> he<00:02:06.450> turns<00:02:06.719> around<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.170> gets

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
killed him but he turns around and gets

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.020 
killed him but he turns around and gets
that<00:02:07.469> 6<00:02:07.770> percent<00:02:07.890> chance<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.550> kills<00:02:08.729> me<00:02:08.879> off

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
that 6 percent chance and kills me off

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.460 
that 6 percent chance and kills me off
right<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.750> kind<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:09.989> sucks<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.440> I

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
right there and that kind of sucks so I

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.210 
right there and that kind of sucks so I
had<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> set<00:02:10.830> out<00:02:10.920> manda<00:02:11.310> buzz<00:02:11.489> and

understand why kept setting up here but

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.960 
understand why kept setting up here but
whatever<00:05:16.890> and<00:05:17.160> then<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:17.610> go<00:05:17.730> for<00:05:17.910> the

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
whatever and then I go for the

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.000 
whatever and then I go for the
earthquake<00:05:18.390> and<00:05:18.660> that<00:05:18.690> does<00:05:19.350> a<00:05:19.380> little<00:05:19.770> more

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
earthquake and that does a little more

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.860 
earthquake and that does a little more
than<00:05:20.160> half<00:05:20.400> scrappie<00:05:21.090> apparently<00:05:21.510> is<00:05:21.660> very

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
than half scrappie apparently is very

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.170 
than half scrappie apparently is very
bulky<00:05:22.200> he<00:05:22.530> took<00:05:22.770> that<00:05:22.890> +2<00:05:23.430> attack<00:05:23.790> from

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
bulky he took that +2 attack from

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.000 
bulky he took that +2 attack from
Marshtomp<00:05:24.780> actually<00:05:25.470> it's<00:05:25.560> from<00:05:25.680> a<00:05:25.710> Marshtomp

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
Marshtomp actually it's from a Marshtomp

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.610 
Marshtomp actually it's from a Marshtomp
so<00:05:26.580> maybe<00:05:27.300> it's<00:05:27.750> not<00:05:27.870> that<00:05:27.930> fault<00:05:28.350> either<00:05:28.500> I

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
so maybe it's not that fault either I

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.500 
so maybe it's not that fault either I
think<00:05:28.860> Scrappy's<00:05:29.220> pretty<00:05:29.460> bulky<00:05:29.640> and<00:05:30.270> he<00:05:30.360> goes

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
think Scrappy's pretty bulky and he goes

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.790 
think Scrappy's pretty bulky and he goes
to<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.720> train<00:05:30.930> punch<00:05:31.200> that<00:05:31.410> does<00:05:31.590> basically

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
to the train punch that does basically

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.340 
to the train punch that does basically
nothing<00:05:32.730> to<00:05:32.880> me<00:05:33.030> because<00:05:33.390> Marshtomp<00:05:34.020> again

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
nothing to me because Marshtomp again

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.280 
nothing to me because Marshtomp again
it's<00:05:34.530> a<00:05:34.620> tank<00:05:35.300> now<00:05:36.300> he<00:05:36.810> brings<00:05:36.990> out<00:05:37.170> the

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
it's a tank now he brings out the

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.930 
it's a tank now he brings out the
greninja<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.890> I<00:05:37.950> get<00:05:38.100> scared<00:05:38.280> here<00:05:38.700> because

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
greninja and I get scared here because

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.000 
greninja and I get scared here because
most<00:05:39.120> /<00:05:39.270> ninjas<00:05:39.570> carry<00:05:39.900> Grass<00:05:40.320> Knot<00:05:40.350> and<00:05:40.860> that

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
most / ninjas carry Grass Knot and that

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.100 
most / ninjas carry Grass Knot and that
would<00:05:41.130> completely<00:05:41.520> wreck<00:05:41.790> me<00:05:42.030> but<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:42.810> decided

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
would completely wreck me but I decided

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.450 
would completely wreck me but I decided
not<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.380> switch<00:05:43.620> out<00:05:43.800> and<00:05:43.920> he<00:05:44.010> just<00:05:44.160> goes<00:05:44.280> for

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
ice beam that goes of it does a decent

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.290 
ice beam that goes of it does a decent
amount<00:05:46.950> of<00:05:47.100> damage<00:05:47.160> and<00:05:47.850> I<00:05:47.940> go<00:05:48.090> for<00:05:48.210> the

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.590 
amount of damage and I go for the
earthquake<00:05:48.450> and<00:05:48.960> just<00:05:49.290> kill<00:05:49.500> that<00:05:49.530> off<00:05:49.770> -<00:05:50.600> now
