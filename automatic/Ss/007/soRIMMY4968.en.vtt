solutions<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.059> wanted<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.450> share<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.080> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
solutions I wanted to share one of the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.870 
solutions I wanted to share one of the
upgrades<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.650> made<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.009> my<00:00:14.099> orchard<00:00:14.280> recently

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
upgrades I made to my orchard recently

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.029 
upgrades I made to my orchard recently
so<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.839> workshop<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.320> planted<00:00:16.680> two<00:00:16.830> years

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
so this workshop was planted two years

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.620 
so this workshop was planted two years
ago<00:00:17.250> that's<00:00:17.460> why<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.640> trees<00:00:17.940> are<00:00:18.090> super<00:00:18.359> small

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
ago that's why the trees are super small

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.450 
ago that's why the trees are super small
they're<00:00:19.199> dwarf<00:00:19.680> variety<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.279> they're<00:00:20.369> not

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
they're dwarf variety and they're not

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.210 
they're dwarf variety and they're not
going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> get<00:00:20.880> really<00:00:21.210> huge<00:00:22.010> originally<00:00:23.010> when

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
going to get really huge originally when

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.980 
going to get really huge originally when
the<00:00:23.340> orchard<00:00:23.670> was<00:00:23.789> planted<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.300> wasn't<00:00:24.600> here

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the orchard was planted I wasn't here

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.529 
the orchard was planted I wasn't here
and<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.560> had<00:00:25.680> used<00:00:25.890> bamboo<00:00:26.220> stakes<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.359> those

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and we had used bamboo stakes and those

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.660 
and we had used bamboo stakes and those
had<00:00:27.689> already<00:00:27.840> started<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.410> rot<00:00:28.590> out<00:00:28.619> fall<00:00:29.250> over

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
had already started to rot out fall over

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.179 
had already started to rot out fall over
break<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.269> half<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.560> could<00:00:31.740> tell<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.040> they

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
break in half and I could tell that they

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.889 
break in half and I could tell that they
just<00:00:32.430> weren't<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> last<00:00:33.420> for<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> long

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
just weren't going to last for the long

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.830 
just weren't going to last for the long
term<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:35.070> we're<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.760> through<00:00:35.910> now<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.719> in

the entire orchard to hold up the trees
for<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.910> long<00:00:42.120> term<00:00:42.480> we're<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.320> with<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
for the long term we're going with a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.729 
for the long term we're going with a
a-frame<00:00:44.280> type<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.960> know<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.410> shape

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739

Christmas<00:00:47.309> tree<00:00:47.870> pruning<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.500> we're<00:00:49.860> staking

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
Christmas tree pruning so we're staking

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.029 
Christmas tree pruning so we're staking
each<00:00:50.520> individual<00:00:51.120> tree<00:00:51.420> versus<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.199> dozen

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
each individual tree versus the dozen

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.799 
each individual tree versus the dozen
other<00:00:53.190> ways<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.670> could<00:00:53.910> prune<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> trees<00:00:54.539> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
other ways you could prune the trees I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.830 
other ways you could prune the trees I
got<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.680> stakes<00:00:56.489> from<00:00:56.730> best<00:00:57.120> angle<00:00:57.600> tree

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
got the stakes from best angle tree

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200 
got the stakes from best angle tree
stakes<00:00:58.140> calm<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:59.190> little<00:00:59.520> shout-out<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.090> them

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
stakes calm a little shout-out to them

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.459 
stakes calm a little shout-out to them
because<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:00.870> happy<00:01:01.199> with<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
because I was really happy with the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.820 
because I was really happy with the
product<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.449> they're<00:01:03.449> untreated<00:01:04.199> steel<00:01:04.470> so

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
product and they're untreated steel so

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.200 
product and they're untreated steel so
they're<00:01:05.010> already<00:01:05.250> starting<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.700> rust<00:01:05.939> which

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
they're already starting to rust which

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.789 
they're already starting to rust which
is<00:01:06.360> fine<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:06.840> that's<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.619> hurt

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
is fine because that's not going to hurt

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.880 
is fine because that's not going to hurt
anything<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.720> I<00:01:09.720> figured<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.290> was<00:01:10.680> better

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
anything and I figured that was better

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.410 
anything and I figured that was better
than<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> painted<00:01:11.640> ones<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> painted<00:01:12.299> ones

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
than the painted ones the painted ones

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.620 
than the painted ones the painted ones
were<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:12.840> more<00:01:13.020> expensive<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.630> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
were a little more expensive and you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.789 
were a little more expensive and you
know<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> don't<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:16.080> what<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> paint

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
know I don't know what was in the paint

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.990 
know I don't know what was in the paint
that<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> go<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> ground

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that was going to go in the ground

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.270 
that was going to go in the ground
the<00:01:18.450> steel<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.380> iron<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.950> steel

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the steel is just it's iron and steel

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.280 
the steel is just it's iron and steel
and<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.670> minerals<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.659> can't<00:01:22.200> imagine

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and it's minerals and I can't imagine

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.800 
and it's minerals and I can't imagine
it's<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> leach<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.340> much<00:01:23.630> it's<00:01:24.630> been

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
it's going to leach that much it's been

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.480 
it's going to leach that much it's been
a<00:01:24.840> process<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:25.830> around<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.280> ladder

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
a process you go around with a ladder

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.850 
a process you go around with a ladder
with<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> post<00:01:27.390> pounder<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.080> pound<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.560> each

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
stake next to the tree and then we're

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.899 
stake next to the tree and then we're
retying<00:01:31.229> them<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> same<00:01:32.400> rubber

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
really happy not only with the way it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.810 
really happy not only with the way it
looks<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.290> far<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:41.189> know<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.460> just<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
looks but so far you know it's just a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
looks but so far you know it's just a
steel<00:01:42.420> rod<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.170> made<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> real

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
steel rod but it's made a real

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.429 
steel rod but it's made a real
difference<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:45.090> me<00:01:45.540> being<00:01:45.780> able<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.020> sleep<00:01:46.259> at

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
difference and me being able to sleep at

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.080 
difference and me being able to sleep at
night<00:01:46.619> knowing<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> trees<00:01:47.759> are<00:01:47.909> more

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
night knowing that the trees are more
