00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
think that there's a price we pay

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.150 
think that there's a price we pay
because

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
because

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.950 
because
it<00:02:14.280> because<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.880> fog<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.570> Jupiter

Neptune that we talked with earlier in

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the day even though it's annoying it has

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.160 
the day even though it's annoying it has
some<00:02:19.830> magic<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:21.390> may<00:02:21.570> focus<00:02:21.870> so

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
some magic to it and we may focus so

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.840 
some magic to it and we may focus so
much<00:02:22.320> on<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.560> reality<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.370> missed<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
much on the reality that we missed the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.940 
much on the reality that we missed the
subtle<00:02:24.240> sweetness<00:02:24.540> right<00:02:25.170> or<00:02:25.380> we<00:02:25.530> can<00:02:25.710> focus

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
subtle sweetness right or we can focus

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.980 
subtle sweetness right or we can focus
so<00:02:26.280> much<00:02:26.490> on<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.760> details<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:27.960> a

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
so much on the details that we have a

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.260 
so much on the details that we have a
