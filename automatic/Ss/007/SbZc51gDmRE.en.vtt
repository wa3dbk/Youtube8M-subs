rate of success and saving and on Cydia

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.519 
rate of success and saving and on Cydia
market<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.970> yes<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.510> oncidium<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.170> super

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
market so yes this oncidium was super

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.200 
market so yes this oncidium was super
sick<00:00:22.740> when<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.920> got<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.369> didn't<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.789> any<00:00:23.970> roots

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
sick when I got it didn't have any roots

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.810 
sick when I got it didn't have any roots
if<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.140> remember<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.619> had<00:00:25.800> two<00:00:26.130> flower<00:00:26.400> spikes

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
if you remember it had two flower spikes

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.509 
if you remember it had two flower spikes
one<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.510> kind<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.710> bloom<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.160> other<00:00:29.279> one

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
one was kind of in bloom the other one

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.780 
one was kind of in bloom the other one
was<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:29.910> bud<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.810> buds<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:32.309> was<00:00:32.550> saying

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
was in bud just buds and I was saying

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.819 
was in bud just buds and I was saying
then<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.140> want<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.440> save<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
then that if I want to save the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.500 
then that if I want to save the
surrogate<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.370> need<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.880> cut<00:00:36.059> those<00:00:36.210> flower

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
surrogate I need to cut those flower

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.389 
surrogate I need to cut those flower
spikes<00:00:36.899> or<00:00:37.140> else<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.620> gonna<00:00:37.950> deplete

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
spikes or else it's just gonna deplete

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.240 
spikes or else it's just gonna deplete
it<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.670> energy<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.420> was<00:00:39.510> pretty<00:00:39.840> drastic<00:00:40.469> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it of energy so it was pretty drastic so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.549 
it of energy so it was pretty drastic so
here's<00:00:41.579> an<00:00:41.730> update<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.750> Sun<00:00:42.930> cerium<00:00:43.290> it's

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
here's an update on the Sun cerium it's

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.580 
here's an update on the Sun cerium it's
doing<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.309> great<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.930> pseudo<00:00:46.170> bulb<00:00:46.320> used

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
doing really great the pseudo bulb used

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
doing really great the pseudo bulb used
to<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> lot<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.280> shriveled<00:00:48.030> than<00:00:48.329> this

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to be a lot more shriveled than this

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.439 
to be a lot more shriveled than this
so<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.350> plumping<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.129> still<00:00:50.969> doesn't<00:00:51.329> look

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
so it's plumping up still doesn't look

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.439 
so it's plumping up still doesn't look
100%<00:00:51.949> perfect<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.550> satisfied<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
100% perfect but I'm satisfied with it

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.549 
100% perfect but I'm satisfied with it
we<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.500> pretty<00:00:56.489> nice-looking<00:00:57.449> new<00:00:58.230> chute

the project okay so as you can see the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.039 
the project okay so as you can see the
Sun<00:01:14.100> CDM<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.580> potted<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.119> some<00:01:15.479> sphagnum<00:01:15.689> moss

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.170 
Sun CDM is potted in some sphagnum moss
and<00:01:16.259> bark<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.770> keeps<00:01:17.280> more<00:01:17.610> moisture<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and bark this keeps more moisture and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.440 
and bark this keeps more moisture and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
but I just discovered recently that some

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.380 
but I just discovered recently that some
of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> roots<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.670> just<00:01:23.670> trying<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.150> surface

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
of the roots are just trying to surface

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.320 
of the roots are just trying to surface
and<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.920> cerium<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.670> really

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and for this one cerium it's not really

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
and for this one cerium it's not really
okay<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> leave<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:28.500> roots<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> air

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
okay to leave these roots in the air

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.310 
okay to leave these roots in the air
like<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.759> I'm<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.090> sure<00:01:30.420> what<00:01:30.630> what's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320

like this I'm not sure what what's
happening<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> roots<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> air<00:01:32.670> but

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
happening with the roots in the air but

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.819 
happening with the roots in the air but
anyway<00:01:33.270> well<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:34.079> I'm<00:01:34.170> gonna<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.530> today<00:01:34.710> is

anyway well what I'm gonna do today is
I'm<00:01:35.100> gonna<00:01:35.490> top<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.570> pot<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.770> some

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I'm gonna top this pot with some

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
I'm gonna top this pot with some
sphagnum<00:01:38.340> Moss<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.060> will<00:01:39.240> retain<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
sphagnum Moss this will retain the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.380 
sphagnum Moss this will retain the
moisture<00:01:40.170> around<00:01:40.799> also<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> new<00:01:42.119> roots

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
moisture around also for the new roots

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.440 
moisture around also for the new roots

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
of the new chute here it has a few good

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.530 
of the new chute here it has a few good
roots<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.799> starting<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.299> just

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
roots here just starting out and I just

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.590 
roots here just starting out and I just
don't<00:01:48.720> want<00:01:48.990> them<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.350> dehydrate<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.600> first

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
don't want them to dehydrate so first

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.679 
don't want them to dehydrate so first
things<00:01:51.780> first<00:01:51.899> I'm<00:01:52.350> gonna<00:01:52.530> top<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.689> hot

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
things first I'm gonna top this hot

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.830 
things first I'm gonna top this hot
little<00:01:55.649> layer<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.009> sphagnum<00:01:56.310> Moss<00:01:56.790> I'm<00:01:57.659> gonna

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
little layer of sphagnum Moss I'm gonna

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.080 
little layer of sphagnum Moss I'm gonna
go<00:01:58.020> crazy<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:58.740> its<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.430> add<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.820> little

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
go crazy about its just add a little

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.160 
go crazy about its just add a little
layer<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> fabulous<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.469> some<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:01.920> moisture

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
layer of fabulous for some more moisture

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.870 
layer of fabulous for some more moisture
so<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.579> layer<00:02:05.759> of

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
so here we have it just a layer of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
so here we have it just a layer of
sphagnum<00:02:06.119> Moss<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> surface<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.439> keep

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
sphagnum Moss on the surface to keep

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.589 
sphagnum Moss on the surface to keep
that<00:02:07.890> extra<00:02:08.250> moisture<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.420> really

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
that extra moisture and this is really

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.010 
that extra moisture and this is really
useful<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.349> my

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
useful in my

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.080 
useful in my
particular<00:02:11.380> summer<00:02:11.680> time<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:12.220> really<00:02:12.460> hot

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
particular summer time it's really hot

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.050 
particular summer time it's really hot
apparently<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.350> year<00:02:14.890> I'm<00:02:15.370> gonna<00:02:15.700> show<00:02:16.000> you

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
apparently this year I'm gonna show you

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.380 
apparently this year I'm gonna show you
the<00:02:16.390> humidity<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.320> air<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:18.370> pretty<00:02:19.090> high

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
the humidity of the air is pretty high

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.780 
the humidity of the air is pretty high
now<00:02:19.810> last<00:02:20.350> year<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.740> had<00:02:20.920> two<00:02:21.040> twenty<00:02:21.490> five

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
now last year I had two twenty five

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.660 
now last year I had two twenty five
percent<00:02:22.000> humidity<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.320> that's<00:02:23.920> good<00:02:24.310> but

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
percent humidity so that's good but

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.620 
percent humidity so that's good but
still<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:25.870> very<00:02:26.320> very<00:02:26.590> warm<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.730> all<00:02:28.480> the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
still it is very very warm and all the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.780 
still it is very very warm and all the
moisture<00:02:28.960> evaporates<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.370> layer<00:02:30.610> of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
moisture evaporates so a layer of

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.710 
moisture evaporates so a layer of
sphagnum<00:02:31.240> Moss<00:02:31.540> on<00:02:31.690> top<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.080> your<00:02:32.670> pot<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
sphagnum Moss on top of your pot is the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.570 
sphagnum Moss on top of your pot is the
lifesaver<00:02:35.170> especially<00:02:35.680> for<00:02:35.830> oncidium<00:02:36.250> or

lifesaver especially for oncidium or
military<00:02:37.480> offices<00:02:37.840> or<00:02:38.050> stuff<00:02:38.590> like<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.770> who

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
military offices or stuff like that who

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.280 
military offices or stuff like that who
do<00:02:39.400> actually<00:02:39.940> like<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:40.870> more<00:02:41.080> moisture

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
do actually like to have more moisture

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.130 
do actually like to have more moisture
now<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.070> next<00:02:42.280> thing<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.580> want<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.880> do<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.930> I

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
now the next thing I want to do like I

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.990 
now the next thing I want to do like I
want<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.650> try<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.890> correct<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.730> little

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
want to try to correct this little

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.700 
want to try to correct this little
growth<00:02:46.390> here<00:02:46.690> I<00:02:46.720> don't<00:02:46.990> want<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.350> go<00:02:47.530> like

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
growth here I don't want it to go like

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.010 
growth here I don't want it to go like
this<00:02:47.980> because<00:02:48.790> my<00:02:48.910> light<00:02:49.210> source<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.750> not

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
this because my light source is not

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.760 
this because my light source is not
necessarily<00:02:50.410> from<00:02:50.710> above<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> balcony

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
necessarily from above I have a balcony

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.160 
necessarily from above I have a balcony
it's<00:02:53.770> from<00:02:54.070> one<00:02:54.310> side<00:02:54.610> all<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.300> new<00:02:55.600> growth<00:02:55.810> of

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
it's from one side all the new growth of

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.070 
it's from one side all the new growth of
my<00:02:56.320> idiom<00:02:56.770> orchids<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.430> brass<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.690> all<00:02:58.930> of

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
my idiom orchids and brass and all of

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.160 
my idiom orchids and brass and all of
that<00:02:59.110> tend<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.860> go<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.070> one<00:03:00.310> side<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.000> roy<00:03:01.840> has<00:03:02.110> a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
that tend to go to one side so roy has a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.290 
that tend to go to one side so roy has a
very<00:03:02.440> good<00:03:02.590> system<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.280> plant<00:03:03.550> support<00:03:04.060> and

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
very good system of a plant support and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.770 
very good system of a plant support and
i'm<00:03:04.390> gonna<00:03:04.570> link<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.110> his<00:03:05.350> video<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.780> in

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
i'm gonna link you to his video and in

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.020 
i'm gonna link you to his video and in
the<00:03:07.990> description<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.680> i<00:03:08.770> did<00:03:08.980> start<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.880> make

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
the description and i did start to make

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.850 
the description and i did start to make
a<00:03:10.060> support<00:03:10.540> but<00:03:10.690> this<00:03:10.990> growth<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.530> still

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
a support but this growth is still

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.220 
a support but this growth is still
pretty<00:03:12.190> tiny<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:12.820> i<00:03:13.240> don't<00:03:13.450> want<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.810> support

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
pretty tiny and i don't want to support

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.090 
pretty tiny and i don't want to support
it<00:03:14.350> from<00:03:14.590> here<00:03:15.400> actually<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.910> want<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.270> try<00:03:16.510> to

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
it from here actually you want to try to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.740 
it from here actually you want to try to
straighten<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.400> from<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.940> base<00:03:19.150> as<00:03:19.360> much<00:03:19.510> as<00:03:19.660> I

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
straighten it from the base as much as I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.140 
straighten it from the base as much as I
can<00:03:19.810> without<00:03:20.650> actually<00:03:21.160> breaking<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:21.730> what

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
can without actually breaking it so what

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.640 
can without actually breaking it so what
I'm<00:03:22.240> gonna<00:03:22.390> do<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.720> I'm<00:03:22.810> gonna<00:03:22.930> tie<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.380> up<00:03:23.470> to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tie it up to

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.890 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna tie it up to
the<00:03:23.770> motor<00:03:23.980> plant<00:03:24.280> with<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.180> piece<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.570> raffia

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
the motor plant with a piece of raffia

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.390 
the motor plant with a piece of raffia
tape<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.840> starts<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.470> grow<00:03:29.770> a<00:03:30.070> little

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
tape just so it starts to grow a little

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.690 
tape just so it starts to grow a little
bit<00:03:31.530> straighter<00:03:32.530> because<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.070> just<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.580> just

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
bit straighter because I just I just

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.310 
bit straighter because I just I just
don't<00:03:33.970> have<00:03:34.209> space<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.600> have<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.020> like<00:03:35.170> that

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
don't have space to have it like that

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.170 
don't have space to have it like that
and<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.590> doesn't<00:03:35.740> look<00:03:36.130> pretty<00:03:36.400> okay<00:03:36.610> so<00:03:36.820> how
