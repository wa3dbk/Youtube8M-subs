3d s without actually recorded on the
unit<00:00:27.210> yourself<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.869> let's<00:00:28.769> go<00:00:28.949> ahead<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.220> see

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
unit yourself so let's go ahead and see

there's<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> neat<00:00:59.309> little<00:00:59.430> trick<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.969> do

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
there's a neat little trick you can do

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.360 
there's a neat little trick you can do
to<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:01.320> people<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.829> coined<00:01:02.100> as

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to get to what people have coined as

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.060 
to get to what people have coined as
that<00:01:02.940> negative<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.629> world<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.170> mean<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.860> still

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
that negative one world I mean it still

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.750 
that negative one world I mean it still
is<00:01:05.100> persist

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
is persist

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.600 
is persist
I<00:01:05.790> think<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.710> Ambassador<00:01:07.710> games<00:01:07.920> are<00:01:08.189> direct

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
I think the Ambassador games are direct

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
I think the Ambassador games are direct
emulation<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.650> original<00:01:10.650> NES

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
emulation of the original NES

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.120 
emulation of the original NES

be able to show you the negative one

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.770 
be able to show you the negative one
world<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.799> go<00:01:22.799> ahead<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:25.040> yeah<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.720> is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
towards that brick at the same time you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.270 
towards that brick at the same time you
don't<00:01:57.479> want<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.750> break<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> brick<00:01:58.290> because

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
don't want to break the brick because

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.429 
don't want to break the brick because
once<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.640> brick<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.090> broken<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.140> does

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
once the brick is broken it just does

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.910 
once the brick is broken it just does
not<00:02:01.469> work<00:02:03.020> took<00:02:04.020> me<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> couple<00:02:04.259> tries<00:02:04.680> another

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
not work took me a couple tries another

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.960 
not work took me a couple tries another
to<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.969> lined<00:02:06.180> up<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.360> right<00:02:07.729> it's<00:02:08.729> kind

to get it lined up just right it's kind

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:21.790 
to get it lined up just right it's kind
of<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.090> hassle

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.320 

we<00:02:22.800> go<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.700> push<00:02:23.910> all<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.209> way<00:02:24.239> through

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
we go and you push all the way through

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.630 
we go and you push all the way through
you<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:26.540> he<00:02:27.540> still<00:02:27.750> pops<00:02:28.019> up<00:02:28.230> there<00:02:28.640> but

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
you see that he still pops up there but

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.620 
you see that he still pops up there but
I'm<00:02:29.760> all<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:29.940> way<00:02:30.000> through<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.300> don't<00:02:30.420> want

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
I'm all the way through you don't want

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.210 
I'm all the way through you don't want
to<00:02:30.690> run<00:02:30.840> all<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.050> way<00:02:31.140> over<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.800> will<00:02:31.920> expose

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
to run all the way over that will expose

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.940 
to run all the way over that will expose
all<00:02:32.459> three<00:02:32.670> pipes<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.739> go

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
all three pipes but if you if you go

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.320 
all three pipes but if you if you go
over<00:02:35.130> just<00:02:35.160> far<00:02:35.459> enough<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.640> go<00:02:35.849> down<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.120> one

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
over just far enough to go down this one

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.199 
over just far enough to go down this one
here<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.650> I'm<00:02:37.769> in<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:38.130> world<00:02:38.370> negative

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.199 
actually goes into the tube at the end
of<00:03:34.890> this<00:03:34.950> why<00:03:35.190> it's<00:03:35.370> called<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.730> negative<00:03:36.060> one

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209

of this why it's called the negative one
levels<00:03:36.540> once<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:39.170> start<00:03:40.170> back<00:03:40.410> over<00:03:40.620> rate<00:03:41.010> at

the beginning and this goes on pretty

this level with with the firepower and
you<00:03:54.180> can<00:03:54.420> boost<00:03:54.600> your<00:03:54.690> score<00:03:55.019> but<00:03:55.230> beyond<00:03:55.530> that
