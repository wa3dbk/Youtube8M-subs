00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
and they're not usually focused on a

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.490 
and they're not usually focused on a
specific<00:03:04.340> goal<00:03:04.850> like<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.269> are<00:03:05.480> sometimes<00:03:06.170> if

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
specific goal like you are sometimes if

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.920 
specific goal like you are sometimes if
you<00:03:06.590> go<00:03:06.709> as<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.310> team<00:03:07.580> so<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.510> know<00:03:08.569> that's<00:03:08.690> kind

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
you go as a team so you know that's kind

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.600 
you go as a team so you know that's kind
of<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.319> thing<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.680> sets<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.069> team<00:03:10.280> apart

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
of the thing that sets the team apart

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
of the thing that sets the team apart
from<00:03:11.269> a<00:03:11.569> random<00:03:12.560> team<00:03:12.769> but<00:03:13.130> as<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.370> solo<00:03:14.269> player

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
from a random team but as a solo player

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.210 
from a random team but as a solo player
like<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.019> said<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.290> get<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> lot<00:03:15.739> more<00:03:15.769> kills

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
like I said you get a lot more kills

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.670 
like I said you get a lot more kills
it's<00:03:16.519> a<00:03:16.610> lot<00:03:16.790> easier<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:17.480> actually<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.500> lot

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
it's a lot easier to actually is a lot

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.380 
it's a lot easier to actually is a lot
harder<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.190> control<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.640> map<00:03:19.820> believe<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.299> or

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
harder to control the map believe it or

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.600 
harder to control the map believe it or
not<00:03:20.510> because<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.170> know<00:03:21.200> put<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> full<00:03:22.400> team

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
not because you know put the full team

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:23.860 
not because you know put the full team
you're<00:03:22.790> going<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:22.970> be<00:03:23.060> able<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.299> control<00:03:23.600> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
you're going to be able to control the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.500 
you're going to be able to control the
engagements<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.590> map<00:03:24.769> etc<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:25.519> lot<00:03:25.910> easier<00:03:26.120> but

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
engagements the map etc a lot easier but

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.300 
engagements the map etc a lot easier but
as<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.959> solo<00:03:27.290> player<00:03:27.560> it's<00:03:27.769> hard<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.040> control

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
as a solo player it's hard to control

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.340 
as a solo player it's hard to control
the<00:03:28.489> map<00:03:28.640> but<00:03:28.910> once<00:03:29.180> you're<00:03:29.329> you<00:03:29.780> do<00:03:29.989> get

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
the map but once you're you do get

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.600 
the map but once you're you do get
yourself<00:03:30.680> in<00:03:30.799> a<00:03:30.860> position<00:03:30.980> where<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.430> control

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
yourself in a position where you control

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.360 
yourself in a position where you control
the<00:03:31.880> map<00:03:32.030> it's<00:03:32.450> usually<00:03:32.930> easier<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:33.829> do

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
the map it's usually easier to just do

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.940 
the map it's usually easier to just do
really<00:03:34.790> really<00:03:34.910> well<00:03:35.060> as<00:03:35.480> an<00:03:36.380> individual

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
really really well as an individual

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.970 
really really well as an individual
because<00:03:37.459> you<00:03:37.640> know<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:37.820> are<00:03:38.180> able<00:03:38.360> to<00:03:38.980> rush

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
because you know you are able to rush

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.400 
because you know you are able to rush
the<00:03:40.190> spawns<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.540> notice<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:41.870> like<00:03:42.140> even

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
the spawns and you notice that like even

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
the spawns and you notice that like even
right<00:03:42.440> now<00:03:42.590> like<00:03:42.739> this<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.130> a<00:03:43.160> good<00:03:43.340> example

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
right now like this is a good example

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.880 
right now like this is a good example
right<00:03:44.030> now<00:03:44.840> I'm<00:03:45.109> rushing<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:45.530> fall<00:03:45.769> and

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
right now I'm rushing this fall and

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.380 
right now I'm rushing this fall and
write<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.190> enemy<00:03:46.459> spawn<00:03:46.700> you<00:03:47.000> know<00:03:47.090> we<00:03:47.269> do

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
write the enemy spawn you know we do

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.849 
write the enemy spawn you know we do
have<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.540> swarm<00:03:47.840> up<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.290> enemies<00:03:48.560> are<00:03:48.590> dying

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
have a swarm up so the enemies are dying

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.160 
have a swarm up so the enemies are dying
really<00:03:49.160> really<00:03:49.400> fast<00:03:49.670> but<00:03:50.299> let's<00:03:50.870> just<00:03:50.930> say

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
really really fast but let's just say

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.740 
really really fast but let's just say
this<00:03:51.320> is<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.560> enemy<00:03:51.890> spawn<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.310> usually<00:03:52.850> the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
this is the enemy spawn and usually the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.259 
this is the enemy spawn and usually the
randoms<00:03:54.410> don't<00:03:55.160> follow<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.640> into<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:55.970> spawn

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
randoms don't follow you into the spawn

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.430 
randoms don't follow you into the spawn
you<00:03:56.420> know<00:03:56.510> there<00:03:56.660> are<00:03:56.690> some<00:03:56.959> times<00:03:57.200> when<00:03:57.290> they

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
you know there are some times when they

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.780 
you know there are some times when they
do<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.799> there's<00:03:57.920> sometimes<00:03:58.130> when<00:03:58.430> they<00:03:58.519> even

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
do and there's sometimes when they even

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.870 
do and there's sometimes when they even
flip<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.180> spawns<00:03:59.450> but<00:04:00.040> usually<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.340> can<00:04:01.640> be

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
flip the spawns but usually you can be

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.910 
flip the spawns but usually you can be
in<00:04:02.269> certain<00:04:02.720> situations<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.380> only<00:04:03.410> one

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
in certain situations the only one

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.590 
in certain situations the only one
rushing<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.489> spawn<00:04:04.730> depending<00:04:05.269> on<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.570> know

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
rushing the spawn depending on you know

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.990 
rushing the spawn depending on you know
the<00:04:05.769> situation<00:04:06.769> i<00:04:06.859> can't<00:04:07.100> speak<00:04:07.519> for<00:04:07.579> every

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
the situation i can't speak for every

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.530 
the situation i can't speak for every
single<00:04:08.299> time<00:04:08.540> obviously<00:04:08.870> but<00:04:09.579> if<00:04:10.579> if<00:04:11.390> you're

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
single time obviously but if if you're

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.449 
single time obviously but if if you're
on<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.660> team<00:04:11.930> like<00:04:12.140> in<00:04:12.350> this<00:04:12.500> game<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:12.859> saw<00:04:13.070> my

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
on a team like in this game you saw my

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.949 
on a team like in this game you saw my
team<00:04:13.670> was<00:04:13.910> kind<00:04:14.120> of<00:04:14.209> following<00:04:14.570> me<00:04:14.660> i<00:04:14.690> had

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
team was kind of following me i had

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.599 
team was kind of following me i had
different<00:04:15.320> people<00:04:15.590> who<00:04:15.739> were<00:04:15.859> also<00:04:16.160> good

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
different people who were also good

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.090 
different people who were also good
players<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.209> they<00:04:18.079> were<00:04:18.140> just<00:04:18.620> following<00:04:18.829> me

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
players and they were just following me

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.560 
players and they were just following me
into<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.400> spawn<00:04:19.669> as<00:04:19.850> well<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.269> because<00:04:20.539> of

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
into the spawn as well and because of

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.089 
into the spawn as well and because of
that<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.930> spawn<00:04:21.200> flips<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:21.739> know<00:04:21.890> had<00:04:22.070> I

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
that the spawn flips so you know had I

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.350 
that the spawn flips so you know had I
been<00:04:22.310> playing<00:04:22.550> with<00:04:22.640> people<00:04:22.940> who<00:04:23.030> weren't<00:04:23.240> so

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
been playing with people who weren't so

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.660 
been playing with people who weren't so
knowledgeable<00:04:23.990> on<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.710> game

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
knowledgeable on the game

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.550 
knowledgeable on the game
then<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:26.720> could<00:04:26.900> have<00:04:26.990> went<00:04:27.140> a<00:04:27.230> little<00:04:27.380> bit

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
then it could have went a little bit

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.990 
then it could have went a little bit
differently<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.160> I<00:04:28.280> could<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:28.910> potentially

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
differently and I could have potentially

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.450 
differently and I could have potentially
been<00:04:29.390> able<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.990> destroy<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.860> enemy<00:04:31.160> in<00:04:31.340> their

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
been able to destroy the enemy in their

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.550 
been able to destroy the enemy in their
spawn<00:04:31.730> alone<00:04:32.240> and<00:04:32.540> you<00:04:32.630> know<00:04:32.750> maybe<00:04:33.230> he<00:04:33.410> could

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
spawn alone and you know maybe he could
