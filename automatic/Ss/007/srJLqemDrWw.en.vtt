00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.359
 fischl also mesh popcorn 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.880
 We are also very simple 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.080
 so start with three walls of air 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.070
 the height of chopsticks and we work 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.990
 now a few triple puffed mesh 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 we skip an ass doing one 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.640
 another air mass now in the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.400
 next but one stitch in the second stitch 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.220
 a triple industry in this case 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.800
 for an envelope a sting 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.809
 get work phases and pull up so high 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.969
 like this three walls air machine like that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.969
 about the height of a town 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.850
 a second time envelope pierce threadlike 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.329
 pick up a hoop and a third time 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.270
 strike an envelope a sting 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.610
 pick up thread and now all 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.559
 Take off and take off with you at once 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.789
 Close an air mass 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.250
 That's an industry now an air mass 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.989
 we skip a stitch again 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.989
 So give these guys a little bit 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.070
 So distance get a envelope 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.400
 sting thread pick up pull envelope 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.200
 pick up a sting thread and pull up 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.150
 a third time a sting 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.790
 always the same spot, of course, a 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.159
 pick up sting thread pick up and now 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.000
 unwind all the loops at once 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.880
 with a mass of air and summarize 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.880
 an air mass for the distance 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.880
 do it a third time for punch 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.070
 Plug pick thread always pull 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.740
 pull as high as a chopstick 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.740
 is high 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.969
 Together from mesh with a mass of air 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.880
 Summarize an air mass for the 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:57.679
 distance and another industry results 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.020
 a very sexy pattern you can 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.960
 but crochet whole baby blankets 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.670
 You can put these tufts mesh 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:12.440
 Crochet each other and just use 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.880
 make it out or you with 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.190
 different other stitches 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.069
 combine here daily at the end 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.959
 a stick for the stable edge 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.959
 So are between mesh
