00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.770 

so<00:00:02.340> I<00:00:02.370> figured<00:00:02.790> after<00:00:02.909> that<00:00:03.179> big<00:00:03.360> rain<00:00:03.600> it

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
so I figured after that big rain it

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.460 
so I figured after that big rain it
would<00:00:03.870> be<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> good<00:00:04.200> time<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.470> burn<00:00:06.170> came<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.290> get

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
would be a good time to burn came to get

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.520 
would be a good time to burn came to get
down<00:00:07.680> for<00:00:07.919> right<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.900> in<00:00:09.900> fact<00:00:10.200> I'm<00:00:10.380> a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
down for right here and in fact I'm a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.200 
down for right here and in fact I'm a
little<00:00:10.860> leery<00:00:11.010> still<00:00:11.460> burning<00:00:11.820> even<00:00:12.090> though

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
rather the hot embers blow towards this

rather the hot embers blow towards this
way<00:00:33.510> lifting<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.020> damn<00:00:34.200> weak<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:35.700> that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
way lifting that damn weak I know that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.729 
way lifting that damn weak I know that
crap<00:00:36.120> will<00:00:36.270> catch<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.600> fire<00:00:36.780> with

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.720 

I'm<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.129> bit<00:00:42.340> of<00:00:42.460> a<00:00:42.520> pyromaniac<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:44.320> half<00:00:45.100> burn

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.620 

violent<00:00:49.480> rain<00:00:49.630> pretty<00:00:49.930> good

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.970 

and<00:00:55.630> over<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.110> way

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.790 

that<00:00:59.980> way<00:01:00.160> no<00:01:01.050> embers<00:01:02.050> burn<00:01:02.290> a<00:01:02.320> hole<00:01:02.530> in<00:01:02.560> my

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
that way no embers burn a hole in my

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.660 
that way no embers burn a hole in my
feet<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:07.560> burning<00:01:08.560> pretty<00:01:08.860> good<00:01:09.130> I<00:01:09.160> think<00:01:09.550> we

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
don't see how it could catch on fire but

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.060 
don't see how it could catch on fire but
that<00:01:33.960> wouldn't<00:01:34.960> be<00:01:35.050> good<00:01:35.080> if<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.530> did<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.950> over
