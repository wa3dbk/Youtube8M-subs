00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.590
 today we are going to make brownie fitness for 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:08.499
 this recipe we will need 4 more clear 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.089
 one yolk 30 grams of cornstarch 40 grams 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.459
 of fine oat bran or failing 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.070
 oatmeal 2 teaspoons of sugar 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.109
 brown 3 tablespoons of agave syrup 2 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.539
 teaspoons of pure cocoa powder 100 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.519
 grams of black chocolate over 70% 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.830
 a handful of chopped walnuts and 2 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.019
 teaspoons of coconut oil in a bowl 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.029
 we throw the coconut oil the sugar 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.029
 Brown and the egg plus the 3 egg whites 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:42.730
 and we beat it all with some rods or 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:44.410
 a spatula we add 3 tablespoons of 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.370
 agave syrup and we integrate them 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.370
 stirring 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.230
 now we add the cornstarch and the bran 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.700
 fine oatmeal and continue stirring 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.450
 until everything is completely 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.450
 integrated 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.780
 add the two teaspoons of cocoa 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.760
 pure and the molten chocolate and we continue 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.500
 removing remember that the 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.420
 characteristic of browning is that it 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.650
 It has leaven so that it does not rise if not 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.650
 it would be a normal sponge cake 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.049
 and finally we incorporate the nuts 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.049
 chopped 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.500
 We are mixing in a mold 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.229
 silicone and we put it to the micro to maximum 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.329
 power for 5 minutes in this case 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.659
 I used this steam case 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.659
 lékué 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.750
 I recommend that when you take it out of the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.430
 micro it pricked with a toothpick or 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.590
 knife to make sure it's 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.900
 well done if you dry out the brownie 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.150
 It will be perfect if it comes out with liquid 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.160
 put it back into the mic in batches of 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.170
 30 seconds until it becomes the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.890
 times will depend as always on each 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.200
 microwave oven 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.910
