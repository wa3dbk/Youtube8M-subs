00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.630
 wonderful new art at the next 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.570
 battlefield play4free comments weapons 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.730
 review preview kram and this time it works 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.099
 not around the 11 85 does not know but 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.079
 the mac version of the l 85 and the l 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.849
 86 creative the l 86 is actually a 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.699
 some exceptionally kind 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.220
 like an 11 85 stop for the magic me 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.630
 I could not test the weapon anymore 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.489
 Nevertheless, I have a nice one again 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.349
 impression of the weapon gained mainly there 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.119
 I had more time but what you have 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.260
 without technically quite a bit 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.940
 I had to say honestly 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.519
 anyway what you noticed so directly 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.500
 is that the l 86 is actually no 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.410
 shining visor has but one 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.120
 normal ironside and the look of the 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.469
 Weapon itself rather the classic l 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.329
 86 felt 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.699
 the oldest 80 is probably coming 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.800
 no later than next Wednesday pending 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.910
 by the way, as already noted 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.890
 I have no patch management 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.050
 Nevertheless, everyone is recommended here 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.440
 if the webex on which you come it is 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.480
 will 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.399
 as if i might be the heavy barry 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.469
 recommend or the physical barrel of 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.610
 is always in any case always as a doc 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.230
 you have to be very careful what you do 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.910
 I would definitely go for it 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.400
 recommend nemesis tag or the tactical 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.080
 The floor is not that good though 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.630
 not screwed down the harm 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.400
 the stable livestock would serve the purpose 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.620
 that the weapon is only 1 3 to the right 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.120
 has the nemesis and hearty there 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.760
 just reduce the recall upwards and 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.440
 which is very handy if you have one 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.110
 Weapon has ever got a side recall 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.580
 the nemesis stock still has the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.830
 advantage that it recoil the side 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.630
 bring a little bit into the middle 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.650
 and the ball deviation or and to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.810
 partially reduced 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.160
 but before I start again, of course 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.380
 skis on the wall and look what 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.980
 happened I really have the l 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.750
 85 and the l 86 I found it really funny 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.580
 because the two weapons are not 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.430
 be sure to do a lot if you for example 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.860
 Look what normal l medical mgs for 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.200
 to have a hit fire is namely the m86 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.650
 up front which is convenient me 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.520
 This part has a long ads 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.870
 problematic, however, because of the cadence 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.210
 because the relatively low at the weapon 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.800
 is the comparison of course adjusted 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.080
 not serious about it but anyway 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.770
 Similar to your weapons 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.940
 basically I would not use the weapon 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.009
 take on people where you 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.330
 dangerous melee areas is here 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.620
 one alone because of the small one 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.540
 accordingly ratio 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.340
 never get to a weapon, the one 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.170
 higher cadence has middle and far 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.549
 You can, however, quite well with distancing 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.810
 This weapon especially if you are 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.890
 then single cab used what you 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.930
 actually only can go well 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.120
 the problem here is that the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.980
 taffy noise on longer fire 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.360
 He has hours until a few shots 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.549
 no problem this point exactly 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.129
 but if you stop for more than two 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.840
 to four shots then three to four 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.030
 Shots fired pretty much 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.049
 bad with the technical can it 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.030
 of course be different 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.920
 Nevertheless, this weapon never becomes one 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.109
 Melee weapon no matter what you put on it 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.450
 makes the question of course is here 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.560
 they will put the l 86 a long 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.150
 his range wunderwaffe 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.150
 with the model for leisure and 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.099
 offenbach kempen the answer is if 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.780
 man if the weapon just nothing 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.459
 to do other things than to cover 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.940
 Cover always to distance to run 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.620
 stay 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.170
 with the hope that never with the fans 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.819
 Arrives as you are a pretty bad one 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.769
 cards would have you then you have to 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.430
 stay on distance simply because 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.750
 Otherwise you can not reach with the weapon 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.370
 that just will not be pdfs 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.840
 be schnitzel machine 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.489
 that's simply a seduction 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.810
 just have to stay on distance then 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.130
 you can not just record it 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.109
 to run and then easier everyone 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.220
 chip away 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.109
 this is probably not made 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.459
 The story is quite interesting 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.349
 which expands as full support 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.530
 the l85 has a shorter one 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.599
 hand guard and a longer run of the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.669
 for a higher ball of guilt and 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.500
 ensures a better accuracy and 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.030
 still a very specific thing and indeed 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.859
 the criticism of the technical defects 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.690
 the weapon because they are relatively 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.879
 is complicated and that one 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.930
 not blindly the weapon in like 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.660
 can unscrew 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.209
 no since the weapon simply solve it 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.390
 she was even missing from 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.150
 Heckler 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.920
 euro be converted to another right 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.240
 funny fact is that the visor what 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.709
 itself is used on the weapon so 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.510
 not what it is in the Play4Free 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.120
 Stepping is known to be lit. 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.740
 Of course, radioactive is there you have to 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.170
 but are the same vision 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.060
 tritium differentiate though binds that 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.800
 glass fiber sight the light so that 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.620
 at first without light does not work 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.180
 But it is also lighter in itself 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.590
 free 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.660
 tritium he is independent of the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.669
 So what does that mean in the sun? 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.410
 night wonderfully works however on 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.870
 day is rather weak why it again 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.550
 painted extra white is tritium 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.960
 also in ears and compass unused the 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.860
 amount is too small to really 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.200
 to be dangerous 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.340
 but we always have in the play-off ri 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.810
 only in la fosse sight 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.610
 otherwise there are a few lights 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.110
 would and I think that she too 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.880
 wanted to avoid that the soldiers 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.480
 radioactive contaminated to their families 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.050
 to return 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.730
 any unnecessary ones know by the way though 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.669
 it is unnecessary to know the word 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.320
 There is no glass fiber visor 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.060
 I invented that is easy 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.950
 the properties of the visor best 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.950
 describes it just works like 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.270
 eg a fiber optic cable and becomes the 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.100
 for example, bow sport also like 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.020
 used where it comes to the visor 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.540
 itself is wrapped around the yearly too 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.390
 bundle I come to the data, the l 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:11.669
 86 has close range image from 26 to 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:13.620
 24 on with rage 23 to 1920 to 18 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.780
 is worth a lot in itself 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.970
 I have to say what I'm pretty funny 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.760
 find is that you have 24 34 34 05 so 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.919
 altogether 170 feet as you have a high 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.210
 Number of cash has extra magazine 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.340
 It is definitely worth one 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.680
 certain type of max to take the not 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.590
 even more magazine itself offers but 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.900
 absolutely something like that again 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.700
 Extra more balls are for example the 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.640
 ace and there you have in any case not 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.620
 170 more but 290 shot in total 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.260
 this principle can be definitely 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.800
 Here also very good use the weapon 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.720
 costs 2 1999 found or 99,000 trends 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.610
 like the one before that a pretty good price 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.979
 in my opinion, the realtime amounts 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.440
 45 seconds even a little less 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.620
 as the 11 man I respect a good value 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.610
 For 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.590
 alinghis the astheim the time so long 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.169
 needs to target is 0.4 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.790
 seconds what is an average and yourself 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.540
 in my opinion , already in retail 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.940
 would be worthwhile 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.540
 the cadence is locked minute 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.669
 according to pellets phones 473 show minute the 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.190
 recall is bad thing of mine 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.919
 opinion after that very much after 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.250
 but on the right is the right text 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.960
 That would go pretty well anyway 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.020
 I said, I have unfortunately all true 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.300
 played without tennis 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.820
 zwtl 86 is different from most all 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.800
 gs is because of the low cadence 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.960
 However, only limited use would be 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.120
 as well as clearly comes with the l 85th 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.380
 definitely should come in any case 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.460
 I recommend the l 86, however 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.750
 In any case, the weapons first 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.180
 Test it because I have it already 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.250
 heard that people recover the atw 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.449
 and then somehow not anymore 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.330
 have played because then rather 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.070
 too much of a scale resembled me though 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.770
 It must be said here that it is an IMG 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:06.280
 not yet existed and that is one 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.740
 Just do a lot of weaponry 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.050
 Potential in certain areas has where 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.849
 stop other weapons were not yet 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.039
 medic weapons 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:16.930
 Of course it does not know how 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.360
 that's when now a rookie this 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.250
 Playful is perhaps too special 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.560
 or maybe you're training yourself there 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.389
 right in such a way the rain man with 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.050
 I am very well aware of such weapons 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:28.090
 Do not know 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.650
 it is certainly a weapon very much 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.360
 can be strong if you are neat 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.190
 has experience with it and the right one 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.260
 I recommended the patch menz to it 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.419
 every time you look at the weapon 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.560
 thanks to facebook blablabla thank you 

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:40.979

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.979
 again with it
