this<00:06:07.270> for<00:06:07.690> five<00:06:07.900> dollars<00:06:08.080> I<00:06:08.560> think<00:06:09.099> that<00:06:09.279> these

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
this for five dollars I think that these

what<00:06:11.560> I<00:06:11.589> can<00:06:11.830> say<00:06:12.069> is<00:06:12.250> because<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:12.729> formula<00:06:13.120> is

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
what I can say is because the formula is

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.540 
what I can say is because the formula is
super<00:06:13.539> super<00:06:13.659> creamy<00:06:14.080> and<00:06:14.199> not<00:06:14.379> as<00:06:14.560> dry<00:06:14.830> it<00:06:15.099> may

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
super super creamy and not as dry it may

not<00:06:15.759> last<00:06:16.029> as<00:06:16.240> long<00:06:16.419> as<00:06:16.479> some<00:06:16.960> other<00:06:17.169> matte
