sextuplet there i'm switching over to
the<00:01:03.809> B<00:01:04.019> string<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.350> I'm

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the B string so I'm going and I'm

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.840 
the B string so I'm going and I'm
hammering<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.280> ring<00:01:08.460> finger<00:01:08.670> and

hammering it with the ring finger and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.040 
hammering it with the ring finger and
then<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.940> just<00:01:12.090> keep<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.510> down<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> strings

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
then I just keep going down the strings

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.140 
then I just keep going down the strings
in<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.380> same<00:01:13.680> pattern

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150
