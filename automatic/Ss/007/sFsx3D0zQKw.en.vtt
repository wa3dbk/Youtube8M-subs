00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
then this is the main road over this way

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.660

and our property kind of goes along what
we<00:00:38.700> call<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.270> tuning<00:00:39.780> fork<00:00:39.809> tree<00:00:40.410> which<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
we call the tuning fork tree which is

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.540 
we call the tuning fork tree which is
that<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.489> right<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.820> goes<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.930> there<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
that one right there goes out there and

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.209 
that one right there goes out there and
then<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.989> can't<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.320> see<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.649> easement

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
then you can't really see the easement

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
then you can't really see the easement
road<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.510> kind<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.899> over<00:00:49.110> by<00:00:49.260> those

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
road but it's kind of over by those

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.580 
road but it's kind of over by those
trees<00:00:49.590> back<00:00:50.520> there<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.170> then<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> goes<00:00:52.440> all

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
trees back there and then it goes all

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.560 
trees back there and then it goes all
the<00:00:52.620> way<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.280> about<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.850> acre<00:00:54.090> wide

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
by about four and a half long if that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380 
by about four and a half long if that
kind<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.350> gives<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.649> better<00:00:58.879> guess<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.239> how

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
kind of gives you better guess as to how

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.840 
kind of gives you better guess as to how

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
large stumps that we can kind of utilize

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.060 
large stumps that we can kind of utilize
and<00:01:36.180> build<00:01:36.600> off<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.780> that's<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.470> well<00:01:37.799> pump

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and build off of that's the well pump

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.910 
and build off of that's the well pump
house<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.520> there<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> be

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.380 
there it doesn't look like very far
maybe<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.810> video<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:07.499> pretty<00:02:07.979> far

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.650 

if<00:02:15.390> some<00:02:15.599> daffodils<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.620> little<00:02:17.660> seasonal

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
creek so you'll see the creek pretty

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.780 
creek so you'll see the creek pretty
good<00:02:28.260> from<00:02:28.440> here<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:34.379> flows<00:02:34.739> pretty<00:02:35.129> good<00:02:35.400> too

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
the back that you brought the goats in

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.090 
the back that you brought the goats in
from<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.080> didn't<00:04:26.350> have<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:26.560> have<00:04:26.770> like<00:04:27.040> a

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
from so you didn't have to have like a

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.690 
from so you didn't have to have like a
gate<00:04:27.990> or<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.740> know<00:04:29.860> try<00:04:30.040> and<00:04:30.190> bring<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.490> goats

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
gate or you know try and bring the goats

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.020 
gate or you know try and bring the goats
in<00:04:30.940> from<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.419> gate<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:31.870> then<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:33.760> know<00:04:33.880> from

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
in from a gate and then you know from

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.840 
in from a gate and then you know from
the<00:04:34.090> pen<00:04:34.390> and<00:04:34.419> into<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.900> milking<00:04:35.200> shed<00:04:35.820> so<00:04:36.820> I

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
the pen and into the milking shed so I

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.580 
the pen and into the milking shed so I
think<00:04:37.030> that's<00:04:37.180> what<00:04:37.270> we're<00:04:37.419> going<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.600> do<00:04:37.750> so

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
think that's what we're going to do so

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.040 
think that's what we're going to do so
we<00:04:38.680> have<00:04:38.770> this<00:04:38.890> kind<00:04:39.130> of<00:04:40.860> I'd<00:04:41.860> say<00:04:42.250> it's<00:04:42.520> lon

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
we have this kind of I'd say it's lon

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.100 
we have this kind of I'd say it's lon
rural<00:04:44.050> lawn<00:04:44.350> area<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:45.340> then<00:04:46.060> out<00:04:46.300> back<00:04:46.810> here

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
rural lawn area and then out back here

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.610 
rural lawn area and then out back here
behind<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.590> shed<00:04:47.860> as<00:04:48.460> well<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:50.230> this<00:04:50.320> is<00:04:50.470> where

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
behind the shed as well so this is where

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.880
