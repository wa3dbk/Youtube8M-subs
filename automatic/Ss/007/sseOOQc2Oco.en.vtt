to be going on pretty smooth let's see

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:34.199 
to be going on pretty smooth let's see
how<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.810> drives<00:02:26.930> all<00:02:28.690> right<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:31.090> poop

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.600 

Durrett<00:02:34.870> X<00:02:35.079> I<00:02:35.379> rolled<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.829> onto<00:02:36.129> the<00:02:36.220> top<00:02:36.430> it

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
Durrett X I rolled it onto the top it

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.640 
Durrett X I rolled it onto the top it
was<00:02:36.670> actually<00:02:36.970> really<00:02:37.180> easy<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.569> roll<00:02:37.689> on

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
was actually really easy to roll on

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.339 
was actually really easy to roll on
I'm<00:02:40.519> going<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.730> let<00:02:40.849> this<00:02:40.970> dry

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.559 

and<00:02:43.500> flip<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:43.920> over<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.870> do<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.200> bottom<00:02:47.099> part

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
and flip it over and do the bottom part

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.000 
and flip it over and do the bottom part
but<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.719> was<00:02:48.810> very<00:02:48.989> easy<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.530> didn't<00:02:49.829> have<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
but it was very easy you didn't have to

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.569 
but it was very easy you didn't have to
really<00:02:50.219> mix<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.500> closed<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.650> top<00:02:52.829> back<00:02:53.099> up<00:02:53.340> I

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
really mix it I closed the top back up I

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.459 
really mix it I closed the top back up I
got<00:02:54.030> my<00:02:54.150> roller<00:02:54.329> in<00:02:54.510> plastic<00:02:54.930> bag<00:02:55.109> so<00:02:55.349> it

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:55.469 
got my roller in plastic bag so it

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.709 
got my roller in plastic bag so it
doesn't<00:02:55.709> dry<00:02:55.859> up<00:02:55.939> so<00:02:56.939> I'm<00:02:57.000> gonna<00:02:57.150> wait<00:02:57.359> about<00:02:57.540> a

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
doesn't dry up so I'm gonna wait about a

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.000 
doesn't dry up so I'm gonna wait about a
couple<00:02:58.469> of<00:02:58.530> hours<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:01.200> then<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.500> third<00:03:01.680> drive

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
couple of hours and then a third drive

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.229 
couple of hours and then a third drive

go<00:03:32.130> crazy<00:03:32.310> as<00:03:32.700> far<00:03:32.940> so

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.040 

as<00:03:42.190> far<00:03:42.460> as<00:03:42.490> prepping<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.260> putting<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:44.380> up

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.690 
like paint it actually smells less than
paint<00:03:57.930> okay<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.020> doesn't<00:03:59.290> really<00:03:59.380> smell<00:03:59.700> which

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
paint okay it doesn't really smell which

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.230 
paint okay it doesn't really smell which
