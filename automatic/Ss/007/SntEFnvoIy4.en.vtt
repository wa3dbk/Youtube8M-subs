weapon is 34 while the minimum damage is
12<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.590> damage<00:04:20.919> drop-off<00:04:21.459> starts<00:04:21.910> at<00:04:22.000> normal

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
12 the damage drop-off starts at normal

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.020 
12 the damage drop-off starts at normal
8<00:04:22.690> meters<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:23.530> it's<00:04:23.830> interval<00:04:24.280> is<00:04:24.460> long<00:04:24.669> 12
