you're<00:01:52.250> filling<00:01:52.579> them<00:01:52.700> up<00:01:52.849> because<00:01:53.119> the

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
you're filling them up because the

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.059 
you're filling them up because the
temptation<00:01:53.959> to<00:01:53.989> load<00:01:54.259> it<00:01:54.409> fill<00:01:54.649> up<00:01:54.770> all<00:01:54.890> the

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
temptation to load it fill up all the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.550 
temptation to load it fill up all the
goodies<00:01:55.280> on<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.759> inside<00:01:56.119> is<00:01:56.689> really<00:01:56.750> high<00:01:57.319> but

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
goodies on the inside is really high but

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.380 
goodies on the inside is really high but
then<00:01:58.039> what<00:01:58.159> happens<00:01:58.549> is<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:58.700> can't<00:01:59.030> roll<00:01:59.270> it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.020 
then what happens is you can't roll it
over<00:01:59.479> all<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.929> way<00:02:00.250> because<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.579> is<00:02:01.610> smaller

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030
