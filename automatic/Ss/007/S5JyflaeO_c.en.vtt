00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.680 
here so everything before 400 meter okay
will<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> total<00:02:43.650> dork<00:02:43.950> okay<00:02:44.670> anything<00:02:45.030> in

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
will be a total dork okay anything in

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.710 
will be a total dork okay anything in
between<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:47.040> focus<00:02:47.459> plane<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> this

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
between the focus plane and this

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.170 
between the focus plane and this
distance<00:02:48.989> we<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> gradient<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.790> case<00:02:51.030> it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
distance we have a gradient in case it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.620 
distance we have a gradient in case it
is<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.390> perfect<00:02:51.600> for<00:02:52.340> def<00:02:53.340> fell<00:02:53.550> ok<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.300> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
is the perfect for def fell ok so the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.930 
is the perfect for def fell ok so the
same<00:02:54.840> settings<00:02:55.200> can<00:02:55.410> be<00:02:55.440> required<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.950> be

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
same settings can be required to be

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.570 
same settings can be required to be
weird<00:02:57.450> ok<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.200> fierce<00:02:58.560> career<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.430> also

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
weird ok so fierce career and can also

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.900 
weird ok so fierce career and can also
see<00:02:59.700> details<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.270> little<00:03:00.300> bit<00:03:00.890> ok<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.489> if<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.760> do

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
see details a little bit ok so if you do

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.229 
see details a little bit ok so if you do
not<00:03:03.030> want<00:03:03.239> if<00:03:03.570> drawer<00:03:03.900> start<00:03:04.350> immediately

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
not want if drawer start immediately

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.990 
not want if drawer start immediately
iran's<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.480> focus<00:03:06.840> point<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.260> can<00:03:07.500> set<00:03:08.310> start

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
iran's to focus point you can set start

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.650 
iran's to focus point you can set start
muted<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.810> can't<00:03:10.050> just<00:03:10.200> send<00:03:10.590> something<00:03:11.660> the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
muted you can't just send something the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.120 
muted you can't just send something the
meter<00:03:13.080> ok<00:03:14.040> Samir<00:03:15.709> against<00:03:16.709> we<00:03:16.860> have<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
meter ok Samir against we have the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.910 
meter ok Samir against we have the
distant<00:03:17.549> attach<00:03:18.330> this<00:03:18.540> makes<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.440> focus

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
distant attach this makes the focus

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.630 
distant attach this makes the focus
areas<00:03:21.049> which<00:03:22.049> panaji<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.769> have<00:03:23.489> the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
areas which panaji so you have the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.930 
areas which panaji so you have the
options<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.209> two<00:03:24.570> settings<00:03:24.989> here<00:03:25.610> so<00:03:26.610> that's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
options for two settings here so that's

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.150 
options for two settings here so that's
Porter<00:03:27.330> camera<00:03:27.660> setting<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.170> then<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.980> can

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
Porter camera setting and then you can

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.509 
Porter camera setting and then you can
go<00:03:29.280> back<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.519> your<00:03:29.790> crossbody<00:03:30.780> will<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.519> if

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
go back to your crossbody will and if

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.180 
go back to your crossbody will and if
you<00:03:32.580> want<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.970> do<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.180> task<00:03:33.630> rendered<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:35.040> need

you want to do a task rendered we need

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.630 
you want to do a task rendered we need
to<00:03:35.340> enable<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.209> depth<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:37.320> files<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.489> go

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
to enable the depth of the files so go

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.370 
to enable the depth of the files so go
to<00:03:38.700> our<00:03:38.850> understanding<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.980> go<00:03:40.980> back<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.519> the
