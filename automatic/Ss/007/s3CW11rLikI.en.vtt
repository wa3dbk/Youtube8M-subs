I'd bring you the part two of the second
part<00:00:08.220> whatever<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.630> effect<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.710> cinema

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
part whatever of the effect is in cinema

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.039 
part whatever of the effect is in cinema
4d<00:00:11.040> now<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.790> did<00:00:12.300> say<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.690> was<00:00:12.809> going<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.990> do

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
4d now I did say that I was going to do

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.099 
4d now I did say that I was going to do
these<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.380> order<00:00:13.469> but<00:00:14.429> I've<00:00:15.330> decided<00:00:15.630> against

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
these in order but I've decided against

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.170 
these in order but I've decided against
that<00:00:16.139> because<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:17.220> first<00:00:17.460> few<00:00:17.820> are<00:00:17.970> pretty

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
that because as the first few are pretty

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.910 
that because as the first few are pretty
like<00:00:18.480> simple<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:18.990> stuff<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.590> I'm<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:19.800> going

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
like simple and stuff so I'm just going

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.200 
like simple and stuff so I'm just going
to<00:00:19.980> go<00:00:20.039> through<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.369> ones<00:00:20.609> i<00:00:20.789> think<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.060> nice

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
to go through the ones i think a nice

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.210 
to go through the ones i think a nice
and<00:00:21.630> dumb<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.050> will<00:00:22.619> kind<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.070> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
and dumb and will kind of get you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.540 
and dumb and will kind of get you
somewhere<00:00:23.519> i<00:00:23.580> guess<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> yeah<00:00:26.010> that's<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.490> guess

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
somewhere i guess so yeah that's I guess

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.250 
somewhere i guess so yeah that's I guess
that's<00:00:26.910> my<00:00:27.090> strategy<00:00:27.390> from<00:00:27.689> now<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:28.050> I'm<00:00:28.230> not

going to do the same with the demons I'm

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.380 
going to do the same with the demons I'm
going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> do<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> same<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.710> order<00:00:32.130> um<00:00:32.390> so

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
going to do that the same in order um so

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.229 
going to do that the same in order um so
yeah<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.430> well<00:00:36.050> today<00:00:37.050> I'm<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.980> killed<00:00:38.250> I'm

yeah so well today I'm not killed I'm
gonna<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.850> explosion<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.540> I'm<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.410> got

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
gonna do the explosion so I'm just got

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.330 
gonna do the explosion so I'm just got
mail<00:00:43.829> anyway<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> i'll<00:00:46.350> start<00:00:46.500> by<00:00:46.739> adding<00:00:47.160> an

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
mail anyway so i'll start by adding an

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.160 
mail anyway so i'll start by adding an
object<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.030> i<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> explosion<00:00:48.840> effects

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
object and i have the explosion effects

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.040 
object and i have the explosion effects
but<00:00:49.559> i'll<00:00:49.649> drag<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> explosion<00:00:50.550> FX<00:00:51.000> onto<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
but i'll drag the explosion FX onto the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.340 
but i'll drag the explosion FX onto the
cube<00:00:52.260> now<00:00:53.039> I'll<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.430> drag<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> cool<00:00:54.510> more

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
cube now I'll just drag the cool more

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.250 
cube now I'll just drag the cool more
Jesus<00:00:56.090> I'll<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.300> change<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:59.899> like<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:01.079> this

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
Jesus I'll just change the like I'm this

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.950 
Jesus I'll just change the like I'm this
big<00:01:01.469> these<00:01:01.680> are<00:01:01.920> these<00:01:02.160> these<00:01:02.460> kind<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.960> line

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
big these are these these kind of line

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.800 
big these are these these kind of line
those<00:01:04.500> those<00:01:04.830> border<00:01:05.430> things<00:01:05.670> there<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.090> really

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
those those border things there I really

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.230 
those those border things there I really
like<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.650> been<00:01:07.799> annoying<00:01:08.240> so

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
like them there have been annoying so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.910 
like them there have been annoying so
i'll<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.600> send<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.290> drag<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
i'll just send to that and drag it up a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.160 
i'll just send to that and drag it up a
bit<00:01:11.330> now<00:01:12.330> basically<00:01:13.049> what<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.770> does<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:15.170> it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
bit now basically what this does it it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.920 
bit now basically what this does it it
it<00:01:16.560> makes<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.939> sofa<00:01:18.450> turn<00:01:18.600> strength

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
it makes all of the sofa turn strength

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
it makes all of the sofa turn strength
up<00:01:19.140> also<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> time<00:01:20.570> by<00:01:21.570> ok<00:01:21.900> ok<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.920> 40

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
up also at the time by ok ok so it's 40

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.670 
up also at the time by ok ok so it's 40
anyway<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.670> you'll<00:01:27.090> see<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.680> basically

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
anyway so you'll see here that basically

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.460 
anyway so you'll see here that basically
it's<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.159> getting<00:01:29.549> um<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.540> gravity<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
it's just getting um like gravity on it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's just getting um like gravity on it
I<00:01:31.560> guess<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.400> being<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.350> cooler<00:01:34.350> stuff

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
I guess I'm being do a lot cooler stuff

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.800 
I guess I'm being do a lot cooler stuff
with<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.939> i'll<00:01:36.270> actually<00:01:36.600> drag<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:38.810> then

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
with it so i'll actually drag it up then

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.370 
with it so i'll actually drag it up then
i'll<00:01:39.900> drag<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.950> cube<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.380> you'll

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
i'll drag the the cube down and you'll

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
i'll drag the the cube down and you'll
see<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.649> happens<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> cube

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
see what happens now so with the cube

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.069 
see what happens now so with the cube
you<00:01:45.479> want<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> put<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> segments<00:01:46.409> maybe<00:01:47.159> 5050

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
you want to put the segments maybe 5050

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.499 
you want to put the segments maybe 5050
actually<00:01:49.079> actually<00:01:49.350> okay<00:01:50.310> 50s<00:01:51.030> could<00:01:51.180> leave

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
actually actually okay 50s could leave

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.770 
actually actually okay 50s could leave
on<00:01:51.659> 50<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:52.920> any<00:01:53.220> explosion<00:01:53.729> affects<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
on 50 so then any explosion affects the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.469 
on 50 so then any explosion affects the
time<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.350> basically<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> strength<00:01:56.479> except

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
time is basically the strength except

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.020 
time is basically the strength except
that<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.380> where<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.860> green<00:01:59.280> bar<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.640> so

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
that it's just where the green bar is so

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.280 
that it's just where the green bar is so
you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.390> little<00:02:00.540> dot<00:02:00.810> here<00:02:01.020> moving

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
you can see this little dot here moving

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.609 
you can see this little dot here moving
so<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.219> i<00:02:02.280> drag<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.729> out<00:02:02.969> BAM<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:04.409> that

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
so if i drag this out BAM see that

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.210 
so if i drag this out BAM see that
that's<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.729> that's<00:02:06.390> some<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:08.039> nice

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
that's a that's some it's very nice

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.850 
that's a that's some it's very nice
isn't<00:02:08.520> yeah<00:02:09.179> i<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.319> too<00:02:10.349> ah<00:02:11.030> what

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
isn't yeah i think so too ah what

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.320 
isn't yeah i think so too ah what
so<00:02:12.950> you'll<00:02:13.580> see<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.850> all<00:02:13.970> these<00:02:14.060> little

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
so you'll see that all these little

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.070 
so you'll see that all these little
pieces<00:02:14.510> come<00:02:14.810> up<00:02:14.960> I<00:02:15.050> might<00:02:15.910> change<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.600> 20

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
pieces come up I might change this to 20

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.930 
pieces come up I might change this to 20
then<00:02:19.090> if<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.300> put<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.540> time<00:02:20.840> up<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:22.640> doesn't

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
then if we put the time up it doesn't

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.450 
then if we put the time up it doesn't
look<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.240> much<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.510> its<00:02:24.170> circles<00:02:24.770> protruding

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
look so much like its circles protruding

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.570 
look so much like its circles protruding
it<00:02:25.640> more<00:02:26.270> just<00:02:26.480> looks<00:02:26.690> like<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:27.020> breaking<00:02:27.200> up

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
it more just looks like it's breaking up

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.800 
it more just looks like it's breaking up
you<00:02:28.580> can<00:02:28.730> also<00:02:28.910> change<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.690> effects<00:02:30.560> sighs<00:02:31.810> so

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
you can also change the effects sighs so

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.690 
you can also change the effects sighs so
if<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:32.960> just<00:02:33.050> drag<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.350> out<00:02:33.530> words<00:02:33.860> then<00:02:34.580> it

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
if you just drag that out words then it

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.180 
if you just drag that out words then it
looks<00:02:34.850> like<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.090> whole<00:02:35.300> world's<00:02:35.780> now<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.830> look

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
looks like the whole world's now to look

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.180 
looks like the whole world's now to look
like<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.460> whole<00:02:37.640> cube<00:02:38.060> kind<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.920> explodes<00:02:39.920> or

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
like the whole cube kind of explodes or

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.949 
like the whole cube kind of explodes or
whatever<00:02:40.820> just<00:02:41.060> kind<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.510> gives<00:02:41.660> them<00:02:41.780> more

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
whatever just kind of gives them more

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.520 
whatever just kind of gives them more
generic<00:02:42.470> effect<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.100> you'll<00:02:43.790> see<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.500> it

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
generic effect and you'll see that so it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.880 
generic effect and you'll see that so it
is<00:02:45.680> having<00:02:45.980> dynamics<00:02:47.380> but<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.590> can<00:02:48.709> see<00:02:48.860> that

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
is having dynamics but you can see that

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.100 
is having dynamics but you can see that
it<00:02:49.100> kind<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.490> looks<00:02:49.640> like<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.110> transformers

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
it kind of looks like a a transformers

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.150 
it kind of looks like a a transformers
cube<00:02:51.500> or<00:02:51.590> something<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.730> looks<00:02:52.910> really

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
cube or something and it looks really

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.760 
cube or something and it looks really
this<00:02:55.160> looks<00:02:55.370> really<00:02:55.580> nice<00:02:56.050> wrecker<00:02:57.050> well

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
this looks really nice wrecker well

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.150 
this looks really nice wrecker well
that's<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.370> weird<00:02:58.550> way<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.700> put<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:58.970> on<00:02:59.180> but<00:03:00.160> yet

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
that's a weird way to put it on but yet

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.550 
that's a weird way to put it on but yet
um<00:03:01.570> just<00:03:02.570> gives<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:03.050> nice<00:03:03.230> kind<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:04.010> cyber

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
um just gives a nice kind of the cyber

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.510 
um just gives a nice kind of the cyber
all<00:03:06.560> right<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.980> looks<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.250> lot<00:03:07.370> like

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
all right it looks a lot like

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.280 
all right it looks a lot like
transformers<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.360> guess<00:03:08.720> that's<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:08.989> best<00:03:09.050> way

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
transformers I guess that's the best way

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.500 
transformers I guess that's the best way
to<00:03:09.350> put<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.190> you<00:03:10.880> can<00:03:11.000> prob<00:03:11.120> do<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.300> lot<00:03:11.480> of

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
to put it so you can prob do a lot of

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.080 
to put it so you can prob do a lot of
this<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.890> could<00:03:13.070> this<00:03:13.640> has<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:13.880> lot<00:03:14.030> of

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
this you could this has a lot of

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.449 
this you could this has a lot of
potential<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.590> could<00:03:15.739> transform<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.340> into

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
potential you could transform it into

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.509 
potential you could transform it into
staff<00:03:16.989> there's<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.110> bunch<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.620> yeah<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:19.430> the

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
staff there's a bunch of yeah so the

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:26.259 
staff there's a bunch of yeah so the
gravity<00:03:19.910> if<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:20.450> change<00:03:24.010> okay<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:25.280> just

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
gravity if you change okay so just

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.380 
gravity if you change okay so just
change<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.600> just<00:03:26.930> have<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:27.049> look<00:03:27.170> at<00:03:27.380> my

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
change that just have a look at my

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.460 
change that just have a look at my
screen<00:03:29.390> on<00:03:29.600> I'm<00:03:29.780> not<00:03:29.870> going<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.080> say<00:03:30.200> because<00:03:30.320> I

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
screen on I'm not going to say because I

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.370 
screen on I'm not going to say because I
really<00:03:30.830> don't<00:03:31.070> know<00:03:31.130> what<00:03:31.400> does<00:03:31.610> but<00:03:32.390> anyway

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
really don't know what does but anyway

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.310 
really don't know what does but anyway
so<00:03:33.709> you'll<00:03:33.860> see<00:03:34.040> here<00:03:34.150> as<00:03:35.150> more<00:03:35.660> little<00:03:35.930> cubes

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
so you'll see here as more little cubes

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.259 
so you'll see here as more little cubes
and<00:03:37.120> stuff<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.320> looks<00:03:39.470> really<00:03:40.269> futuristic

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
and stuff and it looks really futuristic

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.930 
and stuff and it looks really futuristic
I<00:03:41.959> guess<00:03:42.230> or<00:03:42.470> something<00:03:43.340> like<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.489> and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
I guess or something like that and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.310 
I guess or something like that and
there's<00:03:44.420> a<00:03:44.480> bunch<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.720> different<00:03:44.959> settings

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
there's a bunch of different settings

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:53.350 
there's a bunch of different settings
for<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:48.400> or<00:03:49.400> that<00:03:49.730> looks<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:51.350> looks<00:03:51.470> nice<00:03:52.360> but

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
for this or that looks it looks nice but

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.280 
for this or that looks it looks nice but
yet<00:03:53.540> no<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.989> don't<00:03:54.680> really<00:03:55.690> know<00:03:56.690> what<00:03:56.959> many<00:03:57.200> of

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
yet no I don't really know what many of

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.210 
yet no I don't really know what many of
them<00:03:57.560> do<00:03:58.120> I've<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.780> that's<00:03:59.989> I<00:04:00.230> guess<00:04:00.290> that's

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
them do I've that that's I guess that's

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.740 
them do I've that that's I guess that's
the<00:04:01.280> basics<00:04:01.850> of<00:04:02.000> it<00:04:02.410> um<00:04:03.580> like<00:04:04.580> what<00:04:04.850> just<00:04:05.090> shows

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
the basics of it um like what just shows

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.150 
the basics of it um like what just shows
you<00:04:05.870> how<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.049> do<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.320> um<00:04:06.730> but<00:04:08.650> yes<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:09.860> mean<00:04:09.890> I

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
you how to do it um but yes I mean I

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.860 
you how to do it um but yes I mean I
hope<00:04:10.250> you<00:04:10.370> guys<00:04:10.489> enjoy<00:04:10.850> that<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.570> was<00:04:11.690> pretty

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
hope you guys enjoy that that was pretty

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.390 
hope you guys enjoy that that was pretty
quick<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:13.269> it<00:04:14.269> was<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.720> pretty<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.680> mean<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.310> guess

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
quick and it was a pretty I mean I guess

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.099 
quick and it was a pretty I mean I guess
it's<00:04:16.669> pretty<00:04:16.850> self-explanatory<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:17.840> all<00:04:18.049> of

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
it's pretty self-explanatory so all of

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.039 
it's pretty self-explanatory so all of
these<00:04:18.590> affect<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.190> gotta<00:04:19.910> keep<00:04:20.060> doing<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.419> all

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
these affect I gotta keep doing it all

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.980 
these affect I gotta keep doing it all
of<00:04:21.260> these<00:04:21.410> effectors<00:04:21.919> are<00:04:22.690> basically<00:04:23.690> just

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
of these effectors are basically just

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.730 
of these effectors are basically just
put<00:04:24.110> as<00:04:24.229> a<00:04:24.349> child<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:25.010> mesh

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
put as a child the mesh

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.850 
put as a child the mesh
it<00:04:26.250> was<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> bit<00:04:26.580> different<00:04:27.120> same<00:04:27.300> with<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.509> FFD

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
it was a bit different same with the FFD

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.100 
it was a bit different same with the FFD
I'll<00:04:28.860> do<00:04:29.039> separate<00:04:29.400> ones<00:04:29.550> on<00:04:29.699> them<00:04:30.110> but

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
I'll do separate ones on them but

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.379 
I'll do separate ones on them but
basically<00:04:31.500> everything<00:04:32.099> is<00:04:32.340> just<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.639> child<00:04:32.940> so

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
basically everything is just a child so

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.820 
basically everything is just a child so
the<00:04:33.539> camera<00:04:33.810> as<00:04:33.900> well<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.349> the<00:04:34.440> polygon

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
the camera as well and the polygon

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.580 
the camera as well and the polygon
reduction<00:04:35.990> don't<00:04:36.990> think<00:04:37.110> of<00:04:37.199> a<00:04:37.289> few<00:04:37.440> other

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
reduction don't think of a few other

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.999 
reduction don't think of a few other
ones<00:04:38.900> yeah<00:04:39.900> there's<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.470> few<00:04:40.590> other<00:04:40.650> ones<00:04:40.949> but

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
ones yeah there's a few other ones but

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.040 
ones yeah there's a few other ones but
it's<00:04:41.639> pretty<00:04:41.759> easy<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.120> use<00:04:42.389> you<00:04:42.599> can<00:04:42.780> just<00:04:42.930> do

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
it's pretty easy to use you can just do

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.320 
it's pretty easy to use you can just do
it<00:04:43.080> yourself<00:04:43.610> if<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:44.699> want<00:04:44.759> in<00:04:44.940> this<00:04:45.030> video

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
it yourself if you want in this video

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.370 
it yourself if you want in this video
it's<00:04:45.479> probably<00:04:45.720> just<00:04:45.870> because<00:04:45.930> you<00:04:46.229> were

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
it's probably just because you were

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.499 
it's probably just because you were

little that little gold cross here where

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.749 
little that little gold cross here where
my<00:06:00.360> mouse<00:06:00.509> is<00:06:00.690> if<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:01.860> select<00:06:02.400> an<00:06:02.550> object

that's<00:06:03.330> kind<00:06:03.930> of<00:06:03.960> the<00:06:04.050> pivot<00:06:04.380> point<00:06:04.650> if<00:06:05.130> i

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
that's kind of the pivot point if i

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.999 
that's kind of the pivot point if i
select<00:06:05.460> over<00:06:05.969> here<00:06:06.270> oh<00:06:06.479> no<00:06:07.409> that<00:06:07.710> does<00:06:07.860> not
