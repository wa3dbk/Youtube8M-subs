00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.670 
there are several ways to play a bass
bass<00:00:48.580> but<00:00:49.240> for<00:00:49.390> this<00:00:49.480> exercise<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:50.230> really<00:00:50.500> like

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
bass but for this exercise I really like

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.400 
bass but for this exercise I really like
to<00:00:50.830> keep<00:00:50.950> it<00:00:51.130> simple<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:51.930> focus<00:00:52.930> more<00:00:53.110> on<00:00:53.170> the

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
to keep it simple and focus more on the

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.400 
to keep it simple and focus more on the
melody<00:00:53.620> but<00:00:54.190> while<00:00:54.640> playing<00:00:54.910> a<00:00:55.120> bass<00:00:55.330> the<00:00:56.260> bass

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
melody but while playing a bass the bass

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:04.799 
melody but while playing a bass the bass
goes<00:00:56.770> like<00:00:56.980> this<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:03.309> just<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.730> loose<00:01:04.540> a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
goes like this it's just a loose a

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.880 
goes like this it's just a loose a
string<00:01:05.520> it's<00:01:06.520> pretty<00:01:06.820> easy<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.330> course<00:01:07.570> but

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
string it's pretty easy of course but

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.560 
string it's pretty easy of course but
when<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:09.010> play<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.280> melody<00:01:09.550> with<00:01:09.940> it<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.210> can<00:01:10.450> be

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
when you play a melody with it it can be

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.850 
when you play a melody with it it can be
a<00:01:10.600> bit<00:01:10.869> harder

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.220 

so<00:01:14.700> now<00:01:14.880> let's<00:01:15.120> play<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.450> bass<00:01:15.600> mode<00:01:15.900> again

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
so now let's play the bass mode again

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.740 
so now let's play the bass mode again
and<00:01:16.410> try<00:01:16.800> to<00:01:16.860> play<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.550> notes<00:01:17.760> of<00:01:18.120> the

and try to play all the notes of the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.650 
and try to play all the notes of the
skill<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.290> are<00:01:19.770> underneath<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:21.060> string

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
skill that are underneath the a string

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.490 
skill that are underneath the a string
and<00:01:22.080> try<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> play<00:01:23.280> them<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> same<00:01:23.910> beat<00:01:24.150> as

so now try to play two notes of the

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.490 
so now try to play two notes of the
skill<00:01:48.740> on<00:01:48.979> each<00:01:49.759> beat<00:01:49.970> of<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.420> bass<00:01:50.600> notes<00:01:50.930> so

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
skill on each beat of the bass notes so

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:08.029 
skill on each beat of the bass notes so
it<00:01:51.590> goes<00:01:51.770> like<00:01:51.860> this

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.500 

you

so now try to add all the special

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.190 
so now try to add all the special
techniques<00:02:14.549> here<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.879> know<00:02:15.090> into<00:02:15.780> your<00:02:15.930> plane

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
techniques here you know into your plane

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.470 
techniques here you know into your plane
it<00:02:17.129> would<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.489> wise<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.730> play<00:02:18.269> with<00:02:18.450> a

it would be wise to play with a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.860 
it would be wise to play with a
metronome<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.319> start<00:02:19.859> really<00:02:20.189> slow<00:02:20.659> it<00:02:21.659> also

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
metronome and start really slow it also

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.860 
metronome and start really slow it also
would<00:02:22.139> be<00:02:22.170> wise<00:02:22.760> if<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.120> take<00:02:24.480> all<00:02:24.719> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
would be wise if you take all the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.410 
would be wise if you take all the
special<00:02:25.379> techniques<00:02:25.739> step<00:02:26.310> by<00:02:26.459> step<00:02:26.760> for

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
special techniques step by step for

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.849 
special techniques step by step for
instance<00:02:27.750> when<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.900> practice<00:02:30.049> slides<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.590> can

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
instance when you practice slides it can

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:47.790 
instance when you practice slides it can
go<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.219> this<00:02:37.909> so<00:02:38.909> keep<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.269> base<00:02:39.419> going

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.240 

you<00:02:48.800> can<00:02:48.980> practice<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.430> hammer-on<00:02:49.730> after<00:02:50.209> death

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.240 

you

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.950 

another<00:02:58.250> thing<00:02:58.460> to<00:02:58.610> do<00:02:58.730> is<00:02:58.970> playing<00:02:59.510> different

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
another thing to do is playing different

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.980 
another thing to do is playing different
bass<00:03:00.170> notes<00:03:00.700> when<00:03:01.700> you're<00:03:01.850> playing<00:03:02.030> an<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.420> you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
can also play the D like this already

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.990 
can also play the D like this already
like<00:03:10.310> this<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:16.010> once<00:03:16.220> again<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.640> can<00:03:16.670> play

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
all the notes of the skill that are

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.850 
all the notes of the skill that are
underneath<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.970> string<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.630> play<00:03:20.870> for

instance when you play the E string you

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.860 
instance when you play the E string you
also<00:03:24.590> can<00:03:24.770> play<00:03:24.860> these<00:03:25.250> notes<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.510> can<00:03:29.690> go

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
also can play these notes so it can go

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:48.380 
also can play these notes so it can go
like<00:03:29.900> this

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:04:37.890
