00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.770
 well I wish you could imagine one 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.040
 paradoxical situation that I go to 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.309
 describing will be hard but make an effort 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.080
 with me then this happens one day 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.480
 a guy wakes up and gets itchy 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.640
 very strong and annoying on the butt 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 left talking about it with some friends 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.480
 discovers he is not the only one to be 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.080
 was suddenly hit by this 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 disorder 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.380
 indeed in a short time the whole world is 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.869
 affection some newspaper starts 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.480
 talk about it by filling pages and pages of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.329
 personal stories all the same and some 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 repertoire photo dozens of comedians ne 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.510
 make their catchphrase 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.760
 and you know there is a category of people 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.110
 so all this is a real tragedy 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.030
 politicians 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.860
 none of them has yet managed to 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 scratching for fear of raising his ass 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 talk is multiplied from the armchair 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.309
 show where experts fight battles 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.170
 high level dialectics 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.829
 some say it's better to scratch with 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.480
 nails other with fingertips 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.710
 endless television magazines 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.780
 clutter global programming 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.630
 explaining how it works biologically 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.630
 the itch its history and the different ones 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.700
 visions of various world cultures 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.640
 even on newsstands the DVD has only 19 euros 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.900
 and 90 edited by giuseppe angela the church 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.310
 Catholic through a spokesman 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.290
 of the press office says that 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.290
 probably a sign of god and we must 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.360
 accept it with gratitude Islam says 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.869
 the opposite must be fought for 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.250
 Judaism is still discussing it 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.409
 trials of vaccines begin that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.720
 multinationals inhibit itching 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.100
 they make avalanches of money but they risk 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 complaints of effects every day 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.320
 Collaterals not calculated begin 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.970
 cover-up processes in the quizzes 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.310
 questions begin to appear 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.680
 general culture on the subject knows me 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.689
 say the date the great began 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.000
 world itch 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.130
 the itch clubs are born circles of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.930
 people who are convinced that scratching 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.700
 is a normal thing that does not exist 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.680
 no problem to externalize your own 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.780
 itching and scratching in public 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.579
 public opinion is split instead 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.159
 there are those who think everyone should 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.110
 resist not scratching those who think that 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.099
 everyone should scratch themselves in 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 private 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.150
 who thinks there is no problem 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.100
 scratch the butt of the next one 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.650
 part entered it as a preliminary 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.200
 in sexual practice polls on 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.540
 polls fill websites to understand 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.030
 who has the strongest itch and how to do it 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.700
 scratch to understand new trends 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.210
 among the young among the old and you like it 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.670
 do 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.920
 born the astag scratch off the most 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.110
 clicked to the world all the newscasts 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.880
 now they talk about it incessantly 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.310
 alarmist because many people 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.350
 I'm in a panic and it's easy to think that 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.930
 is the prelude to something more serious 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.090
 which will affect the world of questions 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.860
 MPs from the left point finger 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.150
 against the government that is doing little or 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.250
 nothing about the problem 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.680
 the right does the same thing to the government 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.350
 there are both a very hot fight 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.360
 one of two pharmaceutical giants sells 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.190
 the itch cream the other one 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.750
 garrison that helps to scratch without 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.340
 produce damage to the skin 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.440
 both produce an enormous amount 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.050
 of scientific research that corroborate 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.180
 their claims to the United Nations explodes 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.040
 the brawl several countries say that in the 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.239
 their territory and itch is much more 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.250
 stronger than in other areas 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.019
 some accuse them of lying and there 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.880
 sanctioning with the embargo 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.920
 the president of the united states promises 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.750
 war without quarter to the itch already has 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.820
 marked 20 thousand men 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.910
 nobody knows for two years pass 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.950
 decades replace generations in 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.739
 in the midst of all this madness the leaf 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.860
 bigger than no one there 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.190
 understand to disclose and fix 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.840
 what caused this itching e 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.510
 even worse it seems to anyone 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.040
 interesting if they get up on their own 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.230
 asks to stop watching i 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.620
 details of the problem and resolve 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.160
 together the one at the root is silenced 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.160
 because considered a demagogic utopia 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.160
 naivety 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.200
 ok it seems an absurd story yet it is 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.970
 a very fitting parody of how 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.720
 more problems are dealt with in 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.810
 our country 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.030
 even the world we think of Italy 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.519
 how busy our politicians are 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.510
 journalist journalists to talk about 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.400
 VAT increase article 18 pensions 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.889
 a never ending story and perfectly 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.229
 useless as the financial system 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.270
 through which we source from 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.040
 currency for internal investments 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.990
 first of all it is no longer in our hands 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.850
 so we can no longer decide how many 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.070
 money to invest in how to invest them 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.810
 secondly the system created a 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.449
 incurable debt on which we pay 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.850
 so many interests every year I am 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.729
 more than any financial tears e 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.470
 blood never implemented or feasible 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.570
 so it's like we're talking about 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.250
 a house that goes up in flames and we are 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.750
 sitting at a table to decide if 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.940
 try turning off the heat with a 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.850
 glass of carbonated water or a glass 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.710
 of natural water and everyone is fine like this 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.870
 no matter how many you find out 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.000
 beat me how many suicides 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.800
 rights take us away 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.300
 and this is the crisis for all friends 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.400
 world tells us that to go out 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.990
 consumption must be increased 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.570
 they say it is the fault of a finance that 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.030
 play with numbers and consume this 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.180
 it only consumes people and the planet 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.310
 up to a point of no return it is so 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.710
 for poverty for diseases for the 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.599
 crime for every problem we throw away 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.910
 on the media table of details 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.889
 useless or simply consequential a 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.830
 the main one to be torn to pieces 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:31.039
 making the deeper concept disappear 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.960
 the causes of the problem and how to solve it 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.630
 exactly as a good person would do 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.880
 illusionist the illusionist cares 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.449
 always because it doesn't make you understand where it is 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.300
 to illusion it all seems true 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.099
 how do you stop being fooled enough? 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.310
 knowing the trick is the illusion 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.710
 becomes obvious so stop 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.910
 watch the show pay attention to 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.539
 hands 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.539
 sharpen your eyes
