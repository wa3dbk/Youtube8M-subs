00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.090
 which risks if it is found in this today 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.120
 ranking position certainly is 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.460
 also due to luck but above all to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.780
 what has been done in the field what 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.600
 have made the players and the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.609
 coaches both before and today among 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.310
 the other I think is ugly from 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.199
 part of a coach accuse 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.359

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.870

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.600
 and the public now has balls 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.730
 full of those missed opportunities for what 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.050
 a victory that could be done at home 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.730

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.559
 match and victory neither happened 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.539

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.830
 where we cross person has created 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.439
 minimum 6 7 scoring chances and therefore that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.140
