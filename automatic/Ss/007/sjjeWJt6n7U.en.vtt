going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.019> draw<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> curve<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.949> comes<00:00:26.160> down

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
going to draw a curve that comes down

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.170 
going to draw a curve that comes down
like<00:00:26.699> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
like that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.990 
like that
so<00:00:27.630> right<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.170> draw<00:00:28.949> curve<00:00:29.720> comes<00:00:30.720> down<00:00:31.109> like

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
so right here draw curve comes down like

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.360 
so right here draw curve comes down like
that<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> start<00:00:34.440> right<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.040> again

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that I'm going to start right here again

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.740 
that I'm going to start right here again
from<00:00:35.579> where<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.910> start<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.510> draw<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
from where you start it and draw the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.990 
from where you start it and draw the
other<00:00:36.840> side<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.680> same<00:00:37.890> way<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.460> right<00:00:38.670> here

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
other side the same way so right here

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.250 
other side the same way so right here
another<00:00:39.899> curve<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.590> goes<00:00:41.420> this<00:00:42.420> side<00:00:42.480> like

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
another curve that goes this side like

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.770 
another curve that goes this side like
that<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:44.640> we're<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> draw<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> big

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that and now we're going to draw a big

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.049 
that and now we're going to draw a big
curve<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.590> her<00:00:46.710> face<00:00:46.950> eye<00:00:47.190> connects<00:00:47.610> back<00:00:47.789> up

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
curve for her face eye connects back up

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.000 
curve for her face eye connects back up
to<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.390> side<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.350> right<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> curve<00:00:52.010> like

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
to this side so right here a curve like

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.240 
to this side so right here a curve like
that<00:00:55.520> another<00:00:56.520> curve<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.289> connect

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that another curve like that and connect

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.830 
that another curve like that and connect
it<00:01:00.500> like<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.460> that's<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:02.969> her<00:01:03.300> her

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it like that so that's just her her

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.560 
it like that so that's just her her
banks<00:01:04.350> area<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.100> her<00:01:05.369> face<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.510> we

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
banks area and then her face and now we

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.630 
banks area and then her face and now we
can<00:01:06.900> go<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:08.540> we're<00:01:09.540> going<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.750> drop<00:01:09.900> big

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
can go up here we're going to drop big

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.609 
can go up here we're going to drop big
curve<00:01:11.640> right<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.840> top<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.080> her<00:01:13.380> head

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
curve right here for the top of her head

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.310 
curve right here for the top of her head
so<00:01:13.830> right<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> draw<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> curve

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so right here I'm going to draw a curve

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.770 
so right here I'm going to draw a curve
that<00:01:16.590> goes<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:18.500> like<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that goes up like that and go all the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.179 
that goes up like that and go all the
way<00:01:21.810> back<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> other<00:01:22.680> side<00:01:23.780> like<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.189> now

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
way back to the other side like that now

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.320 
way back to the other side like that now
we<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.520> draw<00:01:26.700> right<00:01:26.939> here

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
we can draw right here

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870 
we can draw right here
find<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> center<00:01:27.869> go<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.470> right<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.100> draw<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
find the center go up right here draw a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.270 
find the center go up right here draw a
little<00:01:30.240> curve<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.979> we're<00:01:32.189> going

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280

goes back like that and right here
we're<00:04:39.270> going<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.480> draw<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.990> line<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.740> comes

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
we're going to draw a line that comes

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.220 
we're going to draw a line that comes
out<00:04:41.810> right<00:04:42.810> here<00:04:43.020> for<00:04:43.490> her<00:04:44.490> outfit<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.360> we're

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
going to bring it in with a curve like

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.890 
going to bring it in with a curve like
that<00:04:49.520> same<00:04:50.520> thing<00:04:50.699> other<00:04:50.880> side<00:04:51.030> bring<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.660> in

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
and then we're going to draw angle line

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.280 
and then we're going to draw angle line
that<00:04:55.169> comes<00:04:55.350> down<00:04:56.360> same<00:04:57.360> thing<00:04:57.389> on<00:04:57.720> both<00:04:57.900> sides

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
that comes down same thing on both sides

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.140 
that comes down same thing on both sides
like<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.639> then<00:04:59.639> we're<00:04:59.790> going<00:04:59.910> to<00:04:59.940> draw

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
like that then we're going to draw

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.280 
like that then we're going to draw
another<00:05:00.480> one<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:01.139> follows<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.710> same

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
another one that follows the same

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.620 
another one that follows the same
because<00:05:04.290> she<00:05:04.530> wears<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.889> white<00:05:05.639> apron<00:05:06.030> over<00:05:06.600> her

then go back and like that very simple
it's<00:06:04.419> the<00:06:04.510> same<00:06:04.720> thing<00:06:04.930> the<00:06:05.080> other<00:06:05.110> side

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
it's the same thing the other side

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:12.200 
it's the same thing the other side
groove<00:06:06.669> it<00:06:06.820> out<00:06:08.790> we're<00:06:09.790> back<00:06:09.970> in<00:06:10.440> the<00:06:11.440> thumb

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
groove it out we're back in the thumb

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:18.300 
groove it out we're back in the thumb
and<00:06:13.680> bring<00:06:14.680> it<00:06:14.830> back<00:06:14.860> in<00:06:15.340> like<00:06:16.030> that<00:06:17.040> so<00:06:18.040> now<00:06:18.250> we

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
and bring it back in like that so now we

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.969 
and bring it back in like that so now we
can<00:06:18.550> go<00:06:18.669> back<00:06:18.910> in<00:06:19.120> and<00:06:19.150> draw<00:06:19.510> her<00:06:19.720> apron<00:06:20.380> so

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
can go back in and draw her apron so

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.290 
can go back in and draw her apron so
where<00:06:21.190> this<00:06:21.370> line<00:06:21.639> is<00:06:21.910> we're<00:06:22.150> going<00:06:22.240> to

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
where this line is we're going to

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.540 
where this line is we're going to
continue<00:06:22.840> it<00:06:22.990> and<00:06:23.290> draw<00:06:23.770> a<00:06:23.800> big<00:06:24.070> curve<00:06:24.340> that

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
continue it and draw a big curve that

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.450 
continue it and draw a big curve that
comes<00:06:24.729> out<00:06:25.000> same<00:06:25.810> thing<00:06:25.990> right<00:06:26.139> here<00:06:26.350> a<00:06:26.560> big

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
comes out same thing right here a big

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.659 
comes out same thing right here a big
curve<00:06:27.790> comes<00:06:28.210> out<00:06:28.450> and<00:06:28.889> connect<00:06:29.889> a<00:06:30.040> little<00:06:30.340> big

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
curve comes out and connect a little big

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.920 
curve comes out and connect a little big
curve<00:06:31.620> like<00:06:32.620> that<00:06:32.850> so<00:06:33.850> now<00:06:34.030> we<00:06:34.090> can<00:06:34.360> go<00:06:34.510> back<00:06:34.690> in

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
curve like that so now we can go back in

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.620 
curve like that so now we can go back in
and<00:06:35.200> finish<00:06:35.440> the<00:06:35.770> rest<00:06:36.190> of<00:06:36.340> her<00:06:36.460> hair<00:06:36.490> so<00:06:37.360> right

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
here we're going to draw a curve that

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.920 
here we're going to draw a curve that
goes<00:06:39.040> in<00:06:39.340> comes<00:06:40.150> out<00:06:40.979> like<00:06:41.979> that<00:06:42.270> some<00:06:43.270> zigzags

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
goes in comes out like that some zigzags

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
and we're going to draw a lot of the

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.879 
and we're going to draw a lot of the
kind<00:07:18.220> of<00:07:18.310> angle<00:07:18.789> slightly<00:07:19.470> right<00:07:20.470> here<00:07:20.680> to

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:20.889 
kind of angle slightly right here to

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.909 
kind of angle slightly right here to
this<00:07:21.880> way<00:07:22.150> and<00:07:22.840> we're<00:07:23.139> going<00:07:23.289> to<00:07:23.320> connect<00:07:23.740> them
