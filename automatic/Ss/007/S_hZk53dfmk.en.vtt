also learned today the engineers found
the<00:01:03.350> wiring<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.160> Amazons<00:01:04.610> messed<00:01:04.940> up

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
NGS also found it out the electrons get

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.620 
NGS also found it out the electrons get
more<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.520> aggressive<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.910> second<00:01:20.300> time<00:01:20.479> you

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.499 

The<00:01:57.140> Doors<00:01:58.270> work<00:01:59.270> on<00:01:59.509> them<00:01:59.659> anymore

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509

so<00:02:05.509> I<00:02:05.539> don't<00:02:05.719> think<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.049> world

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.100 

alright<00:02:13.519> guys<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.150> looks<00:02:14.390> like<00:02:14.599> we<00:02:14.930> have

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
alright guys so it looks like we have

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.300 
alright guys so it looks like we have
finally<00:02:15.769> figured<00:02:15.980> out<00:02:16.010> how<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.129> use<00:02:16.280> a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
finally figured out how to use a

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.729 
finally figured out how to use a
flashlight<00:02:16.610> we<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.239> simply<00:02:17.540> click<00:02:17.750> shifts

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
flashlight we just simply click shifts

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.430 
flashlight we just simply click shifts
but<00:02:18.890> it's<00:02:19.010> only<00:02:19.129> on<00:02:19.370> ok<00:02:20.080> masks<00:02:21.080> on<00:02:22.840> he's<00:02:23.840> gone<00:02:24.050> I

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
but it's only on ok masks on he's gone I

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.289 
but it's only on ok masks on he's gone I
should<00:02:24.739> survive<00:02:25.040> right<00:02:25.310> cut<00:02:25.640> up<00:02:25.730> on<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:25.879> mask

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
should survive right cut up on the mask

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.539 
should survive right cut up on the mask
oh<00:02:26.360> yeah<00:02:26.510> we're<00:02:26.660> fine<00:02:26.810> alright<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:27.709> we're
