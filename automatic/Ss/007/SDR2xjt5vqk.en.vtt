00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.460
 this malaise created in 1996 evolved into 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.300
 four areas of activity 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.809
 handling lifting the transport and the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.500
 storage 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:36.530
 in 1999 we decided to develop 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.050
 transport and especially transport 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.449
 with auxiliary crane arms which is 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.210
 today our major activity in 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.460
 2013 we decided to invest in 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.160
 a crane truck of more capabilities 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.620
 important and after 18 months of study and 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.019
 close collaboration with scania us 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.329
 have finally been able to concretize our project 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:00.190
 investment by the 200 tons 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.190
 meters mounted on a scania carrier 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.820
 this project is very special because it is 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.040
 a vehicle that is almost unique in 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 france and scania and is the only 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.390
 manufacturer to go through with it 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.010
 project it was necessary to respect a 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.140
 split two times ten tons on 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.280
 both front axles and 2 x 15 tonnes 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.300
 on the rear axles 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.550
 this material with the different choices of 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.229
 heaven allowed us to 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.899
 exactly match notebook 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.060
 bodybuilder loads today our 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.149
 equipment park consists of cranes 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.910
 lifting from 40 to 130 tons and brad 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.920
 auxiliary crane from 20 to 200 nanometers 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.530
 our daily challenge is to satisfy 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.290
 our 1600 customers with a material 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.369
 always more efficient adapted 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.240
 innovative and a team of 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.240
 qualified professionals 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.830
 I am a truck driver at his house 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.830
 malaise for 15 years my truck is a 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.930
 scania 490 horses euro 6 it is equipped 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.100
 an arm 200 loader cranes 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.500
 tons meter the biggest of his 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.450
 category and the first in France he has 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.300
 the possibility of lifting 40 tons 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.920
 closer and 500 kg to 45 meters 5 years 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.860
 we intervene on different 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.770
 industrial sites petrochemical edf 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.100
 for example today I unloaded a 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.960
 concrete post edf of 12 tons with the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.740
 particularity to set it up under 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.740
 a power line 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.810
 this crane mounted on this truck 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.810
 it is a very nice working tool
