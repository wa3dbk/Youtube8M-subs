00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 greet friends on michael h channel 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.670
 the topic of today's video will be who 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.130
 show you my attack right now 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.309
 clan members in our academy of ours 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.710
 clan who has an academy about 2 which 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.710
 you can come through it get into 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.930
 our clan, but now specifically show 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.189
 you are very interesting attack he attack 8 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.580
 which shoved almost as much 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.699
 rdf two of them 5 1 6 attack he 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.230
 dragons 2 lego pretty good at 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.420
 him receive honor and territory and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.230
 the main group of standing dragons flies 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.360
 middle 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 but now you will see the slope of a hard hat 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.980
 let out fifth boars which are very 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
 successfully under the spells in the middle go 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.149
 in the middle of the base and help very quickly 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.190
 demolish steel df and even one rdf yet 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.670
 it turns out they tear down at a time when 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.620
 the main group, in principle, everything is still whole 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.610
 and unscathed and that is mdf just not 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.590
 managed to react 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.239
 Here is such an interesting so what is it 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.760
 interesting because it was planned 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.100
 yes and of course without x wisdom you know 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.470
 we all already play without xmod and kiss you 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.590
 a week if not one and a half fusing updates 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.520
 who made super sat down our favorite and 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.090
 Of course it is super super that mark 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.150
 there is such an experience of playing dragons and 2 l 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.830
 dragons about demolishes base 8 quietly with 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.630
 practically maximum spruce 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.270
 rdf and 3 stars very successfully very 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.460
 interesting so friends 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.570
 experiment dragons can be given 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.850
 the second to demolish 8 quietly on all 100 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.240
 percent but then go to my base 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.250
 as you can see I have a 111 level I I 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.740
 already 3 golems finally swung to something 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 quietly doing apple 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.020
 I will have heroes and labs 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.840
 golems after halimov of course I want 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.170
 still put in fact at 2 level so that they 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.140
 to me 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.689
 magali but as soon as later 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.630
 I will swing the varik also I try 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.540
 swing heroes and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.110
 up the clouds this little whale fence 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.080
 bombs 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.780
 and now I'll show you my attacks 1 so 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.770
 I was generally super duper unreal 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.140
 watch everyone just zashib x without mod 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.110
 I'll say right away it's hard without x mod balls i 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.810
 just a complete sucker, I generally can not some 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.209
 way to predict something he will and 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.790
 like because you yourself know xmod not 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.200
 shows no bombs aerial test 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.790
 its not worth it and so on go blindly to 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.530
 this of course is of interest 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.000
 defined in principle by me 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.120
 it turned out a couple of stars 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.049
 demolish this ban no base others 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.890
 base 9 quiet even as much as possible lego 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.110
 but this time I did exactly on 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.380
 but 10 stars this base as we see 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.959
 released their balls in groups let out 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.760
 love yes, I have to go out from above 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.560
 it was to heal a few balls 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.750
 it may not have been necessary because 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.609
 that they have already reached the building to me 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.680
 just the same here is one link at the end not 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:09.480
 I also lacked a little treat and their 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.340
 love to be safe and sound until 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.739
 people flew even give the whole right 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.290
 two lava scattered rascha and 3 scatter 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.970
 left here 1 ripe not enough now 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.970
 that's left to throw and on 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.209
 lava and although not even lavana balls you 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.340
 see the balls were already a little black 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.530
 it was enough for them a little bit was not enough 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.970
 there would have been a little more good not 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.880
 you will be either or only then 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.340
 single shot and here we see a fly fly 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.140
 flies the same thing as not enough to finish 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.940
 their and then at least one asterisk up was 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.090
 Here is such a successful only in my 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.739
 performance friends can not yet without x 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.350
 fashion play balls 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.739
 Well, my second such I have already gone 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.870
 in a proven way I did this myself 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.900
 mix that moment is not that moment for my army 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.680
 I get the top mix 3 golem I have three 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.440
 dive 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.060
 magicians of course bomber in clan caste me 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.280
 magic and go move over them and of course 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.810
 there is no plank for us anyway 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.930
 there will be a lot of golem magicians 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.540
 distract immediately throwing stochn 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.700
 health that treat everyone yes kinda 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.709
 bombs exploded but thankfully mostly 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.099
 a friend of the magicians, they did not blow up also Vitya 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.080
 on the sides throwing shoots and two magicians for 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.320
 them just the right view, it was the magician was 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.810
 witch 1 the essence is that upeco is 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.060
 forward as glebchik on take it takes 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.120
 kick please not quite on the left 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.220
 disconnected and mages go help clear 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.080
 a bit for the structure so but to the syrin 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.630
 us going in the middle we have a super 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.400
 golem 2 divided it is a big plus then 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.880
 what does not go to month 1 right another 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.800
 on the left as this is just super very 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.539
 a lot in principle 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.460
 whole magicians sorry not the same for me 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:58.560
 no spell of spells I have everything 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.659
 used and help help 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.830
 Golemchiki clean territory 69 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:03.690
 percent 2 stars 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.250
 but of course I counted on two stars 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.099
 on we see at the end there the following three 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.840
 Tesla and 3 test from the chairs there it to 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:15.030
 latest somewhere i become because 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.159
 that dough to a close maximum level 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.530
 9 d.h. 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:21.330
 as i said on this and on so and 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.520
 ended 83 percent from me 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.800
 it turned out although it can not even more there 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.310
 I still finish the bows but not the essence 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.840
 I took the stars and probably for the time being 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.610
 walking at that moment he learns to walk 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.669
 murder because attacks are more 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.500
 predictable can somehow 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.610
 predict 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.590
 and maneuver during the attack case 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.510
 I managed to throw someone right 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.790
 heal and so on because earthly 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:50.420
 troops are more predictable and than 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:53.360
 air so and so my attack rather 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.240
 attacks my base from such I have 10 tx 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.720
 and I have such lobling balls 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.990
 he has 5 links two cutters 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.000
 where he freezes crossbows on rdf 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.200
 for some reason does not throw very strange could 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.010
 rdf and frieze 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.230
 u rdf and crossbow freeze why he 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.280
 sometimes not abandoned i didn't get it okay ok 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:18.380
 In principle, he managed to finish off and 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:22.160
 the queen even destroyed already yes and finish 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.200
 the rest df from kong base released 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.810
 like moss he has a king and queen 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.540
 he seemed to have enough time to breed me 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.660
 100 percent and he took from me 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.480
 only two stars in general 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.270
 attacks dear friends here are friends 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.310
 attacks as new ones arrive and so 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.650
 I will definitely show you from

 our main clan language kids 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.790
