00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
can pretty much as long as they have the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.150 
can pretty much as long as they have the
same<00:00:59.460> animations<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.170> still<00:01:01.649> can't<00:01:01.859> take

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
same animations so you still can't take

with<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> two-handed<00:01:53.939> axe<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.600> run<00:01:54.750> around

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
with the two-handed axe I can run around

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.200 
with the two-handed axe I can run around
two<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.500> sword<00:01:55.740> singing<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:56.700> animations

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
two and a sword singing my animations

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.020 
two and a sword singing my animations
and<00:01:57.329> everything<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:57.860> looks<00:01:58.860> different

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
and everything it just looks different

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.459 
and everything it just looks different
so<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.299> pretty<00:02:00.540> much<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.020> quality<00:02:01.439> of

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
so this is pretty much just a quality of

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.069 
so this is pretty much just a quality of
life<00:02:01.770> change<00:02:02.189> because<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.630> doesn't

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
life change because really this doesn't

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:04.710 
life change because really this doesn't
add<00:02:04.170> any

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
add any

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.060 
add any
game<00:02:05.080> breaking<00:02:05.440> or<00:02:05.770> anything<00:02:06.100> like<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.330> but

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
game breaking or anything like that but

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.820 
game breaking or anything like that but
subvert<00:02:09.070> this<00:02:09.250> does<00:02:09.880> that<00:02:10.000> like<00:02:10.180> that<00:02:10.300> model

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
subvert this does that like that model

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.340 
subvert this does that like that model
it<00:02:11.830> will<00:02:12.100> make<00:02:12.510> costumes<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.840> little<00:02:14.110> more

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
it will make costumes a little more

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.510 
it will make costumes a little more
easier<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.220> little<00:02:15.850> easier<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:17.310> go<00:02:18.310> about

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
easier a little easier to go about

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.190 
easier a little easier to go about
making<00:02:19.060> because<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.690> know<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.840> lot<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:20.110> people

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
making because I know a lot of people

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.460 
making because I know a lot of people
are<00:02:20.500> really<00:02:20.680> into<00:02:21.010> transmog<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:22.470> sometimes

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
are really into transmog and sometimes

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.070 
are really into transmog and sometimes
you<00:02:23.620> really<00:02:23.800> do<00:02:24.040> have<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.400> find<00:02:24.640> like<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.900> a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
you really do have to find like just a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.640 
you really do have to find like just a
random<00:02:26.470> green<00:02:26.830> item<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:28.360> put<00:02:28.930> on<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.380> say<00:02:29.620> I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
random green item to put on to say I

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.830 
random green item to put on to say I
want<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.160> have<00:02:30.310> this<00:02:30.460> dagger<00:02:30.820> model<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:31.600> I

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
want to have this dagger model but I

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.300 
want to have this dagger model but I
don't<00:02:32.020> have<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> dagger<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.650> usually<00:02:33.130> use<00:02:33.280> a

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
don't have a dagger I usually use a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.650 
don't have a dagger I usually use a
sword<00:02:34.260> here<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.320> go<00:02:35.470> random<00:02:36.070> green<00:02:36.250> and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
sword here you go random green and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.199 
sword here you go random green and
transmog<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:38.280> now<00:02:39.280> there's<00:02:39.459> also<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.760> small

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
transmog that now there's also a small

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.660 
transmog that now there's also a small
quality<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.290> life<00:02:41.500> change<00:02:41.860> if<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.340> look<00:02:42.580> at

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
quality of life change if you look at

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.630 
quality of life change if you look at
your<00:02:42.790> map<00:02:43.180> now<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.780> live<00:02:44.560> right<00:02:44.830> now<00:02:45.070> it'll<00:02:45.400> do

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
your map now in live right now it'll do

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.449 
your map now in live right now it'll do
a<00:02:45.670> soft<00:02:46.180> ping<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.020> circle<00:02:47.530> around<00:02:47.740> you<00:02:48.130> about

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
a soft ping of a circle around you about

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.260 
a soft ping of a circle around you about
two<00:02:49.120> times<00:02:49.360> but<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.050> very<00:02:50.890> subtle<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.850> can't

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
two times but it's very subtle you can't

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.860 
two times but it's very subtle you can't
really<00:02:52.420> see<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:53.190> now<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.250> have<00:02:54.580> this<00:02:54.870> little

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
really see it now you have this little

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.930 
really see it now you have this little
arrows<00:02:56.260> around<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.740> even<00:02:57.430> if<00:02:57.520> you<00:02:57.610> zoom<00:02:57.640> out

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
arrows around it even if you zoom out

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.410 
arrows around it even if you zoom out
it'll<00:02:58.300> still<00:02:58.540> be<00:02:58.660> like<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.140> it's<00:03:00.130> just<00:03:01.120> a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
it'll still be like that it's just a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.530 
it'll still be like that it's just a
bigger<00:03:02.310> notification<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.400> where<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:03.670> are<00:03:03.820> so

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
bigger notification of where you are so

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.949 
bigger notification of where you are so
not<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:05.650> big<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:05.830> a<00:03:05.920> change<00:03:06.160> but<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.850> will<00:03:07.600> at

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
not that big of a change but it will at

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.380 
not that big of a change but it will at
least<00:03:08.500> show<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.070> where<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.550> are<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:10.060> little

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
least show you where you are a little

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.050 
least show you where you are a little
quicker<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:12.720> who<00:03:13.720> knows<00:03:13.900> maybe<00:03:14.820> that's<00:03:15.820> not

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
quicker but who knows maybe that's not

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.910 
quicker but who knows maybe that's not
going<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.300> stay<00:03:16.450> this<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.170> PTR<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.800> this

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
going to stay this is the PTR and this

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.890 
going to stay this is the PTR and this
could<00:03:18.040> all<00:03:18.160> change<00:03:18.459> they<00:03:18.760> could<00:03:18.970> decide

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
could all change they could decide

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.750 
could all change they could decide
against<00:03:20.320> putting<00:03:20.590> these<00:03:20.830> transmog<00:03:21.310> changes

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
against putting these transmog changes

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.790 
against putting these transmog changes
in<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.600> small<00:03:22.930> map<00:03:23.110> change<00:03:23.470> but

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
in and that small map change but

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.680 
in and that small map change but
hopefully<00:03:24.760> they<00:03:24.910> won't<00:03:25.150> because<00:03:25.540> this

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
hopefully they won't because this

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.479 
hopefully they won't because this
transmog<00:03:26.110> change<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.560> pretty<00:03:26.890> awesome<00:03:27.100> in<00:03:27.459> my

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
transmog change is pretty awesome in my

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.240 
transmog change is pretty awesome in my
opinion<00:03:27.850> even<00:03:28.390> though<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:28.810> don't<00:03:29.620> really<00:03:29.920> use

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
opinion even though I don't really use

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.970 
opinion even though I don't really use
transmog<00:03:30.700> much<00:03:30.910> sometimes<00:03:31.450> it's<00:03:31.989> pretty<00:03:32.769> cool

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
transmog much sometimes it's pretty cool

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.750 
transmog much sometimes it's pretty cool
but<00:03:33.190> sometimes<00:03:33.580> it's<00:03:33.850> totally<00:03:34.720> useless<00:03:34.930> so

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
but sometimes it's totally useless so

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.490 
but sometimes it's totally useless so
