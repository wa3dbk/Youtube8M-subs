00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.639
 hello and welcome to this roulette 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.559
 the recipe of the day is the pastry custard 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.740
 we need a broken dough a liter of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.730
 whole milk 4th 150 g sugar 90 g 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.410
 cornflour and a vanilla bean 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.279
 first step we will heat up the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.840
 milk with vanilla little trick we're going 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.400
 wet the pan 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.310
 before pouring the milk it will allow 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.390
 to prevent them from approaching too strong 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.440
 there is a small film of water at the bottom 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.000
 it's perfect we pour the milk we go 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.460
 now perfume the milk with the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.050
 vanilla then little trick so that the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.540
 milk is well scented the better it is 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.360
 to have it brewed cold at this time 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.789
 there we put the vanilla the day before in the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.370
 cold milk is going to pounce on any 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.230
 the length and then we will recover 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.899
 all the little black grains that are at 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.620
 inside and I'm going to add the pod 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.600
 vanilla cracked and scraped and the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.579
 small seeds 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.579
 we will now sift and the maÃ¯zena 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:14.470
 we will add the sugar we mix we go 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.780
 now take care of the eggs 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.060
 we'll go break in a bowl for them 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.970
 beat it seems that the flambeau high school students 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.810
 and favorite french desserts 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.670
 personally it's not my drawing 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.110
 prefect is it your dessert 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.390
 prefer 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.150
 no and that's which ten months in the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.520
 comments hu have to be slightly 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.440
 to them and we'll add them to the mix in 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.180
 whipping from the center by going 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.820
 gradually goes the self we could 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.100
 incorporate all the elements without 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.220
 no greno the milk is boiling I 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.170
 picks up the vanilla bean and I'm going 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.940
 to be able to pour milk on my eggs 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.890
 it smells super good I feel like 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.070
 to shift the recipe she's just 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.770
 which publishers prefer I 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.539
 reverse in the pan and I'm going 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.420
 cook over low heat for two 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.800
 minutes at night on fire in two 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.780
 minutes without stirring 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.910
 we will now put some dough 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.560
 broken in the bottom of a mold so I I 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.510

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.750
 a stupidly round mold I'm going 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.920
 reread the excellent game late it does not we 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.600
