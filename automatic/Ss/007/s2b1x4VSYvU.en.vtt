00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.579
 for a half an hour how 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.050
 I chose my color I have everything 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.050
 simply contact the service 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.390
 L'Oreal Paris Consumer is a 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.219
 team of hair professionals who 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.379

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.699
 coloring and who is there to help you 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.730
 to choose the right color 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.170
 so I explained what she was 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.939
 was my case how were the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.070
 hair currently the effect that I 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.270
 were looking for and really lavished on me 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.760
 full of good advice 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.540
 already to choose my color and also 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.520
 for the application 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.990
 I opted for the 4.15 Arabica muance 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.509
 iced brown 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.210
 because as you know I have a 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.150
 tie and dye effect so I have a hair 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.920
 rather dark at the base and tip a 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.570
 little bit clearer so I wanted 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.040
 to unify it all thanks to this brown 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.020
 iced to avoid having a result 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.440
 too dark and still have the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.390
 light 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.770
 in my hair so we will end up 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.600
 a little bit later I'm going 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.980
 proceed to the application and we will 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.190
 find out later to see how that 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.190
 happened 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.080
 here we are back after 30 minutes 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 of application you must know that I have 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.360
 used two leaves because I have them 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.130
 very long hair 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.020
 so we had to have a minimum of 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.540
 two kits to have a good result 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.970
 so it is very easy to use it 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.480
 is a super easy to understand 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.210
 mixtures 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.950
 we have great professionals who are 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.800
 really nice to use and especially 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.110
 we have a color without ammonia which 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.240
 without really super good I already had 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.740
 a little glimpse of the smell really 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.500
 greedy because I had received a 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.850
 prodigy candle from l'oreal paris so 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.220
 it's nice to smell 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.620
 nice on the head when we have it during 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.270
 30 minutes on you at the result level 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.970
 colors I have the impression of having 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.830
 found my original brown so it's 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.420
 rather nice it's not the effect 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.370
 charcoal that we can have with 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.540
 some coloring I have an art or 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.070
 almost nude 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.320
 so I'm pretty happy to have a 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.940
 really natural effect against me 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.660
 still a coloring full of 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.670
 reflections I see in transparency even though 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.800
 my color be very homogeneous I see in 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.090
 transparency but reflections and that's 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.790
 really nice to have a color 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.700
 which vibrates so I am satisfied in 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.300
 makes this coloring experience without 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.430
 ammonia 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.739
 so it's a very good product I'm 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.390
 really glad to have tried this 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.670
