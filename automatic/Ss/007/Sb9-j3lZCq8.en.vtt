00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
run in idle for a short time and then it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
run in idle for a short time and then it

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.360 
shows well from the bottom to the top is
one<00:01:24.570> quarter<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.650> would<00:01:25.830> be<00:01:25.920> about<00:01:26.130> half

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
one quarter so this would be about half

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
back out start it and then recheck it

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
no easy way to check this you can add

no easy way to check this you can add
another<00:01:45.130> half<00:01:45.430> before<00:01:45.820> I'm<00:01:46.120> going<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.360> do<00:01:46.450> more

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
another half before I'm going to do more

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.490 
another half before I'm going to do more
than<00:01:46.870> that<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.290> check<00:01:47.410> it<00:01:47.560> again<00:01:47.830> we<00:01:48.700> have<00:01:49.030> had

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
than that and check it again we have had

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.520 
than that and check it again we have had

bad oil level sensors have customers

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.220 
bad oil level sensors have customers
actually<00:01:53.980> add<00:01:54.190> three<00:01:54.940> four<00:01:55.300> five<00:01:55.690> even<00:01:56.200> six

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
actually add three four five even six

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.180 
actually add three four five even six

more footage of oil into an engine and

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.320 
more footage of oil into an engine and
usually<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.280> can<00:02:00.460> either<00:02:00.640> get<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:01.060> lot<00:02:01.210> of

usually you can either get a lot of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.960 
usually you can either get a lot of
smoke<00:02:01.540> into<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.870> tailpipe<00:02:02.500> or<00:02:02.890> very<00:02:03.700> very

tempest<00:02:09.610> engine<00:02:10.149> image<00:02:10.479> I've<00:02:10.960> never<00:02:11.230> seen<00:02:11.470> it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
tempest engine image I've never seen it

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.380 
tempest engine image I've never seen it
happen<00:02:12.000> and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
happen and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.240 
happen and
so<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.870> only<00:02:15.020> way<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.230> really<00:02:15.650> check<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.040> is

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
so the only way to really check this is

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.860 
so the only way to really check this is
you<00:02:16.400> don't<00:02:16.550> have<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> dipstick<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.660> to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
you don't have the dipstick is to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.830 
you don't have the dipstick is to
physically<00:02:18.650> drain<00:02:18.950> your<00:02:19.100> oil<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.700> measure

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
physically drain your oil and measure

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.690 
physically drain your oil and measure
