comparison<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.410> gas<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> browser<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
comparison on the gas to the browser and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.599 
comparison on the gas to the browser and
we<00:00:20.820> gassed<00:00:21.000> actual<00:00:21.359> browser<00:00:21.600> farms<00:00:22.050> as<00:00:22.199> well

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
we gassed actual browser farms as well

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.560 
we gassed actual browser farms as well
sir<00:00:23.609> we're<00:00:24.210> going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> look<00:00:24.449> at<00:00:24.510> three

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
sir we're going to look at three

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.240 
sir we're going to look at three

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the good old test what I like to do is

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
the good old test what I like to do is
basically<00:00:40.260> tap<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.829> hold<00:00:40.950> tap<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.149> hold<00:00:42.710> up

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
basically tap and hold tap and hold up

on<00:00:43.890> old<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> we're<00:00:45.539> going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.870> best<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
on old so we're going to do is best to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
on old so we're going to do is best to
open<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.620> buff<00:00:46.800> up<00:00:46.950> at<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> exact<00:00:47.370> same<00:00:47.610> time<00:00:47.879> do

open a buff up at the exact same time do

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.270 
open a buff up at the exact same time do
a<00:00:48.629> quick<00:00:48.899> scroll<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> website<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.070> see

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
a quick scroll on the website and see

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.389 
a quick scroll on the website and see
what<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.640> sir<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:51.840> two<00:00:51.870> three<00:00:52.469> off<00:00:53.039> the

nice obviously if you go to the side in
oil<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.799> whole<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.640> white<00:01:23.909> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
oil this is just a whole more white and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.450 
oil this is just a whole more white and
it<00:01:24.840> should<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.470> him<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.369> can

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
it should really know him but as you can

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.950 
it should really know him but as you can
see<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> gas<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.270> pinch<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> zoom<00:01:27.630> again

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
see there the gas to pinch to zoom again

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.390 
see there the gas to pinch to zoom again
my<00:01:28.110> website<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.829> exactly<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.220> most

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.429 
this one as well I'm just going to show
her<00:01:36.720> gas<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.079> pinch<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> zoom<00:01:39.140> there<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.229> go

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
her gas to the pinch to zoom there we go

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.289 
her gas to the pinch to zoom there we go
so<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:43.159> I<00:01:44.159> want<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> do<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.210> we

here<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.390> over<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> verge<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.500> it's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
here we have over to the verge so it's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.870 
here we have over to the verge so it's
going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.920> probably<00:02:02.070> go<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.520> default

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880

as far as you can go zoom in that's as

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.910 
as far as you can go zoom in that's as
far<00:03:18.209> as<00:03:18.269> we<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.540> go<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.380> can<00:03:19.500> see<00:03:19.590> they<00:03:19.709> can

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
far as we can go so you can see they can

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.840 
far as we can go so you can see they can
go<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.190> little<00:03:20.370> bit<00:03:20.549> further<00:03:20.760> because

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
go in a little bit further because

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.970 
go in a little bit further because
you've<00:03:21.060> got<00:03:21.120> more<00:03:21.299> screen<00:03:21.630> real<00:03:21.660> estate<00:03:21.980> but

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
you've got more screen real estate but

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.960 
you've got more screen real estate but
it's<00:03:23.070> not<00:03:23.190> really<00:03:23.310> much<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.640> difference<00:03:23.880> it

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
it's not really much of a difference it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.520 
it's not really much of a difference it
