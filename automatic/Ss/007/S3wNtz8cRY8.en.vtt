of<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.210> other<00:01:18.390> adjustable<00:01:18.900> dumbbells<00:01:19.259> that

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
of these other adjustable dumbbells that

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.039 
of these other adjustable dumbbells that
have<00:01:19.560> those<00:01:19.680> organ<00:01:20.100> Amin<00:01:20.369> handles<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.630> get

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
have those organ Amin handles that get

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.780 
have those organ Amin handles that get
fat<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.500> center<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.100> really<00:01:23.490> skinny

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
fat in the center and get really skinny

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.330 
fat in the center and get really skinny
on<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> side<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:25.409> don't<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:25.979> they<00:01:26.220> were

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
on the side and I don't think they were

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.980 
on the side and I don't think they were
designed<00:01:26.640> by<00:01:26.759> people<00:01:26.970> who<00:01:27.240> work<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.630> because

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
designed by people who work out because

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.170 
designed by people who work out because
I<00:01:28.290> find<00:01:28.890> them<00:01:28.979> extremely<00:01:29.189> uncomfortable<00:01:29.790> but

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
I find them extremely uncomfortable but

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.960 
I find them extremely uncomfortable but
this<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.890> probably<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.400> most<00:01:32.520> comfortable

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
this is probably the most comfortable

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.840 
this is probably the most comfortable
handle<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.049> find<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.860> gym<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.369> piece<00:01:35.759> of

was talking about the two and a half
pound<00:01:44.340> increments<00:01:44.549> when<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.479> put<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.780> open

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
pound increments when you put it to open

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.600 
pound increments when you put it to open
you<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.700> these<00:01:47.820> two<00:01:48.119> two<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> half<00:01:49.110> pound

steel<00:01:50.610> pieces<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.720> what<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> can

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
steel pieces in there and what you can

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.310 
steel pieces in there and what you can
do<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.439> five<00:01:52.649> pounds<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.170> really

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
want a two and a half to put on it you

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.880 
want a two and a half to put on it you
know<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.930> mean<00:01:58.229> you're<00:01:58.350> supposed<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.710> two

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
know I mean you're supposed to do two

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.200 
know I mean you're supposed to do two

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
but if you do one you get a two and a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569 
but if you do one you get a two and a
half<00:02:00.299> pound<00:02:00.540> increment<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.189> put<00:02:02.399> both<00:02:02.549> of

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
half pound increment so to put both of

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.749 
half pound increment so to put both of
those<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.969> there<00:02:03.119> lock<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.369> see<00:02:05.369> how<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.520> lock

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
those in there lock it see how the lock

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.940 
those in there lock it see how the lock
works<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.079> go<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.259> sides<00:02:07.710> with

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
works just as that and go to sides with

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.999 
works just as that and go to sides with
it

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
it

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.080 
it
and<00:02:09.759> there's<00:02:10.269> your<00:02:10.330> ten<00:02:10.479> pound<00:02:10.720> dumbbell<00:02:12.090> but

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
and there's your ten pound dumbbell but

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.070 
and there's your ten pound dumbbell but
what<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.239> wanted<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.569> show<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.840> here<00:02:14.170> is

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
what I wanted to show you here is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.000 
what I wanted to show you here is
actually<00:02:17.080> have<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:17.879> take<00:02:18.879> this<00:02:19.090> here<00:02:20.010> slide

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
actually have I take this here slide

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.550 
actually have I take this here slide
that<00:02:21.250> right<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:24.510> here's<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.660> actual<00:02:26.019> size<00:02:26.379> of

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
that right in here's the actual size of

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.589 
that right in here's the actual size of
it<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.549> think<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.910> will<00:02:28.150> help<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.450> lot<00:02:28.569> of

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
it and I think this will help a lot of

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.880 
it and I think this will help a lot of
people<00:02:28.720> understand<00:02:29.610> how<00:02:30.610> convenient<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.209> is

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
people understand how convenient it is

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.069 
people understand how convenient it is
that's<00:02:32.890> next<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> 40-pound<00:02:33.849> dumbbell

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
that's next to a 40-pound dumbbell

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.479 
that's next to a 40-pound dumbbell
that's<00:02:35.079> a<00:02:35.170> 45-pound<00:02:35.590> power<00:02:36.069> block<00:02:36.280> right

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
that's a 45-pound power block right

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.740 
that's a 45-pound power block right
there<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:37.959> actually<00:02:38.110> smaller<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:39.750> then

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
there so it's actually smaller and then

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.220 
there so it's actually smaller and then
if<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.900> take<00:02:41.079> a<00:02:41.140> look<00:02:41.410> at<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.769> this<00:02:42.579> is<00:02:42.790> a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
if you take a look at this this is a

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.110 
if you take a look at this this is a
real<00:02:44.230> 45<00:02:44.709> pound<00:02:44.980> adjustable<00:02:45.459> dumbbell<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.910> mean

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
real 45 pound adjustable dumbbell I mean

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.880 
real 45 pound adjustable dumbbell I mean
look<00:02:46.269> at<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.480> size<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.870> you're<00:02:47.200> it's

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
look at the size of that you're it's

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.880 
look at the size of that you're it's
almost<00:02:48.250> half<00:02:48.459> as<00:02:48.640> wide<00:02:48.819> you<00:02:49.510> know<00:02:49.629> so<00:02:49.900> if<00:02:50.680> you

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
almost half as wide you know so if you

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.670 
almost half as wide you know so if you
look<00:02:51.069> at<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:51.310> it's<00:02:51.549> really<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:52.560> mean<00:02:53.560> if<00:02:53.620> you

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
look at that it's really I mean if you

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.300 
look at that it's really I mean if you
put<00:02:53.829> them<00:02:53.920> down<00:02:54.069> there<00:02:54.160> got<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.370> same<00:02:54.640> height

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
put them down there got the same height

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.199 
put them down there got the same height
you<00:02:57.310> look<00:02:57.459> at<00:02:57.549> six<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.879> eight<00:02:58.000> inches

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
you look at six to eight inches

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.539 
you look at six to eight inches
difference<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:58.810> just<00:02:59.290> the<00:03:00.069> width<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.459> the

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
difference in just the width of the

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.569 
difference in just the width of the
dumbbell<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.599> it's<00:03:02.290> extremely<00:03:02.530> convenient<00:03:03.280> I

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
dumbbell so it's extremely convenient I

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.369 
dumbbell so it's extremely convenient I
mean<00:03:04.239> if<00:03:04.299> we<00:03:04.390> pull<00:03:04.569> them<00:03:04.629> down<00:03:04.810> here<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:05.260> look

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
mean if we pull them down here and look

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.039 
mean if we pull them down here and look
at<00:03:05.470> these<00:03:05.590> two<00:03:06.540> that's<00:03:07.540> what<00:03:07.660> you're<00:03:07.780> looking

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
at these two that's what you're looking

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.890 
at these two that's what you're looking
at<00:03:08.109> so<00:03:09.069> I<00:03:10.140> size-wise<00:03:11.140> PowerBlock<00:03:12.129> is<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.900> I

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
at so I size-wise PowerBlock is is I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.990 
at so I size-wise PowerBlock is is I
think<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.139> perfect<00:03:14.319> dumbbell<00:03:14.709> because<00:03:15.609> the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
think the perfect dumbbell because the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.620 
think the perfect dumbbell because the
the<00:03:16.239> Bowflex<00:03:16.750> are<00:03:17.109> pretty<00:03:17.560> big<00:03:17.799> they're<00:03:18.790> not

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
the Bowflex are pretty big they're not

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.479 
the Bowflex are pretty big they're not
that<00:03:19.840> big<00:03:20.079> but<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.950> know<00:03:21.069> you're<00:03:21.190> looking<00:03:21.280> at

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
that big but you know you're looking at

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.949 
that big but you know you're looking at
more<00:03:21.669> of<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.849> full<00:03:22.090> size<00:03:22.299> adjustable<00:03:22.840> because

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
more of a full size adjustable because

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.050 
more of a full size adjustable because
when<00:03:23.919> you<00:03:24.010> lower<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.549> weight<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.940> don't

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
when you lower the weight you don't

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.370 
when you lower the weight you don't
shrink<00:03:25.359> the<00:03:25.510> size<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:27.900> that's<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.049> basic

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
shrink the size so that's the basic

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.819 
shrink the size so that's the basic
review<00:03:29.560> arm<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.139> stand<00:03:32.410> right<00:03:32.620> here
