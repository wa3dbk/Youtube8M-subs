then I'm still running their original

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.849 
then I'm still running their original
batteries<00:01:26.030> that<00:01:26.149> they<00:01:26.270> came<00:01:26.450> with<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.109> three

lumens as you can tell it's certainly
plenty<00:01:36.649> of<00:01:36.920> light<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.399> see<00:01:38.299> what's<00:01:38.479> going<00:01:38.780> on

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
it's enough light to have the camera

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.709 
it's enough light to have the camera
focus<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.219> see<00:01:43.219> what's<00:01:43.549> going<00:01:43.850> on<00:01:44.000> outside

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719
