00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:08.280
 we already managed to do as I already 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.660
 said here are such additional 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.410
 fasteners 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:20.029
 that keep us on the screws they 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:24.449
 go to the plug here we are welded it 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.689
 everything is exactly the size we also took 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.989
 then a piece of reinforcement floor stand 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.090
 picked up cut derzhak from the fork 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.539
 cut rebar in the middle shoved 2 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.379
 there big washers cooked together 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.789
 stuck 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.359
 a piece of rebar in this pipe scalded 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.230
 around and we have this 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:56.370
 mount secure yes yes all design 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.199
 I weighed 70 kilograms here I will sell 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.339
 the front wheel will be lifted 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.369
 some kind of counterweight come up so then 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.450
 we are back to the cart 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:12.619
 fortified here a little bit added 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.979
 some parts for better mounting 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:21.500
 for better weight gain 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:27.229
 they cut off everything was put 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.170
 This mechanism from the car honda civic 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.930
 it's like 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:38.760
 front end ball 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:43.020
 she serves as a turnbuckle dressing washers 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:47.040
 and clamping the bottom of the screw can talk 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:53.460
 we are all now we are still talking here 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:56.659
 can support the bottom 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:03.440
 as it will now look like us 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:09.239
 here's got dressed fixed bottom nut and 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:13.350
 here we have a cart we have here we are 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:17.209
 we strengthen very necessary correctly 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.370
 calculate the distance between the ground 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.519
 the wheels of the whole undercarriage system we took 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.450
 set the level here if you see u 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.600
 us bubble slightly raise the front 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.500
 part of it so that when 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 putting weight on it it’s equal it’s not 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.970
 I feel so well here conceived this 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.170
 here's a new mechanism we don't have a mechanism 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.440
 removable any time can be removed 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.250
 to put 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:54.390
 if you need to use a bicycle 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.049
 cart well here's the next stage and we 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.590
 will make bumpers on podvarivat 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.350
 strengthen well done yes and most 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.650
 the main thing in the middle is choosing between 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:13.109
 basic inject between the wheels that is not 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.420
 this grid namely, we count as 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.160
 we have wheels 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.350
 take one middle one between the wheels to 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.120
 we had it the same 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.460
 that is, so we know on the steering wheel 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.420
 passes we have trailed does not pass at 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.570
 I currently have a little more trailer 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.600
 they will not have to drive here 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.730
 add 4 know three and a half 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.940
 somewhere it read the address half 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.280
 centimeter on each side and then 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.370
 it will be seen that if the wheel passes 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:55.830
 passes and the cart itself standard steering wheel 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.350
 and I have 60 centimeters rui and so not 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.620
 I do not know how much the rest of the steering wheel and 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:05.240
 Now we even take interest 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.240
 measure roulette on any Galician 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.870
 rippon
