you know the Rose has not even given to
me<00:04:04.519> so<00:04:04.819> I'm<00:04:05.750> sure<00:04:06.049> I'm<00:04:06.200> actually<00:04:06.530> I'm<00:04:06.980> pretty

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
me so I'm sure I'm actually I'm pretty

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.710 
me so I'm sure I'm actually I'm pretty
sure<00:04:07.459> that<00:04:07.609> they<00:04:07.730> probably<00:04:08.120> cast<00:04:08.420> someone

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
sure that they probably cast someone

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.229 
sure that they probably cast someone
already<00:04:08.900> well<00:04:09.769> because<00:04:10.099> there<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.700> think<00:04:11.090> gone

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
already well because there I think gone

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:20.229 
already well because there I think gone
past<00:04:11.510> castings<00:04:12.079> stage<00:04:12.680> but<00:04:13.480> yeah<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:19.370> have<00:04:20.030> no

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
past castings stage but yeah I have no

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.759 
past castings stage but yeah I have no
idea<00:04:20.419> because<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:21.019> honestly<00:04:21.169> have<00:04:21.560> no<00:04:21.739> idea

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
idea because I honestly have no idea

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.249 
idea because I honestly have no idea
about<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:23.300> casting<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.840> feminine<00:04:24.169> I've

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
about the casting of the feminine I've

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:31.159 
about the casting of the feminine I've
not<00:04:24.500> been<00:04:24.620> approached

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.709 

we<00:04:31.889> didn't<00:04:32.580> favor<00:04:32.789> the<00:04:33.060> zip<00:04:33.240> line<00:04:33.419> point

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:33.719 
we didn't favor the zip line point

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:35.619 
we didn't favor the zip line point
whatever

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:35.629 
whatever

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:39.710 
whatever
so<00:04:36.629> I<00:04:36.660> think<00:04:37.289> that<00:04:37.560> it's<00:04:37.860> unfair<00:04:38.069> that<00:04:38.720> people

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
so I think that it's unfair that people

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.760 
so I think that it's unfair that people
have<00:04:39.930> made<00:04:40.470> assumptions<00:04:41.599> because<00:04:42.650> you<00:04:43.650> know<00:04:43.740> i

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
have made assumptions because you know i

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.520 
have made assumptions because you know i
mean<00:04:43.889> my<00:04:44.430> relationship<00:04:45.210> with<00:04:45.240> salman<00:04:45.629> is<00:04:45.930> a

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
mean my relationship with salman is a

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.129 
mean my relationship with salman is a
lot<00:04:47.310> more<00:04:47.340> meaningful<00:04:47.940> than<00:04:47.970> then<00:04:48.659> you<00:04:48.990> know

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
lot more meaningful than then you know

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.080 
lot more meaningful than then you know
then<00:04:49.949> that<00:04:50.129> dies<00:04:50.400> in<00:04:50.550> four<00:04:50.699> people<00:04:50.789> just<00:04:51.030> make

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
then that dies in four people just make

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.730 
then that dies in four people just make
assumptions<00:04:51.659> on<00:04:51.870> what<00:04:52.169> they're<00:04:52.349> physically

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
assumptions on what they're physically

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.990 
assumptions on what they're physically
not<00:04:52.889> seeing<00:04:53.159> and<00:04:53.370> what<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.669> media<00:04:53.819> is<00:04:53.940> not

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
not seeing and what the media is not

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.689 
not seeing and what the media is not
