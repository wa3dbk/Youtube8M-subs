hey YouTube adopted mic here and today I

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.940 
hey YouTube adopted mic here and today I
am<00:00:05.430> going<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:06.000> look<00:00:06.270> at<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.810> power<00:00:07.170> color

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
am going to look at this power color

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.950 
am going to look at this power color
power<00:00:08.580> jack<00:00:11.599> interesting<00:00:13.730> boxart<00:00:14.730> here<00:00:15.210> but

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
power jack interesting boxart here but

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.939 
power jack interesting boxart here but
basically<00:00:16.410> if<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.369> get<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.730> jest<00:00:18.090> it's

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
basically if you get the jest it's

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.590 
basically if you get the jest it's
standing<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> bottom<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.820> case<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
standing on the bottom of a case and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.210 
standing on the bottom of a case and
it's<00:00:22.080> holding<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.550> video<00:00:24.510> card<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.289> help

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
it's holding up a video card to help

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.330 
it's holding up a video card to help
with<00:00:26.550> sagging<00:00:27.349> you<00:00:28.349> know<00:00:28.439> when<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.189> your

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
with sagging you know when I have your

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.069 
with sagging you know when I have your
video<00:00:29.609> card<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:31.219> vertically<00:00:32.219> mounted

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
video card in a vertically mounted

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
video card in a vertically mounted
motherboard<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:35.040> yeah<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.670> anyway<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.940> mean

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
motherboard so yeah so anyway I mean

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.520 
motherboard so yeah so anyway I mean
most<00:00:36.420> people<00:00:36.510> probably<00:00:36.870> see<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> end

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
most people probably see it at the end

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.889 
most people probably see it at the end
of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.680> video<00:00:37.920> card<00:00:38.160> starts<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.579> sag<00:00:38.820> down

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
of the video card starts to sag down

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.380 
of the video card starts to sag down
this<00:00:39.899> guy<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.550> help<00:00:41.820> hold<00:00:42.090> it

up so you I wish he'd kind of look like

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.660 
up so you I wish he'd kind of look like
that<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:46.800> inside<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.520> go

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that as we get inside there we go

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.549 
that as we get inside there we go
there's<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.450> good<00:00:50.840> description<00:00:51.840> there<00:00:52.350> or

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
there's a good description there or

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.260 
there's a good description there or
rather<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.860> picture<00:00:53.309> there<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
rather a picture there of it how it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.889 
rather a picture there of it how it
works

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
works

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.920 
works
and<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.860> pretty<00:00:56.190> much<00:00:56.690> adjustable<00:00:57.690> there

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and it's pretty much adjustable there

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.029 
and it's pretty much adjustable there
from<00:00:58.579> 61<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.300> quarter<00:01:00.629> millimeter<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.289> 150

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
from 61 and a quarter millimeter to 150

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.960 
from 61 and a quarter millimeter to 150
millimeter<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:03.510> adjusts<00:01:04.080> all<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> way<00:01:04.970> in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
millimeter it adjusts all the way in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:14.719 
millimeter it adjusts all the way in
between<00:01:06.479> those<00:01:06.720> two<00:01:07.049> numbers<00:01:10.729> okay<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:13.700> take<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
between those two numbers okay so take a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.630 
between those two numbers okay so take a
look<00:01:15.150> here

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.580 

in<00:01:18.000> out-of-the-box<00:01:19.940> we've<00:01:20.940> got<00:01:21.210> an

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
in out-of-the-box we've got an

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.490 
in out-of-the-box we've got an
installation<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:23.220> instruction<00:01:23.850> manual<00:01:24.500> but

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
installation or instruction manual but

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100 
installation or instruction manual but
I'll<00:01:25.650> give<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.980> guys<00:01:26.300> just<00:01:27.300> of<00:01:27.510> how<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:27.810> works

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
I'll give you guys just of how it works

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.600 
I'll give you guys just of how it works
and<00:01:29.000> also<00:01:30.000> I'll<00:01:30.480> show<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.490> my

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
and also I'll show it in one of my

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.340 
and also I'll show it in one of my
system<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:34.050> basically<00:01:35.060> not<00:01:36.060> much<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:37.260> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
system but basically not much to the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.920 
system but basically not much to the
packaging<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.160> mean<00:01:38.970> we're<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:39.390> much<00:01:39.660> in<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
packaging I mean we're not much in the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.660 
packaging I mean we're not much in the
packaging<00:01:40.410> other<00:01:40.560> than<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.750> see<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.050> not

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
packaging other than this see it's not

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.130 
packaging other than this see it's not
kind<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.820> waste<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.210> packaging<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:45.990> this

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
kind of a waste of packaging for this

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.240 
kind of a waste of packaging for this
but<00:01:47.150> anyway<00:01:48.150> here's<00:01:48.870> how<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.260> works<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.800> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
but anyway here's how it works so this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.740 
but anyway here's how it works so this
is<00:01:50.490> how<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.729> comes<00:01:50.910> and<00:01:51.360> when<00:01:52.080> it's<00:01:52.290> completely

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
is how it comes and when it's completely

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.290 
is how it comes and when it's completely
closed<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.680> bottom<00:01:56.100> piece<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.840> should

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
closed so this bottom piece here should

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.660 
closed so this bottom piece here should
there<00:02:00.300> we<00:02:00.390> go<00:02:00.540> separate<00:02:01.110> okay<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.460> an

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
there we go separate okay this is an

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.240 
there we go separate okay this is an
optional<00:02:03.270> piece<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.710> needs<00:02:04.979> if

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
optional piece here if it just needs if

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.690 
optional piece here if it just needs if
you<00:02:05.369> need<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:05.790> taller<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:07.520> look<00:02:08.520> this

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you need it to be taller and look this

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.800 
you need it to be taller and look this
is<00:02:08.940> where<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.600> will<00:02:11.150> actually<00:02:12.150> no<00:02:12.510> actually

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
is where it will actually no actually

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.290 
is where it will actually no actually
now<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.290> correct<00:02:13.680> myself<00:02:13.890> there<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.550> don't

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
now I correct myself there I don't

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.350 
now I correct myself there I don't
believe<00:02:16.340> this<00:02:17.340> bottom<00:02:17.820> piece<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.030> not

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
believe this bottom piece is not

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.650 
believe this bottom piece is not
optional<00:02:18.870> okay<00:02:19.230> there's<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.620> rubber<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:21.150> to

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
optional okay there's a rubber here to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.560 
optional okay there's a rubber here to
hold<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.989> at<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.170> bottom<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.739> case<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
hold it at the bottom of the case and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.250 
hold it at the bottom of the case and
then<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.959> can<00:02:25.230> loosen<00:02:25.470> these<00:02:25.920> screws<00:02:27.260> which

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
then you can loosen these screws which

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.420 
then you can loosen these screws which
allow<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:30.660> part<00:02:31.200> with<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> plunger<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.010> come

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
allow this part with the plunger to come

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.830 
allow this part with the plunger to come
out<00:02:32.780> another<00:02:33.780> inch<00:02:34.380> or<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.780> tighten<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
out another inch or so and tighten the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.630 
out another inch or so and tighten the
screws<00:02:37.140> back<00:02:37.380> down<00:02:37.650> again<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.190> then<00:02:38.340> you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
screws back down again and then you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.259 
screws back down again and then you
adjust<00:02:39.440> with<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:40.650> nut<00:02:41.040> here<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:42.120> can

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
adjust with this nut here and you can

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.750 
adjust with this nut here and you can
see<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.600> plunger<00:02:42.989> starts<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.590> rise<00:02:43.799> so

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
see the plunger starts to rise so

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.810 
see the plunger starts to rise so
basically<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.980> know<00:02:47.570> if<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.870> were<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.730> put<00:02:50.730> it

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
basically you know if you were to put it

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.650 
basically you know if you were to put it
down<00:02:51.000> there<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:52.470> length<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.420> can

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
down there that is the length you can

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.289 
down there that is the length you can
get<00:02:55.040> good<00:02:56.040> now<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.340> know<00:02:56.430> what<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.640> suppose<00:02:57.090> you

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
get good now you know what I suppose you

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.090 
get good now you know what I suppose you
probably<00:02:57.690> could<00:02:58.019> put<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.739> bottom<00:02:58.890> of

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
probably could put it on the bottom of

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.650 
probably could put it on the bottom of
your<00:02:59.160> case<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.850> just<00:03:00.239> doesn't<00:03:00.420> have

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
your case like this just doesn't have

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.960 
your case like this just doesn't have
that<00:03:00.799> rubber<00:03:01.799> piece<00:03:02.160> there<00:03:02.459> like<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.790> does

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
that rubber piece there like it does

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.270 
that rubber piece there like it does
here<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.480> help<00:03:03.720> secure<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.100> doesn't

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
here to help secure it so it doesn't

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.370 
here to help secure it so it doesn't
slide<00:03:05.670> but<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.420> don't<00:03:06.690> think<00:03:06.810> you'd<00:03:07.019> want<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.260> be

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
slide but I don't think you'd want to be

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.500 
slide but I don't think you'd want to be
moving<00:03:07.739> your<00:03:07.860> case<00:03:08.100> with<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:08.970> installed

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
moving your case with this installed

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.780 
moving your case with this installed
anyway<00:03:09.930> because<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.320> imagine<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.100> would<00:03:11.250> pop

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
anyway because I imagine it would pop

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.110 
anyway because I imagine it would pop
out<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.720> anyway<00:03:13.019> let's<00:03:13.260> go<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.790> system<00:03:14.790> of

got a 580 and I installed a Zalman trip
double<00:03:48.030> fan<00:03:48.269> cooler<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.349> that's<00:03:49.470> in

one of my other videos but you can see

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.100 
one of my other videos but you can see
it's<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.920> it's<00:03:53.310> sags<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:54.209> sags<00:03:54.690> quite<00:03:55.080> a

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
it's it's it's sags that sags quite a

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.720 
it's it's it's sags that sags quite a
bit<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:56.760> know<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.269> just<00:03:58.160> don't<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.610> know

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
bit and you know it just don't you know

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.869 
bit and you know it just don't you know
I<00:03:59.760> don't<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:00.890> definitely<00:04:01.890> don't<00:04:02.580> care

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
I don't like it I definitely don't care

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.390 
I don't like it I definitely don't care
for<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.209> much<00:04:03.959> sagging<00:04:04.530> it's<00:04:04.799> hard<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.190> tell

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
for that much sagging it's hard to tell

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.750 
for that much sagging it's hard to tell
in<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.730> video<00:04:05.849> but<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:07.170> does<00:04:07.440> drop<00:04:07.890> down<00:04:08.310> I

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
in the video but it does drop down I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.180 
in the video but it does drop down I
don't<00:04:09.120> know<00:04:09.450> maybe<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:10.140> half<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.709> centimeter

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
don't know maybe a half of a centimeter

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.000 
don't know maybe a half of a centimeter
or<00:04:11.459> something<00:04:11.849> and<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.750> just<00:04:13.079> yeah<00:04:13.829> just

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
or something and it just yeah just

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.090 
or something and it just yeah just
pisses<00:04:14.489> me<00:04:14.519> off<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:15.200> anyway<00:04:16.200> this<00:04:16.410> power<00:04:16.739> jack

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
pisses me off so anyway this power jack

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.090 
pisses me off so anyway this power jack
I<00:04:17.370> put<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.090> it's<00:04:18.389> there's<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.680> bottom<00:04:19.979> of

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
I put and it's there's to the bottom of

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.870 
I put and it's there's to the bottom of
the<00:04:20.190> case<00:04:20.430> and<00:04:21.320> but<00:04:22.320> it<00:04:22.500> doesn't<00:04:22.860> make<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.550> to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
the case and but it doesn't make it to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.060 
the case and but it doesn't make it to
the<00:04:23.910> video<00:04:24.180> card<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.260> kind<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.530> pisses<00:04:25.770> me

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
the video card so that kind of pisses me

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.830 
the video card so that kind of pisses me
off<00:04:26.100> so<00:04:26.520> in<00:04:26.850> a<00:04:27.560> larger<00:04:28.560> ATX<00:04:29.460> case<00:04:30.210> like<00:04:30.570> this

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
off so in a larger ATX case like this

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.250 
off so in a larger ATX case like this
one<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:32.190> may<00:04:32.460> not<00:04:32.700> make<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.479> so<00:04:33.900> what<00:04:34.050> I'm<00:04:34.169> gonna

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
one it may not make it so what I'm gonna

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.070 
one it may not make it so what I'm gonna
have<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.680> do<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.940> might<00:04:36.180> find<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:36.840> some

rubber feet or something - at a hardware

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.890 
rubber feet or something - at a hardware
store<00:04:40.530> -<00:04:41.039> bump<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.729> up<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:41.970> little<00:04:42.120> bit<00:04:42.419> because

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.980 
I really I mean I need to gain
definitely<00:04:47.789> more<00:04:48.210> than<00:04:49.100> my<00:04:50.240> fingertip<00:04:51.240> yeah<00:04:51.960> I

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
definitely more than my fingertip yeah I

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.110 
definitely more than my fingertip yeah I
mean<00:04:52.410> when<00:04:52.950> I<00:04:52.979> put<00:04:53.220> my<00:04:53.340> finger<00:04:53.760> in<00:04:53.880> there

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
mean when I put my finger in there

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.170 
mean when I put my finger in there
that's<00:04:54.510> about<00:04:54.930> that's<00:04:55.830> about<00:04:56.010> where<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.880> would

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
that's about that's about where I would

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.600 
that's about that's about where I would
like<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.570> be<00:04:57.780> so<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.500> need<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.830> gain<00:04:59.039> you<00:04:59.460> know

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
like to be so I need to gain you know

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.080 
like to be so I need to gain you know
about<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:01.139> much<00:05:01.440> there<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:02.100> I'm<00:05:02.700> gonna<00:05:02.850> play

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
about that much there so I'm gonna play

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.760 
about that much there so I'm gonna play
around<00:05:03.330> with<00:05:03.479> it<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.720> little<00:05:03.870> bit<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.289> then<00:05:04.740> I

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
around with it a little bit and then I

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.029 
around with it a little bit and then I
will<00:05:05.310> come<00:05:05.729> back<00:05:05.970> after<00:05:06.389> I<00:05:06.960> figure<00:05:07.650> out<00:05:07.710> how

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
will come back after I figure out how

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.510 
will come back after I figure out how
the<00:05:08.100> hell<00:05:08.340> I'm<00:05:08.370> gonna<00:05:08.580> do<00:05:08.789> this<00:05:09.000> all<00:05:10.010> right<00:05:11.010> so

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
the hell I'm gonna do this all right so

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.529 
the hell I'm gonna do this all right so
anyway<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.560> popped<00:05:13.560> in<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:14.160> couple<00:05:14.550> of<00:05:14.729> like<00:05:15.030> case

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
anyway I popped in a couple of like case

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.159 
anyway I popped in a couple of like case
feet<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.169> put<00:05:16.200> one<00:05:16.710> down<00:05:17.160> here<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:17.940> then<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:18.750> also

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
feet I put one down here and then I also

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.089 
feet I put one down here and then I also
put<00:05:19.440> one<00:05:20.010> up<00:05:20.729> top<00:05:21.450> there<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.169> that<00:05:22.740> got<00:05:23.070> me

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
put one up top there and that got me

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.230 
put one up top there and that got me
right<00:05:23.910> at<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.419> level<00:05:24.720> that<00:05:25.320> I<00:05:25.380> wanted<00:05:26.099> I<00:05:26.340> might

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
right at the level that I wanted I might

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.200 
right at the level that I wanted I might
mess<00:05:27.599> with<00:05:27.780> it<00:05:27.930> just<00:05:28.200> a<00:05:28.349> hair<00:05:28.380> because<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:29.580> do

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
mess with it just a hair because I do

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.260 
mess with it just a hair because I do
notice<00:05:30.900> now<00:05:31.169> the<00:05:31.560> card<00:05:32.220> is<00:05:32.520> level<00:05:32.940> but<00:05:33.150> the

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
notice now the card is level but the

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.460 
notice now the card is level but the
heatsink<00:05:33.960> is<00:05:34.289> definitely<00:05:35.389> getting<00:05:36.389> closer<00:05:36.750> to

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
heatsink is definitely getting closer to

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.100 
heatsink is definitely getting closer to
the<00:05:37.650> PCB<00:05:38.190> on<00:05:38.639> this<00:05:38.940> side<00:05:39.240> not<00:05:39.539> that<00:05:39.780> that's<00:05:39.930> a

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
the PCB on this side not that that's a

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.250 
the PCB on this side not that that's a
horrible<00:05:40.470> thing<00:05:40.729> but<00:05:41.729> I<00:05:41.940> might<00:05:42.210> just<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:43.289> know

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
horrible thing but I might just you know

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.780 
horrible thing but I might just you know
Oh<00:05:44.290> down<00:05:44.590> a<00:05:44.620> hair<00:05:45.040> here<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:46.950> drop<00:05:47.950> there<00:05:48.370> we<00:05:48.580> go

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
Oh down a hair here and drop there we go

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.480 
Oh down a hair here and drop there we go
yeah<00:05:49.090> that<00:05:49.140> heatsink<00:05:50.140> yes<00:05:50.440> just<00:05:50.890> a<00:05:51.040> little<00:05:51.310> bit

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
yeah that heatsink yes just a little bit

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.180 
yeah that heatsink yes just a little bit
and<00:05:51.790> there<00:05:52.210> we<00:05:52.240> go<00:05:52.570> yeah<00:05:52.870> so<00:05:53.110> now<00:05:53.320> I<00:05:53.620> feel

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
and there we go yeah so now I feel

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.270 
and there we go yeah so now I feel
really<00:05:54.430> comfortable<00:05:54.760> with<00:05:55.630> the<00:05:55.950> yeah<00:05:56.950> I<00:05:56.980> feel

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
really comfortable with the yeah I feel

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.070 
really comfortable with the yeah I feel
really<00:05:57.460> comfortable<00:05:57.700> with<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.240> level<00:05:58.570> that

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
really comfortable with the level that

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.310 
really comfortable with the level that
that<00:05:59.740> is<00:06:00.070> so<00:06:00.970> yeah<00:06:01.120> pretty<00:06:01.480> cool<00:06:01.750> product

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
that is so yeah pretty cool product

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.980 
that is so yeah pretty cool product
although<00:06:02.590> like<00:06:03.520> I<00:06:03.640> mentioned<00:06:04.060> earlier<00:06:04.360> as

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
although like I mentioned earlier as

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.480 
although like I mentioned earlier as
soon<00:06:05.290> as<00:06:05.440> I<00:06:05.590> moved<00:06:06.370> this<00:06:06.730> case<00:06:08.010> that<00:06:09.010> thing<00:06:09.340> is

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
soon as I moved this case that thing is

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.020 
soon as I moved this case that thing is
gone<00:06:09.790> I<00:06:10.120> could<00:06:10.870> try<00:06:11.140> some<00:06:11.410> glue<00:06:11.770> and<00:06:12.100> glue<00:06:12.850> it

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
gone I could try some glue and glue it

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.760 
gone I could try some glue and glue it
down<00:06:13.270> here<00:06:13.840> and<00:06:14.050> that's<00:06:14.200> probably<00:06:14.500> what<00:06:14.740> I

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
down here and that's probably what I

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.130 
down here and that's probably what I
will<00:06:15.040> do<00:06:15.340> but<00:06:16.120> I<00:06:16.180> definitely<00:06:16.720> am<00:06:16.780> NOT<00:06:16.930> going<00:06:17.110> to

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
will do but I definitely am NOT going to

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.310 
will do but I definitely am NOT going to
glue<00:06:17.380> it<00:06:17.560> to<00:06:17.920> the<00:06:18.070> video<00:06:18.340> card<00:06:18.640> so<00:06:19.150> but<00:06:19.930> I<00:06:20.140> guess

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
glue it to the video card so but I guess

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.920 
glue it to the video card so but I guess
if<00:06:20.470> I<00:06:20.590> glued<00:06:21.160> it<00:06:21.280> down<00:06:21.460> here<00:06:21.820> or<00:06:22.060> attached<00:06:22.660> it

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
if I glued it down here or attached it

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.680 
if I glued it down here or attached it
somehow<00:06:23.230> then<00:06:24.160> at<00:06:24.400> least<00:06:24.550> you<00:06:25.270> know<00:06:25.390> it

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
somehow then at least you know it

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.840 
somehow then at least you know it
wouldn't<00:06:26.200> move<00:06:26.380> here<00:06:26.740> so<00:06:26.950> it<00:06:27.190> probably<00:06:27.490> would

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
wouldn't move here so it probably would

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.850 
wouldn't move here so it probably would
handle<00:06:28.150> the<00:06:28.300> transit<00:06:28.750> okay<00:06:29.110> at<00:06:29.290> that<00:06:29.350> point

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
handle the transit okay at that point

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.040 
handle the transit okay at that point
but<00:06:30.520> I<00:06:30.760> definitely<00:06:30.970> wouldn't<00:06:31.390> take<00:06:31.690> it<00:06:31.720> down

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
but I definitely wouldn't take it down

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.020 
but I definitely wouldn't take it down
you<00:06:32.500> know<00:06:32.530> a<00:06:32.620> bumpy<00:06:33.100> road<00:06:33.280> or<00:06:33.490> anything<00:06:33.550> like

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
you know a bumpy road or anything like

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.480 
you know a bumpy road or anything like
that<00:06:34.090> I<00:06:34.270> wouldn't<00:06:34.600> move<00:06:34.780> it<00:06:34.930> too<00:06:35.140> far<00:06:35.470> so<00:06:36.310> yeah

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
that I wouldn't move it too far so yeah

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.240 
that I wouldn't move it too far so yeah
that<00:06:36.730> wraps<00:06:36.970> up<00:06:37.270> my<00:06:37.840> unboxing<00:06:38.650> and<00:06:38.890> quick

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
that wraps up my unboxing and quick

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.100 
that wraps up my unboxing and quick
little<00:06:39.940> test<00:06:40.210> of<00:06:40.600> the<00:06:41.050> power<00:06:41.740> jack<00:06:42.310> and<00:06:43.110> yeah

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
little test of the power jack and yeah

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.990 
little test of the power jack and yeah
hopefully<00:06:44.440> like<00:06:44.680> the<00:06:44.800> video<00:06:45.070> and<00:06:45.370> as<00:06:45.790> always

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
hopefully like the video and as always

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.440 
hopefully like the video and as always
thank<00:06:46.780> you<00:06:46.900> for<00:06:47.080> watching
