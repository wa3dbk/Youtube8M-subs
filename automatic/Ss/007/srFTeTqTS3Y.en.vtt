00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
quick run on this the Rojas sandwich

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.890 
quick run on this the Rojas sandwich
truck<00:00:27.060> while<00:00:27.390> there's<00:00:27.599> still<00:00:27.660> some<00:00:27.930> light<00:00:28.140> out

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
truck while there's still some light out

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.780 
truck while there's still some light out
ended<00:00:30.900> up<00:00:31.019> cutting<00:00:31.170> away<00:00:31.410> some<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> metal

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
ended up cutting away some of the metal

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.229 
ended up cutting away some of the metal
here<00:00:33.180> because<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> was<00:00:33.719> interfering<00:00:35.059> it<00:00:36.059> was

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
here because it was interfering it was

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.790 
here because it was interfering it was
just<00:00:36.450> barely<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.989> touching<00:00:37.410> when<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.590> stood

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
just barely not touching when you stood

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.000 
just barely not touching when you stood
on<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.850> when<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> went<00:00:39.390> over<00:00:39.540> bumps<00:00:40.010> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
on it and when the I went over bumps it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.560 
on it and when the I went over bumps it
would<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:41.489> he<00:00:41.730> would<00:00:41.879> bump<00:00:42.120> around<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
would it which he would bump around a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.049 
would it which he would bump around a
little<00:00:42.629> bit<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.899> touch<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.469> little<00:00:44.160> loud<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
little bit in touch a little loud and it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.639 
little bit in touch a little loud and it
was<00:00:45.149> me<00:00:45.300> me<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.629> wasn't<00:00:45.780> me<00:00:46.050> making<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.559> as

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
was me me it wasn't me making it as

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.020 
was me me it wasn't me making it as
smooth<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.180> is<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.629> could<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:49.219> sad<00:00:53.030> way

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
smooth as it is it could have sad way

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.990 
smooth as it is it could have sad way
and<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:55.100> sounds<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.160> good<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.579> drop<00:00:56.789> test

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and it sounds really good the drop test

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.340 
and it sounds really good the drop test
is<00:00:57.180> good

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
is good

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.710 
is good
so<00:00:58.920> here<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.340> go<00:00:59.460> okay<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.820> I've<00:01:02.820> only<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.630> up

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
so here we go okay so I've only going up

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.469 
so here we go okay so I've only going up
a<00:01:03.809> few<00:01:04.019> blocks<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.670> I<00:01:05.670> should<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.240> brought<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
a few blocks and I should have brought a

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.500 
a few blocks and I should have brought a
wooden<00:01:06.720> breaker<00:01:06.979> but<00:01:08.210> I'll<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.360> how<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
wooden breaker but I'll see how this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:02:44.920 
wooden breaker but I'll see how this
goes

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.819 

it's<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:51.019> it's<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.049> lot<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.230> work<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.769> it

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
it's that it's a lot of work to get it

00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:00.020 
it's that it's a lot of work to get it
to<00:02:53.010> turn<00:02:55.250> more<00:02:56.250> heart<00:02:56.629> with<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:58.760> with<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.879> two

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
to turn more heart with the with the two

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.180 
to turn more heart with the with the two
bushings<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:00.540> there<00:03:00.829> it's<00:03:01.829> twice<00:03:02.159> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
bushings on there it's twice the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.649 
bushings on there it's twice the
resistance<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.909> the<00:03:03.000> normal<00:03:03.329> 70<00:03:04.290> na<00:03:04.790> Reds<00:03:05.790> and

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
resistance of the normal 70 na Reds and

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.479 
resistance of the normal 70 na Reds and
then<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:07.079> have<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.349> stand<00:03:07.590> way<00:03:07.860> on<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.190> front

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
then I have to stand way on the front

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.640 
then I have to stand way on the front
because<00:03:09.480> it's<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:09.810> much<00:03:09.989> more<00:03:10.170> resistant<00:03:10.620> to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
because it's so much more resistant to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.710 
because it's so much more resistant to
them<00:03:10.799> than<00:03:10.920> on<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.129> back<00:03:11.310> which<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.420> opie

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
them than on the back which is the opie

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.559 
them than on the back which is the opie
on<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.370> if<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.459> put<00:03:14.670> more<00:03:14.879> just<00:03:15.120> on<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.420> back

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
on it and if I put more just on the back

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.900 
on it and if I put more just on the back
to<00:03:15.720> make<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.959> more<00:03:16.049> even<00:03:16.459> then<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.489> end<00:03:17.700> up<00:03:17.760> just

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
to make it more even then I end up just

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.710 
to make it more even then I end up just
being<00:03:17.970> overheard<00:03:18.390> even<00:03:18.690> less<00:03:19.400> but<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.720> think

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
being overheard even less but I think

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.460 
being overheard even less but I think
it'll<00:03:21.870> be<00:03:21.989> great

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
it'll be great

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.339 
it'll be great
what's<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.519> uh<00:03:24.829> which<00:03:25.829> warms<00:03:26.190> up<00:03:27.290> it's<00:03:28.290> just

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
what's it uh which warms up it's just

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.440 
what's it uh which warms up it's just
still<00:03:28.620> pretty<00:03:28.799> cold<00:03:28.950> outside<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.670> was<00:03:30.299> gonna

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
still pretty cold outside I was gonna

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.599 
still pretty cold outside I was gonna
stick<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.810> from<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.049> fireplace<00:03:31.579> before<00:03:32.579> I

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
stick it from the fireplace before I

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.640 
stick it from the fireplace before I
headed<00:03:32.790> out<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.510> didn't<00:03:34.230> want<00:03:34.349> to<00:03:34.409> lose<00:03:34.500> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
headed out but I didn't want to lose the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.009 
headed out but I didn't want to lose the
light<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.040> waste<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.280> time<00:03:35.629> yeah<00:03:36.629> I<00:03:36.659> thought

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
light and waste the time yeah I thought

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.270 
light and waste the time yeah I thought
it<00:03:37.140> was<00:03:37.489> pretty<00:03:38.489> fun<00:03:38.730> it's<00:03:38.940> definitely<00:03:40.280> really

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
it was pretty fun it's definitely really

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.309 
it was pretty fun it's definitely really
smooth<00:03:43.519> look<00:03:44.519> at<00:03:44.609> this<00:03:44.700> so<00:03:44.849> quick<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:46.650> has<00:03:46.919> more

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
smooth look at this so quick it has more

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.369 
smooth look at this so quick it has more
deflection<00:03:49.669> then<00:03:50.669> I<00:03:50.790> was<00:03:50.940> thinking<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.660> would

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:00.460 

push<00:03:55.379> on<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:58.400> straight<00:03:59.400> up<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.579> down

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
push on it straight up and down

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.920 
push on it straight up and down
yeah<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.650> can<00:04:01.769> see<00:04:01.919> the<00:04:02.040> axle<00:04:02.840> maybe<00:04:03.840> you

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
yeah you can see the axle maybe you

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.140 
yeah you can see the axle maybe you
can't<00:04:04.139> run<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.379> much<00:04:04.470> okay<00:04:04.889> let's<00:04:05.129> see<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.340> I

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
can't run so much okay let's see it I

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.330 
can't run so much okay let's see it I
had<00:04:06.449> both<00:04:06.629> hands<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.079> could<00:04:07.230> really<00:04:07.440> torque<00:04:08.190> it

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
had both hands I could really torque it

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.159 
had both hands I could really torque it
and<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:09.180> can<00:04:09.299> actually<00:04:09.419> travel<00:04:12.470> quite<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.530> lot

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
and it can actually travel quite a lot

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.420 
and it can actually travel quite a lot
quite<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.289> bit<00:04:16.470> more<00:04:16.590> than<00:04:16.769> any<00:04:16.919> other<00:04:17.070> truck<00:04:17.250> I

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
quite a bit more than any other truck I

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.539 
quite a bit more than any other truck I
think<00:04:17.459> I've<00:04:17.849> seen<00:04:18.090> but<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:18.959> takes<00:04:19.199> a<00:04:19.519> lot<00:04:20.519> of

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
think I've seen but it takes a lot of

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.180 
think I've seen but it takes a lot of
force<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:21.030> make<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.299> do<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.449> I<00:04:21.919> think<00:04:22.919> it<00:04:23.070> will

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
force to make it do it I think it will

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.830 
force to make it do it I think it will
still<00:04:23.870> behave<00:04:25.820> under<00:04:26.820> normal<00:04:27.030> circumstances

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
still behave under normal circumstances

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.370 
still behave under normal circumstances
like<00:04:28.590> it's<00:04:28.770> very<00:04:28.979> precise<00:04:29.340> but<00:04:30.330> if<00:04:30.599> it<00:04:31.169> hits

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
like it's very precise but if it hits

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.070 
like it's very precise but if it hits
something<00:04:31.680> or<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.699> curve<00:04:33.479> it<00:04:33.630> or<00:04:33.810> something

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
something or you curve it or something

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.040 
something or you curve it or something
it'll

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
it'll

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.709 
it'll
it'll<00:04:37.050> absorb<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:38.580> know<00:04:38.669> even<00:04:39.000> having<00:04:39.389> really

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
it'll absorb you know even having really

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.969 
it'll absorb you know even having really
strong<00:04:40.110> impacts<00:04:41.360> because<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.539> has<00:04:42.740> it<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:43.860> the

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
strong impacts because it has it is the

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.600 
strong impacts because it has it is the
ability<00:04:44.159> to<00:04:44.520> travel<00:04:45.710> but<00:04:46.710> we'll<00:04:47.189> have<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.370> wait

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
ability to travel but we'll have to wait

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.189 
ability to travel but we'll have to wait
till<00:04:47.759> I<00:04:47.849> can<00:04:48.000> push<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.210> little<00:04:48.330> bit<00:04:48.599> harder<00:04:48.659> to

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
till I can push a little bit harder to

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.890 
till I can push a little bit harder to
see<00:04:50.129> if<00:04:50.430> that's<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.909> case<00:04:51.090> or<00:04:51.419> not

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
see if that's the case or not

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.700 
see if that's the case or not
anyway<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:52.979> I<00:04:54.379> like<00:04:55.379> it

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
anyway I I like it

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.909 
anyway I I like it
I<00:04:55.740> guess<00:04:56.449> but<00:04:57.449> uh<00:04:57.509> we'll<00:04:58.139> keep<00:04:58.469> experimenting

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
I guess but uh we'll keep experimenting

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.999 
I guess but uh we'll keep experimenting
and<00:04:59.189> see<00:04:59.340> what<00:04:59.430> we<00:04:59.490> can<00:04:59.610> do<00:05:00.530> be<00:05:01.530> nice<00:05:01.680> to<00:05:01.860> get<00:05:01.949> a

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
and see what we can do be nice to get a

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.319 
and see what we can do be nice to get a
a<00:05:02.340> pair<00:05:02.939> of<00:05:03.060> them<00:05:03.319> going
