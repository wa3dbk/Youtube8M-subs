00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 that who lives in the daily life of the Lord 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.780
 you press know very well the weight 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.410
 more from that we had some 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.289
 to be made so that these 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.810
 possibility situations because people 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 had a slightly better condition 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.050
 we set up a team is within our 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.400
 possibilities that are shining is 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.619
 fighting until today 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.279
 but it is clear and evident the lack and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.170
 needs as a team and this comes 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.559
 being asked on my part is there any 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.899
 time in all these situations 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.180
 we say that the financial situation 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.829
 I got it but unfortunately it did not 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.140
 happened and I specifically say 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.899
 a team that creates many possibilities 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.370
 goal and can not make the people and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.640
 this did not happen in today's game 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.859
 happened and many opportunities where 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.170
 we just identified the party 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.489
 will indicate a good result due to 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.110
 these situations 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.479
 came a moment of competition that 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.580
 You need to have a quality 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.560
 more work and face the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.290
 opponents but there are situations that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.880
 to link but this was not done the day 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.030
 Board has several days 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.040
 in fact they have many many players 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.610
 players were placed 1 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.460
 it was to modify the other had a type of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.619
 problem was not golf but everything inside 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.610
 of Parana possibilities and it does not 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.570
 It happened 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.720
 Unfortunately then I come here. 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.400
 You how I want the best to give 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.060
 better at this moment the bastard is the 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.790
 output 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.520
 so I wanted to thank all is 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.200
 Unfortunately I did what I could. 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:55.729
 I leave sad because it was aimed at 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.740
 try to restructure and improve 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.180
 position to act within the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.920
 possibilities we had 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.290
 we got that it's daily hard work 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.509
 wear and tear and finally a 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.940
 series of situations that wear out more 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.170
 How do I want the best for nadal? 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.970
 And as I see it, province is with 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.160
 this situation without me these 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.890
 possibilities and priorities for 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.080
 offensive example that we had to 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.530
 having is a time that we do not see 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:32.030
 unfortunately the profile or açaí banana and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.340
 here and there that the mode 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.840
 provider can open and can 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.310
 continuity of work 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.850
 I wanted to thank the supporter who 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.910
 believed mec to thank the fans 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.940

 direction but they did not heed me not 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.170
 were started answer the door I ask 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.850

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.750
 communicate them 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.750
