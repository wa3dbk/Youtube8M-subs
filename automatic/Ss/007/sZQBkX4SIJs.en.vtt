is<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.640> where<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.850> flag<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:54.360> ride<00:00:54.510> up

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
is the one where the flag will ride up

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.020 
is the one where the flag will ride up
and<00:00:54.840> down<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:56.100> flag<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:56.879> will

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and down in and that flag is what will

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.810 
and down in and that flag is what will

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
the post the rod for the hi-hat symbol

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.440 
the post the rod for the hi-hat symbol
so<00:02:29.260> we<00:02:30.260> take<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.709> set<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.459> down<00:02:31.489> over<00:02:32.150> a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
so we take this set it down over a

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.900 
so we take this set it down over a
hi-hat<00:02:33.170> we<00:02:33.350> see<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.709> nice<00:02:33.910> comfortable

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
hi-hat we see it's a nice comfortable

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.320 
hi-hat we see it's a nice comfortable
easy<00:02:35.180> fit<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:36.140> drops<00:02:36.470> over<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.920> spring<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.549> we

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
easy fit it drops over the spring and we

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.309 
easy fit it drops over the spring and we
align<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:39.049> flag<00:02:39.350> into<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.860> groove<00:02:40.100> as<00:02:41.319> the

align the flag into the groove as the

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.559 
align the flag into the groove as the
hi-hat<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.769> closed<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.519> will<00:02:43.670> push<00:02:43.880> down<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
hi-hat is closed it will push down the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.130 
hi-hat is closed it will push down the
spring<00:02:44.900> pushes<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.470> up<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:46.489> illustrate<00:02:46.910> that

spring pushes it up to illustrate that
we<00:02:48.140> install<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.680> hi-hat<00:02:49.549> symbol<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.239> this

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
we install the hi-hat symbol in this

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.690 
we install the hi-hat symbol in this
case<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.819> higher<00:02:52.819> quality<00:02:53.480> Acme<00:02:54.109> symbol<00:02:54.700> with

the hi-hat clutch and now with that
attention<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.690> we<00:02:59.780> step<00:03:00.049> on<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.290> pedal<00:03:00.829> we

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
attention on and we step on the pedal we

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.229 
attention on and we step on the pedal we
see<00:03:01.579> the<00:03:01.670> flag<00:03:01.880> going<00:03:02.180> up<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.750> down<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:04.239> this

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
see the flag going up and down and this

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.530 
see the flag going up and down and this
is<00:03:05.390> inside<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.989> hi-hat<00:03:06.470> assembly<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:08.269> light
