of<00:04:01.940> tight<00:04:02.150> trees<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.720> get<00:04:02.870> through<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:03.710> I<00:04:03.740> took

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
of tight trees to get through so I took

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.490 
of tight trees to get through so I took
it<00:04:04.130> really<00:04:04.520> slow<00:04:05.180> they<00:04:05.780> didn't<00:04:06.050> want<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.320> patch

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
it really slow they didn't want to patch

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.950 
it really slow they didn't want to patch
the<00:04:06.740> side<00:04:06.980> of<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.220> record<00:04:07.460> or<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.180> buggy<00:04:08.360> into

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
the side of the record or the buggy into

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.670 
the side of the record or the buggy into
a<00:04:08.990> tree<00:04:10.330> but<00:04:11.330> when<00:04:11.840> we<00:04:11.990> got<00:04:12.170> close<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.500> the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
a tree but when we got close to the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.950 
a tree but when we got close to the
bottom<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.430> buggy<00:04:13.700> had<00:04:13.970> started<00:04:14.420> sliding<00:04:14.660> off

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
bottom the buggy had started sliding off

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.320 
bottom the buggy had started sliding off
of<00:04:14.990> the<00:04:15.290> sling<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.650> we<00:04:19.580> had<00:04:19.760> what<00:04:20.000> looked<00:04:20.239> like

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
of the sling and we had what looked like

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.570 
of the sling and we had what looked like
to<00:04:20.660> be<00:04:20.840> pretty<00:04:21.410> steep<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:22.010> tough<00:04:22.250> climb

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
to be pretty steep and tough climb

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.820 
to be pretty steep and tough climb
coming<00:04:22.970> up<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:23.930> thought<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.290> would<00:04:24.410> be<00:04:24.590> best

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
coming up so I thought it would be best

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.730 
coming up so I thought it would be best
to<00:04:24.950> stop<00:04:25.280> unhook<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.450> buggy<00:04:26.710> recenter<00:04:27.710> the

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
to stop unhook the buggy recenter the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.490 
to stop unhook the buggy recenter the
wrecker<00:04:28.070> before<00:04:28.850> we<00:04:28.970> made<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.180> climb<00:04:32.500> of

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
wrecker before we made the climb of

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.800 
wrecker before we made the climb of
course<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.100> problem<00:04:34.580> was<00:04:34.730> stopping<00:04:35.270> right<00:04:35.660> at

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
course the problem was stopping right at

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.610 
course the problem was stopping right at
the<00:04:35.900> bottom<00:04:36.230> of<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.440> hill<00:04:36.650> in<00:04:36.920> mud<00:04:37.760> is<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:39.440> we

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
the bottom of the hill in mud is that we

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.010 
the bottom of the hill in mud is that we
lose<00:04:39.830> all<00:04:40.130> our<00:04:40.160> momentum<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.690> now<00:04:41.840> we're

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
lose all our momentum and now we're

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.960 
lose all our momentum and now we're
going<00:04:42.170> to<00:04:42.230> have<00:04:42.410> to<00:04:42.560> make<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.890> climb<00:04:43.160> on<00:04:43.460> just

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
going to have to make the climb on just

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.860 
going to have to make the climb on just
motor<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.480> traction<00:04:44.750> alone<00:04:46.240> but<00:04:47.240> believe<00:04:47.840> me

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
motor and traction alone but believe me

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.950 
motor and traction alone but believe me
when<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.680> tell<00:04:48.950> you<00:04:49.130> if<00:04:49.700> one<00:04:50.000> falls<00:04:50.330> off<00:04:50.600> in<00:04:50.870> the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
when I tell you if one falls off in the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.990 
when I tell you if one falls off in the
middle<00:04:51.170> of<00:04:51.410> a<00:04:51.500> climb<00:04:51.740> like<00:04:51.980> this<00:04:52.250> that's<00:04:52.760> a

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
middle of a climb like this that's a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.080 
middle of a climb like this that's a
much<00:04:53.360> bigger<00:04:53.780> problem

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
much bigger problem

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.909 
much bigger problem
besides<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.330> we<00:04:56.900> got<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.110> new<00:04:57.290> motor<00:04:57.560> in<00:04:57.800> the

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
besides that we got a new motor in the

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.710 
besides that we got a new motor in the
record<00:04:58.310> that<00:04:58.340> we<00:04:58.580> need<00:04:58.790> to<00:04:58.940> give<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.150> good<00:04:59.390> test

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
record that we need to give a good test

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.920 
record that we need to give a good test
to<00:04:59.930> right

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:37.580 

okay<00:05:06.930> here<00:05:07.470> we<00:05:07.800> go

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.920 

well<00:05:38.590> plenty<00:05:39.130> of<00:05:39.340> molder<00:05:39.640> just<00:05:40.360> not<00:05:40.630> quite

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
well plenty of molder just not quite

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.400 
well plenty of molder just not quite
enough<00:05:40.990> traction<00:05:42.360> right<00:05:43.360> at<00:05:43.540> the<00:05:43.660> top<00:05:43.900> it<00:05:44.230> was

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
enough traction right at the top it was

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.220 
enough traction right at the top it was
a<00:05:44.440> hole<00:05:44.770> with<00:05:45.490> a<00:05:45.520> steep<00:05:45.850> crest<00:05:46.210> that<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.990> duals

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
a hole with a steep crest that the duals

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.880 
a hole with a steep crest that the duals
got<00:05:47.530> caught<00:05:47.830> in<00:05:48.990> now<00:05:49.990> what<00:05:50.290> do<00:05:50.380> we<00:05:50.500> do

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
got caught in now what do we do

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.400 
got caught in now what do we do
well<00:05:51.340> backing<00:05:52.090> down<00:05:52.240> a<00:05:52.300> hill<00:05:52.480> like<00:05:52.690> this<00:05:53.140> with

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
well backing down a hill like this with

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.590 
well backing down a hill like this with
one<00:05:53.620> on<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.770> hook<00:05:54.010> is<00:05:54.550> not<00:05:54.880> a<00:05:54.910> desirable

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
one on the hook is not a desirable

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.530 
one on the hook is not a desirable
option<00:05:56.320> and<00:05:56.860> with<00:05:57.220> nobody<00:05:57.430> directly<00:05:58.180> in<00:05:58.270> front

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
option and with nobody directly in front

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.690 
option and with nobody directly in front
of<00:05:58.630> us<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:59.020> give<00:05:59.200> us<00:05:59.320> a<00:05:59.440> tiny<00:05:59.680> tug<00:06:00.010> up<00:06:00.280> over<00:06:00.610> the

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
of us to give us a tiny tug up over the

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.180 
of us to give us a tiny tug up over the
crest<00:06:00.970> we<00:06:01.900> figured<00:06:02.290> firing<00:06:02.680> up<00:06:02.800> the<00:06:02.950> buggy

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
crest we figured firing up the buggy

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.490 
crest we figured firing up the buggy
giving<00:06:03.940> a<00:06:04.000> little<00:06:04.180> push<00:06:04.510> might<00:06:05.020> be<00:06:05.200> our<00:06:05.320> best

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
giving a little push might be our best

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:18.060 
giving a little push might be our best
option

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.710 

and<00:06:19.070> that's<00:06:19.340> all<00:06:19.580> it<00:06:19.760> took<00:06:20.000> just<00:06:20.300> a<00:06:20.480> tiny

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
and that's all it took just a tiny

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
and that's all it took just a tiny
little<00:06:21.050> bump<00:06:22.660> now<00:06:23.660> that<00:06:23.870> we<00:06:23.990> were<00:06:24.140> up<00:06:24.290> over<00:06:24.590> the

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
little bump now that we were up over the

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.500 
little bump now that we were up over the
top<00:06:24.920> of<00:06:24.980> the<00:06:25.160> hill<00:06:25.400> the<00:06:25.940> only<00:06:26.150> thing<00:06:26.300> that<00:06:26.450> we

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
top of the hill the only thing that we

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.660 
top of the hill the only thing that we
had<00:06:26.690> to<00:06:26.840> deal<00:06:27.050> with<00:06:27.080> on<00:06:27.500> the<00:06:27.590> trail<00:06:27.830> were<00:06:28.430> some

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
had to deal with on the trail were some

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.810 
had to deal with on the trail were some
tight<00:06:28.850> trees<00:06:29.150> corners<00:06:30.080> and<00:06:30.320> a<00:06:31.100> few<00:06:31.640> mud

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
tight trees corners and a few mud

tight trees corners and a few mud
puddles

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.740 

not<00:06:54.729> too<00:06:54.970> much<00:06:55.180> farther<00:06:55.449> now<00:06:55.840> ah<00:06:57.449> there<00:06:58.449> it<00:06:58.600> is
