00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.890

 charge cuqui this enamel 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.610
 once better 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:07.080
 well it 's part of a chinita that is that 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:12.090
 I love it reminds me a lot of angles 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.150
 no dolls out there in the end of 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.090
 agenda system as it is called but good 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.220
 it's super pretty it's pretty teeny it's not 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.860
 It is a very large enamel but good 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.420
 he did many thanks 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.930
 this is tone 34 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.930
 Y 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.220
 a stateless 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.080
 all right 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.020
 good has 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.049
 little pieces in white pink turquoise 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.420
 and for above the nail it remains 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.100
 pretty funny I think its price is 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.100
 of one euro I think I remember 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.350
 but as I said it will appear for some 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.260
 side of the screen so you can see it and 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.260
 all the things that I bought were these 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.980
 slopes 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.690
 of hearts in gold 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.520
 I liked them a lot and I could not 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.950
 resist I think it cost me seventy and 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.670
 so many five cents and we got a 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.280
 euro and the truth that they are very beautiful are 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.950
 my originals and now as long as 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.620
 and so on 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.049
 I decided to say buy them 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.879
 and the thing that I have said that has 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:38.049
 many years of buying is this 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:41.200
 disc remover and make-up remover 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:44.050
 good is vintage type is is like a 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.800
 butterfly has the talk of a butterfly 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.440
 you do not see 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.390
 and good 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.550
 is another wood opens up poke at 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.550
 cottons and here has an opening 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.310
 that's already where you get the cotton 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.590
 and 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.530
 play in white and the black of its price 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.440
 of one euro and a little more than one euro and 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.660
 wines are perfectly going to have in your 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.540
 little box and I bought it in white 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.510
 because I saw it more transparent the more 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.280
 beautiful is black is very beautiful too and 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.730
 to always have the cottons to the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.910
 hand and not have to be good 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.050
 other plastic and also that decorates the 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.150
 army of the cops loved it 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.040
 and all the things that we have so many 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.090
 eager to try because there has been very 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.300
 good criticism of them were these the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.720
 fixed of boeing coin I already took the 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:46.010
 tone 307 I think that its price does not reach what 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.920
 at one euro and good are the lasting ones and 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.459
 I'm going to do badly looks and it's a 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.530
 they were buesa super intense and makes a his 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.360
 so you can see 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.360
 in a normal gloss applicators 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.700
 materials that in one pass 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.700
 as well mint 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.140
 it's super nice a zoom so you can see 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.879
 Look how nice 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.269
 and for less double euros 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.800
 Awesome 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.529
 as a pigment and they're fixed so it's a 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.259
 fixed that last long enough 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:35.959
 I have not tried it yet so when 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.609
 I will try to comment on it but it has 

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:39.409
 very good looking because as well 

00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:42.709
 you know blogs with just one 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:47.199
 last they do not usually reinvent unless 

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:49.159
 be the type mate or well and well 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.359
 I wanted to have a lot of desire to 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.470
 try it for that because he had given 

00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:57.580
 good reviews of them 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.110
 and I said good because I'm going to approve it on 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.100
 video is super short because only 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.530
 He asked me for these things but hey, I wanted to 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.750
 teach waves because I always know that the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.910
 videos of wayne coynÃ© you like them a lot 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.710
 because between them we go 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.860
 teaching things that we did not know that 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.430
 There was nothing and tell me what you thought 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.540
 these mini purchases and we hope there 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.540
 liked the following video
