the<00:03:44.510> inner<00:03:44.720> half<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:45.740> might<00:03:45.920> end<00:03:45.950> up<00:03:46.190> being<00:03:46.250> the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
the inner half it might end up being the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:55.630 
the inner half it might end up being the
homing<00:03:46.820> though<00:03:46.940> I'm<00:03:47.120> not<00:03:47.180> sure<00:03:47.330> yet

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:10.990

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.940 

all<00:04:11.600> rights<00:04:11.750> ended<00:04:12.080> up<00:04:12.170> taking<00:04:12.350> copper<00:04:12.800> thrown

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
all rights ended up taking copper thrown

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.550 
all rights ended up taking copper thrown
along<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.340> whole<00:04:13.490> wing<00:04:13.670> just<00:04:14.450> because<00:04:15.020> I<00:04:15.260> can

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
along the whole wing just because I can

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.110 
along the whole wing just because I can
I<00:04:15.830> guess<00:04:16.100> that's<00:04:16.340> how<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.489> ended<00:04:16.579> up<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:16.940> can't

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120
