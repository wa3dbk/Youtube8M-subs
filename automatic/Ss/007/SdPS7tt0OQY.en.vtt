00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
I've kind of figured out in like a solid

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.209 
I've kind of figured out in like a solid
path<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.090> go<00:00:39.360> down<00:00:39.899> then<00:00:40.320> open<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> mound

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
path to like go down then open the mound

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.580 
path to like go down then open the mound
which<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.820> some<00:00:42.690> pretty<00:00:42.870> cool<00:00:43.020> well<00:00:43.290> anyway

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
which is some pretty cool well anyway

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.819 
which is some pretty cool well anyway
you'll<00:00:43.829> see<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.899> yeah<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> targets<00:00:46.739> are
