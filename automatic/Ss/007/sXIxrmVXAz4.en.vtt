magma<00:00:45.829> in<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.160> same<00:00:46.489> zone<00:00:46.760> here<00:00:47.060> this<00:00:47.750> boss<00:00:48.110> is

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
magma in the same zone here this boss is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.040 
magma in the same zone here this boss is
not<00:00:48.500> all<00:00:48.739> it<00:00:48.890> difficult<00:00:49.750> really<00:00:50.750> you<00:00:50.930> just

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
not all it difficult really you just

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.660 
not all it difficult really you just
need<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.320> practice<00:00:51.500> your<00:00:52.149> primary<00:00:53.149> tank

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
need to practice your primary tank

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.850 
need to practice your primary tank
rotation<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:55.940> avoid<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:57.079> really<00:00:57.710> dangerous

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
rotation and avoid the really dangerous

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.150 
rotation and avoid the really dangerous
stuff<00:00:58.399> if<00:00:58.610> you<00:00:58.730> ever<00:00:58.850> get<00:00:59.059> trouble<00:00:59.469> so<00:01:00.469> I'm

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
stuff if you ever get trouble so I'm

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.649 
stuff if you ever get trouble so I'm
doing<00:01:01.520> a<00:01:02.410> solo<00:01:03.410> with<00:01:03.770> I<00:01:04.149> level<00:01:05.149> five<00:01:05.329> hundred

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
doing a solo with I level five hundred

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.639 
doing a solo with I level five hundred
gear<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.530> obviously<00:01:07.600> your<00:01:08.600> gear<00:01:09.079> may<00:01:09.380> differ

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
gear so obviously your gear may differ

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.949 
gear so obviously your gear may differ
and<00:01:10.039> probably<00:01:10.490> will<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:10.939> that<00:01:11.450> may<00:01:11.659> change

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:11.959 
and probably will and that may change

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.739 
and probably will and that may change
the<00:01:12.229> difficulty<00:01:12.469> of<00:01:12.649> the<00:01:12.799> fight<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:14.420> basic

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:14.749 
the difficulty of the fight the basic

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:17.590 
the difficulty of the fight the basic
idea<00:01:15.049> here<00:01:15.109> though<00:01:15.499> is<00:01:15.709> that<00:01:16.179> I'm<00:01:17.179> pretty<00:01:17.450> much

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
idea here though is that I'm pretty much

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.690 
idea here though is that I'm pretty much
fully<00:01:18.020> geared<00:01:18.740> for<00:01:19.340> DPS<00:01:20.109> so<00:01:21.369> pretty<00:01:22.369> standard

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
fully geared for DPS so pretty standard

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.359 
fully geared for DPS so pretty standard
for<00:01:22.789> tanks<00:01:23.090> these<00:01:23.240> days<00:01:23.450> but<00:01:23.799> no<00:01:24.799> worry<00:01:25.130> about

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
for tanks these days but no worry about

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.039 
for tanks these days but no worry about
stamina<00:01:25.700> or<00:01:26.299> avoidance<00:01:26.659> or<00:01:26.749> anything<00:01:27.020> like

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
stamina or avoidance or anything like

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.389 
stamina or avoidance or anything like
that<00:01:27.579> just<00:01:28.579> let<00:01:28.759> your<00:01:28.999> extra<00:01:29.659> haste<00:01:29.899> and<00:01:30.560> your

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
that just let your extra haste and your

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.019 
that just let your extra haste and your
play<00:01:32.049> dictate<00:01:33.049> how<00:01:33.560> well<00:01:33.829> you<00:01:33.979> do<00:01:34.130> in<00:01:34.429> terms<00:01:34.789> of

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:35.029 
play dictate how well you do in terms of

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:39.160 
play dictate how well you do in terms of
mitigation<00:01:36.399> so<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.639> basic<00:01:37.999> goal<00:01:38.479> here<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:39.109> to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
mitigation so the basic goal here is to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.039 
mitigation so the basic goal here is to
try<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.009> take<00:01:40.189> advantage<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.689> extra

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
try to take advantage of the extra

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.199 
try to take advantage of the extra
damage<00:01:42.469> boosts<00:01:43.159> that<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:43.819> get<00:01:43.999> throughout

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
damage boosts that you get throughout

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.359 
damage boosts that you get throughout
the<00:01:44.359> fight<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.950> any<00:01:46.130> way<00:01:46.279> possible<00:01:46.899> without

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
the fight in any way possible without

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.300 
the fight in any way possible without
having<00:01:49.369> your<00:01:49.579> damage<00:01:49.999> taken<00:01:50.209> go<00:01:50.689> up<00:01:50.810> too<00:01:50.959> much

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
having your damage taken go up too much

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.399 
having your damage taken go up too much
so<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.700> first<00:01:52.819> thing<00:01:52.969> you<00:01:53.209> can<00:01:53.240> do<00:01:53.479> is<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:54.139> keep

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
so the first thing you can do is to keep

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.069 
so the first thing you can do is to keep
mobs<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.249> poison<00:01:55.490> cloud<00:01:55.869> dropped<00:01:56.869> by

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
mobs in the poison cloud dropped by

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.429 
mobs in the poison cloud dropped by
toxic<00:01:57.619> Ron<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:59.060> when<00:01:59.479> toxic<00:01:59.959> Ron's<00:02:00.169> cloud

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
toxic Ron so when toxic Ron's cloud

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.409 
toxic Ron so when toxic Ron's cloud
comes<00:02:00.709> out<00:02:00.889> it's<00:02:01.189> going<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.429> be<00:02:01.520> cast<00:02:01.729> on<00:02:01.969> you

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:02.419 
comes out it's going to be cast on you

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:05.080 
comes out it's going to be cast on you
directly<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.219> want<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.520> quickly<00:02:04.700> move<00:02:04.909> out

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
directly so you want to quickly move out

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.139 
directly so you want to quickly move out
of<00:02:05.209> it<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.450> then<00:02:06.319> slowly<00:02:06.709> back<00:02:07.249> your<00:02:07.459> way<00:02:07.639> to

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
of it and then slowly back your way to

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.960 
of it and then slowly back your way to
the<00:02:08.300> edge<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:08.929> that<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.979> mobs<00:02:10.729> you're

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
the edge of it so that the mobs you're

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.660 
the edge of it so that the mobs you're
attacking<00:02:11.450> just<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:12.110> there<00:02:12.380> are

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
attacking just like that there are

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.340 
attacking just like that there are
inside<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.820> while<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.240> or<00:02:14.390> not<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
inside it while you or not and the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.450 
inside it while you or not and the
easiest<00:02:15.500> way<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.710> tell<00:02:15.890> if<00:02:15.980> you're<00:02:16.100> in<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.370> or

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
easiest way to tell if you're in it or

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.930 
easiest way to tell if you're in it or
not<00:02:16.520> is

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
not is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.340 
not is
just<00:02:17.120> look<00:02:17.270> at<00:02:17.330> your<00:02:17.390> D<00:02:17.570> buffs<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.930> see<00:02:18.140> if<00:02:18.230> you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
just look at your D buffs and see if you

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.620 
just look at your D buffs and see if you

have<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.810> they're<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.260> your<00:02:24.380> D<00:02:24.470> buffs<00:02:24.650> then

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
have that they're in your D buffs then

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.610 
have that they're in your D buffs then
you're<00:02:25.010> not<00:02:25.160> in<00:02:25.370> but<00:02:26.240> if<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.480> mobs<00:02:26.750> are<00:02:27.080> green

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
then they have it and they're taking

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.780

fifty<00:02:29.690> percent<00:02:29.930> extra<00:02:30.200> damage<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:31.460> that's<00:02:31.640> the

fifty percent extra damage so that's the

fifty percent extra damage so that's the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.520 
it without allowing the mobs to stand in
it<00:03:03.710> as<00:03:03.830> well<00:03:04.390> then<00:03:05.390> that's<00:03:05.810> beneficial

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
it as well then that's beneficial

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.590 
it as well then that's beneficial
obviously<00:03:07.040> but<00:03:07.520> that's<00:03:07.760> really<00:03:08.000> tricky<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.450> do

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
obviously but that's really tricky to do

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.990 
obviously but that's really tricky to do
because<00:03:08.810> their<00:03:09.170> model<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.760> slightly<00:03:10.760> bigger

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
because their model is slightly bigger

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.750 
because their model is slightly bigger
than<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.390> are<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:12.070> in<00:03:13.070> order<00:03:13.160> for<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.550> get

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
than you are and in order for you to get

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.970 
than you are and in order for you to get
on<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:13.940> edge<00:03:14.230> they<00:03:15.230> often<00:03:15.500> have<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.710> be<00:03:15.800> in<00:03:15.890> it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
on the edge they often have to be in it

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.160 
on the edge they often have to be in it
as<00:03:16.100> well<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:16.460> you<00:03:17.240> can<00:03:17.360> see<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.660> tried<00:03:17.990> my<00:03:18.140> best

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
as well so you can see I tried my best

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.870 
as well so you can see I tried my best
right<00:03:18.530> there<00:03:18.710> to<00:03:18.830> do<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.070> but<00:03:19.250> they<00:03:19.310> were<00:03:19.520> in<00:03:19.640> it

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
right there to do it but they were in it

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.540 
right there to do it but they were in it
anyway<00:03:20.210> and<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:21.680> means<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:22.070> all<00:03:22.310> their

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
anyway and that means that all their

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.310 
anyway and that means that all their
abilities<00:03:22.970> are<00:03:23.150> fifty<00:03:23.840> percent<00:03:24.140> more

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
abilities are fifty percent more

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.979 
abilities are fifty percent more
dangerous<00:03:24.709> so<00:03:25.580> it's<00:03:26.060> not<00:03:26.420> really<00:03:26.480> that

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
dangerous so it's not really that

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.130 
dangerous so it's not really that
beneficial<00:03:27.440> if<00:03:27.709> you're<00:03:28.190> both<00:03:28.430> in<00:03:28.580> it<00:03:29.140> you're

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
beneficial if you're both in it you're

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.300 
beneficial if you're both in it you're
probably<00:03:30.440> not<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.830> hit<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:30.950> berserk

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
probably not going to hit the berserk

you<00:03:38.600> may<00:03:38.780> have<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.050> sacrifice<00:03:39.230> some

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
you may have to sacrifice some

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.830 
you may have to sacrifice some
survivability<00:03:40.370> by<00:03:40.760> sending<00:03:41.239> in<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.540> puddle

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.130 
survivability by sending in the puddle
and<00:03:42.550> doing<00:03:43.550> extra<00:03:43.850> DPS<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.390> them<00:03:44.540> while<00:03:44.870> they

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
also do the same to you obviously this

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.270 
also do the same to you obviously this
will<00:03:47.570> increase<00:03:47.780> your<00:03:47.900> vengeance<00:03:48.350> so<00:03:48.920> it's<00:03:49.160> a

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
will increase your vengeance so it's a

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.140 
will increase your vengeance so it's a
trade-off<00:03:49.519> here<00:03:51.100> other<00:03:52.100> than<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.459> use<00:03:52.940> your

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
trade-off here other than that use your

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.330 
trade-off here other than that use your
DPS<00:03:53.630> cooldowns<00:03:54.080> such<00:03:54.410> as<00:03:54.560> your<00:03:54.709> tiger<00:03:55.130> and

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
your potions and all that when you are

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.410 
your potions and all that when you are
getting<00:03:58.310> one<00:03:58.820> or<00:03:59.120> two<00:03:59.600> of<00:03:59.780> those<00:03:59.930> benefits<00:04:00.410> so

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
getting one or two of those benefits so

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.509 
getting one or two of those benefits so
you<00:04:02.420> can<00:04:02.720> technically<00:04:03.260> arrange<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.250> such<00:04:04.489> that

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
you can technically arrange it such that

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.920 
you can technically arrange it such that
you<00:04:04.910> get<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:06.170> mobs<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.769> cloud<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.930> you

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
you get the mobs in the cloud and you

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.710 
you get the mobs in the cloud and you
get<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.170> benefit<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.650> puddle<00:04:10.720> but

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
get the benefit of the puddle but

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.150 
get the benefit of the puddle but
chances<00:04:12.019> are<00:04:12.140> they<00:04:12.380> will<00:04:12.500> get<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.800> puddle<00:04:13.040> at

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
chances are they will get the puddle at

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.130 
chances are they will get the puddle at
the<00:04:13.250> same<00:04:13.430> time<00:04:13.640> but<00:04:14.390> if<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:14.540> can<00:04:14.660> combine

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
the same time but if you can combine

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.190 
the same time but if you can combine
both<00:04:15.440> of<00:04:15.620> those<00:04:15.739> effects<00:04:16.250> at<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.459> same<00:04:16.640> time

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
both of those effects at the same time

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.030 
both of those effects at the same time
so<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:18.350> they're<00:04:18.470> taking<00:04:18.620> one<00:04:18.830> hundred

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
so that they're taking one hundred

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.580 
so that they're taking one hundred
percent<00:04:19.070> extra<00:04:19.489> damage<00:04:19.930> then<00:04:20.930> you'll<00:04:21.200> burn

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
percent extra damage then you'll burn

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.690 
percent extra damage then you'll burn
through<00:04:21.799> them<00:04:21.950> really<00:04:22.160> fast<00:04:22.430> obviously

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
through them really fast obviously

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.750 
through them really fast obviously
alright<00:04:25.700> so<00:04:26.060> other<00:04:26.270> than<00:04:26.390> all<00:04:26.510> that

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
alright so other than all that

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.340 
alright so other than all that
the<00:04:28.760> big<00:04:28.910> tip<00:04:29.150> is<00:04:29.300> simply<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:29.690> this<00:04:30.020> fight

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
the big tip is simply that this fight

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.420 
the big tip is simply that this fight
sort<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.830> is<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.190> bit<00:04:31.430> chaotic<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.870> just<00:04:33.350> if<00:04:33.530> you

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
sort of is a bit chaotic so just if you

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.490 
sort of is a bit chaotic so just if you
want<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.060> get<00:04:35.180> practice<00:04:35.750> on<00:04:35.900> until<00:04:36.260> you<00:04:36.350> get

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
want to get practice on until you get

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.680 
want to get practice on until you get
used<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:36.860> just<00:04:37.670> avoid<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:37.970> clouds<00:04:38.330> avoid

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
used to it just avoid the clouds avoid

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.230 
used to it just avoid the clouds avoid
the<00:04:38.810> puddles<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.430> just<00:04:40.430> tank<00:04:40.700> them<00:04:40.880> away<00:04:41.180> from

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
the puddles and just tank them away from

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.480 
the puddles and just tank them away from
all<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.510> stuff<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.890> only<00:04:43.070> other<00:04:43.100> thing<00:04:43.220> you

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
all that stuff the only other thing you

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.410 
all that stuff the only other thing you
have<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.640> do<00:04:43.820> is<00:04:44.030> switch<00:04:44.270> targets<00:04:44.540> when<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.110> new

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
have to do is switch targets when a new

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.630 
have to do is switch targets when a new
defender<00:04:47.420> comes<00:04:47.690> out<00:04:47.900> so<00:04:48.740> when<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.100> new<00:04:49.340> golem

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
defender comes out so when a new golem

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.150 
defender comes out so when a new golem
activates<00:04:50.120> start<00:04:50.990> attacking<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.650> goal<00:04:51.890> if

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
activates start attacking that goal if

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.430 
activates start attacking that goal if
you<00:04:52.940> attack<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.330> previous<00:04:53.690> column<00:04:54.020> they'll

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
you attack the previous column they'll

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.020 
you attack the previous column they'll
generally<00:04:54.710> have<00:04:54.920> a<00:04:54.950> shield<00:04:55.220> of<00:04:55.400> some<00:04:55.550> kind<00:04:55.730> and

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
generally have a shield of some kind and

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.360 
generally have a shield of some kind and
this<00:04:56.990> will<00:04:57.170> activate<00:04:57.530> if<00:04:57.890> you<00:04:58.010> do<00:04:58.130> too<00:04:58.280> much

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
this will activate if you do too much

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.420 
this will activate if you do too much
damage<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.790> them<00:04:59.060> so<00:04:59.990> you<00:05:00.919> don't<00:05:00.950> want<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.310> do<00:05:01.400> a

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
damage to them so you don't want to do a

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.280 
damage to them so you don't want to do a
whole<00:05:01.669> lot<00:05:01.730> of<00:05:01.880> damage<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.330> them<00:05:02.480> but<00:05:02.990> if<00:05:03.110> that

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
whole lot of damage to them but if that

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.020 
whole lot of damage to them but if that
shield<00:05:03.560> does<00:05:03.890> get<00:05:04.130> activated<00:05:04.490> it's<00:05:04.730> not<00:05:04.910> the

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
shield does get activated it's not the

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.500 
shield does get activated it's not the
end<00:05:05.060> of<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.210> world<00:05:06.130> save<00:05:07.130> your<00:05:07.310> cooldowns<00:05:07.820> for

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
any emergency situation if you find that

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.560 
any emergency situation if you find that
you<00:05:11.660> are<00:05:11.840> taking<00:05:12.169> too<00:05:12.290> much<00:05:12.380> damage<00:05:13.360> but<00:05:14.360> that

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
you are taking too much damage but that

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.260 
you are taking too much damage but that
said<00:05:14.810> you'll<00:05:15.050> notice<00:05:15.350> that<00:05:15.880> even<00:05:16.880> when<00:05:17.150> my

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
said you'll notice that even when my
