legs<00:02:10.440> all<00:02:11.440> right<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:11.740> just<00:02:11.890> grab<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.340> cable

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
legs all right so just grab the cable

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.720

you<00:02:18.760> go

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.250 

and<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.849> extend<00:02:23.360> right<00:02:23.660> across<00:02:23.840> your<00:02:24.080> body

so this move right here is actually a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.170 
so this move right here is actually a
little<00:02:32.650> stricter<00:02:33.220> than<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.490> other<00:02:33.730> variation

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
little stricter than the other variation

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.750 
little stricter than the other variation
we<00:02:34.960> are<00:02:35.110> standing<00:02:35.470> up<00:02:35.590> because<00:02:36.070> your<00:02:36.400> upper

we are standing up because your upper

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.540 
we are standing up because your upper
body<00:02:37.500> braced<00:02:38.500> against<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.890> floor<00:02:39.070> obviously

and there's no momentum whatsoever so

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.980 
and there's no momentum whatsoever so
you're<00:02:42.100> just<00:02:42.280> relying<00:02:42.610> totally<00:02:43.120> on<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.780> rear

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
you're just relying totally on the rear

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.520 
you're just relying totally on the rear
delt<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.600> really<00:02:47.020> strict<00:02:47.290> isolation

that's pretty normal most people do have

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.860 
that's pretty normal most people do have
one<00:03:41.730> side<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:41.970> little<00:03:42.209> stronger<00:03:42.510> than<00:03:42.660> the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
one side a little stronger than the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.470 
one side a little stronger than the
other<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.709> if<00:03:44.099> that's<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.459> case<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:45.060> would<00:03:45.390> be

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
other so if that's the case it would be

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.089 
other so if that's the case it would be
a<00:03:45.510> good<00:03:45.660> idea<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.050> start<00:03:46.380> with<00:03:46.440> your<00:03:46.739> weaker

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
a good idea to start with your weaker

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.120 
a good idea to start with your weaker
side<00:03:47.310> first<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.349> make<00:03:49.349> sure<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.680> perform<00:03:49.800> the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
side first and make sure to perform the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.920 
side first and make sure to perform the
exact<00:03:50.550> same<00:03:50.819> number<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.209> sets<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.630> reps<00:03:51.780> with

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
exact same number of sets and reps with

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:01.350 
exact same number of sets and reps with
your<00:03:52.020> stronger<00:03:52.380> side<00:03:52.530> afterwards

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.460
