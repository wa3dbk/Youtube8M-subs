00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.570 

okay<00:00:00.539> so<00:00:00.599> the<00:00:00.840> first<00:00:00.989> thing<00:00:01.170> I<00:00:01.680> should<00:00:01.890> say<00:00:02.070> is

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
okay so the first thing I should say is

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.360 
okay so the first thing I should say is
that<00:00:03.120> I'm<00:00:03.480> not<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.200> research<00:00:04.650> methodologist

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
that I'm not a research methodologist

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.519 
that I'm not a research methodologist
research<00:00:05.970> methodologist<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.870> people<00:00:07.200> who<00:00:07.350> are

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
research methodologist to people who are

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.680 
research methodologist to people who are
into<00:00:08.010> research<00:00:08.429> methodology<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.330> big<00:00:09.510> way

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
into research methodology in a big way

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.680 
into research methodology in a big way
and<00:00:10.019> so<00:00:10.650> their<00:00:10.860> field<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.400> study<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.150> research

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
and so their field of study is research

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.900 
and so their field of study is research
methodology<00:00:13.500> where<00:00:14.160> it's<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.460> most<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.820> us

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
methodology where it's for most of us

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.660 
methodology where it's for most of us
will<00:00:15.150> use<00:00:15.360> some<00:00:15.630> sort<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.960> research<00:00:16.350> method<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
will use some sort of research method to

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.460 
will use some sort of research method to
do<00:00:17.789> some<00:00:17.970> research<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.900> I'm<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.410> to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
do some research and I'm just going to

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.290 
do some research and I'm just going to
do<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> really<00:00:19.920> quick<00:00:20.189> flick<00:00:20.670> through<00:00:20.939> those

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
do a really quick flick through those

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.410 
do a really quick flick through those
four<00:00:21.750> paradigms<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.130> sort<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.430> stereotyped

for<00:00:35.940> example<00:00:36.600> people<00:00:36.989> would<00:00:37.440> take<00:00:37.770> children

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
for example people would take children

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.220 
for example people would take children
into<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.760> room<00:00:39.000> where<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.480> 2-way<00:00:39.930> glass

into a room where there was 2-way glass

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.709 
into a room where there was 2-way glass
and<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:41.190> would<00:00:41.309> probably<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.790> videoed<00:00:42.210> then

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and it would probably be videoed then

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.959 
and it would probably be videoed then
someone<00:00:43.110> would<00:00:43.230> stand<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.280> opposite<00:00:44.640> side

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
someone would stand on the opposite side

someone would stand on the opposite side
of<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> glass<00:00:45.390> from<00:00:45.719> where<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> children

of the glass from where the children

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.410 
of the glass from where the children
were<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.070> they've<00:00:47.160> watched<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.730> behavior

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
were and they've watched the behavior

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
were and they've watched the behavior
the<00:00:48.570> interactions<00:00:49.379> they<00:00:49.890> watch<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.399> way<00:00:50.579> that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the interactions they watch the way that

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.090 
the interactions they watch the way that
the<00:00:51.149> child<00:00:51.480> or<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> children<00:00:52.379> would<00:00:52.559> respond

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the child or the children would respond

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.760 
the child or the children would respond
to<00:00:53.340> different<00:00:53.550> stimuli<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.809> their<00:00:55.260> parent

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
to different stimuli like their parent

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
to different stimuli like their parent
coming<00:00:56.100> into<00:00:56.250> their<00:00:56.489> route<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.910> room<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.300> the

introduction of a particular toy or
something<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.760> scientific

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
something like that so this scientific

something like that so this scientific

of the world is a set of assumption and

are not challengeable they simply are

the assumptions that underpin that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.910

knowledge<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.479> seen<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:33.930> objective<00:01:34.530> it's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
knowledge is seen as objective it's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.370 
knowledge is seen as objective it's
measurable<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.850> some<00:01:36.299> sort<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> way<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.350> be

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
measurable in some sort of way can be

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.710 
measurable in some sort of way can be
objectified<00:01:38.159> by<00:01:38.430> numbers<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.479> also

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
objectified by numbers it's also

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.670 
objectified by numbers it's also
value-free

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
value-free

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.889 
value-free
so<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> idea<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.329> wouldn't<00:01:42.659> matter

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
so the idea is that it wouldn't matter

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.380 
so the idea is that it wouldn't matter
where<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:44.189> particular<00:01:44.430> phenomenon

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
where this particular phenomenon

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.090 
where this particular phenomenon
occurred<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> world<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:46.890> always

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
occurred in the world it would always

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.490 
occurred in the world it would always
occur<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.909> exactly<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> same<00:01:48.720> way<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
occur in exactly the same way that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.530 
occur in exactly the same way that
knowledge<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.159> universal<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.090> notion<00:01:51.450> of

the scientific positive approach was the

in education and it would be wrong to

think that this approach to research and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
education does not have value but if you

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.020 
education does not have value but if you
are<00:02:29.590> wanting<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.190> look<00:02:30.340> at<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.610> way<00:02:30.760> that

are wanting to look at the way that

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
is different depending on the person and

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.520 
is different depending on the person and

addressing and the questions are where
in<00:05:17.760> your<00:05:18.240> personal<00:05:19.080> view<00:05:19.949> do<00:05:20.729> you<00:05:20.760> think<00:05:21.270> that

you're located and why why do you think

you're located and why why do you think

that you're actually tending to one or

the other or two of them and secondly

the other or two of them and secondly
where<00:05:28.710> do<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.400> think<00:05:29.699> your<00:05:30.090> research<00:05:30.360> is

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
to do and why the first question is

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.610 
to do and why the first question is
really<00:05:36.180> important<00:05:36.780> it<00:05:36.900> is<00:05:36.930> but<00:05:37.320> I<00:05:37.380> think<00:05:37.530> it's

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
really important it is but I think it's
