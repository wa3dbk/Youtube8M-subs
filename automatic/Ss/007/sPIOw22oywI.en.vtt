movie I think if it wasn't supposed to

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.820 
movie I think if it wasn't supposed to
be<00:04:43.630> Walter<00:04:43.900> Mitty<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.380> took<00:04:44.530> out<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
have been a sharper more interesting

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.270 
have been a sharper more interesting
