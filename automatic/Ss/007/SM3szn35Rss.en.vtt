out<00:00:20.520> Papa<00:00:20.820> Tom<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:21.900> how<00:00:22.140> easy<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.740> can

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
out Papa Tom and see how easy we can

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:39.650 
out Papa Tom and see how easy we can
make<00:00:23.130> stones<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.090> cinder<00:00:24.720> blocks<00:00:38.510> now<00:00:39.510> in

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
make stones and cinder blocks now in

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.740 
make stones and cinder blocks now in
order<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> create<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.379> cinder<00:00:40.710> blocks<00:00:40.980> let's

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
order to create the cinder blocks let's

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.720 
order to create the cinder blocks let's
evenly<00:00:42.750> mark<00:00:43.590> those<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:46.190> so<00:00:47.190> let's<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.579> out

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
evenly mark those out so let's get out

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.279 
evenly mark those out so let's get out
our<00:00:49.010> black<00:00:50.010> marker<00:00:50.550> line<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> lines<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.170> we

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
our black marker line up the lines so we

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.510 
our black marker line up the lines so we
know<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.649> gonna<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:52.920> pretty<00:00:53.070> straight

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
know it's gonna be pretty straight

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.360 
know it's gonna be pretty straight

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.740 

and<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.040> we're<00:01:08.189> ready<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.909> exactly<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.600> we

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and now we're ready to do exactly as we

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.179 
and now we're ready to do exactly as we
did<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> others<00:01:10.350> only<00:01:10.650> filling<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
did the others only filling in the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.660 
did the others only filling in the
second<00:01:11.610> role<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.250> it'll<00:01:14.460> give<00:01:14.640> us

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
second role here so that it'll give us

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.539 
second role here so that it'll give us
the<00:01:15.170> completed<00:01:16.170> stone<00:01:16.500> wall<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.430> cinder<00:01:17.909> block

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
the completed stone wall of cinder block

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.740 
the completed stone wall of cinder block
we're<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> castle<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.600> would

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
we're going to do a castle that would

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
we're going to do a castle that would
really<00:01:21.990> work<00:01:22.229> great<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.939> now<00:01:23.939> how<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.180> we

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
really work great for that now how do we

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.999 
really work great for that now how do we
want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.600> show<00:01:24.780> some<00:01:24.810> depth<00:01:25.380> into<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> there

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
want to show some depth into it there

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.640 
want to show some depth into it there
are<00:01:26.100> several<00:01:26.280> different<00:01:26.700> ways<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.060> doing<00:01:27.180> that

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
are several different ways of doing that

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.859 
are several different ways of doing that
let<00:01:28.650> me<00:01:28.680> show<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.979> how<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> score<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.090> really

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
let me show you how to score it a really

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.929 
let me show you how to score it a really
interesting<00:01:31.320> thing<00:01:31.619> about<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.610> it

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
interesting thing about that is that it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.530 
interesting thing about that is that it
really<00:01:33.920> can<00:01:34.920> create<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.280> perfect<00:01:35.909> turret<00:01:36.270> for

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
really can create a perfect turret for

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.969 
really can create a perfect turret for
you<00:01:38.060> just<00:01:39.060> lightly<00:01:39.390> cut<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> through<00:01:40.110> not<00:01:40.770> all

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you just lightly cut it through not all

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.020 
you just lightly cut it through not all
the<00:01:41.100> way<00:01:41.189> through<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.680> 3/4<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> way

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:57.149 

and<00:01:48.030> now<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> bricks<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.590> between

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.550 

now<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.540> little<00:01:58.750> bit<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.079> flexing

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
now it's just a little bit of flexing

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.899 
now it's just a little bit of flexing
from<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.860> back<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:03.100> form<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.460> nice<00:02:03.610> circular

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
from the back can form a nice circular

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.669 
from the back can form a nice circular
turret<00:02:04.509> if<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.500> say<00:02:05.799> cut<00:02:06.070> out<00:02:06.250> well<00:02:07.679> every

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
turret if you say cut out well every

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.080 
turret if you say cut out well every
other<00:02:08.830> one

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.210 

and<00:02:16.270> you've<00:02:17.080> now<00:02:17.260> got<00:02:17.500> your<00:02:17.740> turret<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.100> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
and you've now got your turret on the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.650 
and you've now got your turret on the
end<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:19.050> went<00:02:20.050> ahead<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.340> wall<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.390> did<00:02:22.630> a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
end I went ahead on the wall and did a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.660 
end I went ahead on the wall and did a
little<00:02:22.930> indentation<00:02:23.230> around<00:02:24.010> each<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
little indentation around each of the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.970 
little indentation around each of the
blocks<00:02:24.850> running<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:26.319> back<00:02:26.560> end<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.890> a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
blocks running a the back end of a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.050 
blocks running a the back end of a
paintbrush<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.220> gives<00:02:30.370> more<00:02:30.580> texture

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
paintbrush so that it gives more texture

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.240 
paintbrush so that it gives more texture
and<00:02:31.120> depth<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.720> stone<00:02:31.990> now<00:02:32.860> what<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.040> want

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and depth to the stone now what I want

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.600 
and depth to the stone now what I want
to<00:02:33.340> do<00:02:33.459> now<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.700> give<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.180> black<00:02:34.390> wash<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.580> I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
to do now is give it a black wash and I

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.390 
to do now is give it a black wash and I
just<00:02:36.850> run<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.120> all<00:02:37.239> over<00:02:37.569> it<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.709> see<00:02:39.069> how<00:02:39.220> that

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
just run it all over it and see how that

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.970 
just run it all over it and see how that
does<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.840> learn<00:02:41.050> more<00:02:41.319> about<00:02:41.530> black

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
does it to learn more about black
