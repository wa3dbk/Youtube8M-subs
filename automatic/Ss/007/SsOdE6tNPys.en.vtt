00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.480
Welcome to Ahmet's kitchen, today we will be making Tulumba

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.889
Contents:

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:16.889
350 ml of water, pour into the pan

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.140
Butter 100 g

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.140
put that in too

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.189
let it melt

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.590
let it melt, then add flour

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.850
a bit of salt

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.320
lets wait until the butter has melted

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.450
then 400g of flour

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.040
always stir

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.600
you can make it in the pot or pan

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.600
if you want to make sure that nothing falls out, rather make it in a pot

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.449
Stir 5 minutes

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:33.839
5 minutes are up, now we put it into the shell

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:38.849
let it all cool down

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:48.569
Now comes the pan with the oil on the stove

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.889
which must first be cold, then we can continue

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.469
since we will be putting eggs in later

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:06.529
now that its cooled down, we put in a pack of vanilla

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:15.379
a tablespoon semolina

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:22.379
three eggs

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:31.509
by hand

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:38.509
work it

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:54.259
if you have a good machine you can also use that of course

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.089
I'm doing it by hand

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:06.499
do this until everything is incorporated in the dough

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.679
the dough is done

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:13.349
lets take a small piece and make it round

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.879
after that, go in with your finger

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.859
make a hole

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.599
and then you have to turn it like this

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.159
now put them into sunflower oil

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.469
roast them until they get a golden brown color

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.590
then put them in sugar water

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.379
I have her. a liter of water, a kilo of sugar

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:06.069
four slices of lemon

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.939
Cook for 30 minutes and then let it cool

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.610
now they are golden brown

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.289
let them rotate, 1 - 2 times

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.099
this one is slightly too bright

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.639
take out those that are done

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.439
then put them into sugar water

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:29.460
always put them into sugar water

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.550
here, they must be pressed down

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:39.309
the cameraman has to help out

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:04.069
lets continue

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.819
leave it in there until it's done

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.400
Tulumba is now ready

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:32.249
now we put pistacious and walnut on top

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:43.050
OK

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.979
Good appetite, until next time, bye, Ahmet :)
