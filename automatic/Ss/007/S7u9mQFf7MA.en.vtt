00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.530 
it's going to go my shoulder and way
back<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> wave<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.530> you're<00:01:37.680> kind<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.890> doing

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
back to the wave so you're kind of doing

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.100 
back to the wave so you're kind of doing
this<00:01:39.540> cycle<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.670> can<00:01:41.670> also<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:42.150> reverse<00:01:43.759> and

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
this cycle you can also go reverse and

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.160 
this cycle you can also go reverse and
back<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> forth<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.430> your<00:01:47.939> paper<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
back and forth so your paper is like a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.899 
back and forth so your paper is like a
continuation<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.909> way<00:01:51.619> paper<00:01:52.619> move<00:01:52.950> if

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
continuation of the way paper move if

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.609 
continuation of the way paper move if
you<00:01:54.119> got<00:01:54.240> your<00:01:54.390> pencil<00:01:54.810> ready<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.470> is

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
you got your pencil ready this is

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.020 
you got your pencil ready this is
probably<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> coolest<00:01:56.219> one<00:01:56.579> out<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.880> all<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
probably the coolest one out of all of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
probably the coolest one out of all of
them<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.420> I'm<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.170> three<00:01:58.560> different

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
them so I'm going to do three different

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.010 
them so I'm going to do three different
variations<00:01:59.549> mechanical<00:02:00.360> kind<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.659> robotic

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
variations mechanical kind of robotic

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
variations mechanical kind of robotic
movements<00:02:01.290> first<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.070> I'm<00:02:02.460> gonna<00:02:02.579> take<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
movements first one I'm gonna take the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.340 
movements first one I'm gonna take the
pencil<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> want<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.420> put<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.630> my<00:02:03.659> forehead<00:02:04.200> I'm

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
intervals to move back and forth and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.840 
intervals to move back and forth and
then<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.440> final<00:02:28.770> one<00:02:28.800> I'm<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.550> take<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
then the final one I'm going to take the
