00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
general is we're using rage not because

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.810 
general is we're using rage not because
I<00:01:04.439> mean<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.680> blooms<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.220> Dragons<00:01:05.610> really

I mean it blooms and Dragons really

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.219 
I mean it blooms and Dragons really
power<00:01:06.030> for<00:01:06.210> anyway<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.570> we're<00:01:06.689> using<00:01:06.960> them

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
power for anyway but we're using them

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.870 
power for anyway but we're using them
for<00:01:07.260> speed<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.100> let's<00:01:08.280> go<00:01:08.430> check<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.729> out

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
for speed so let's go check it out

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.640 
for speed so let's go check it out
popped<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> blooms<00:01:09.689> I'm<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> pop

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
popped out of blooms I'm going to pop

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
popped out of blooms I'm going to pop
down<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.130> hey<00:01:11.580> spell<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.270> they<00:01:12.600> give<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> full

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
down a hey spell and they give a full

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.030 
down a hey spell and they give a full
into<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:13.470> getting<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.799> really

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
into it and then getting a really

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
into it and then getting a really
quickly<00:01:14.640> across<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> air<00:01:15.180> defense<00:01:15.509> yeah

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
quickly across to the air defense yeah

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
quickly across to the air defense yeah
so<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> point<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:17.009> get<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> speed<00:01:17.490> without

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so the point is we get the speed without

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.630 
so the point is we get the speed without
having<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> carry<00:01:18.540> use<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.650> two<00:01:19.860> spaces<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.549> it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
having to carry use up two spaces for it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.190 
having to carry use up two spaces for it
so<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.909> k<00:01:21.060> twice<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:21.570> many<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:22.170> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
so we can k twice as many can you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.940 
so we can k twice as many can you
imagine<00:01:22.439> having<00:01:22.979> 11<00:01:23.369> hey<00:01:23.610> spells<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.630> it's

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
imagine having 11 hey spells and it's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.320 
imagine having 11 hey spells and it's
just<00:01:25.950> running<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.430> balloons<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.970> straight
