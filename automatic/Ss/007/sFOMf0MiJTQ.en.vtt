 Units from the body

 collect all here again and first switch on the reverse gear 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.449
 and think of something new 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.220
 we now see the effects as in the dovecote 7 percent yielded 4 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.820
 we see too 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.099
 Another popular destination is being produced or bricklayer for more 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.560
 and we now see the swap location 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.539
 um, we may see an old school for PET percent Tenk reinforcement 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.760
 or with percent reinforcement in the form of Williams 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.760
 or we could also percent now 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.370
 something percent funny SC with EHEC he unit strategies for southwest wind 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.780

 Of course, day had to be player 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.260

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.930
 he now needs the more exe by percent here with an IQ advantage the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.910
 Rear swing to Oberpforte therefore a little to hold back 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.380
 Must be due to the fact that he was a bunker 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.660
 how does the forest is the game April to 2 in March had someday day and 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.530

 and percent spared that percent the four Technology and i very much 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.200
 important for the betrayal player 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.259
 Percent 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.549
 You know, it's great that it's twice as much fun and fun 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.410
 Of course everything is much better 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.970
 and just tuned bricklayer are against Roth final round 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.610
 not so nice as a player 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.100
 Percent, of course, the breasts still have the advantage that they are a miserable 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.310
 long person have percent of course, the good 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.410

 Firstly Meditec Grabbe there is directly put into position 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.799

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.229
 Per cent how he should now back to the whole trash because who 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.670
 Seeing the Obi he may suspect a drop rocking that is 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.390
 only as a permanent problem 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 Percent who once ran across the deadline 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.160
 to get all the necessary information 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.520
 We continue to see the skinning technology of the Unisys 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.159
 Give Terrence Malick today 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.419
 and we see 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:16.319
 Percent even more MediaTek that's under construction because there is now simply mass 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.129
 Pushed for that must go fast before he showed his export performance 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.159
 run Red 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.049
 and we can see percent good ones Hey you too again 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.089
 Payne put 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:31.319
 the natural Superquote are however now the portions become 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.559
 4 1 although the onyx speaks at least not quite as high as giving 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.859
 be granted now 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.110
 but if the lost units one to see 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.390
 Percent, what it's all about it when the violet that offers poverty 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.640
 Units forward like never before are percent how bring we are natural 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.999
 warmly 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:49.990
 Percent and there have to talk 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.359
 Soft ring of a simple 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.689
 now it is so 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.969
 By exerting pressure on health raw materials harden the day Verdi 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.220
 Percent there is the right to the same that is in the come 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.210
 if it is finished that would of course be good now and IT but 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.579
 Percent misses 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.579
 compared the series of others 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.229
 They want the credit line seen less frequented 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.069
 since I am here now 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.979
 Percent in reverse percent with one with were second here, so to speak 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.149
 the one or the other wavelength simply delicious driven 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:24.269
 Super well done percent ahead 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.340
 the good Poscher who does not get involved here who with whom Linke Timo 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.569
 to dance 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.969
 but with bars, percent of the thousands remain maneuvered through the system 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:38.129
 he denied himself region is much faster and can still bring relief 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.619
 you also comment here 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.799
 Percent has the whole 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.819
 the booths Poszwa units tasted and 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.129
 Percent Heckroth percent more than double 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.569
 and now I'm the one we change the without wiping professionals quarter by 14 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.319
 however, the plans do land a coup and percent damage the 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.129
 To serve MÃ¼ritz 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.129
 now here, too, the Woods front 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.209
 of course now against wrinkles that I'm not intimidating now 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:07.939
 to let 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.960
 watch damn and her indices contract player Prof 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.409
 are not an innovation on the training network 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.839
 for reconstruction 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.839
 and now here is the big one 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.879
 Repro and a petition position 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.419
 we can still see the luggage here now also the BAV topic Friedwald Hertha 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.370
 incomprehensible here in the death because I would have loved me and just shit 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.849
 set 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.610
 now everyone comes shopping 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.979
 Lucerne was he catches the leg length with his whole 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.249
 that though all 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.759
 when he is there but does not seem easy as well as wanted to come from Klopp 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.029
 putting his Broder in position that did not succeed now of course 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:49.330
 whole again 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.930
 designed at Eon com 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.930
 how they interact 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.789
 probably a lot to align 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:02.099
 that is now for language in the place patent application day calculated the Expo 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:03.210
 is kicked 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.339
 that was a very short story he did not look for afterwards 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:09.189
 the women are easy 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.189
 accidentally in my opinion 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:15.870
 so not allowed to wait 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.000
 whoever but not so posed Caffier tilted over the keyboard is feasible 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:21.740
 the 7th 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.740
 Walheim is afraid 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.839
 Roth, however, wants to be friendly 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.409
 Switzerland 0 interspersed 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.409
 but the games were over 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.700
 the good quota says that we too like deep 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.430
 Percent probably saw for himself that he was there a bit 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.589
 hungover at the point 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:44.699
 that will definitely give an interesting rematch again 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.650
 I'll say it on the lake and see you soon 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.550
