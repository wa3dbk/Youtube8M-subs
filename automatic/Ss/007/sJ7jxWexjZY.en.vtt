shouldn't<00:01:21.359> take<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> ton<00:01:21.719> of<00:01:21.750> force<00:01:23.299> once<00:01:24.299> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
shouldn't take a ton of force once you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
shouldn't take a ton of force once you
get<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:24.869> grab<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.409> kick<00:01:25.890> start<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
get it there grab your kick start with a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.340 
get it there grab your kick start with a
bushing<00:01:26.729> kick<00:01:27.450> start<00:01:27.719> gear<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> bushing

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
bushing kick start gear with a bushing

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.810 
bushing kick start gear with a bushing
and<00:01:28.500> drop<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> into<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> hole<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:29.520> CVT

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
and drop that into the hole in the CVT

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.349 
and drop that into the hole in the CVT
cover<00:01:31.009> just<00:01:32.009> push<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.399> down<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> then

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
cover just push that down and then

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.459 
cover just push that down and then
you'll<00:01:33.539> need<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.719> twist<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.109> further

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
you'll need to twist a little further

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.980 
you'll need to twist a little further
most<00:01:34.770> likely<00:01:35.359> so<00:01:36.359> that<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.719> get<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
most likely so that you can get this

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.959 
most likely so that you can get this
gear<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.380> pass<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.770> spot<00:01:38.039> on<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.219> CVT<00:01:38.609> case

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
gear to pass this spot on the CVT case

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.870 
gear to pass this spot on the CVT case
CVT<00:01:39.689> cover<00:01:39.929> and<00:01:40.259> then<00:01:40.409> push<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> down<00:01:41.039> so

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
CVT cover and then push that down so

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.639 
CVT cover and then push that down so
that<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.179> will<00:01:42.299> prevent<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.229> spring<00:01:43.499> from

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that it will prevent the spring from

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.580 
that it will prevent the spring from
coming<00:01:43.950> back<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.539> then<00:01:45.539> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.689> unlock<00:01:46.530> your

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
coming back and then you can unlock your

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649 
coming back and then you can unlock your
vise<00:01:46.890> grips<00:01:47.249> to<00:01:47.700> let<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.270> but<00:01:48.539> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
vise grips to let go of that but you

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.270 
vise grips to let go of that but you
want<00:01:48.749> to<00:01:48.869> keep<00:01:48.990> pressure<00:01:49.259> down<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.979> on

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
want to keep pressure down on this on

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.980 
want to keep pressure down on this on
the<00:01:50.579> kickstart<00:01:51.060> gear<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.569> that<00:01:51.600> nothing<00:01:51.960> can

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the kickstart gear so that nothing can

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.849 
the kickstart gear so that nothing can
come<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:54.109> so<00:01:55.109> you<00:01:55.170> unlock<00:01:55.530> your<00:01:55.560> place

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
come out at you so you unlock your place

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.130 
come out at you so you unlock your place
grips<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.399> should<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:56.819> the<00:01:57.600> spring<00:01:57.960> is

up<00:01:58.289> against<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.740> corner<00:01:59.249> of<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.729> kickstart

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
up against this corner of the kickstart

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.370 
up against this corner of the kickstart
gear<00:02:01.969> sometimes<00:02:02.969> when<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.389> do<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:04.170> you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
gear sometimes when you do this as you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.550 
gear sometimes when you do this as you
can<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:05.299> this<00:02:06.299> spring<00:02:06.719> will<00:02:06.899> get<00:02:07.020> twisted<00:02:07.259> up

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
can see this spring will get twisted up

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
can see this spring will get twisted up
it<00:02:07.740> comes<00:02:07.859> up<00:02:08.100> over<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:09.090> not<00:02:09.149> sure<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.479> you

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
it comes up over I'm not sure that you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.870 
it comes up over I'm not sure that you
can<00:02:09.780> really<00:02:09.990> see<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.380> video<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.880> it'll

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
can really see it on the video but it'll

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.190 
can really see it on the video but it'll
come<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.060> over<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> little<00:02:12.659> surface<00:02:13.019> in<00:02:13.110> the

here and push down on the kickstart here

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.290 
here and push down on the kickstart here
while<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.810> pry<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.140> spring<00:02:37.620> out<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:39.000> you

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
while you pry this spring out and you

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.670 
while you pry this spring out and you
should<00:02:39.570> be<00:02:39.780> able<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.990> get<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.260> pop<00:02:40.410> down

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
should be able to get it to pop down

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.650 
should be able to get it to pop down
into<00:02:40.950> place

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
into place

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.130 
into place
might<00:02:42.660> take<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> couple<00:02:42.990> tries<00:02:47.180> but<00:02:48.180> like<00:02:49.050> you

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
might take a couple tries but like you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.330 
might take a couple tries but like you
can<00:02:49.290> see<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.530> can<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.920> into<00:02:50.040> place<00:02:50.220> and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
can see you can get it into place and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.590 
can see you can get it into place and
then<00:02:50.580> you'll<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:50.790> need<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.090> hold<00:02:51.360> pressure

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
then you'll just need to hold pressure

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.650 
then you'll just need to hold pressure
on<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.380> nothing<00:02:52.650> flies<00:02:52.890> out<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:54.480> while

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
on this so nothing flies out and while

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.870 
on this so nothing flies out and while
you're<00:02:54.780> holding<00:02:54.900> pressure<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.739> flip<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
you're holding pressure on this flip the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.940 
you're holding pressure on this flip the
CVT<00:02:57.180> cover<00:02:57.540> over<00:02:57.930> again<00:02:58.350> make<00:02:58.530> sure<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.800> don't

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
CVT cover over again make sure you don't

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.490 
CVT cover over again make sure you don't
release<00:02:59.250> pressure<00:02:59.810> once<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:00.930> flip<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.200> CVT

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
release pressure once you flip the CVT

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.110 
release pressure once you flip the CVT
cover<00:03:01.830> over<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.220> should<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.730> there's<00:03:03.060> a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
cover over you should see that there's a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.030 
cover over you should see that there's a
little<00:03:03.360> groove<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.959> kickstart<00:03:04.440> gear<00:03:04.739> here

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
little groove in the kickstart gear here

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.680 
little groove in the kickstart gear here
and<00:03:05.220> that's<00:03:05.820> where<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.440> your<00:03:07.440> snap<00:03:07.739> ring<00:03:07.770> is

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
and that's where a your snap ring is

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.990 
and that's where a your snap ring is
going<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.750> go<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.170> minute<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.760> wanted<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.850> show

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
going to go in a minute I wanted to show

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.400 
going to go in a minute I wanted to show
the<00:03:12.180> first<00:03:12.450> because<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.840> hard<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.080> see<00:03:13.230> once

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
the first because it's hard to see once

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.410 
the first because it's hard to see once
I<00:03:13.500> get<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.770> washer<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.520> there<00:03:14.730> but<00:03:14.940> before<00:03:15.150> you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
I get the washer on there but before you

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.729 
I get the washer on there but before you
do<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.920> start<00:03:16.920> off<00:03:17.070> by<00:03:17.280> sliding<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.850> washer

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
do that start off by sliding the washer

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:26.570 
do that start off by sliding the washer
over<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.769> kickstart<00:03:20.310> gear<00:03:24.230> then<00:03:25.459> you'll<00:03:26.459> need

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
over the kickstart gear then you'll need

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.110 
over the kickstart gear then you'll need
to<00:03:26.670> take<00:03:26.790> your<00:03:26.940> snap<00:03:27.209> ring<00:03:27.450> pliers<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:29.430> open

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
to take your snap ring pliers and open

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.410 
to take your snap ring pliers and open
up<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.360> snap<00:03:30.600> ring<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.790> slide<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.030> on<00:03:33.090> to

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
up the snap ring and slide that on to

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.410 
up the snap ring and slide that on to
the<00:03:33.540> kickstart<00:03:34.350> gear<00:03:34.560> here<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.030> usually<00:03:36.330> get

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
the kickstart gear here so I usually get

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.940 
the kickstart gear here so I usually get
it<00:03:36.570> pretty<00:03:36.750> close<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.290> then<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:37.620> finish

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
it pretty close and then I just finish

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.560 
it pretty close and then I just finish
off<00:03:38.160> pushing<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.700> up<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:39.030> rest<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.450> way

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
off pushing it up the rest of the way

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.880 
off pushing it up the rest of the way
into<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.810> groove<00:03:40.019> with<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.260> flat<00:03:40.709> head

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.449 
into the groove with a flat head
screwdriver<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:42.980> just<00:03:43.980> want<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.160> make<00:03:44.310> sure

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
screwdriver you just want to make sure

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.530 
screwdriver you just want to make sure
that<00:03:44.580> locks<00:03:44.880> into<00:03:45.090> place<00:03:47.269> once<00:03:48.269> you've<00:03:48.390> got

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
that locks into place once you've got

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.300 
that locks into place once you've got
all<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.870> done<00:03:49.110> now<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.709> need<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.040> install

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
all that done now you need to install

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.340 
all that done now you need to install
your<00:03:50.370> kickstart<00:03:50.910> lever<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:51.989> want<00:03:52.290> to

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
your kickstart lever and you want to

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.990

install<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.640> lever<00:04:11.850> coming<00:04:12.209> off<00:04:12.360> of

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
install this to the lever coming off of

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.229 
install this to the lever coming off of
it<00:04:12.660> is<00:04:12.750> about<00:04:13.019> two<00:04:13.260> o'clock<00:04:13.940> so<00:04:14.940> once<00:04:15.120> you

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
it is about two o'clock so once you

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.789 
it is about two o'clock so once you
figured<00:04:15.480> out<00:04:15.600> where<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.780> want<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.229> line<00:04:16.650> up

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
figured out where you want it line up

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.330 
figured out where you want it line up
the<00:04:16.919> splines<00:04:17.250> on<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.729> shaft<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:20.100> lever

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
the splines on the shaft and the lever

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.820 
the splines on the shaft and the lever
and<00:04:20.609> slide<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:21.359> into<00:04:21.570> place<00:04:21.830> sometimes

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
and slide that into place sometimes

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.350 
and slide that into place sometimes
they're<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.039> little<00:04:23.099> stubborn<00:04:23.550> but<00:04:24.090> once<00:04:24.270> you

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
they're a little stubborn but once you

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.420 
they're a little stubborn but once you
know<00:04:24.510> they're<00:04:24.690> lined<00:04:25.200> up<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:26.039> should<00:04:26.250> be<00:04:26.370> able

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
know they're lined up you should be able

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.230 
know they're lined up you should be able
to<00:04:26.550> just<00:04:26.729> kind<00:04:26.880> of

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
to just kind of

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.939 
to just kind of
but<00:04:27.360> on<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.810> once<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.110> lever<00:04:31.289> is<00:04:31.440> basically<00:04:31.770> in

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
but on so once the lever is basically in

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.670 
but on so once the lever is basically in
place<00:04:32.130> then<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.400> need<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.669> bolt<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:33.000> on<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.930> if

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
place then you need to bolt it on and if

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.870 
place then you need to bolt it on and if
you<00:04:34.770> have<00:04:34.919> trouble<00:04:35.340> starting<00:04:35.759> the<00:04:35.970> bolt<00:04:36.180> then

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
you have trouble starting the bolt then

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.520 
you have trouble starting the bolt then
there's<00:04:38.880> actually<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.360> groove<00:04:39.870> between<00:04:40.410> the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
there's actually a groove between the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.980 
there's actually a groove between the
splines<00:04:40.889> on<00:04:41.370> this<00:04:41.729> kicks<00:04:42.000> our<00:04:42.240> gear<00:04:42.509> here<00:04:42.810> and

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
splines on this kicks our gear here and

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.749 
splines on this kicks our gear here and
the<00:04:43.530> bolt<00:04:43.770> needs<00:04:44.039> to<00:04:44.280> line<00:04:44.430> up<00:04:44.460> with<00:04:44.610> that

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
the bolt needs to line up with that

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.279 
the bolt needs to line up with that
groove<00:04:45.090> where<00:04:45.389> you<00:04:45.479> won't<00:04:45.599> be<00:04:45.690> able<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:46.020> start

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
groove where you won't be able to start

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.529 
groove where you won't be able to start
it<00:04:46.470> so<00:04:47.340> once<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:47.610> get<00:04:47.699> that<00:04:47.759> started<00:04:48.210> just<00:04:48.389> go

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
it so once you get that started just go

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:56.159 
it so once you get that started just go
ahead<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.840> tighten<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.139> all<00:04:49.319> the<00:04:49.440> way<00:04:49.560> up

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.020 

so<00:04:56.860> once<00:04:57.039> that's<00:04:57.189> tightened<00:04:57.490> up<00:04:57.729> you<00:04:57.849> should

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
so once that's tightened up you should

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.360 
so once that's tightened up you should
see<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.199> kickstart<00:04:59.889> gear<00:05:00.069> should<00:05:00.249> be

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
see that the kickstart gear should be

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.499 
see that the kickstart gear should be
moving<00:05:00.729> everything<00:05:01.090> under<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.419> case<00:05:03.449> now<00:05:04.449> we

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
moving everything under the case now we

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.209 
moving everything under the case now we
can<00:05:04.719> flip<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:05.020> CBT<00:05:05.409> cover<00:05:05.650> over<00:05:05.889> to<00:05:05.979> finish

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:06.219 
can flip the CBT cover over to finish

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.249 
can flip the CBT cover over to finish
the<00:05:06.310> job<00:05:06.520> you<00:05:06.909> should<00:05:07.270> just<00:05:07.599> have<00:05:07.779> this<00:05:07.960> gear

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
the job you should just have this gear

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.269 
the job you should just have this gear
here<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:10.150> little<00:05:10.360> metal<00:05:10.509> piece<00:05:10.810> that

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:11.279 
here and the little metal piece that

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.679 
here and the little metal piece that
holds<00:05:12.279> it<00:05:12.370> in<00:05:12.430> place<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:13.210> what<00:05:13.330> you'll<00:05:13.509> need

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:13.689 
holds it in place and what you'll need

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:15.659 
holds it in place and what you'll need
to<00:05:13.779> do<00:05:13.900> is<00:05:14.110> drop<00:05:14.319> this<00:05:14.529> gear<00:05:14.830> in<00:05:15.039> so<00:05:15.400> this

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
to do is drop this gear in so this

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.499 
to do is drop this gear in so this
should<00:05:16.180> engage<00:05:16.349> these<00:05:17.349> teeth<00:05:17.680> here<00:05:18.069> and<00:05:18.509> this

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
should engage these teeth here and this

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.709 
should engage these teeth here and this
piece<00:05:19.749> is<00:05:20.020> going<00:05:20.439> to<00:05:20.499> go<00:05:20.590> here<00:05:21.069> and<00:05:21.300> your<00:05:22.300> CVT

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
piece is going to go here and your CVT

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.749 
piece is going to go here and your CVT
cover<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:23.919> just<00:05:24.099> kind<00:05:24.279> of<00:05:24.340> slide<00:05:24.550> that

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
cover so you just kind of slide that

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.899 
cover so you just kind of slide that
into<00:05:24.879> place<00:05:25.150> on<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.389> pin<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:27.460> you'll<00:05:27.639> want<00:05:27.789> to

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
into place on the pin and you'll want to

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.999 
into place on the pin and you'll want to
hold<00:05:28.659> a<00:05:28.810> little<00:05:29.020> bit<00:05:29.110> of<00:05:29.199> pressure<00:05:29.379> on<00:05:29.529> here

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
hold a little bit of pressure on here

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.899 
hold a little bit of pressure on here
and<00:05:30.520> move<00:05:30.939> the<00:05:31.090> kickstart<00:05:31.569> lever<00:05:31.840> and<00:05:32.909> then

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
and move the kickstart lever and then

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.429 
and move the kickstart lever and then
when<00:05:34.090> it<00:05:34.180> comes<00:05:34.330> back<00:05:34.479> down<00:05:34.840> it<00:05:35.020> should<00:05:35.169> kind

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:35.439 
when it comes back down it should kind

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.689 
when it comes back down it should kind
of<00:05:35.469> pull<00:05:35.710> it<00:05:35.830> into<00:05:35.949> place<00:05:36.250> and<00:05:36.279> you<00:05:36.520> may<00:05:36.669> just

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
of pull it into place and you may just

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.029 
of pull it into place and you may just
have<00:05:36.969> to<00:05:37.090> work<00:05:37.270> it<00:05:37.389> in<00:05:37.539> a<00:05:37.569> little<00:05:37.840> bit<00:05:38.039> make

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
have to work it in a little bit make

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.510 
have to work it in a little bit make
sure<00:05:39.219> that's<00:05:39.340> seated<00:05:39.759> all<00:05:39.879> the<00:05:39.909> way<00:05:40.150> down<00:05:41.520> and

sure that's seated all the way down and

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.550 
sure that's seated all the way down and
once<00:05:42.699> that's<00:05:42.879> seated<00:05:43.330> you<00:05:44.199> should<00:05:44.379> be

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
once that's seated you should be

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.409 
once that's seated you should be
finished<00:05:44.889> installing<00:05:45.279> your<00:05:45.610> kick<00:05:46.090> start<00:05:46.360> your
