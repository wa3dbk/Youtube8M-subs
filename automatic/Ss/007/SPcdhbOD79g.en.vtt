wonderful<00:02:03.090> run<00:02:03.299> over<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> top<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.020> he's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
wonderful run over the top and he's

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.770 
wonderful run over the top and he's
default<00:02:04.649> actually<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> left-wing<00:02:06.149> even

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
default actually as a left-wing even

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.850 
default actually as a left-wing even
though<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.869> play<00:02:07.140> them<00:02:07.290> at<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> right<00:02:07.649> wing

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
though I play them at a right wing

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.410 
though I play them at a right wing
because<00:02:08.099> he<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.429> right<00:02:08.700> footed<00:02:09.090> he's<00:02:09.239> got

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
because he is right footed he's got

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.059 
because he is right footed he's got
better<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:10.080> four<00:02:10.349> star<00:02:10.530> weak<00:02:10.709> foot<00:02:10.890> maybe

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
better I think four star weak foot maybe

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.770 
better I think four star weak foot maybe
just<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.520> Dell<00:02:11.730> FAU<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.300> he's<00:02:12.450> an<00:02:12.599> absolute

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
just like Dell FAU but he's an absolute

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.190 
just like Dell FAU but he's an absolute
handful<00:02:13.500> i'm<00:02:13.590> pretty<00:02:13.770> sure<00:02:13.920> he

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
handful i'm pretty sure he

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.020 
handful i'm pretty sure he
play<00:02:14.379> anywhere<00:02:14.830> across<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.400> top<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.640> he'd<00:02:15.879> be

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
play anywhere across the top and he'd be

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.690 
play anywhere across the top and he'd be
extremely<00:02:16.840> strong<00:02:17.170> loses<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.099> but<00:02:18.340> we<00:02:18.430> managed

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
kind of you know exciting talent from

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.970 
kind of you know exciting talent from
the<00:03:28.329> BPL<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.900> price<00:03:29.079> would<00:03:29.230> be<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.380> lot<00:03:29.739> higher

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
the BPL the price would be a lot higher

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.470 
the BPL the price would be a lot higher
yeah<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.459> don't<00:03:30.670> know<00:03:30.730> if<00:03:30.819> manager<00:03:31.150> mode<00:03:31.269> takes

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
yeah I don't know if manager mode takes

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.120 
yeah I don't know if manager mode takes
that<00:03:31.690> into<00:03:31.870> consideration<00:03:32.079> at<00:03:32.709> all<00:03:32.799> but<00:03:33.040> in

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
that into consideration at all but in

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.770 
that into consideration at all but in
real<00:03:33.340> life<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.549> certainly<00:03:34.180> would<00:03:34.480> be<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
real life that certainly would be the

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.620 
real life that certainly would be the
case<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.319> so<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.769> think<00:03:36.190> it's<00:03:36.430> kind<00:03:36.910> of<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.329> when

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
case and so I think it's kind of it when

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.360 
case and so I think it's kind of it when
you<00:03:37.720> look<00:03:37.870> at<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.139> BPL<00:03:38.650> these<00:03:38.859> days<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.220> look

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
you look at the BPL these days you look

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.860 
you look at the BPL these days you look
at<00:03:39.459> teams<00:03:39.670> that<00:03:39.880> are<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.389> know<00:03:40.480> having

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
at teams that are you know having

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.479 
at teams that are you know having
success<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.560> lot<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.739> times<00:03:42.040> they're<00:03:42.250> going

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
success and a lot of times they're going

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.800 
success and a lot of times they're going
out<00:03:42.579> and<00:03:42.639> they're<00:03:42.760> buying<00:03:43.000> players<00:03:43.359> from

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
out and they're buying players from

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.170 
out and they're buying players from
other<00:03:44.109> leagues<00:03:44.769> for<00:03:45.250> cheaper<00:03:45.670> prices<00:03:45.910> now

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
other leagues for cheaper prices now

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.150 
other leagues for cheaper prices now
that's<00:03:46.630> not<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.810> say<00:03:47.079> like<00:03:47.319> Manchester<00:03:47.769> United

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
that's not to say like Manchester United

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.129 
that's not to say like Manchester United
didn't<00:03:48.400> splash<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.940> cast<00:03:49.120> on<00:03:49.359> a<00:03:49.389> cash<00:03:49.660> on<00:03:49.900> our

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
didn't splash the cast on a cash on our

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.960 
didn't splash the cast on a cash on our
VP<00:03:50.470> but<00:03:50.650> Arsenal<00:03:51.040> was<00:03:51.160> gonna<00:03:51.340> end<00:03:51.519> up<00:03:51.639> having

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
VP but Arsenal was gonna end up having

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.699 
VP but Arsenal was gonna end up having
to<00:03:52.030> let<00:03:52.150> him<00:03:52.299> go<00:03:52.450> 26<00:03:52.989> million<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.380> think<00:03:53.590> he's

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
to let him go 26 million I think he's

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.559 
to let him go 26 million I think he's
proven<00:03:54.190> his<00:03:54.310> worth<00:03:54.340> with<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:54.790> but<00:03:55.329> you<00:03:55.389> look

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
proven his worth with that but you look

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.509 
proven his worth with that but you look
at<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.780> likes<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.170> Shinji<00:03:56.650> Kagawa<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.430> they

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
at the likes of Shinji Kagawa that they

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.370 
at the likes of Shinji Kagawa that they

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
paid 11 or 12 million for when you

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.900
