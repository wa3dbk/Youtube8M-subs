I<00:00:11.570> think<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.690> my<00:00:12.809> movement<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.320> carving<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
I think of my movement is carving in the

I think of my movement is carving in the
space<00:00:15.650> moving<00:00:16.650> sculpture<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:17.580> quite

specific before I start a piece I very
often<00:00:21.510> don't<00:00:21.990> really<00:00:22.529> analyze<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.279> because<00:00:23.760> I

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
often don't really analyze it because I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.939 
often don't really analyze it because I
want<00:00:24.180> something<00:00:24.480> very<00:00:24.810> fresh<00:00:25.109> down<00:00:25.439> I'm

I heard years ago and that often happens
I<00:01:35.600> listen<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.020> piece<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.319> music<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.649> think

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
I listen to a piece of music I think

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.410 
I listen to a piece of music I think
what<00:01:36.920> love<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.220> do<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.429> after<00:01:37.580> that<00:01:37.819> and<00:01:38.330> it

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
what love to do it after that and it

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.010 
what love to do it after that and it
just<00:01:38.659> doesn't<00:01:38.840> happen<00:01:39.110> for<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.440> while<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:39.890> saw<00:01:40.490> it

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
just doesn't happen for a while I saw it

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.450 
just doesn't happen for a while I saw it
choreographed<00:01:42.020> by<00:01:42.229> someone<00:01:42.619> else<00:01:42.830> about<00:01:43.190> a

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
choreographed by someone else about a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.520 
choreographed by someone else about a
year<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:43.940> half<00:01:44.149> ago<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:44.810> thought<00:01:44.990> right

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
year and a half ago and I thought right

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.529 
year and a half ago and I thought right
that's<00:01:46.250> even<00:01:46.640> more<00:01:46.880> wonderful<00:01:47.210> than<00:01:47.330> I

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
that's even more wonderful than I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.930 
that's even more wonderful than I
thought<00:01:47.810> I'd<00:01:48.319> really<00:01:48.950> like<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.399> make<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.610> piece

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
thought I'd really like to make a piece

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.450 
thought I'd really like to make a piece
that<00:01:49.970> really<00:01:50.300> investigates<00:01:51.080> this<00:01:51.289> music<00:01:51.770> yes

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.950 

so<00:01:55.460> at<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.640> moment<00:01:56.000> I'm<00:01:56.179> working<00:01:56.210> on<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.750> last

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
so at the moment I'm working on the last

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.719 
so at the moment I'm working on the last
movement<00:01:57.590> which<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.130> quite<00:01:58.369> complicated

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
movement which is quite complicated

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.120 
movement which is quite complicated
music<00:01:59.149> is<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.690> most<00:01:59.990> complicated<00:02:00.409> keep

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
music is the most complicated keep

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.399 
music is the most complicated keep
stopping<00:02:01.429> and<00:02:01.670> starting<00:02:01.940> very<00:02:02.750> very<00:02:03.140> tricky

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
stopping and starting very very tricky

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.279 
stopping and starting very very tricky
counts<00:02:04.039> all<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.880> like<00:02:05.060> up<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.719> backside<00:02:06.110> goes

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
counts all the like up the backside goes

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.830 
counts all the like up the backside goes
into<00:02:06.560> material<00:02:07.039> that's<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.610> that's<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.360> I'm

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
into material that's it that's it I'm

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.479 
into material that's it that's it I'm
relying<00:02:09.229> on<00:02:09.380> fill<00:02:09.769> the<00:02:09.920> lock<00:02:10.100> because<00:02:10.340> he's

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
relying on fill the lock because he's

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.100 
relying on fill the lock because he's
very<00:02:10.549> musical<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.269> just<00:02:11.480> does<00:02:11.660> things<00:02:11.959> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
very musical that just does things and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.100 
very musical that just does things and
then<00:02:12.230> looks<00:02:12.470> at<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.910> that's<00:02:13.910> quite<00:02:14.150> nice<00:02:14.299> but

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
then looks at you that's quite nice but

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.949 
then looks at you that's quite nice but
I<00:02:15.140> want<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.860> try<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.640> get<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.060> blocked<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:17.660> as

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
I want to try and get it blocked in as

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.630 
I want to try and get it blocked in as
soon<00:02:18.140> as<00:02:18.290> possible<00:02:18.739> because<00:02:18.799> then<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.160> can<00:02:19.370> step

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
soon as possible because then I can step

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.610 
soon as possible because then I can step
back<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.150> then<00:02:20.540> I'll<00:02:20.690> come<00:02:20.930> back<00:02:20.959> later
