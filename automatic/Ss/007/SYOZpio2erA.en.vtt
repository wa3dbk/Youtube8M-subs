good<00:00:09.320> hey<00:00:10.320> what<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:10.800> up<00:00:11.010> guys<00:00:11.070> wizard<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
good hey what is up guys wizard and

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.749 
good hey what is up guys wizard and
today<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.900> want<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.469> talk<00:00:13.740> about<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.370> theory

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
today I want to talk about the theory

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.769 
today I want to talk about the theory
where<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.780> see<00:00:16.049> 5<00:00:16.440> f9<00:00:16.859> made<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.670> video<00:00:18.060> about<00:00:18.330> I

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
where you see 5 f9 made a video about I

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.109 
where you see 5 f9 made a video about I
can<00:00:19.289> tell<00:00:19.500> already<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.100> super<00:00:20.580> sick<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
can tell already it's super sick and

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.300 
can tell already it's super sick and
it's<00:00:21.359> definitely<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.380> blow<00:00:22.560> your<00:00:22.890> mind

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it's definitely going to blow your mind

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.720 
it's definitely going to blow your mind
so<00:00:23.900> everything<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.260> theory<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.920> actually

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
so everything in this theory is actually

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.019 
so everything in this theory is actually
a<00:00:26.760> reference<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.619> GTA<00:00:28.619> san<00:00:28.800> andreas<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:29.340> from

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
let's move on here this tag says the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.640 
let's move on here this tag says the
easiest<00:02:50.370> way<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.910> enter<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.780> bunker<00:02:52.410> is

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
easiest way to enter the bunker is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.910 
easiest way to enter the bunker is
through<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.370> blast<00:02:53.670> doors<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.720> open<00:02:55.110> DS<00:02:55.260> go

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
through the blast doors the open DS go

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.880 
through the blast doors the open DS go
to<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.220> control<00:02:56.850> tower<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.080> city<00:02:58.590> with

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.820 
to the control tower so a city with
bunker<00:02:59.430> in<00:02:59.580> and<00:02:59.760> again<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.360> immediately<00:03:01.170> think

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
bunker in and again I immediately think

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.670 
bunker in and again I immediately think
of<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.160> bunker<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.970> GTA<00:03:03.390> 5<00:03:03.720> where<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.470> green

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
of the bunker in GTA 5 where the green

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.550 
of the bunker in GTA 5 where the green
light<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.250> at<00:03:05.400> 3<00:03:05.610> a.m.<00:03:05.810> but<00:03:06.810> yeah<00:03:07.020> go<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560
