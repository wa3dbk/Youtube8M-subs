right here is the the crash bar that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.260 
right here is the the crash bar that
you're<00:00:32.250> gonna<00:00:32.340> attach<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.079> you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.230> see

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
you're gonna attach it to you can see

kind of one of the the bracket cells
parallel<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> ground<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.379> drilled<00:00:40.950> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
parallel with the ground I drilled to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.799 
parallel with the ground I drilled to
the<00:00:41.070> bottom<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.270> crash<00:00:42.540> bar

you'll see where that's gonna go it's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.279 
you'll see where that's gonna go it's
basically<00:00:45.149> looking<00:00:45.329> through<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> top<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
basically looking through the top you

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.720 
basically looking through the top you
can<00:00:46.320> see<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> top<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.550> heat

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
can see just the top of the heat

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.360 
can see just the top of the heat
exchanger<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.800> look<00:00:49.800> into<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> grill

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
exchanger here look into the grill

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.130 
exchanger here look into the grill
excuse<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.329> dead<00:00:51.600> bugs<00:00:52.219> is<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:54.270> heat

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
excuse the dead bugs is the heat

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.549 
excuse the dead bugs is the heat
exchanger<00:00:56.300> there's<00:00:57.300> probably<00:00:59.809> maybe<00:01:00.809> five

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
exchanger there's probably maybe five

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.469 
exchanger there's probably maybe five
inches<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.910> space<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.870> between<00:01:03.899> there

inches or so of space in between there

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.030 
inches or so of space in between there
it's<00:01:06.479> decently<00:01:06.930> close<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.470> pretty<00:01:07.619> far<00:01:07.799> back

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040

and you install let's see if I can get

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.660 
and you install let's see if I can get
the<00:01:14.820> bottom<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.979> all<00:01:16.979> right<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.310> from<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the bottom here all right going from the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.690 
the bottom here all right going from the
bottom<00:01:18.530> that's<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:20.100> there's<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
bottom that's it up here there's the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.780 
bottom that's it up here there's the
inlet<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.540> outlet<00:01:22.009> but<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.640> along

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
inlet and outlet but just going along

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.710 
inlet and outlet but just going along
this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.580> bottom<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.030> crash<00:01:27.450> bar

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
this is the bottom of the crash bar

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.990 
this is the bottom of the crash bar
bottom<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> heat<00:01:28.680> exchanger<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.400> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
bottom of the heat exchanger here you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.490 
bottom of the heat exchanger here you
can<00:01:30.150> see<00:01:30.299> where<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> drilled<00:01:30.810> into<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.140> bottom

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
can see where I drilled into the bottom

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.600 
can see where I drilled into the bottom
of<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.740> again<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:34.009> crash<00:01:35.009> bar<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> little

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
of it again the crash bar is a little

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
of it again the crash bar is a little
bit<00:01:35.820> bowed<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> front<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.840> guess<00:01:37.020> they're

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
bit bowed in the front I guess they're

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.050 
bit bowed in the front I guess they're
kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> curved<00:01:37.710> out<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:40.700> just<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.759> little<00:01:41.970> bit

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
kind of curved out so just a little bit

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.749 
kind of curved out so just a little bit
of<00:01:42.150> space<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.360> there<00:01:43.159> but<00:01:44.159> there's<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> only

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
of space in there but there's the only

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.100 
of space in there but there's the only
one<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> other<00:01:45.090> side<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.869> through<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
one on the other side just through the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.620 
one on the other side just through the
bottom<00:01:46.579> there's<00:01:47.579> no<00:01:47.759> real<00:01:47.939> angle<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.509> get

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
bottom there's no real angle I can get

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.139 
bottom there's no real angle I can get
to<00:01:48.750> show<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> top<00:01:50.570> brackets<00:01:51.619> but<00:01:53.149> pretty

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
to show you the top brackets but pretty

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.889 
to show you the top brackets but pretty
much<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.450> it

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
much that's it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.980 
much that's it
all<00:01:55.770> right<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.159> lied<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.689> see

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
all right I lied you actually can see

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.569 
all right I lied you actually can see
the<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.469> top<00:01:58.680> bracket<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.219> from<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the the top bracket this is from the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.219 
the the top bracket this is from the
bottom<00:01:59.880> again<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:03.180> bracket<00:02:03.540> right<00:02:03.570> there<00:02:03.960> is

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
bottom again the bracket right there is

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.670 
bottom again the bracket right there is
the<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.590> bent<00:02:04.979> out<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:06.380> away<00:02:07.380> from<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the one I bent out and away from the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.270 
the one I bent out and away from the
center<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.009> heat<00:02:08.160> exchanger<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
center of the heat exchanger and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.559 
center of the heat exchanger and
basically<00:02:11.280> after<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.610> bent<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.390> put

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
basically after I bent that I just put

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.430 
basically after I bent that I just put
it<00:02:12.660> through<00:02:12.810> where<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it through where the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.100 
it through where the
bolts<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.860> crash<00:02:14.040> bar<00:02:14.340> go<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.110> tightened

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
bolts on the crash bar go and tightened

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.710 
bolts on the crash bar go and tightened
it<00:02:16.170> up<00:02:16.320> aluminum<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.220> pretty<00:02:17.400> soft<00:02:17.720> didn't

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
it up aluminum is pretty soft didn't

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.300 
it up aluminum is pretty soft didn't
mess<00:02:18.870> with<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.110> weld<00:02:19.290> where<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.710> -<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.160> heat

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
mess with the weld where is - that heat

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.020 
mess with the weld where is - that heat
exchanger<00:02:20.660> worked<00:02:21.660> out<00:02:21.780> pretty<00:02:21.960> good<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:23.030> don't

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
exchanger worked out pretty good I don't

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.960 
exchanger worked out pretty good I don't
even<00:02:24.090> know<00:02:24.330> if<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.690> see<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.050> one<00:02:25.970> that's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
even know if I can see this one that's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
even know if I can see this one that's
probably<00:02:27.150> as<00:02:27.390> good<00:02:27.480> as<00:02:27.600> I'm<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.870> get

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
probably as good as I'm going to get

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.150 
probably as good as I'm going to get
over<00:02:28.170> there<00:02:28.320> actually<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:29.130> right<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:31.160> just

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
over there actually it's right here just

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.070 
over there actually it's right here just
right<00:02:32.250> there's<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.910> other<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.960> other

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
right there's the other the other

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.210 
right there's the other the other
bracket<00:02:34.560> there's<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.830> bolt<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.970> goes<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.570> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
bracket there's a bolt that goes to the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.980 
bracket there's a bolt that goes to the
to<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.310> crash<00:02:38.520> bar<00:02:38.850> from<00:02:39.270> part<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.750> frame

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
to the crash bar from part of the frame

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.720 
to the crash bar from part of the frame
I'm<00:02:40.170> guessing<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:43.010> that's<00:02:44.010> where<00:02:44.430> they<00:02:44.550> used

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
I'm guessing and that's where they used

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.410 
I'm guessing and that's where they used
it<00:02:44.880> stock<00:02:45.210> on<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.770> cobalt<00:02:46.770> on<00:02:47.460> their<00:02:48.000> install

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
it stock on the cobalt on their install

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.680 
it stock on the cobalt on their install
ours<00:02:49.320> are<00:02:49.500> just<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:49.770> bit<00:02:49.950> wider<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.690> I

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
ours are just a little bit wider and I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.240 
ours are just a little bit wider and I
just<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.130> said<00:02:53.400> bent<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.120> put<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.540> on

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
just like I said bent it and put it on

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.770 
just like I said bent it and put it on
I'm<00:02:56.250> interested<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.790> see<00:02:56.820> how<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
I'm interested to see how the the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.810 
I'm interested to see how the the
redline<00:02:58.020> specific<00:02:58.500> one<00:02:58.590> works<00:02:58.770> all<00:02:59.700> right

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
redline specific one works all right

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.430 
redline specific one works all right
thanks<00:03:00.210> it's<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.840> little<00:03:00.990> bit<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.230> space<00:03:01.410> in

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
thanks it's that little bit of space in

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.220 
thanks it's that little bit of space in
there<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:02.310> easy<00:03:02.520> piece<00:03:02.870> layout<00:03:03.870> looks<00:03:04.080> like

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
there is easy piece layout looks like

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.070 
there is easy piece layout looks like
it's<00:03:04.350> maybe<00:03:04.500> about<00:03:04.620> an<00:03:04.920> inch<00:03:05.040> or<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.370> closer

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
it's maybe about an inch or so closer

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.930 
it's maybe about an inch or so closer
what<00:03:07.080> theirs<00:03:07.260> would<00:03:07.440> have<00:03:07.560> done<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.730> move

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
what theirs would have done is just move

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.120 
what theirs would have done is just move
that<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.930> front<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.620> crash<00:03:10.830> bar<00:03:11.100> a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
that to the front of the crash bar a

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.320 
that to the front of the crash bar a
little<00:03:11.280> bit<00:03:11.490> more<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:11.850> actually<00:03:12.180> probably

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
little bit more it's actually probably

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.330 
little bit more it's actually probably
gonna<00:03:12.510> be<00:03:12.600> like<00:03:12.810> just<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.230> just<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.100> middle

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
gonna be like just the just the middle

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.290 
gonna be like just the just the middle
of<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:14.580> there<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:16.580> like<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.760> said<00:03:17.820> there's

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
of it there but like I said there's

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.060 
of it there but like I said there's
maybe<00:03:18.510> there's<00:03:19.080> maybe<00:03:19.230> half<00:03:19.530> an<00:03:19.650> inch<00:03:19.800> gap

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
maybe there's maybe half an inch gap

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.130 
maybe there's maybe half an inch gap
just<00:03:20.310> going<00:03:20.520> straight<00:03:20.640> down<00:03:20.820> from<00:03:21.780> top<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.020> the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
just going straight down from top of the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.479 
just going straight down from top of the
heat<00:03:22.290> exchanger<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.890> crash<00:03:23.040> bar<00:03:23.310> how<00:03:23.459> I

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
heat exchanger to the crash bar how I

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.210 
heat exchanger to the crash bar how I
have<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.790> now<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.680> there's<00:03:25.680> my<00:03:25.830> moving<00:03:26.070> up

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
have it now and there's my moving up

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.100 
have it now and there's my moving up
like<00:03:26.370> an<00:03:26.489> inch<00:03:26.640> or<00:03:26.760> two<00:03:26.970> but<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.750> hope<00:03:27.959> that

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
like an inch or two but I hope that

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.730 
like an inch or two but I hope that
helps<00:03:28.410> all<00:03:29.130> right<00:03:29.280> peace
