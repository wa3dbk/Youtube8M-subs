00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.980
 you speak you saw on the first episodes 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.840

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.670
 last two episodes with this tea 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.219

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.469
 then the Egyptian gods are known 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.210

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.710
 den that maybe take away some 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.539
 paper that we really have a lot e 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.179
 structuring a little better if we have to 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.440
 face the expert mode mode 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.159
 sorry that on one's own 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.690
 resurrection 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:01:01.579
 ok let's put them to nice 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:12.590
 then first is not a bit when for 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:14.509
 desktop role then moon then 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:21.039
 we start pretty well from and therefore 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:24.200
 we can do this here I think it was 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:32.299
 which then we put down good at 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:34.189
 alexandre it but nothing for now 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.060
 let's do so now at the lucchini 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.060
 let's see what he does 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.009
 what is it that makes this ok surely ai 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.009
 famous, it 's great 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.210
 1900 was ok but by what it does admire 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.770
 attack okay let's see if we can 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.770
 destroy with the covered part 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:17.520
 ok this place instead 1500 ok 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:20.550
 then we do not know sincerely yes 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.980
 they put it down when this part comes 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.630
 destroyed the first store destroyed the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.920
 his player suffers damage ok that's fine 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.010
 so we can do to summon him 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.160
 meanwhile the stadiums have never been used 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.030
 we produce wait a moment for 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.600
 our machines 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:46.620
 so we can do so ok 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:50.850
 we select him nice 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.890
 and now we list more we do 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:03:00.060
 the direct attack unless it has 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:03.890
 hand made that I can lock in 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.359
 place then batten face 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.620
 if you see that I do strange things 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.900
 because they really are really put 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.549
 bad just want to record audio 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.250
 and naruto who have some days not 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:21.200
 so I did it even two 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.200
 assemblies now let's do the g 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.790
 and let's put him down though 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.470
 on the contrary, we first activate 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.950
 the effect since you lied to me 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:45.640
 then go two texts no he had to fuck off 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:48.450
 In that case go to 1600 minimum minimums 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.450
 I went direct 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.410
 sorry and no player takes damage 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.630
 so it is only for what I know how to destroy 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:09.250
 the monster we attack and we can 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:21.590
 sacrifice it maybe for others showing 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:24.320
 now I understand it's over ok then if 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.440
 I got it right if I call you he a 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.440
 kurt hamrin destroyed, however, for now 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.010
 then we do so that we never go anymore 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:40.090
 on the safe side by the two heads upset 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:51.920
 the well by a fucking oh weapons 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:54.470
 we still attach no what is lacking a 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:59.200
 reduces attack which will therefore be 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:06.770
 we attack nothing happens but right 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:10.820
 safety is between them do something or 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:16.690
 attachments destroy on brown so 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.690
 what does getafe do now 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:35.020
 low we do so better in the meantime 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:37.660
 keep it there the cyber good then 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.030
 let 's talk about getting two tests out 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:47.919
 drive for the third time at least from aica 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:52.990
 a buoy finally then if we 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:57.960
 now let's do 2008 2000 made the 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:01.660
 format missing the recent 3.100 3.900 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:15.220
 it had already begun in the meantime 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:18.090
 let's leave them like this, never risk 1800 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.090
 all attacks 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:32.210
 at this point we have to do so you know 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:44.389
 that maybe we can destroy it 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:46.560
