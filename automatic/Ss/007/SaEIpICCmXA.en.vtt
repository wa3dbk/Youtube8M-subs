00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
mechanism that tensions the chain that

mechanism that tensions the chain that
goes<00:00:25.980> around<00:00:26.490> your<00:00:26.789> starter<00:00:27.240> clutch<00:00:27.449> etc<00:00:28.109> as

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
goes around your starter clutch etc as

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.670 
goes around your starter clutch etc as
you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.279> see<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:30.769> little<00:00:31.769> piece<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.309> my<00:00:32.340> hand

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
you can see this little piece in my hand

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.440 
you can see this little piece in my hand
would<00:00:34.680> ratchet<00:00:35.809> up<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> down<00:00:38.090> this<00:00:39.090> bit

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
would ratchet up and down this bit

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.200 
would ratchet up and down this bit
there's<00:00:39.780> teeth<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.469> top<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.129> perhaps<00:00:41.969> you

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
there's teeth on top of it perhaps you

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.529 
there's teeth on top of it perhaps you
can<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.110> ambient<00:00:43.739> there<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.160> are

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
can see them this ambient there they are

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:52.400 
can see them this ambient there they are
I'll<00:00:45.539> turn<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:47.329> this<00:00:48.410> bit<00:00:50.030> here<00:00:51.379> has<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
I'll turn it and this bit here has a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.130 
I'll turn it and this bit here has a
tooth<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.399> end<00:00:53.610> would<00:00:54.480> ratchet<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
tooth on one end would ratchet up and

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
tooth on one end would ratchet up and
down<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> spring<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.059> broken

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
down it you can see the spring is broken

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.250 
down it you can see the spring is broken
on<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:59.300> has<00:01:00.300> collapsed<00:01:00.980> upon<00:01:01.980> itself

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
on here and has collapsed upon itself

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.550 
on here and has collapsed upon itself
completely<00:01:05.360> completely<00:01:06.360> buggered<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.020> this

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
completely completely buggered you this

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.620 
completely completely buggered you this
is<00:01:07.799> doesn't<00:01:08.280> even<00:01:08.400> look<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.790> spring<00:01:09.299> take

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
is doesn't even look like a spring take

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.580 
is doesn't even look like a spring take
a<00:01:09.659> look<00:01:10.850> let's<00:01:11.850> bring<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> all<00:01:12.450> anyway<00:01:13.380> where

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
a look let's bring it all anyway where

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.370 
a look let's bring it all anyway where
that<00:01:13.770> comes<00:01:14.100> from<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.140> hopefully<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.350> have

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that comes from and hopefully we have

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.440 
that comes from and hopefully we have
enough<00:01:16.740> ambient<00:01:17.100> light<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.180> have

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
enough ambient light you can see I have

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.609 
enough ambient light you can see I have
the<00:01:19.520> chain<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.380> wire

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the chain with a little bit of wire

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.880 
the chain with a little bit of wire
wired<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.430> there<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.479> right<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
wired up in there but right here at the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.999 
wired up in there but right here at the
end<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.130> my<00:01:26.250> fingers<00:01:26.990> further<00:01:27.990> back<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
end of my fingers further back is the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.690 
end of my fingers further back is the
tensioner<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.659> would<00:01:30.930> go<00:01:31.619> against<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
tensioner that would go against the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.969 
tensioner that would go against the
chain<00:01:34.009> this<00:01:35.009> bit<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:36.299> that's<00:01:36.479> broken

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
chain this bit down here that's broken

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.490 
chain this bit down here that's broken
would<00:01:37.979> apply<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> tension<00:01:39.329> without<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
would apply the tension without the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.330 
would apply the tension without the
tension<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.790> chain<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.619> your<00:01:43.619> starter

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
tension on the chain then your starter

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.590 
tension on the chain then your starter
is<00:01:46.070> here<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.430> gear<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> slip

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
is here your gear is just going to slip

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.120 
is here your gear is just going to slip
within<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> chain<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.649> was<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> noise

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
within the chain and that was the noise

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.090 
within the chain and that was the noise
that<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.640> hearing<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:52.229> thing<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.590> mounts

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that I was hearing the thing that mounts

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
that I was hearing the thing that mounts
this<00:01:53.570> has<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:55.700> bolt<00:01:56.700> out<00:01:56.939> here<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.899> there's

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
this has a bolt out here but there's

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.490 
this has a bolt out here but there's
also<00:01:58.200> another<00:01:59.090> back<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.320> then

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
also another back in here and then

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.980 
also another back in here and then
there's<00:02:01.759> one<00:02:02.759> further<00:02:03.210> down<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.810> there

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
there's one further down in there

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.569 
there's one further down in there
they're<00:02:04.229> very<00:02:04.259> difficult<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.009> get<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> it

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
they're very difficult to get to it

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.160 
they're very difficult to get to it
would<00:02:05.759> mean<00:02:05.909> taking<00:02:06.329> apart<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> whole<00:02:06.869> motor

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
would mean taking apart the whole motor

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.029 
would mean taking apart the whole motor
so<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.770> did<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.849> replace<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.899> part

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
so I did to replace the part

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.869 
so I did to replace the part
also<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.790> bag<00:02:12.319> here<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.980> bit<00:02:14.519> of

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.380 

aluminum<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:18.560> believe<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.909> this<00:02:21.120> came

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
aluminum I believe that and this came

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.130 
aluminum I believe that and this came
out<00:02:21.540> from<00:02:21.750> down<00:02:21.959> by<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.260> oil<00:02:22.530> pump<00:02:23.689> it<00:02:24.689> looks

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
out from down by the oil pump it looks

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.930 
out from down by the oil pump it looks
like<00:02:25.349> a<00:02:25.709> bit<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.280> casting<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:29.220> bit

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
like a bit of casting and it was a bit

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.050 
like a bit of casting and it was a bit
where<00:02:30.239> where<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.430> tensioner<00:02:32.430> were<00:02:32.640> where

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
where where the tensioner were where

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.490 
where where the tensioner were where
these<00:02:33.239> are<00:02:33.450> mounted<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:35.069> has<00:02:35.310> broken

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
these are mounted so it has broken

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.140 
these are mounted so it has broken
somewhere<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.590> there<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.069> bit<00:02:38.370> setup<00:02:38.700> falling

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
somewhere in there and bit setup falling
