00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it and the rear of debate allows me to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.390 
it and the rear of debate allows me to
attach<00:01:21.600> any<00:01:21.990> bait<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.710> want<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> put<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.369> it

attach any bait that I want to put on it

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.820 
attach any bait that I want to put on it
rather<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> crankbait<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:25.020> spinnerbait

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
rather it be a crankbait a spinnerbait

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.350 
rather it be a crankbait a spinnerbait
or<00:01:26.700> maybe<00:01:26.939> even<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:28.100> topwater<00:01:29.100> bait<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.150> want

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
or maybe even a topwater bait if I want

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.710 
or maybe even a topwater bait if I want
to<00:01:30.450> fish<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> bait<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.049> top<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> there's<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.420> big

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
to fish the bait on top so there's a big

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.749 
to fish the bait on top so there's a big
variety<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.680> then<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:37.460> spin<00:01:38.460> rigs

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
variety and then we have the spin rigs

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.950 
variety and then we have the spin rigs
we<00:01:39.689> got<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> double<00:01:40.409> willow<00:01:40.619> leaf<00:01:41.750> which<00:01:42.750> is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
we got a double willow leaf which is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.260 
we got a double willow leaf which is
going<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> create<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.860> little<00:01:44.250> more<00:01:44.399> vibrations

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
going to create a little more vibrations

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.819 
going to create a little more vibrations
when<00:01:45.509> you're<00:01:45.689> fishing<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.170> bait<00:01:46.350> underneath

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
when you're fishing the bait underneath

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.670 
when you're fishing the bait underneath
the<00:01:47.009> surface

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
the surface

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.330 
the surface
water<00:01:48.900> we<00:01:49.900> have<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.320> with<00:01:50.500> double<00:01:50.950> will<00:01:51.160> and

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
water we have it with double will and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.800 
water we have it with double will and
leaves<00:01:51.550> or<00:01:52.270> we<00:01:52.810> have<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.910> Colorado

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
leaves or we have it with the Colorado

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.830 
leaves or we have it with the Colorado
in<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.350> will<00:01:56.650> early<00:01:57.300> so<00:01:58.300> you<00:01:58.360> got<00:01:58.600> two

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
in the will early so you got two

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.120 
in the will early so you got two
versions<00:01:59.410> of<00:01:59.680> the<00:02:00.070> boost<00:02:00.580> spin<00:02:00.970> rigs<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
versions of the boost spin rigs to

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.360 
versions of the boost spin rigs to
attach<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:04.660> what<00:02:04.870> this<00:02:05.050> allows<00:02:05.110> an<00:02:05.770> angler<00:02:06.160> to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
attach and what this allows an angler to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.740 
attach and what this allows an angler to
do<00:02:06.550> is<00:02:06.760> really<00:02:07.090> be<00:02:07.240> creative<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:09.009> far<00:02:09.399> as<00:02:09.750> it

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
do is really be creative as far as it

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.750 
do is really be creative as far as it
opens<00:02:11.110> up<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.410> whole<00:02:11.440> new<00:02:11.620> can<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.070> worms<00:02:12.190> is

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
opens up a whole new can of worms is

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.330 
opens up a whole new can of worms is
what<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.000> say<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.720> allows<00:02:14.290> an<00:02:14.560> angler<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.070> take<00:02:15.310> a
