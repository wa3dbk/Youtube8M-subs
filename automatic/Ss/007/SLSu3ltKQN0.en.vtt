 your attention a brief review 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.219

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:18.109
 oklick bt lt 300 bluetooth, here they are 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.470
 headphones design immediately want to say 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.119
 reminds that they are Chinese 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.289
 in the sense of holding something 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 a bit even probably scary fragile 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.700
 but they work no less 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.450
 wonderful sound they perfectly 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.780
 completely satisfied if you look here 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.629
 all plastics 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.450
 dangling maybe this is nothing 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:51.559
 scary button here there is a button 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:59.129
 on-off if and hold 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:01.559
 two or three seconds they turn them on immediately 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.290
 picks up the ipad with which they already 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:11.390
 were synchronized as if to see 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.390
 generally connected is written 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.970
 that is, I immediately turn on the music 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.970
 any kind of occasion music 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.330
 Well, the sound once knew that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.440
 here you can do it louder you can do 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.760
 more quietly with these keys one way 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.020
 press hold 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.750
 it makes it quieter short press 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.890
 means turning the track 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.890
 make the other side louder 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.290
 Respectively press it once 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.290
 also switch the track 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.390
 it's probably hard to hear here but 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.300
 twisted 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.700
 pressing the middle one means 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.430
 pause pause 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.860
 it is in bluetooth mode and also can 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.200
 connect via regular jack 35 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:29.099
 millimeters through aux here 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.440
 usb mini usb connectors for recharging 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:36.560
 the set has only successful now 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:43.470
 complete lace 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:46.590
 You can charge this from a computer 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.140
 thing can be charged through it in 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.060
 Included also is a cable jack to jack 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.760
 just in case things 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.410
 useless since he's boxes hard 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.680
 uncomfortable this lace 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.640
 but you all know what you can buy in 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.480
 many stores 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:10.110
 similar not so expensive that's the point 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.019
 understandable if connected to another 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.769
 device, but first turn off the two too 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.959
 three seconds if we want to him if we want 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.920
 to another device take my super 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.239
 nokia smart phone trying to 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.239
 connect let's say to him 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.450
 bluetooth device connection enabled 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.640
 so that he understood what you need to connect 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.050
 you need to hold the same button 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.000
 turning on just a little longer to those 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.600
 until it burns like this 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.490
 alternating signal blue red 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.160
 now it will connect to that device 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.800
 which 1 comes to connect to it 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:02.670
 In this case, the phone connection is Oleg 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:08.090
 quarrels hail is connected now if its 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:12.980
 will turn off connected quickly said ways 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:20.609
 I hope you all can see I wash myself 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:22.410
 connected generally disable all 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.690
 is disabled 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.170
 now when i turn it on just hold 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.870
 two or three seconds 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.960
 it turns on it is synchronized immediately 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.840
 with the phone connect confirm ipad 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.000
 He already forgets to return to the iPad 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.580
 need to hold again 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.100
 56 seconds but how much is more than two 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:49.530
 anyway when blue will burn 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:52.010
 red signal alternately so here's how 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.010
 time helps 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.499

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.479
 say something with this phone is better 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:06.619
 he is not friends because the sound 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.239
 disgusting does not go through bluetooth 

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:14.899
 there's ipad sound that sounds amazing to me 

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:17.879
 like it this way 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:21.239
 fold can be carried in a bag who 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:23.839
 allow bag sizes on top of head 

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:29.159
 holds soft foam rubber tag 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:32.879
 convenient enough to turn it on 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:40.639
 managed but then generally understand 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:43.800
 easy but you can design a good one 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:48.289
 nice enough brothers important 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.289
