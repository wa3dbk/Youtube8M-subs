00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.160
 and 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.150
 Hello dear friends of the audience 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.060
 channel and today I again you roll on 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.680
 m41 bulldog on the drum and we will 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.770
 shine on a fire arc 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.230
 on the open map fireflies kings 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.480
 if they have allies which 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.940
 help them shoot targets that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.440
 they highlight and very important here 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.250
 understand the following at the moment if you are not 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.890
 destroy firefly 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.790
 if you do not perceive it as a threat 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.100
 then he will just bury your whole team 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.320
 as now in general, I plan to do 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.229
 just bury the whole enemy team 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.680
 starting systematically from the center then 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:58.290
 first-second line then 4 5 and then 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.690
 will already be moving towards the zero line i 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.519
 I see no reason to shine now at 0 if 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.409
 this is a head-on battle and on a head-on battle 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.960
 beautifully tanks from second base 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.030
 ride through the first side of the sixth seventh 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.760
 lines this is normal movement few 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.890
 Remains on 1 2 only those guys who 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.530
 In principle, they do not understand what they got 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 oncoming my first journey gives 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.900
 the opportunity for art sa to shoot off 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.410
 age 11 who immediately went to 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.780
 Centre 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.940
 he understands this perfectly experienced player 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.640
 that the center needs to be held 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.370
 but keep him on a heavy tank against 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.820
 bulldog is almost impossible why 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.770
 see further he is trying to lean out 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.110
 at least take off some firefly but i 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.850
 constantly dodge him 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.860
 interesting at the moment I find and 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.200
 slow but here and yandex 12t 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.300
 which I take on the 400 auto strong 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.440
 spree I take off just on the go 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.320
 holding 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.210
 in auto sight, many asked why 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.670
 the drum is uncomfortable with him there 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.070
 no stabilization no guys drum 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.580
 allows you to shoot on avtopritsele 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.950
 shells just despite the stabilization on 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.750
 near distance they fly perfectly 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.410
 and now it was enough to 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.060
 remove ami 12 sold already highlight i 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.800
 in no way overload 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.860
 line boundary and 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.960
 and showed a little of this one 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.570
 have enough arts should not be much 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.420
 your tanks should not have targets 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.040
 many targets which need to shoot 1 2 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.480
 goals 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.170
 which is more convenient to choose if 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.320
 light all around then unfortunately 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.730
 my great regret 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.010
 blurred focus and that doesn't work i 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.140
 now driving through the second third line 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.450
 and see that my lamp is off 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.180
 I assume that it is possible 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.970
 the enemy is put very deeply and ours 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.070
 E25 at least one she already drove a little 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.250
 closer to the intersection of lines e and d 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.800
 they do not stand in the square b1 b2 and I you 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.860
 showed already fights on prokhorovka on 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.830
 a fire arc where in general many are 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.320
 on line b and on line jay and doesn't see something 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.300
 what happens in the middle and field now 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.480
 they drove so close that i 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.760
 can show opponents on line j on 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.190
 line and even they will be able to shoot him, I 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.400
 I'm starting to get impudent I don't have 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.220
 the lamp I act semicircles drove 100 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.560
 meters gave the circle did not shine another 100 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.170
 meters ahead gave a circle did not shine 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.860
 another 100 meters climb the ridge not 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.630
 glows 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.190
 I do not shine and maybe here at all 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.060
 there is nobody here yet 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.440
 someone's 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.959
 and borscht well, and you understand 2 E25 + 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.510
 from now can calmly by focus on 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.310
 I still need to shoot borscht 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.560
 I will take treated avtopritsel and give him 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.230
 one gram te so of course not 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.790
 has time to react plus 50 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.390
 kilometers per hour which is moving 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.860
 bulldog them not so easy to intercept 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.690
 at the same time I try to be in 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.750
 lowlands so that according to could shoot the type 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.150
 62 of his zones and the next task is 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.860
 recharge and go and light 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.709
 re a couple of our e25 couple from also 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.050
 moving forward you can't stand somewhere 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.359
 on the center this cannot be done if you 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.060
 go on the attack on 1 2 here for example 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.519
 su-100 y he basically can not shoot 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.340
 by those goals because if you notice 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.490
 then my draw square is on 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.020
 two squares lower than sest itself 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.940
 and y and accordingly this problem 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.860
 I understand that someone has disappeared somewhere and 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.200
 I 'm starting to get closer in the bushes 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.270
 closer to the enemy to understand somewhere 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.510
 is on the edge of my 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.780
 light on 425 meters from me between 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.169
 Away from the Optics + ventilation lights Lego 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.210
 his to pallet and to to from e25 all these 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.160
 guys can shoot me now 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.410
 a little more wondering where all the same 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.530
 near hiding showing you for and 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.050
 in a semicircle and return to my niche 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.140
 here after you passed one of 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.840
 lines the whole game is built from niche niche 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.460
 you are your busy life 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.470
 space in which you can 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.169
 skate don't appear with absolutely 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.270
 unexpected side again rolling see 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.610
 here b in the valley 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.919
 and I understand that I can in principle now 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.700
 roll out on a couple take him away 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.650
 The vk 4502 drum is at the top perfectly 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.240
 the longer it costs there the more 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.400
 damage 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.080
 will get explicitly rolling out and 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.900
 I highlight it in the tub 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.690
 plus I leave them in the safe in depth 2 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.060
 below here the devil kill me there 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.650
 even bigger half of the drum can i 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.069
 afford to go out in for 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.160
 In general, I can but you collectively that 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.479
 will kill me but here it is a little bit 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.520
 breaks out of 3 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.289
 and this probability already tends to zero 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.590
 again on avtopritsele go out 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.560
 take the vase and move closer to the corner 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.759
 Immediately the corner and there of course hangs the whole 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.590
 enemy artillery 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.690
 I have a drum here of course 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.729
 ends many will say well here 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.250
 ended the drum you can not do anything 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.830
 i can do everything i can go on 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.870
 shine I do nothing three 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.060
 short range artillery they 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.949
 can just shoot in all directions but 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.960
 I really can not do anything and 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.440
 will die because I have for 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.289
 back 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.419
 a huge number of su-100 y barrels already 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.690
 boldly flies ahead there are three 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:27.569
 opponent t-44 lion and 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.479
 e25 that all shone and we know that 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:32.639
 they for e25 pass on me to leave but 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.469
 I honestly do not see him at this moment 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.920
 I'm trying to shoot. Anyone thinks that 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:36.750
 exactly 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.070
 shines me i see what starts for me 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.650
 Gold damage 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.650
 react to e25 let him go a little 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.500
 ahead and skip for ourselves now we 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.430
 moving in parallel and we have faithful 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:54.690
 chance and really flies to me from my and 25 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:56.790
 damage but still my friend is the same 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.340
 the very thing that struck me after all 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.080
 covers up and destroy not 25 like you 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.480
 You know, despite what goes 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.730
 quite a long base capture 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.620
 opponents are now the only thing 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.710
 our team needs to do it 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.740
 roll out and pick up the remaining 44-ku 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:16.890
 what did in this fight in this fight was 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:20.220
 the center was completely destroyed because it lived 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.400
 firefly completely destroyed the center because 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.520
 that the firefly lived on open maps so 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:29.070
 will happen constantly if you don't 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.320
 will destroy the color at the beginning if you 

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:34.440
 you will not react to it and you will 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.410
 underestimate him well on this today 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.500
