 I'm being called memory enhancing iq overturned 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:32.530
 According to our survey , by the year 2030 , the Pungent IQ is 192 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.190
 But less so to talk about the plight

 80 percent of those who do not have a lot of variety are too old to work after 10 years 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.719
 80 percent of jobs go away. 

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:07.339
 Now there is no place to fix this is multiplayer 

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:11.659
 I do not ask for it. 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:16.520
 If only everything in five years dissipates only John 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:21.169
 So you need a life design . Oh. Right now. 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.039
 Today's affair in yoger majors is critical in 15 years . 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:27.259
 I will. 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:32.749
 Just a little later in the doegetda be a little later another study that Swish 2 Park Sang-in 

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:34.339
 No, not at all, not at all. 

00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:39.319
