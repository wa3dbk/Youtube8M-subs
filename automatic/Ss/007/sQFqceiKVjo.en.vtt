so<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.909> instance<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.450> say<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> only<00:01:30.840> want

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
so for instance you can say I only want

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.380 
so for instance you can say I only want
to<00:01:31.170> limit<00:01:31.320> 25<00:01:31.650> skips<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:32.460> maybe<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.790> 50<00:01:33.119> skips

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
to limit 25 skips or maybe in 50 skips

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.990 
to limit 25 skips or maybe in 50 skips

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
edits that you need and so you can

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.780 
edits that you need and so you can
continue<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.689> refine<00:01:45.990> your<00:01:46.490> shadows<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.640> can

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
continue to refine your shadows you can

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.550 
continue to refine your shadows you can
you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.210> play<00:01:48.360> test<00:01:48.659> them<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.079> give<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
you can play test them and give you a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.719 
you can play test them and give you a
little<00:01:49.649> bit<00:01:49.829> test<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.189> what<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.369> takes<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
little bit test of what it takes to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.080 
little bit test of what it takes to
build<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.299> game<00:01:51.950> for<00:01:52.950> our<00:01:53.070> advanced<00:01:53.399> players<00:01:53.759> we

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
build a game for our advanced players we

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.789 
build a game for our advanced players we
added<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.509> new<00:01:54.659> feature<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.439> called

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
added a new feature in here called

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.280 
added a new feature in here called
master<00:01:56.189> mode<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.820> master<00:01:57.240> mode<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.810> something

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
master mode and master mode is something

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.800 
master mode and master mode is something
that<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.460> focused<00:01:59.880> on<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> poor<00:02:00.570> player

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
that is really focused on a poor player

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.469 
that is really focused on a poor player
and<00:02:01.310> in<00:02:02.310> master<00:02:02.759> mode<00:02:02.909> you'll<00:02:03.119> notice<00:02:03.450> that

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
and in master mode you'll notice that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.560 
and in master mode you'll notice that
there's<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.439> no<00:02:04.799> sense<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.180> tetra

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
there's really no sense of the the tetra

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.119 
there's really no sense of the the tetra
menos<00:02:06.810> actually<00:02:07.110> dropping<00:02:07.350> they<00:02:07.740> drop<00:02:07.950> as

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
menos actually dropping they drop as

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.559 
menos actually dropping they drop as
fast<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.489> they<00:02:08.580> appear<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> screen<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
fast as they appear on the screen and

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.530 
fast as they appear on the screen and
this<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.649> definitely<00:02:11.099> something<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.550> we

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
this is definitely something that we

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.440 
this is definitely something that we
recommend

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
recommend

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.690 
recommend
to<00:02:13.690> familiarize<00:02:14.410> yourself<00:02:14.980> with<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.220> general

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
to familiarize yourself with the general

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.119 
to familiarize yourself with the general
gameplay<00:02:16.000> mechanics<00:02:16.690> get<00:02:16.959> set<00:02:17.349> up<00:02:17.379> on<00:02:17.709> on<00:02:18.099> a

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
gameplay mechanics get set up on on a

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.400 
gameplay mechanics get set up on on a
game<00:02:18.370> like<00:02:18.550> marathon<00:02:19.120> exam<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.870> example<00:02:20.260> and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
game like marathon exam for example and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.740 
game like marathon exam for example and
then<00:02:20.830> go<00:02:21.040> into<00:02:21.069> master<00:02:21.730> master<00:02:22.239> is<00:02:22.360> something

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
then go into master master is something

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.680 
then go into master master is something
that<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> little<00:02:23.319> bit<00:02:23.470> more<00:02:23.709> core<00:02:24.040> in<00:02:24.190> nature

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
that is a little bit more core in nature

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.290 
that is a little bit more core in nature
but<00:02:25.690> once<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.410> improve<00:02:27.400> your<00:02:27.430> game<00:02:28.090> play

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
but once you improve your game play

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.720 
but once you improve your game play
skills<00:02:28.599> with<00:02:28.810> master<00:02:29.349> you'll<00:02:29.860> be<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> force<00:02:30.580> to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
skills with master you'll be a force to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.070 
skills with master you'll be a force to
be<00:02:30.760> reckoned<00:02:30.880> with<00:02:31.239> in<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.630> multiplayer

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
be reckoned with in the multiplayer

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.080 
be reckoned with in the multiplayer
world<00:02:34.800> another<00:02:35.800> interesting<00:02:36.130> mode<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.970> we

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
world another interesting mode that we

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.559 
world another interesting mode that we
added<00:02:37.300> was<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:38.800> we<00:02:38.950> had<00:02:39.250> which<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.330> stage

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
added was that we had which is stage

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.550 
added was that we had which is stage
racer<00:02:41.220> stage<00:02:42.220> racer<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:43.440> when<00:02:44.440> you're

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
racer stage racer is when you're

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.259 
racer stage racer is when you're
actually<00:02:44.709> racing<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.310> Tetra<00:02:45.610> me<00:02:45.700> know<00:02:45.760> down<00:02:46.030> a

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
actually racing the Tetra me know down a

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.720 
actually racing the Tetra me know down a
set<00:02:46.510> matrix<00:02:47.220> but<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.310> nice<00:02:48.459> thing<00:02:48.489> about

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
set matrix but the nice thing about

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.759 
set matrix but the nice thing about
stage<00:02:49.180> racer<00:02:49.630> is<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.140> two<00:02:50.319> things<00:02:50.560> have<00:02:50.680> been

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
stage racer is that two things have been

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.130 
stage racer is that two things have been
added<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.310> one<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.180> abyss<00:02:52.450> mode<00:02:52.690> so

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
added to it one is the abyss mode so

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.960 
added to it one is the abyss mode so
that<00:02:53.410> instead<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.799> having<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.250> definitive<00:02:54.730> end

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
that instead of having a definitive end

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.940 
that instead of having a definitive end
line<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.420> can<00:02:55.599> actually<00:02:55.810> continue<00:02:56.380> down<00:02:56.709> the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
line you can actually continue down the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.979 
line you can actually continue down the
matrix<00:02:57.370> but<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.000> other<00:02:58.120> option<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.840> we

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
matrix but the other option is the we

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.780 
matrix but the other option is the we
will<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.530> we<00:02:59.560> know<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.370> there's<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.610> lot<00:03:00.760> of

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
will and we know that there's a lot of

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.910 
will and we know that there's a lot of
players<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.209> have<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.569> we<00:03:01.690> will<00:03:01.930> from<00:03:02.799> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
players that have the we will from the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.430 
players that have the we will from the
popularity<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.489> Mario<00:03:03.819> Kart<00:03:04.060> etc<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:04.810> with

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
popularity of Mario Kart etc and so with

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.050 
popularity of Mario Kart etc and so with
the<00:03:05.560> we<00:03:05.709> will<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:06.250> can<00:03:06.400> actually<00:03:06.519> steer<00:03:06.940> you

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
the we will you can actually steer you

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.630 
the we will you can actually steer you
away<00:03:07.090> down<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.750> course<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.459> nice<00:03:09.610> thing

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
away down the course so the nice thing

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.670 
away down the course so the nice thing
here<00:03:09.910> is<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.630> mode<00:03:10.930> was<00:03:11.170> actually<00:03:11.530> designed

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
here is this mode was actually designed

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
here is this mode was actually designed
to<00:03:12.130> help<00:03:12.430> teach<00:03:12.970> right<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.930> left<00:03:14.230> rotation<00:03:14.769> so

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
to help teach right and left rotation so

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.819 
to help teach right and left rotation so
most<00:03:16.090> players<00:03:16.269> tend<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.049> use<00:03:17.319> only<00:03:17.590> one

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
most players tend to use only one

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.710 
most players tend to use only one
rotation<00:03:18.250> where<00:03:18.850> it's<00:03:19.239> typically<00:03:19.690> a

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
rotation where it's typically a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.140 
rotation where it's typically a
clockwise<00:03:20.410> rotation<00:03:21.040> but<00:03:21.549> if<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.850> actually

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
clockwise rotation but if you actually

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.110 
clockwise rotation but if you actually
use<00:03:22.660> left<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.440> right<00:03:23.709> rotation<00:03:24.130> it'll<00:03:24.730> let

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
use left and right rotation it'll let

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.120 
use left and right rotation it'll let
you<00:03:25.150> get<00:03:25.660> through<00:03:25.930> precarious<00:03:26.500> situations

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
you get through precarious situations

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.490 
you get through precarious situations
and<00:03:27.519> actually<00:03:28.239> let<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.510> teach<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:29.410> know

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
and actually let you teach you know

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.319 
and actually let you teach you know
teach<00:03:29.680> at<00:03:29.829> different<00:03:30.100> moves<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.579> then<00:03:31.150> to

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
teach at different moves and then to

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.729 
teach at different moves and then to
reach<00:03:31.510> back<00:03:31.840> for<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:32.139> little<00:03:32.260> bit<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.650> a

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
reach back for a little bit of a

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.800 
reach back for a little bit of a
nostalgic<00:03:33.430> version<00:03:33.819> of<00:03:33.910> Tetris<00:03:34.329> we've<00:03:34.569> added

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
nostalgic version of Tetris we've added

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.170 
nostalgic version of Tetris we've added
a<00:03:35.230> popular<00:03:35.980> version<00:03:36.400> from<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.639> paths<00:03:36.880> called

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
a popular version from the paths called

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.629 
a popular version from the paths called
bomb<00:03:37.450> bliss<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.959> bomb<00:03:38.650> lists<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:39.130> essentially

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
bomb bliss and bomb lists is essentially

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.460 
bomb bliss and bomb lists is essentially
taking<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.180> core<00:03:40.389> Tetris<00:03:40.810> game<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.290> then

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
taking the core Tetris game and then

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.650 
taking the core Tetris game and then
adding<00:03:41.799> bombs<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.430> but<00:03:42.850> also<00:03:43.000> adding<00:03:43.480> new

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
adding bombs to it but also adding new

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.569 
adding bombs to it but also adding new
designs<00:03:44.049> of<00:03:44.850> me<00:03:45.850> know<00:03:45.970> shapes<00:03:46.239> so<00:03:46.959> the

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
designs of me know shapes so the

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.699 
designs of me know shapes so the
objective<00:03:48.579> here<00:03:48.609> is<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.480> use<00:03:50.109> these<00:03:50.290> special

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
objective here is to use these special

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.890 
objective here is to use these special
me<00:03:50.829> know<00:03:50.889> shapes<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.819> clear<00:03:52.060> lines<00:03:52.329> much<00:03:52.690> like

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
me know shapes to clear lines much like

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.240 
me know shapes to clear lines much like
you<00:03:52.989> would<00:03:53.019> do<00:03:53.230> in<00:03:53.350> a<00:03:53.410> regular<00:03:53.709> Tetris<00:03:54.069> game

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
you would do in a regular Tetris game

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.940 
you would do in a regular Tetris game
however<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:55.750> now<00:03:55.930> have<00:03:56.200> these<00:03:56.470> little<00:03:56.680> red

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
however you now have these little red

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.160 
however you now have these little red
dots<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.489> symbolize<00:03:57.880> bombs<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.690> when<00:03:59.079> you

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
dots that symbolize bombs and when you

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.870 
dots that symbolize bombs and when you
clear<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.410> line<00:03:59.650> with<00:03:59.889> a<00:03:59.920> dot<00:04:00.220> in<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:00.730> will

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
clear a line with a dot in it that will

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.300 
clear a line with a dot in it that will
actually<00:04:01.269> start<00:04:01.690> an<00:04:01.810> explosion<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:03.099> more

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
actually start an explosion the more

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.979 
actually start an explosion the more
explosions<00:04:03.819> that<00:04:03.940> happen<00:04:04.359> you<00:04:04.480> get<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.660> chain

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
explosions that happen you get a chain

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.020 
explosions that happen you get a chain
reaction<00:04:05.170> that<00:04:05.799> gives<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.250> an<00:04:06.340> all-clear<00:04:06.760> and

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
reaction that gives you an all-clear and

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.839 
reaction that gives you an all-clear and
allows<00:04:07.209> you<00:04:07.359> to<00:04:07.420> progress<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:07.930> next<00:04:08.139> level

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
allows you to progress the next level

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.759 
allows you to progress the next level
now<00:04:09.849> of<00:04:10.000> course<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.540> Tetris<00:04:11.019> party<00:04:11.349> wouldn't<00:04:11.650> be

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
now of course a Tetris party wouldn't be

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.559 
now of course a Tetris party wouldn't be
a<00:04:11.799> party<00:04:12.130> without<00:04:12.340> lots<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.120> multiplayer

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
a party without lots of multiplayer

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.990 
a party without lots of multiplayer
action<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.709> we've<00:04:14.980> added<00:04:15.190> lots<00:04:15.579> of<00:04:15.849> new<00:04:15.970> things

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
action so we've added lots of new things

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.449 
action so we've added lots of new things
to<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.539> multiplayer<00:04:17.049> you've<00:04:17.859> got<00:04:18.070> all<00:04:18.310> of

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
to the multiplayer you've got all of

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.550 
to the multiplayer you've got all of
your<00:04:18.579> grape<00:04:18.849> modes<00:04:19.120> in<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.720> versus<00:04:20.109> mode<00:04:20.139> one

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
your grape modes in the versus mode one

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.890 
your grape modes in the versus mode one
thing<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:20.919> we've<00:04:21.070> added<00:04:21.280> is<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:21.820> vs.<00:04:22.510> battle

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
thing that we've added is the vs. battle

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.230 
thing that we've added is the vs. battle
auto<00:04:23.169> handicap<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.669> will<00:04:24.760> essentially

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
auto handicap and that will essentially

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.450 
auto handicap and that will essentially
take<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.930> player<00:04:26.680> who<00:04:26.979> may<00:04:27.220> not

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
take a player who may not

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.980 
take a player who may not
he<00:04:27.639> is<00:04:27.789> strong<00:04:28.150> as<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.509> other<00:04:28.539> competitors

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
he is strong as the other competitors

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.960 
he is strong as the other competitors
and<00:04:29.620> give<00:04:29.680> them<00:04:30.009> the<00:04:30.039> advantage<00:04:30.250> by

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
and give them the advantage by

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.700 
and give them the advantage by
penalizing<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.020> other<00:04:32.139> players<00:04:32.440> with

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
penalizing the other players with

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.950 
penalizing the other players with
additional<00:04:33.130> obstacles<00:04:33.840> essentially<00:04:34.840> the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
additional obstacles essentially the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.140 
additional obstacles essentially the
game<00:04:35.139> will<00:04:35.410> create<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.430> bit<00:04:36.699> of<00:04:36.789> a<00:04:36.849> disadvantage

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
game will create a bit of a disadvantage

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.020 
game will create a bit of a disadvantage
for<00:04:37.599> the<00:04:37.690> stronger<00:04:38.110> player<00:04:38.349> by<00:04:39.030> after

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
for the stronger player by after

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.909 
for the stronger player by after
watching<00:04:40.419> a<00:04:40.750> few<00:04:41.020> games<00:04:41.169> happen<00:04:41.710> add

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
watching a few games happen add

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.070 
watching a few games happen add
additional<00:04:42.610> obstacles<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.539> those<00:04:43.690> obstacles

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
additional obstacles and those obstacles

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.860 
additional obstacles and those obstacles
will<00:04:44.770> definitely<00:04:45.340> give<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.300> weaker<00:04:46.630> player

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
will definitely give the weaker player

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.589 
will definitely give the weaker player
the<00:04:47.470> advantage<00:04:47.979> and<00:04:48.270> hopefully<00:04:49.270> at<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.569> end

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
the advantage and hopefully at the end

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.540 
the advantage and hopefully at the end
of<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.870> day<00:04:50.050> when<00:04:50.259> both<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:51.160> know<00:04:51.310> players

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
of the day when both you know players

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.610 
of the day when both you know players
match<00:04:51.880> up<00:04:52.150> it'll<00:04:52.330> be<00:04:52.479> more<00:04:52.750> of<00:04:52.780> an<00:04:52.930> even<00:04:53.110> battle

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
match up it'll be more of an even battle

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.600 
match up it'll be more of an even battle
and<00:04:53.830> avoid<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:55.740> weaker<00:04:56.740> player<00:04:56.979> so<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.340> speak

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
and avoid the weaker player so to speak

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.550 
and avoid the weaker player so to speak
from<00:04:58.120> having<00:04:58.449> to<00:04:58.539> play<00:04:58.720> practice<00:04:59.139> mode<00:04:59.319> for

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
from having to play practice mode for

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.900 
from having to play practice mode for
the<00:04:59.650> entire<00:04:59.919> round<00:05:00.160> while<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.580> other<00:05:00.729> two

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
the entire round while the other two

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.870 
the entire round while the other two
players<00:05:01.150> are<00:05:01.449> going<00:05:02.289> to<00:05:02.410> town<00:05:02.620> on<00:05:02.880> large

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
players are going to town on large

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.300 
players are going to town on large
battle<00:05:04.120> modes<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:08.050> can<00:05:08.080> see<00:05:08.380> of<00:05:08.830> course<00:05:09.009> the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
battle modes you can see of course the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.279 
battle modes you can see of course the
items<00:05:09.639> are<00:05:09.820> added<00:05:09.849> in<00:05:10.240> there<00:05:10.419> and<00:05:10.690> we<00:05:10.840> have<00:05:11.020> all

we've added some new items the items are
focused<00:05:15.789> on<00:05:16.060> not<00:05:16.300> only<00:05:16.449> using<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.900> remote

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
focused on not only using the remote

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.740 
focused on not only using the remote
there<00:05:18.310> is<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.430> confused<00:05:18.909> item<00:05:19.240> which<00:05:19.389> reverses

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
there is a confused item which reverses

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.610 
there is a confused item which reverses
the<00:05:21.479> rotation<00:05:22.479> so<00:05:22.780> what<00:05:23.080> you<00:05:23.169> think<00:05:23.380> is<00:05:23.500> going

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
the rotation so what you think is going

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.680 
the rotation so what you think is going
to<00:05:23.680> rotate<00:05:23.830> right<00:05:24.159> will<00:05:24.370> rotate<00:05:24.699> left<00:05:24.880> there's

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
to rotate right will rotate left there's

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.749 
to rotate right will rotate left there's
a<00:05:25.780> new<00:05:25.960> mode<00:05:26.199> or<00:05:26.560> a<00:05:26.620> new<00:05:26.889> item<00:05:27.159> that<00:05:27.310> was<00:05:27.400> added

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
a new mode or a new item that was added

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.450 
a new mode or a new item that was added
that<00:05:27.940> will<00:05:28.120> actually<00:05:28.949> capture<00:05:29.949> the<00:05:30.159> next

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
that will actually capture the next

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.990 
that will actually capture the next
piece<00:05:30.669> and<00:05:30.909> repeat<00:05:31.750> it<00:05:32.099> consecutively<00:05:33.099> one<00:05:33.909> of

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
piece and repeat it consecutively one of

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.490 
piece and repeat it consecutively one of
the<00:05:34.060> other<00:05:34.180> modes<00:05:34.419> that<00:05:34.539> we've<00:05:34.750> added<00:05:34.990> into

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
the other modes that we've added into

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.589 
the other modes that we've added into
the<00:05:35.530> game<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:36.130> this<00:05:36.400> is<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.639> mode<00:05:36.909> that<00:05:36.940> came

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
the game and this is a mode that came

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.189 
the game and this is a mode that came
from<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:38.849> co-op<00:05:39.849> mode<00:05:40.330> which<00:05:40.630> is<00:05:40.810> where<00:05:40.990> two

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
from the co-op mode which is where two

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.170 
from the co-op mode which is where two
people<00:05:41.409> playing<00:05:41.710> an<00:05:41.949> extra-wide<00:05:42.340> matrix<00:05:43.030> a

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
people playing an extra-wide matrix a

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.730 
people playing an extra-wide matrix a
lot<00:05:43.330> of<00:05:43.449> people<00:05:43.690> really<00:05:43.960> enjoyed<00:05:44.259> this<00:05:44.469> but

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
lot of people really enjoyed this but

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.620 
lot of people really enjoyed this but
they<00:05:44.860> asked<00:05:45.250> how<00:05:45.550> do<00:05:45.610> I<00:05:45.759> take<00:05:46.150> advantage<00:05:46.570> of

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
they asked how do I take advantage of

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.999 
they asked how do I take advantage of
the<00:05:46.750> two<00:05:46.930> other<00:05:47.080> people<00:05:47.409> who<00:05:47.440> are<00:05:47.560> sitting<00:05:47.919> in

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
the two other people who are sitting in

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.800 
the two other people who are sitting in
the<00:05:48.099> room<00:05:48.280> so<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:49.000> course<00:05:49.150> we<00:05:49.360> came<00:05:49.539> up<00:05:49.570> with

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
the room so of course we came up with

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.610 
the room so of course we came up with
co-op<00:05:49.990> vs<00:05:50.469> co-op<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:52.210> in<00:05:52.599> co-op<00:05:52.900> vs<00:05:53.259> co-op

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
co-op vs co-op and in co-op vs co-op

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.589 
co-op vs co-op and in co-op vs co-op
you're<00:05:54.159> essentially<00:05:54.699> playing<00:05:54.969> two<00:05:55.240> people

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
you're essentially playing two people

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.589 
you're essentially playing two people
against<00:05:55.930> two<00:05:56.050> people<00:05:56.460> it's<00:05:57.460> cooperatively<00:05:58.120> so

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
against two people it's cooperatively so

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.240 
against two people it's cooperatively so
you<00:05:58.659> have<00:05:58.840> to<00:05:58.960> work<00:05:59.110> together<00:05:59.289> and<00:05:59.740> you're

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
you have to work together and you're

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.740 
you have to work together and you're
basically<00:06:00.639> trying<00:06:00.849> to<00:06:01.030> clear<00:06:01.240> lines<00:06:01.479> much

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
basically trying to clear lines much

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.909 
basically trying to clear lines much
like<00:06:01.960> you<00:06:02.050> would<00:06:02.080> in<00:06:02.320> a<00:06:02.380> regular<00:06:02.469> game<00:06:02.770> of

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
like you would in a regular game of

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.120 
like you would in a regular game of
Tetris<00:06:03.960> this<00:06:04.960> is<00:06:05.139> a<00:06:05.169> game<00:06:05.440> that's<00:06:05.650> definitely

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
Tetris this is a game that's definitely

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.580 
Tetris this is a game that's definitely
based<00:06:06.880> on<00:06:07.030> the<00:06:07.090> feedback<00:06:07.750> that<00:06:07.960> we<00:06:08.139> received

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
based on the feedback that we received

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.649 
based on the feedback that we received
on<00:06:08.710> the<00:06:08.800> original<00:06:09.159> co-op<00:06:09.520> game<00:06:09.789> that's<00:06:10.419> going

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
on the original co-op game that's going

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.589 
on the original co-op game that's going
to<00:06:11.159> definitely<00:06:12.159> create<00:06:12.940> some<00:06:13.060> excitement<00:06:13.150> in

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
to definitely create some excitement in

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:14.909 
to definitely create some excitement in
the<00:06:13.719> gaming<00:06:13.900> world<00:06:14.020> a<00:06:14.289> lot<00:06:14.440> of<00:06:14.530> people<00:06:14.770> would

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
the gaming world a lot of people would

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.740 
the gaming world a lot of people would
had<00:06:15.280> to<00:06:15.400> ask<00:06:15.490> for<00:06:15.729> this<00:06:15.849> and<00:06:16.180> this<00:06:16.419> is<00:06:16.479> one<00:06:16.719> of

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
had to ask for this and this is one of

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.659 
had to ask for this and this is one of
those<00:06:16.870> cases<00:06:16.930> where<00:06:17.349> the<00:06:18.070> players<00:06:18.280> got<00:06:18.520> what

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
those cases where the players got what

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.100 
those cases where the players got what
they<00:06:18.789> asked<00:06:19.060> for<00:06:19.090> and<00:06:19.479> Hudson<00:06:19.750> did<00:06:19.870> a<00:06:19.930> great

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
they asked for and Hudson did a great

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.140 
they asked for and Hudson did a great
job<00:06:20.139> of<00:06:20.349> implementing<00:06:20.919> this<00:06:21.099> new<00:06:21.159> mode<00:06:24.150> and

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
job of implementing this new mode and

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.570 
job of implementing this new mode and
we've<00:06:25.750> added<00:06:25.930> versus<00:06:26.500> sprint<00:06:26.860> versus<00:06:27.280> sprint

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
we've added versus sprint versus sprint

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.550 
we've added versus sprint versus sprint
is<00:06:27.789> the<00:06:28.240> fastest<00:06:28.630> person<00:06:28.780> to<00:06:28.990> clear<00:06:29.169> the<00:06:29.289> 40

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
is the fastest person to clear the 40

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.290 
is the fastest person to clear the 40
lines<00:06:29.740> and<00:06:30.070> so<00:06:30.610> we<00:06:30.759> thought<00:06:30.909> it<00:06:31.060> would<00:06:31.180> be

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
lines and so we thought it would be

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.909 
lines and so we thought it would be
definitely<00:06:31.539> interesting<00:06:32.169> to<00:06:32.259> have<00:06:32.409> a<00:06:32.469> full<00:06:32.770> on

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
definitely interesting to have a full on

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.770 
definitely interesting to have a full on
race<00:06:33.130> and<00:06:33.159> the<00:06:33.520> nice<00:06:33.669> thing<00:06:33.699> about<00:06:33.940> vs.<00:06:34.479> sprint

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
race and the nice thing about vs. sprint

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.930 
race and the nice thing about vs. sprint
is<00:06:34.960> because<00:06:35.349> you're<00:06:35.560> set<00:06:35.860> on<00:06:36.099> the<00:06:36.669> amount<00:06:36.820> of

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
is because you're set on the amount of

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.550 
is because you're set on the amount of
lines<00:06:37.150> that<00:06:37.300> you<00:06:37.330> have<00:06:37.449> to<00:06:37.539> clear<00:06:37.870> it<00:06:38.020> makes

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
lines that you have to clear it makes

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.290 
lines that you have to clear it makes
for<00:06:38.740> faster<00:06:39.159> matches<00:06:39.580> so<00:06:39.789> this<00:06:39.969> is<00:06:40.089> definitely

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
for faster matches so this is definitely

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.850 
for faster matches so this is definitely
a<00:06:40.539> game

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
a game

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.350 
a game
or<00:06:40.949> if<00:06:41.039> you've<00:06:41.159> got<00:06:41.310> four<00:06:41.520> people<00:06:41.699> playing<00:06:41.969> and

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
or if you've got four people playing and

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.149 
or if you've got four people playing and
you've<00:06:42.870> got<00:06:43.020> only<00:06:43.199> so<00:06:43.439> much<00:06:43.560> time<00:06:43.620> to<00:06:43.979> play<00:06:44.009> a

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:44.159 
you've got only so much time to play a

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.339 
you've got only so much time to play a
bunch<00:06:44.310> of<00:06:44.460> races<00:06:44.879> this<00:06:45.479> is<00:06:45.659> this<00:06:45.930> is<00:06:46.080> a<00:06:46.169> game

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
bunch of races this is this is a game

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:48.040 
bunch of races this is this is a game
where<00:06:46.560> you<00:06:46.710> can<00:06:46.830> have<00:06:46.949> a<00:06:46.979> lot<00:06:47.159> of<00:06:47.189> fun<00:06:47.430> with<00:06:47.610> and

where you can have a lot of fun with and
there's<00:06:49.050> also<00:06:49.259> an<00:06:49.469> auto<00:06:49.650> handicap<00:06:50.159> feature

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
there's also an auto handicap feature

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.249 
there's also an auto handicap feature
for<00:06:50.729> this<00:06:50.879> as<00:06:51.030> well<00:06:51.180> so<00:06:51.479> that<00:06:51.719> if<00:06:51.840> you're<00:06:52.050> just
