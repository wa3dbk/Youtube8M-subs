00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
make a mistake and this is the connector

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.130 
make a mistake and this is the connector
for<00:05:46.169> avian<00:05:46.530> it<00:05:46.710> looks<00:05:47.310> exactly<00:05:47.550> like<00:05:48.240> hdmi

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
for avian it looks exactly like hdmi

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.170 
for avian it looks exactly like hdmi
connector<00:05:49.620> I'm<00:05:50.550> going<00:05:50.700> to<00:05:50.760> put<00:05:50.910> this<00:05:50.940> aside

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
connector I'm going to put this aside

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.630 
connector I'm going to put this aside

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.129 
this is the car has a little bubble
rough

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
rough

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.619 
rough
so<00:05:57.379> we're<00:05:57.710> going<00:05:57.800> to<00:05:57.919> put<00:05:58.039> this<00:05:58.189> aside<00:05:58.370> and<00:05:58.879> the

00:05:59.619 --> 00:05:59.629 
so we're going to put this aside and the

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:04.540 
so we're going to put this aside and the
card<00:05:59.930> is<00:06:00.400> what<00:06:01.400> a<00:06:01.539> PCIe<00:06:02.539> slot<00:06:02.960> and<00:06:03.310> a<00:06:04.310> very

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
card is what a PCIe slot and a very

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.610 
card is what a PCIe slot and a very
small<00:06:04.849> portion<00:06:05.300> of<00:06:05.569> it<00:06:05.719> you<00:06:06.229> guys<00:06:06.409> probably

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
small portion of it you guys probably

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.290 
small portion of it you guys probably
know<00:06:06.800> that<00:06:07.039> it's<00:06:07.189> going<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.400> be<00:06:07.520> very<00:06:07.550> near<00:06:08.029> to

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
know that it's going to be very near to

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.629 
know that it's going to be very near to
the<00:06:08.509> video<00:06:09.050> capture<00:06:09.740> say<00:06:09.889> to<00:06:09.949> the<00:06:10.129> video<00:06:10.430> card

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
the video capture say to the video card

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.820 
the video capture say to the video card
and<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:11.930> has<00:06:12.169> the<00:06:13.330> avian<00:06:14.330> and<00:06:14.599> also<00:06:15.139> the<00:06:15.259> hdmi

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
and it has the avian and also the hdmi

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.320 
and it has the avian and also the hdmi
so<00:06:16.189> you<00:06:16.279> don't<00:06:16.430> have<00:06:16.490> to<00:06:16.639> make<00:06:16.729> a<00:06:16.789> mistake<00:06:17.180> and

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
so you don't have to make a mistake and

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.820 
so you don't have to make a mistake and
put<00:06:17.479> it<00:06:17.599> on<00:06:17.689> the<00:06:17.719> wrong<00:06:17.930> one<00:06:18.199> so<00:06:18.469> you<00:06:18.560> know<00:06:18.680> that

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
put it on the wrong one so you know that

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.369 
put it on the wrong one so you know that
the<00:06:18.949> top<00:06:19.159> one<00:06:19.370> will<00:06:19.550> be<00:06:19.699> the<00:06:19.819> hdmi<00:06:20.240> cable<00:06:20.599> to

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.379 
the top one will be the hdmi cable to

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:24.760 
the top one will be the hdmi cable to
goes<00:06:21.590> in<00:06:21.919> and<00:06:22.639> that's<00:06:23.150> how<00:06:23.300> it<00:06:23.449> looks<00:06:23.689> so<00:06:24.620> it's

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
goes in and that's how it looks so it's

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.709 
goes in and that's how it looks so it's
not<00:06:24.889> very<00:06:25.099> big<00:06:25.370> very<00:06:25.819> small<00:06:26.210> and<00:06:28.449> if<00:06:29.449> you<00:06:29.569> guys

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:29.719 
not very big very small and if you guys

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:31.990 
not very big very small and if you guys
have<00:06:30.050> a<00:06:30.080> desktop<00:06:30.620> version<00:06:31.129> and<00:06:31.639> it's<00:06:31.819> not<00:06:31.969> a

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
have a desktop version and it's not a

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.360 
have a desktop version and it's not a
tower<00:06:32.300> this<00:06:33.229> is<00:06:33.409> a<00:06:33.439> good<00:06:33.650> thing<00:06:33.800> to<00:06:33.860> remember

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
tower this is a good thing to remember

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.790 
tower this is a good thing to remember
to<00:06:34.729> keep<00:06:34.909> just<00:06:35.750> in<00:06:35.900> case<00:06:36.110> if<00:06:36.289> you<00:06:36.379> guys<00:06:36.529> wanted

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
to keep just in case if you guys wanted

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.100 
to keep just in case if you guys wanted
to<00:06:36.860> put<00:06:37.069> it<00:06:37.159> on<00:06:37.250> that<00:06:37.460> and<00:06:37.750> you<00:06:38.750> needed<00:06:39.020> a

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
to put it on that and you needed a

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.499 
to put it on that and you needed a
smaller<00:06:39.409> place<00:06:39.770> to<00:06:40.550> hook<00:06:40.669> it<00:06:40.819> up<00:06:40.939> there<00:06:41.270> you<00:06:41.360> go

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509 
smaller place to hook it up there you go

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:43.689 
smaller place to hook it up there you go
so<00:06:41.840> you<00:06:41.930> don't<00:06:42.080> need<00:06:42.199> to<00:06:42.439> hook<00:06:43.219> up<00:06:43.400> the<00:06:43.520> big

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699 
so you don't need to hook up the big

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.920 
so you don't need to hook up the big
part<00:06:43.969> and<00:06:44.810> also<00:06:45.259> the<00:06:45.469> wires<00:06:45.710> so<00:06:46.430> there<00:06:46.669> you<00:06:46.729> go

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
part and also the wires so there you go

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.779 
part and also the wires so there you go
this<00:06:47.930> is<00:06:48.080> all<00:06:48.229> the<00:06:49.009> rest<00:06:49.250> of<00:06:49.400> the<00:06:49.520> night<00:06:49.669> just
