so

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.420 

so<00:03:41.200> you're<00:03:41.319> starting<00:03:41.680> an<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.890> on<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.250> B<00:03:42.370> string

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
so you're starting an a on the B string

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:58.350 
so you're starting an a on the B string
you're<00:03:42.879> ending<00:03:43.299> on<00:03:43.480> e<00:03:44.760> Democrat<00:03:45.760> Asia

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:14.990 

one<00:03:59.360> more<00:03:59.540> time

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.340 

you

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
you

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.340 
you
I

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.750 

if<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:25.470> notice<00:04:25.770> your<00:04:25.890> pic<00:04:26.130> is<00:04:26.280> always<00:04:26.550> staying

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
if you notice your pic is always staying

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.310 
if you notice your pic is always staying
inside<00:04:27.390> the<00:04:27.450> strings<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.200> you're

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
inside the strings and you're

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.830 
inside the strings and you're
alternating<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.980> whole<00:04:29.100> time<00:04:29.390> that's<00:04:30.390> not<00:04:30.630> no

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
alternating the whole time that's not no

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.660 
alternating the whole time that's not no
economy<00:04:31.290> pic<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.620> i<00:04:31.680> highly<00:04:31.950> recommend

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
economy pic and i highly recommend

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.420 
economy pic and i highly recommend
alternate<00:04:33.090> picking<00:04:33.300> I've<00:04:33.620> done<00:04:34.620> both<00:04:34.890> I<00:04:35.160> used

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
alternate picking I've done both I used

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.490 
alternate picking I've done both I used
to<00:04:35.520> try<00:04:35.670> to<00:04:35.700> economy<00:04:36.210> pick<00:04:36.420> and<00:04:36.690> some<00:04:37.200> people

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
to try to economy pick and some people

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.930 
to try to economy pick and some people
really<00:04:37.680> good<00:04:37.890> at<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.040> but<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.310> think<00:04:38.610> overall

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
really good at it but I think overall

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.330 
really good at it but I think overall
alternate<00:04:39.600> picking<00:04:39.780> is<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.170> way<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.320> go<00:04:40.530> but

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
alternate picking is the way to go but

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.060 
alternate picking is the way to go but
my<00:04:41.610> problem<00:04:41.850> was<00:04:42.150> always<00:04:42.770> trying<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:43.890> get<00:04:44.010> a

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
my problem was always trying to get a

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.290 
my problem was always trying to get a
lot<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.280> speed<00:04:46.220> when<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.250> was<00:04:47.490> taking<00:04:47.970> on<00:04:48.210> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
lot of speed when I was taking on the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.260 
lot of speed when I was taking on the
outside<00:04:48.750> betta<00:04:49.140> and<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:49.560> example<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:50.370> on<00:04:51.150> the

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
outside betta and that example is on the

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.390 
outside betta and that example is on the
B<00:04:51.420> string<00:04:51.480> I<00:04:51.750> would<00:04:51.900> break<00:04:52.050> down<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.770> then

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
B string I would break down and then

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.820 
B string I would break down and then
pick<00:04:53.640> maybe<00:04:53.880> up<00:04:54.240> on<00:04:54.450> high<00:04:54.660> E<00:04:54.690> string<00:04:54.840> but<00:04:55.740> if

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
pick maybe up on high E string but if

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.410 
pick maybe up on high E string but if
you<00:04:56.010> do<00:04:56.250> you<00:04:56.580> can<00:04:57.030> set<00:04:57.300> yourself<00:04:57.420> up<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:59.270> lot<00:05:00.270> of

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
you do you can set yourself up a lot of

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:24.020 
you do you can set yourself up a lot of
great<00:05:02.720> licks<00:05:04.130> by<00:05:05.130> keeping<00:05:05.430> not<00:05:05.790> on<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.270> inside

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:52.100 

might<00:05:28.620> see<00:05:29.620> I'm<00:05:29.740> always<00:05:29.949> inside

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.880
