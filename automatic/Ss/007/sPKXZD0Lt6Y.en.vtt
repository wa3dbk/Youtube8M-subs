00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
helpful so the great thing about this is

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.420 
helpful so the great thing about this is
this<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> global<00:01:49.500> class<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.340> have

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
this is a this is a global class we have

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.590 
this is a this is a global class we have
people<00:01:50.700> from<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:51.030> over<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.420> world

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
people from all over the world

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.450 
people from all over the world
submitting<00:01:52.229> their<00:01:52.350> work<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.220> start

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
submitting their work and you can start

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.929 
submitting their work and you can start
to<00:01:53.689> generate<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> community<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.590> artists<00:01:56.009> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
to generate a community of artists that

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.999 
to generate a community of artists that
you<00:01:57.090> would<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.329> never<00:01:57.600> had<00:01:58.259> before

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you would have never had before

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.539 
you would have never had before
so<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.520> think<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.509> that's<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.200> strong

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
so I think that that's a really strong

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.039 
so I think that that's a really strong
exciting<00:02:02.549> component<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.540> think<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> most

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
exciting component and I think the most

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.260 
exciting component and I think the most
important<00:02:04.560> thing<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.310> sharing<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.119> know

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
important thing is the sharing you know

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.900 
important thing is the sharing you know
the<00:02:06.659> idea<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.649> can<00:02:07.920> share<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:08.759> can

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the idea that we can share then we can

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.639 
the idea that we can share then we can
help<00:02:09.119> each<00:02:09.270> other<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
help each other so this is going to be a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.559 
help each other so this is going to be a
really<00:02:10.979> fun<00:02:11.220> class<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.879> can't<00:02:12.150> wait<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.420> see
