00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:22.560
 phil owner of the cico in red color as 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.920
 3mm crochet hook 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.020
 Let's wrap the yarn over the two fingers. 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:34.200
 and turning the thread at the beginning of the ball is 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.550
 to the left side and the wire that we 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.490
 Let's work on the right side. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.770
 we will introduce needles into the 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:54.290
 circle loop the wire and pull let's do 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:58.170
 one two three chains throw the wire 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:02.670
 enter the circle and make a 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.240
 high point pass the wire insert 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.270
 inside the circle another high point 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.270
 see what we are working on 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.470
 the two wires on the wire at the beginning of 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 government and the circle wire 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.640
 we throw the wire we introduced inside the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.329
 circle 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.299
 Another high point we'll make in. 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:34.740
 of this circle a total of 16 points 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:37.619
 to count on the three with the three 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.509
 the first currents we have made to 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.999
 start with 16 points high start 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.179
 here with three chains 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:53.100
 Let's end here with three chains 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:57.479
 Let's also get this wire from the beginning. 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.530
 Let's close our circle without launching 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.649
 of wire 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.969
 let's enter inside the circle 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.979
 throw the film 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.290
 inside the other 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:17.010
 we close the career with a low 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:23.720
 let's make a current point height 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.720
 down and following six competitors 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.600
 let's throw the thread 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.630
 Let's skip the three chains and the 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.300
 first point and we will introduce here 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:42.140
 or between the first and second 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.440
 point and let's make a high point 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.100
 chain 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.560
 we launched the cio we introduced in the point of 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:56.130
 in front of a high point a current between 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.290
 books at the point of front against 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.470
 Hight point 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.160
 we made three high points separated by 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.790
 a chain and a chain 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:14.120
 we draw the thread twice between the games 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:18.379
 next point first high point of the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.950
 a chain we passed the wire twice 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:25.430
 we introduce in the next second point 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.000
 high point of a chain 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.959
 we launched the estrus twice we introduced 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.739
 in the next third point high point of the 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.400
 top 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:45.049
 a chain we threw the wire three times 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:49.760
 we introduce in the next point a point 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:52.989
 high triple athens a current 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.709
 we cast the wire four times 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:03.430
 we introduce in the point in front 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.430
 a high frame only 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:12.810
 here we did half the same way 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:16.380
 Come on, let's go down to this other one. 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.039
 side only with the points in order 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.039
 contrary 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:27.449
 Let's make a chain throw the son. 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:32.669
 three times to introduce the next point and 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:36.090
 make a triple high point only one 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:39.690
 chain throw the wire twice 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.979
 enter in the front 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:47.669
 high point double a chain throw the 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:52.110
 child twice at the front 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:55.259
 second high point of a current in the 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.280
 plots the child twice in the 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.509
 front 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:04.470
 the third double high point a current 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:08.910
 we threw a thread we introduced the next 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:12.120
 point a point a chain 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:17.090
 We launched the wire to introduce the mos 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.389
 next point second high point one 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.139
 chain 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:26.190
 we launched the child we introduced in the next 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.740
 point a high point reminds that here in the 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.550
 we skipped the three chains and one 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.860
 point here at the end let's skip the point 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.229
 and the three chains 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.909
 To conclude, let's do five 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:43.590
 chains without releasing the wire 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.130
 a very low point 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.789
 we will introduce here in the first 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:53.250
 chain that is above the closing 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:57.960
 of the previous career to release the film 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:01.530
 pull one loop inside the other 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.960
 we close the career we will start 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.960
 career with eight chains 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:18.660
 without releasing the heat we will introduce here 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.660
 between the first and second point 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:26.470
 we will have one point plus three chains without 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.430
 toss the thread 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:35.500
 we introduced a front space one 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:40.720
 low three oil chains between one 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:45.850
 point and another a low three 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.570
 in the front space a point 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.930
 low 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:53.310
 Let's do it this way until we get there. 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:56.170
 here at the end of his career 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:07:00.100
 we are at the end of the career in the last 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:03.040
 two points with 3 chains 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:06.070
 enter between the last two points 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.490
 and make a low 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:11.880
 To conclude, let's do seven 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.880
 chains 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:23.699
 without throwing the thread we will introduce here 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:24.720
 in the same place that we closed the race 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:28.110
 previous 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:31.979
 let's introduce the needle to launch the film 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.849
 and pulling a loop through the 

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:36.449
 other 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:39.590
 It's going to be like this, let's throw the thread. 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:45.000
 to pass through the throat of the needle 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:49.919
 cut our wire here with the 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:54.440
 the sewing needle and the needle is 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:54.440
 our heart crochet pe
