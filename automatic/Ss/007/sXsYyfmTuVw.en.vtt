it'll smell really bad it doesn't I

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.490 
it'll smell really bad it doesn't I
thought<00:02:19.120> it'd<00:02:19.209> be<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.360> strong<00:02:19.720> garlic<00:02:20.050> smell<00:02:20.380> it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
doesn't smell bad at all actually so

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.710 
doesn't smell bad at all actually so
it's<00:02:23.020> just<00:02:23.110> really<00:02:23.349> fresh<00:02:24.450> really<00:02:25.450> really

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
it's just really fresh really really

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:34.110 
it's just really fresh really really
fresh

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.820 

see<00:02:34.630> how<00:02:34.690> that's<00:02:34.810> coming<00:02:35.230> right<00:02:35.349> off<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.560> it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
see how that's coming right off and it

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.790 
see how that's coming right off and it
took<00:02:39.010> about<00:02:39.130> like<00:02:39.610> 10<00:02:39.910> minutes<00:02:40.150> Doon<00:02:40.870> take<00:02:41.230> 15

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
took about like 10 minutes Doon take 15

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.040 
took about like 10 minutes Doon take 15
I<00:02:41.830> think<00:02:42.220> they<00:02:42.340> recommend<00:02:42.880> just<00:02:43.510> when<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.810> see

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.770 
I think they recommend just when you see
it<00:02:44.140> start<00:02:44.470> drying<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:46.209> when<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.540> should<00:02:46.750> take

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
it start drying is when you should take

00:02:46.780 --> 00:03:11.710 
it start drying is when you should take
it<00:02:47.110> off

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.650
