 (DOCTOR SCHAEMROODT) Hi, I'm Dr. Schaemroodt. Shall we take a look? (GIECHELT) 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.880
 "Goodbye, Dr. Schaemroodt." I am, no doubt about it. 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.280 position:56%
 'I am entering puberty and I get pimples on my face. 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.680
 I feel monstrously ugly. 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.880
 I don't want them and if I pinch them away it hurts. 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.560
 I have the measles or something exactly. Bah.' 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.800
 (LAUGH) Come to the table with those blackheads. (GIECHELT) 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.120
 Better a pimple than a fist in your face. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.480
 (DOCTOR SCHAEMROODT) No, that is definitely not funny. You can't do anything about pimples. 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.760
 You cannot prevent that. Pimples grow on your face, 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.000
 on your shoulders, sometimes on your arms, in your neck 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 and that is because your body produces a substance, tallow, 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.480
 which ensures that your skin does not dry out. 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.240
 But in adolescence, those hormones do run wild 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.240 position:56%
 and they suddenly make way too much sebum 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.480
 making you all of those black dots, blackheads, 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.120
 and in those hidden sebaceous glands the acne bacteria sometimes wanders around 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.400
 who then takes care of those ambitious red nodules in your face. 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.520 position:56%
 Girls can really get pimples from the age of eight. 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.000
 Boys usually a little later, but usually you get pimples 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.000
 between your 14th and your 19th and then you usually get rid of it. 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.400
 Hey. (GIECHELT) Pimples, acne, blackheads, they are harmless 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.720
 and not contagious at all, but admittedly, 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.680
 they are not a pretty sight and you can get a pimple head 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.160
 feel pretty sip. But what you have to do is: Stay away. 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.080
 Not squeezing is really the best solution. 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.320
 You will not get any scars. The pimple does not become a wound 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.720
 and therefore cannot ignite and squeezing pimples sometimes hurts. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.600
 Okay, and then what about the big one here on your forehead 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.920
 what you want to get rid of immediately? You can try a number of things. 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.480
 Apply a little toothpaste to the pimple before bedtime. 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.080
 He dries out. Or you can go to the pharmacy 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.000
 and ask for zinc ointment. Wash your face twice a day with water, 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.760
 clean well. And no makeup, because that clogs your pores 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.760
 and often makes it worse. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.200
 Success with it. (LAUGH) Countdown to nineteen years.
