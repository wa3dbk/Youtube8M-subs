00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.100
 the cuttings of perennials and without 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.049
 no doubt the most radical method 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.420
 and the most effective way to multiply 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:15.420
 plants in large quantities at lower 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.400
 cost in his garden to be successful 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.869
 a cuttings of perennials we go 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.060
 choose a period when he is not in 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.680
 flowers concerning santolines this 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.019
 is not a plant that is famous for 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.170
 its doing so so it's easy enough for 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.300
 recover the heads le chatelel roll 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.610
 nepeta we will take a stem and we 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.710
 can make several grinds on 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.290
 the same niche and we will remove the flowers 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.780
 another plant easy to cut 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.610
 sages the dreams officinal we are going 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.710
 extract the heads we will dispense 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.360
 flowers and then we'll finish with 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.289
 a plant that is very famous in 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.629
 our garden 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.329
 the famous and mining say they 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.489
 simple it cuts very easily to 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.710
 condition to cut the tifs at the base 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.780
 to make these cuttings we will 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.370
 use buckets so for that we have 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.640
 need small plastic buckets of 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.769
 7 cm in diameter a good potting soil then a 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.170
 potting seedlings or so a potting soil 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.150
 horticultural ma that time you add 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 a bit of sand or even a tiny 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.640
 little garden soil 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 he must be the poorest 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.460
 possible and that they can well drained 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.170
 we are going to use a non pierced tray we are going 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.280
 fill our cup that we will put in 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.350
 inside our bin 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.759
 once we have filled our skins we will 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.150
 soak them so you do not have to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.740
 hesitate to bring a lot of moisture 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.710
 so that's why I chose a 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.150
 tray that is not pierced we will start 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.750
 to put a little bit of water in 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.210
 area 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.920
 I remove a bucket and inside I 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.990
 can transfer less than 5 liters of water 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.460
 water by subdelegation really helping 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.869
 the buckets that will allow for good 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.579
 that they have modified for that we are going 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.829
 wait a few minutes before doing 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.299
 we cuttings then the principle of 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.560
 cutting is removing the leaves of the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.380
 down you must never bury them 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.930
 I detach the small leaves even the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.780
 small stems it concerns santolines 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.370
 I then plans the ideal is to 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.650
 to put several grinds by bucket 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.240
 if we put three years now 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.920
 to things then you will notice that 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.480
 the stumps have a little more leaves 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.520
 important much wider when 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.360
 will do we will remove the leaves of the 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.700
 down one detaches them carefully without 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.550
 tear the rod 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.100
 there we have a knot we will cut soul 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.720
 you can use a knife or 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.610
 graft the suitcase and a good pair of 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.100
 scissors since there are big 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.250
 leaves I cut the leaves on 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.230
 the end and I plant another 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.210
 very effective technique to succeed the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.850
 cuttings so here it is about us is 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.880
 peta we will break the cuttings and the 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.000
 plant directly then for that we go 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.490
 use we must we will hold the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.790
 cutting on one side and we will attract 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.580
 the Aude 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.250
 as it is a long stem we are going 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.270
 continue our cuttings on the same stem 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.330
 so we will break this cuttings and we 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.880
 plant directly 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.310
 we will continue with the wingmen then 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.500
 the principle is the same one 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.040
 remove the leaves from the bottom never 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.110
 bury the leaves 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.360
 finally little cleaning and I plant 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.600
 directly then with teachers 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.489
 first and foremost I pique my cuttings this 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.950
 which is important if it's never 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.560
 too protected from cuttings because we risk 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.330
 to have a rot afterwards and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.910
 we finish the grinds by covering them 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.280
 with a plastic cover so 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.930
 to have a stifled culture this 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.700
 terrine with the cuttings inside 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.130
 we can leave it in this greenhouse or 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.680
 otherwise you simply place it at 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.200
 long or better shade outside at 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.730
 one month and a half ago 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.340
 we get cuttings 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.750
 here it is nepeta root 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.750
 close to planting
