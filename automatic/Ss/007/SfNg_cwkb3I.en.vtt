What's up guys? I'm Michael Abreu from Universal Call of Duty Heroes channel

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.180
Today I'm gonna continue showing you more about campaign saga

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.960
This time, Campaign South Asia - Mission 2

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.380
The way I will atack today is very effective, as it uses few killstreaks

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.100
You are gonna use more your troops than your killstreaks

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.260
As you must have noticed, in my last video I used a lot of killstreaks

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.860
And it can be bad if you don't have a good amount of skill points

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.240
So, these are the troops that I'm gonna use

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.900
8 AGRs, YES, 8 AGRs

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.180
5 Juggernaults

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.400
Allys reinforcements

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.085
And the hero Soap

00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:18.345
So, I advise you to use all these troops, if you don't have them, at least use what you have the way I'll show you

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:25.700
Reminder: my AGRs are high level, so they are quite strong

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.680
I'm gonna show you the basics and what you can do if you don't succeed

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.860
or if your AGRs are low level

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.900
Anyway, we are gonna use the hero Soap

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.620
Just because he has the killstreaks to disarm bombs and heal

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.980
In this mission, there is a lot of mines, so for sure you are gonna need it

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.960
So, let's go to the interesting part

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.380
Well, this is the mission 2, South Asia, let's do it calmly, there is no need to hurry

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.140
Because there is no time limit, so keep calm

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.400
The first thing, let's deploy right here the hero Soap

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.420
To disarm some mines in this side

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.720
Use it in this direction

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.340
Booooooomm!!!

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.680
Well, it destroyed many of them

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.200
Let's bring him here and do the same thing

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.020
I'll just put him a bit this side, to lauch it aside

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.240
Cool

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.300
As you can see, it destroyed a bunch of them

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.200
So always start this way and then put soap this side so he wouldn't die 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.320
You are gonna need him later

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.320
Now, let's deploy 2 AGRs right here and 2 more at the right side

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.060
So, 2 of them at the right side and 2 at the left side, let's go

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.840
Deploy the first one and then the second and deploy 1, 2, 3 juggernaults

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.180
Same thing here, deploy the first one, second and 1, 2

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:26.040
Let them go, take Soap and if you are dying, you can bring him inside and use the heal skill, as you wish

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.840
If you want to go inside and use heal, you can do it, there is no problem at all

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.840
Well, at this side he can't take much, there is just this side left

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.500
What you're gonna do

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.540
Deploy 2 here

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.226
And 2 more here

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:51.406
And use your allies troops

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.360
You can bring Soap this way

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:08.900
Bring him here, and if you think it's necessary to use the heal skill, just use it normally

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:18.100
As my AGRs are quite strong, there is no need to use but if I was going to use, I could use it right here, look

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.260
See, it's healing. So you can use here Soap to heal in case your troops are dying

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.940
Reminder: you have seen the amount of mines in this mission

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.420
So use Soap, don't use Harper

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:47.160
Just because he doesn't have the killstreak to disarm mines

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:56.260
Well, after that, it's 100%, you just have to be patient and wait your troops destroy everything

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.240
And that's all good

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:08.040
If you follow this strategy with your AGRs, you won't have any difficulties with the laser turrets

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.360
Well, I hope it can be useful to all of you

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:20.840
In this mission I forgot to leave the game music on, so I used a background music to be more pleasant

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.920
Aftet this, I'll be posting South Asia - Mission 3 right away, it's not that hard, it'll help all of you
