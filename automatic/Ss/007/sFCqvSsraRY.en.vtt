00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello to all boys girl then in the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.509
 elbow gone for maicon is another 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.370
 video this will be the video of 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.050
 series back to school is the first video 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.790
 of the back to school series and make up 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.940
 for second and third girls 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.550
 average, however, of 12 13 years expected 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.880
 that we exist the carpet then girls 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.080
 make up is a make up and this is it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.000
 what I did 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.849
 from this very very simple part 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.699
 then you see this this white 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.230
 very lit but in reality it is very much 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.180
 much more read also because it 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.600
 fade because as there is a lot of light 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.180
 strong in this in this period and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.430
 so nothing seems very strong but me 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.600
 I will leave you a photo at the end of the video 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 anyway with me as an icon or before 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.770
 of the video and in such a way that you see that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.039
 the makeup is not of this white like that 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.690
 on but it is a much more dull color 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.859
 then I immediately tell myself the products I am 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.870
 then using as a thing if 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.390
 You are bigger girls than you want 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.309
 just see how you trick me if you see that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.110
 I do something wrong for 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.119
 Please don't offend me because I don't 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.710
 I want to hurt my videos the exact 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.710
 because I want to improve to wear makeup 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.330
 since I really like makeup and 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.049
 and then following you I do 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.310
 tell me something wrong and tell me 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.740
 limited advice I want to 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.150
 tips type but not in the April 6 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.100
 eyeshadow and lipstick of advice of 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.340
 apply it with this little brush 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.350
 by nuance then shoot better 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.020
 advice of this kind because of the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.750
 end the grids the offenses do not give you 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.220
 a help ie you can have 10,000 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.659
 offenses under your videos but in the end 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.610
 not better then I would always have 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.740
 so I instead of having offended e 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.830
 I prefer criticism 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.690
 constructive so I become better at it 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.399
 therefore after this premise falls within 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.050
 grant usage projects from 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.289
 this my stake of you now that now 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:01.170
 if tanned all the writing goes to 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:02.789
 take this color here here 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.130
 that is, as you can see, it is not for nothing 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.380
 what you see here there I'll see 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.509
 I took this color and it seems instead 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.030
 this white but this is not here 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:18.110
 make sure this is like a minnow 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.110
 and also quite a few clicks 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.239
 then always read a mascara in the eye 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.030
 I use this almost beyond style that me 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.370
 my mom gave it and then oh well 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.620
 let 's say the tutorial then first 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.390
 I ca n't approach it because the quality 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.040
 at most in the phone and therefore not me 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.810
 brings the quality closer to the maximum 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.150
 in the phone 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.739
 at the beginning do not apply my base of 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:47.600
 I agree and that you are the internship that I am 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:53.670
 doing the stuff to put a dozen 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:03:00.030
 that I'm going to blend it well here and now 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:02.040
 type higher up like this 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.620
 obviously fade the lancets that come the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.190
 take off there is a little bit there must be 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.250
 always then taking one I have no brushes 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.100
 sorry professionals take of these 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.650
 unfair brushes and I'm going to take this 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.450
 color here precisely the little fish we say 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.450
 that I told you it wasn't really a 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:27.989
 nice golden special I don't know 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:33.540
 after login I started to apply 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:37.940
 in the beard bra now then fade it 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.940
 so we don't leave it so fade 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:56.349
 it put me back a little from this one too 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.349
 part because he was taking off like this 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.480
 well 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.440
 now it 's the trick that's over 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.200
 we just basically have to 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.200
 add the mascara with a part of the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.459
 clean brush I start to fade a 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.290
 little the eyeshadow to remove for 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.169
 take away the excess of government 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.760
 own access to remove for 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.350
 make it not too bright 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.550
 flashy so I do it for it 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.550
 mirror because it really is 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:48.500
 I was stained asking for eyelashes 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:53.660
 to provide you with live ok it won't seem but 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.370
 it's faded you see now it's a little bit 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.490
 it was noticed the color is not that white 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.460
 accessory you see is so much goal 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.930
 that finished now just puts the 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.930
 mascara my direct steel 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.580
 I thought about doing a lot of makeup 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.890
 simple because it is always 12 13 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.990
 years there is not that much recommended 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.160
 true blue car by I also put back the cover 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.160
 that is taking off 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:42.949
 but I'm here so I'm lucky 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.630
 have very long eyelashes 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.300
 so when he puts on mascara he does it to me 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.919
 like fake eyelashes I like it 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.350
 very 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.789
 finally, I don't apply anything to my face 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.270
 had to apply some figures 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:06:00.139
 the figure in truth I would have put it though 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:02.479
 you do not fight point hate what here from 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.850
 video you do not notice bitter we like it from 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:08.120
 committed too much the 70 type 4 this bluff 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.610
 oh this little bubble concluded bed oh well 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:20.169
 and put it in my lips I apply this 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:20.169
 big and kindling like that 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:35.410
 mom so why then from the video 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.500
 it looks like a super white type 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:42.370
 very bright in the eyes but in reality 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.260
 there were no access to this at all 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.120
 color that you see however not 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.800
 you will see at the very beginning of the video that 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.110
 I will put the picture there anyway 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.140
 miniature you will see that it is not white 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.820
 which can be seen precisely from the archive 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.070
 I didn't apply my arm but if you want 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.230
 you can put it me sincerely not 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.650
 like blush just maybe put the 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.450
 concealer in the pimple and then put the 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.620
 city across the face to dull but 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:10.210
 then I don't put it too sour and 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.340
 not even blush because I don't like it 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.620
 feel the weight 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.470
 no boyfriend then the trick is over 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.180
 this is exactly where it is very good 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.800
 it is also very good for people 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.630
 wearing glasses like me 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.070
 because it makes me look again 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.930
 bigger because already the glasses 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.750
 enlarge your eyes with this 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.850
 trick you have your eyes practically 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.380
 huge so nothing i hope the 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:36.280
 tutorial you enjoyed it was a lot 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:39.430
 simple very easy to make 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.770
 I did it in six minutes because 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.410
 however I have spoken but it can be done 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.660
 quietly in 5 minutes and nothing 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:49.780
 I remain a huge kiss and I really hope so 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.260
 that the video you liked dirty veil 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.680
 of gloss 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.680
 Hello
