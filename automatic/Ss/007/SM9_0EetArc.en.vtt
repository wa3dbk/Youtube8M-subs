00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.450 

computers<00:00:19.349> have<00:00:19.380> come<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.710> long<00:00:19.919> way<00:00:20.099> since<00:00:20.279> we

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
computers have come a long way since we

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.609 
computers have come a long way since we
released<00:00:20.669> 2x<00:00:21.179> so<00:00:21.359> we're<00:00:21.480> really<00:00:21.689> starting<00:00:22.589> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
released 2x so we're really starting to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.009 
released 2x so we're really starting to
push<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.829> little<00:00:22.980> bit<00:00:23.130> more<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.599> 300<00:00:24.599> all<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
push a little bit more and 300 all the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.810 
push a little bit more and 300 all the
weapons<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.499> realistic<00:00:26.310> ballistic

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
weapons have realistic ballistic

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.579 
weapons have realistic ballistic
simulation<00:00:27.419> every<00:00:28.050> single<00:00:28.289> one<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.409> your

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
simulation every single one of your

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.589 
simulation every single one of your
rounds<00:00:28.919> is<00:00:29.039> affected<00:00:29.489> by<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.210> know<00:00:30.300> gravity

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
rounds is affected by you know gravity

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.359 
rounds is affected by you know gravity
and<00:00:31.079> we've<00:00:31.289> modeled<00:00:31.739> off<00:00:31.829> your<00:00:32.009> real-world

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
and we've modeled off your real-world

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.950 
and we've modeled off your real-world
data<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:32.940> not<00:00:33.120> sure<00:00:33.270> how<00:00:33.420> many<00:00:33.480> games<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
data I'm not sure how many games you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.670 
data I'm not sure how many games you
know<00:00:34.050> they<00:00:34.170> may<00:00:34.290> have<00:00:34.470> ballistics

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
know they may have ballistics

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.440 
know they may have ballistics
mutilations<00:00:35.310> but<00:00:35.490> then<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.850> began<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.240> data

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
mutilations but then I began the data

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.580 
mutilations but then I began the data
because<00:00:36.690> they<00:00:36.780> don't<00:00:36.930> work<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.290> army

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
because they don't work for the army

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.900 
because they don't work for the army
so<00:00:38.010> another<00:00:38.190> new<00:00:38.370> features<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.760> really

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
so another new features are really

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.310 
so another new features are really
excited<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.630> unlock<00:00:39.900> system

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320

together<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.799> achieving<00:01:44.520> missions<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.290> think

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
together and achieving missions I think

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.140 
together and achieving missions I think
one<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.010> greatest<00:01:47.190> strengths<00:01:47.700> America's

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
one of the greatest strengths America's

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.240 
one of the greatest strengths America's
Army<00:01:48.390> has<00:01:48.510> always<00:01:48.720> had<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.650> that<00:01:49.950> it's

constantly<00:01:51.030> being<00:01:51.630> developed<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.260> changed

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
constantly being developed and changed

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.640 
constantly being developed and changed

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.199 
store and buy and pick
it's<00:02:09.099> just<00:02:09.399> something<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.759> click<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> button

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209

it's just something you click a button
or<00:02:11.080> in<00:02:11.409> this<00:02:11.590> case<00:02:11.830> actually<00:02:12.099> it'll<00:02:12.459> be

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
or in this case actually it'll be

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.490

you've got to do is launch it and go and

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.180 
you've got to do is launch it and go and
see<00:02:16.659> what<00:02:16.810> we've<00:02:16.930> added<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.500> mission<00:02:17.890> control

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
see what we've added a mission control

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.140 
see what we've added a mission control
or<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.549> actually<00:02:18.670> something<00:02:18.970> we're<00:02:19.120> really

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
or is actually something we're really

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.580 
or is actually something we're really
excited<00:02:19.450> about<00:02:19.659> we<00:02:20.049> can<00:02:20.230> build<00:02:20.379> really

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
excited about we can build really

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.399 
excited about we can build really
compelling<00:02:21.690> environments<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.870> then<00:02:23.110> just

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
compelling environments and then just

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.990 
compelling environments and then just
abstract<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.980> gameplay<00:02:24.310> off<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.849> then

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
abstract the gameplay off and then

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.699 
abstract the gameplay off and then
substitute<00:02:25.420> new<00:02:25.599> gameplay<00:02:25.989> on<00:02:26.170> so<00:02:26.470> we<00:02:26.590> could

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
substitute new gameplay on so we could

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.559 
substitute new gameplay on so we could
have<00:02:26.920> one<00:02:27.549> level<00:02:27.760> that's<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.120> nerve<00:02:28.480> and

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
have one level that's a nerve and

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.059 
have one level that's a nerve and
environment<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.260> we<00:02:29.349> could<00:02:29.470> have<00:02:29.650> let's<00:02:29.950> say

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
environment and we could have let's say

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.309 
environment and we could have let's say
a<00:02:30.099> VIP<00:02:30.459> mission<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.180> then<00:02:31.629> the<00:02:31.750> next<00:02:31.930> round<00:02:32.140> it

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
a VIP mission and then the next round it

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.020 
a VIP mission and then the next round it
could<00:02:32.410> be<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:33.040> know<00:02:33.129> taking<00:02:33.519> hold<00:02:33.730> kind<00:02:33.970> of

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
could be you know taking hold kind of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.880 
could be you know taking hold kind of
capture<00:02:34.360> point<00:02:34.569> mission<00:02:34.840> next<00:02:35.319> round<00:02:35.620> could

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
capture point mission next round could

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.589 
capture point mission next round could
be<00:02:36.040> an<00:02:36.280> assault<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.790> defend<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.209> next<00:02:37.390> round

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
be an assault and defend the next round

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.500 
be an assault and defend the next round
could<00:02:37.720> be<00:02:37.840> an<00:02:37.989> extract<00:02:38.319> and<00:02:38.590> recover<00:02:38.829> so<00:02:39.519> it's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
could be an extract and recover so it's

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.059 
could be an extract and recover so it's
really<00:02:40.690> kind<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.989> compelling<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.440> allows<00:02:41.680> the

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
really kind of compelling it allows the

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.430 
really kind of compelling it allows the
gameplay<00:02:42.579> to<00:02:42.640> be<00:02:42.730> very<00:02:43.019> varied<00:02:44.019> over<00:02:44.349> the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
gameplay to be very varied over the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.160 
gameplay to be very varied over the
course<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.799> several<00:02:45.010> rounds<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.750> radial<00:02:47.079> menu

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
course of several rounds the radial menu

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.289 
course of several rounds the radial menu
we're<00:02:47.620> trying<00:02:47.859> our<00:02:48.040> best<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.549> really<00:02:48.910> use<00:02:49.120> it

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
we're trying our best to really use it

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.729 
we're trying our best to really use it
to<00:02:49.599> its<00:02:49.750> full<00:02:49.959> potential<00:02:50.349> we<00:02:50.920> hope<00:02:51.099> to<00:02:51.370> allow

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
to its full potential we hope to allow

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.099 
to its full potential we hope to allow
small<00:02:53.739> gestures<00:02:54.310> in<00:02:54.730> which<00:02:55.000> people<00:02:55.660> will<00:02:55.780> have

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
small gestures in which people will have

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.080 
small gestures in which people will have
quick<00:02:56.440> movements<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.609> way<00:02:57.760> they<00:02:57.910> won't

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
quick movements in that way they won't

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.430 
quick movements in that way they won't
have<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.329> memorize<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:58.810> many<00:02:58.959> keys<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.349> the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
have to memorize so many keys on the

have to memorize so many keys on the
keyboard<00:02:59.650> however<00:03:00.489> still<00:03:00.819> be<00:03:01.359> able<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.629> be
