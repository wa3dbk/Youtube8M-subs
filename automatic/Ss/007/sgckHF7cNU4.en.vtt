00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.570
 I have here 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.030

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.130

 Percent is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.140
 especially in Asia 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.410
 to be drawn 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.280
 it shows up 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.280
 this great 3 Seeger brush here 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.170
 be able to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.200
 only to spread that a broad stay in the StÃ¤del 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.770
 then leaking in a spike 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.900
 I can also use this brush 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.410
 smaller leaves 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.970
 fix 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.290
 and in this way 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 of compositions 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.360
 GEA the tip of the brush is so fine 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.940
 that is also in the picture 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.130
 Can carry strokes on 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.280
 "I want to go now 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.130
 Possibility to demonstrate that of some aquariums 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.839
 is used and that working 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.999
 Roger Kreft 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.829
 this is a 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.429
 rubber 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.659
 Arteaga 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.159
 the in with you Iech 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.849
 Bill Gates does not apply a pattern at all 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.819
 have one here 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.719
 provided a few victories percent and paint the water surface 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.879
 the special thing is 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.899
 that I'm after 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:46.369
 the BND and the dry process 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.229
 these the sails 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.189
 can pull and then have that 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.369
 complete way 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.149
 Neither paper 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:00.570
 Of course you can do that with flowers still life 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.019
 or others 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.389
 work now 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.389
 why do it? 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.699
 Century leads 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.829
 that is here now 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.829
 just push away 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.489
 clean cheerful way paper 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.349
 comes to light 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.889
 now you could put a boat underneath if you did 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.489
 because when the sailboats should be 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.559
 and know 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:38.299
 you could have 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.629
 again in this way 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.299
 completed
