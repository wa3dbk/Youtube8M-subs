00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi my name is ulyana or people i'm not 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.240
 I know when I last 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.130
 waited for something as much as a trailer 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.889
 and the fifth wave so you well and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.840
 finally picked up when it happened 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 something very much a bunch of times already mentioned in 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.279
 my videos and I just couldn't 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.109
 come off this is the book that is me 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.020
 captured literally from the first pages and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.400
 didn't let go until the very end 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.199
 I run out of carpet this do not believe me 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.330
 I immediately wanted to be entrusted with the ultimate 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.460
 the sea about which I heard huge 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.590
 amount of conflicting feedback and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.200
 many said pieces nickname absolutely not 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.590
 she's related strange much worse than 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.530
 first part and i'm from a big screen so 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.969
 caution came to the beginning of the reading and persons 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 series as a whole because i'm not very 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.700
 I love when the following parts after the first 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.239
 it gets much worse 1 gram is clearly worse 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.399
 clearly more stretched but 5 wave this 5 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.879
 a series of 3 books that i'm waiting with a huge 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.620
 impatience is what i can 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.570
 say love and can't wear 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.449
 physical media let's say book 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.320
 infinite sea because I came 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.659
 ended that literally the night before 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.210
 fly away to cyprus and sister somewhere removed 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.790
 her paper generation and so could not on 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.010
 but in any case, I have this gap 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.200
 highway endless sea seemed more 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.170
 deep both in terms of heroes and in 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.960
 respect of the plot than was the fifth wave and 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.180
 today is finally out today can 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.189
 to be human I do n't know came out the trailer 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.680
 the fifth wave that was promised than at the beginning 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.730
 August , you were detained again Petya flour 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.470
 left home in the morning why not 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.190
 I would not have time to watch together now 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.000
 with you the first time i watch the trailer and i 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.800
 expect 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.300
 something very clearly if you haven't 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.710
 read the fifth wave or not heard of 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.480
 this book I wondered if it 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.400
 postapokalipsis we have a girl 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.840
 the main heroine who are trying to survive 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.360
 after the influx 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.370
 huge amounts of all sorts in lol 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.020
 who brought with them destruction 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.970
 of different nature father cantata 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.010
 minorities who survived more 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.050
 now they deserve to understand what 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.910
 There were 5 waves and together with the face of the egg 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.310
 together with readers together with you we 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.650
 must understand that there will be 5 I really 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.750
 I liked the story I think it's one 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.460
 of the highest quality works of this kind 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.860
 the characters that I met and a couple 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.020
 Tatiana was found on literature and study 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.610
 in general what is happening in the market so they 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.320
 started in front of me my computer and 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.510
 I'm with you now for the first time 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.510
 watch trailer Petrovna 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.190
 partly this ship that hovers over 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.410
 the planets above the city doesn't matter to me 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.269
 remind the show visitors when I 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.700
 I read a book from time to time 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.000
 there was a feeling that I was watching a series 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.000
 visitors 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.010
 per year 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.180
 is always 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.130
 rather please can i have a movie i 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.380
 imagined that the trailer would be about 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.180
 i like the cast 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.680
 because I have n't read the book already 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.420
 after appearing with the map 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.610
 fully order and it was easier for me 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.500
 it takes the characters in the format 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.110
 in which they will look available 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.000
 so you can say so what is their principle 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.940
 like the cast of I ' 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.750
 like his schreiberg you are so called 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.690
 an actor who is from a whale or summarizing an actor 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.730
 I think he should fit in well 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.230
 this role vince is such a super gross river 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.300
 Chloe Grace Moretz 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.520
 I think she's great too 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.100
 health if it is so go to 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.440
 you face 99 percent of the movie and me 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.570
 really like the other actors who 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.740
 The people of the team are selected, I will say that 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.630
 will be actually in parallel 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.180
 developing so to speak storyline 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.300
 anyway i'm tremendously impatient 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.770
 I am waiting for this movie and I will leave the link to smell 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.570

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.220

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.380

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.600
