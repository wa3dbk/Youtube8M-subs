patient hats because we're going to sit
through<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.879> watch<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> make<00:00:45.780> sure

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
through this and watch just to make sure

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
going to stop it right here just so we

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
going to stop it right here just so we
can<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> good<00:00:56.039> idea<00:00:56.100> all<00:00:56.520> right<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:56.699> this

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
can get a good idea all right now this

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
can get a good idea all right now this
is<00:00:56.969> august<00:00:57.480> twenty-third<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.590> see

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
is august twenty-third as you can see

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.830 
is august twenty-third as you can see
they're<00:00:59.070> down<00:00:59.520> at<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> bottom<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.690> we're

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
they're down at the bottom if we're

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.470 
they're down at the bottom if we're
jupiter<00:01:01.230> mercury<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.980> common<00:01:02.969> element<00:01:03.359> on

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
jupiter mercury and common element on

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.200 
jupiter mercury and common element on
now<00:01:04.170> if<00:01:04.320> earth<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.739> over<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.489> stereo-b<00:01:06.000> is

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
now if earth is over there stereo-b is

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
now if earth is over there stereo-b is
going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.570> down<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> aligned

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
going to be down here kind of aligned

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.460 
going to be down here kind of aligned
with<00:01:08.400> mercury<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:08.990> common<00:01:09.990> allen<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.350> you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
with mercury and common allen and you

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.859 
with mercury and common allen and you
can<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:10.799> jupiter<00:01:11.010> right<00:01:11.490> there<00:01:11.869> okay

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
can see jupiter right there okay

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.320 
can see jupiter right there okay
everything's<00:01:13.320> pretty<00:01:13.530> much<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.950> line<00:01:13.979> with

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
everything's pretty much in line with

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.030 
everything's pretty much in line with
stereo<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.960> should<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.350> okay<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.740> we

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
stereo be as it should be okay so we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.820 
stereo be as it should be okay so we
know<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:17.939> Jupiter<00:01:18.659> mercury<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
know that that is Jupiter mercury and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.550 
know that that is Jupiter mercury and
allanon

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.719

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
appears to now be moving towards Jupiter

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.819 
appears to now be moving towards Jupiter

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
in there now the blast is going to come

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.130 
in there now the blast is going to come
and<00:02:11.299> admittedly<00:02:12.299> it<00:02:12.480> does<00:02:12.660> look<00:02:12.900> like<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.380> is

can say that you know that what

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.420 
can say that you know that what
everything<00:03:22.500> is<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.860> there<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.220> can<00:03:23.250> watch

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
everything is on there you can watch

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.429 
everything is on there you can watch
Alan<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.299> going<00:03:24.480> across<00:03:24.689> the<00:03:24.959> screen<00:03:25.170> and

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
Alan and going across the screen and

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.610 
Alan and going across the screen and
whatever<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.280> anomaly<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:27.079> it<00:03:28.079> went<00:03:28.260> on<00:03:28.349> for

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
whatever that anomaly is it went on for

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.020 
whatever that anomaly is it went on for
a<00:03:28.650> number<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.950> hours<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.489> take<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:29.819> into

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
a number of hours so take that into

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.759 
a number of hours so take that into
consideration<00:03:30.180> when<00:03:30.810> making<00:03:30.959> your<00:03:31.230> judgments

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769
