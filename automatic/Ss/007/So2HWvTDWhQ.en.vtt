00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.860
 Shredded glass road and vinegar 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:27.180
 Oh, how far is my home from me now. 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.460
 And I made myself a bed of roses 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.140
 Where I can not see you 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.760
 and I can not see you anymore 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.140
 And I heard from my father and mother: 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.660
 "Hold the hand of God, one day you will pluck" 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.140
 I heard from my girlfriend and my brother: 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.440
 "Who would have thought that one day you would let go?" 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.240
 One day you would release 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:34.960
 Formulas and scientific attempts 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.500
 What have not I tried so far? 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.820
 It hurts to say goodbye. 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:56.520
 when you know it's the last 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.700
 The last 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.260
 And I heard coming from my conscious: 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.440
 "Out of bed, time will surely pass!" 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.160
 I force my eyes to see how much 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.460
 to get to you, going on that glass road 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.380
 going on this glass road 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:42.720
 And I tried to spend my life. 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.580
 far far 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.180
 But you chose to go 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.960
 behind me 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.440
 Even though I've been so lost 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:47.760
 And I tried to spend my life. 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.520
 far far 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:01.840
 But you chose to go after me. 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.380
 Even though I was so lost 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.020
 And I was so lost
