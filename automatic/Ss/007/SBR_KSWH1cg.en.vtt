instrument<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:13.700> want<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:14.000> swap<00:02:14.209> out<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
instrument you want to swap out the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.430 
instrument you want to swap out the
inside<00:02:15.019> of<00:02:15.380> each<00:02:16.220> valve<00:02:16.550> casing<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:18.380> is

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
inside of each valve casing this is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.590 
inside of each valve casing this is
going<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.769> remove<00:02:19.069> any<00:02:19.400> debris<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.819> dirt<00:02:20.209> old

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
going to remove any debris and dirt old

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.780 
going to remove any debris and dirt old
valve<00:02:20.930> oil<00:02:21.230> that's<00:02:21.500> inside<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.160> casing<00:02:22.430> as

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
valve oil that's inside the casing as

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.270 
valve oil that's inside the casing as
you<00:02:23.600> can<00:02:23.720> see<00:02:23.930> we<00:02:24.290> rolling<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.830> valves<00:02:25.130> on<00:02:25.250> a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you can see we rolling the valves on a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.160 
you can see we rolling the valves on a
brand<00:02:25.610> new<00:02:25.730> instrument<00:02:26.329> even<00:02:26.690> on<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.959> new

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
brand new instrument even on that new

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.560 
brand new instrument even on that new
instrument<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:28.130> do<00:02:28.370> get<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.790> little<00:02:29.060> bit<00:02:29.390> of

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
instrument you do get a little bit of

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.960 
instrument you do get a little bit of
grit<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:29.840> dirt<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:31.160> it's<00:02:31.340> very<00:02:31.459> important

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
grit and dirt so it's very important

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.729 
grit and dirt so it's very important
that<00:02:32.000> periodically<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.930> clean<00:02:33.290> out<00:02:33.320> the

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
that periodically you clean out the

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.610 
that periodically you clean out the
valve<00:02:34.310> casings<00:02:35.000> on<00:02:35.239> your<00:02:35.510> instrument<00:02:36.110> we're

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
valve casings on your instrument we're

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.000 
valve casings on your instrument we're
going<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.799> do<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.070> same<00:02:37.310> for<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.610> Pistons

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
going to do the same for the Pistons

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.340 
going to do the same for the Pistons
take<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.160> cheese<00:02:40.400> cloth<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.079> just<00:02:42.079> wipe

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
take that cheese cloth and just wipe

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.789 
take that cheese cloth and just wipe
away<00:02:42.530> any<00:02:42.920> dirt<00:02:43.220> debris<00:02:43.989> old<00:02:44.989> valve<00:02:45.320> oil<00:02:45.590> that

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
away any dirt debris old valve oil that

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.990 
away any dirt debris old valve oil that
tends<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:46.280> gum<00:02:46.459> up<00:02:46.489> in<00:02:46.850> there<00:02:48.610> make<00:02:49.610> sure<00:02:49.790> that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
tends to gum up in there make sure that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.759 
tends to gum up in there make sure that
these<00:02:50.180> are<00:02:50.360> clean<00:02:50.660> lubricated<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.680> running

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
these are clean lubricated and running

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.280 
these are clean lubricated and running
smoothly

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.570 

again<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.440> can<00:02:59.560> see<00:02:59.740> even<00:03:00.070> on<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.190> brand<00:03:00.490> new

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
again you can see even on a brand new

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.850 
again you can see even on a brand new
instrument<00:03:01.150> there's<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.810> little<00:03:02.230> bit<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.560> grit

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
instrument there's a little bit of grit

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.830 
instrument there's a little bit of grit
and<00:03:02.980> grime<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.250> is<00:03:03.610> still<00:03:04.180> stuck<00:03:04.480> in<00:03:04.660> there

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
and grime that is still stuck in there

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.060 
and grime that is still stuck in there
so<00:03:04.990> this<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.230> very<00:03:05.380> important<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:05.920> make<00:03:06.040> sure

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
so this is very important to make sure

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.370 
so this is very important to make sure
that<00:03:06.340> things<00:03:06.580> are<00:03:06.670> clean<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.150> running<00:03:07.210> smooth

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.900 

so<00:03:11.380> all<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.650> pistons<00:03:12.010> encasing<00:03:12.490> it<00:03:12.550> are<00:03:12.670> clean

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
so all the pistons encasing it are clean

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.490 
so all the pistons encasing it are clean
it's<00:03:13.030> time<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.390> lubricate<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.900> valves<00:03:14.380> and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
it's time to lubricate the valves and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.910 
it's time to lubricate the valves and
then<00:03:15.040> reassemble<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> instrument<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:17.860> you

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
then reassemble the instrument so you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.850 
then reassemble the instrument so you
take<00:03:18.100> your<00:03:18.250> valve<00:03:18.430> oil<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.970> place<00:03:19.709> five<00:03:20.709> to

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
take your valve oil and place five to

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.980 
take your valve oil and place five to
six<00:03:21.100> drops<00:03:22.080> over<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.410> piston<00:03:24.720> making<00:03:25.720> sure

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
six drops over the piston making sure

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.850 
six drops over the piston making sure
that<00:03:26.770> it<00:03:27.130> gets<00:03:27.340> over<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.090> entire<00:03:28.860> bearing

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
that it gets over the entire bearing

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.979 
that it gets over the entire bearing
surface<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.910> piston<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.690> we're<00:03:34.840> going<00:03:34.959> to

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
surface of the piston and we're going to

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.570 
surface of the piston and we're going to
work<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.290> piston<00:03:35.680> in<00:03:35.800> from<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.100> bottom<00:03:36.459> of

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
work the piston in from the bottom of

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.070 
work the piston in from the bottom of
the<00:03:36.700> valve<00:03:36.910> that's<00:03:37.209> another<00:03:37.600> reason<00:03:37.840> why<00:03:38.050> I

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
the valve that's another reason why I

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.350 
the valve that's another reason why I
removed<00:03:38.470> those<00:03:38.709> bottom<00:03:39.070> caps<00:03:39.310> this<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.209> where

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
removed those bottom caps this is where

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.750 
removed those bottom caps this is where
the<00:03:40.510> valve<00:03:40.720> actually<00:03:41.260> runs<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.860> it's<00:03:42.370> easier

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
the valve actually runs and it's easier

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.490 
the valve actually runs and it's easier
to<00:03:42.790> make<00:03:43.090> sure<00:03:43.300> that<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.630> valve<00:03:43.930> oil<00:03:44.200> gets

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
to make sure that that valve oil gets

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.199 
to make sure that that valve oil gets
all<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.920> way<00:03:45.040> around<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.610> surface<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:46.090> the

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
all the way around the surface of the

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.820 
all the way around the surface of the
piston<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.440> casing<00:03:47.890> too<00:03:49.800> you<00:03:50.800> just

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
piston and in the casing too you just

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.590 
piston and in the casing too you just
want<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.400> move<00:03:51.520> the<00:03:51.670> piston<00:03:51.880> in<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.390> out<00:03:52.450> of

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
want to move the piston in and out of

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.360 
want to move the piston in and out of
the<00:03:52.690> casing<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.320> you<00:03:53.440> can<00:03:53.650> rotate<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:54.250> a

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
the casing and you can rotate it a

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.430 
the casing and you can rotate it a
little<00:03:54.400> bit<00:03:54.820> just<00:03:55.660> make<00:03:55.750> sure<00:03:56.080> that<00:03:56.260> that

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
little bit just make sure that that

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.539 
little bit just make sure that that
valve<00:03:56.709> oil<00:03:56.890> covers<00:03:57.430> evenly<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:03.160> can<00:04:03.340> see

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
valve oil covers evenly you can see

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.130 
valve oil covers evenly you can see
there<00:04:03.790> that<00:04:03.820> there's<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.299> slot<00:04:04.600> for<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.870> valve

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
there that there's a slot for the valve

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.070 
there that there's a slot for the valve
guide<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.440> narrow<00:04:05.890> and<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.459> wide<00:04:06.700> side<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.930> want

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
guide a narrow and a wide side you want

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.810 
guide a narrow and a wide side you want
to<00:04:08.170> line<00:04:08.380> those<00:04:08.620> up<00:04:08.680> with<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.220> valve<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:09.700> that

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
to line those up with the valve so that

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.580 
to line those up with the valve so that
all<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.060> ports<00:04:10.360> on<00:04:10.510> your<00:04:10.540> valve<00:04:10.930> will<00:04:11.320> line<00:04:11.560> up

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
all the ports on your valve will line up

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:23.690 
all the ports on your valve will line up
and<00:04:12.160> your<00:04:12.280> instrument<00:04:12.640> will<00:04:12.760> work<00:04:12.940> properly

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.920 

place<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.630> piston<00:04:24.990> back<00:04:25.170> into<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.650> casing

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
place the piston back into the casing

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.150 
place the piston back into the casing
make<00:04:27.930> sure<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:28.290> it<00:04:28.380> works<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.860> you'll<00:04:28.980> hear

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
make sure that it works and you'll hear

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.900 
make sure that it works and you'll hear
a<00:04:29.190> click<00:04:29.490> when<00:04:29.670> those<00:04:29.850> valve<00:04:30.120> guides<00:04:30.420> line<00:04:30.780> up

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
a click when those valve guides line up

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.780 
a click when those valve guides line up
let's<00:04:32.910> screw<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.480> top<00:04:33.660> cap<00:04:33.960> back<00:04:34.230> on<00:04:37.700> at<00:04:38.700> this

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
let's screw the top cap back on at this

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.760 
let's screw the top cap back on at this
point<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.300> can<00:04:39.480> put<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.750> bottom<00:04:40.020> cap<00:04:40.260> back<00:04:40.500> on

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
point you can put the bottom cap back on

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.710 
point you can put the bottom cap back on
-<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.780> you<00:04:43.440> see<00:04:43.620> we<00:04:43.770> have<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:44.540> piston<00:04:45.540> that's

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
- and you see we have a piston that's

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.160 
- and you see we have a piston that's
running<00:04:45.990> smoothly<00:04:46.670> cleaned<00:04:47.670> and<00:04:47.820> lubricated

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
running smoothly cleaned and lubricated

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.840 
running smoothly cleaned and lubricated
we're<00:04:49.170> going<00:04:49.320> to<00:04:49.380> repeat<00:04:49.680> that<00:04:49.710> step<00:04:50.160> for

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
we're going to repeat that step for

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.750 
we're going to repeat that step for
pistons<00:04:51.240> two<00:04:51.420> and<00:04:51.570> three
