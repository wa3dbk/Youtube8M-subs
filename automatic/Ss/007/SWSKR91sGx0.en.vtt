doughnut and then the actual doll joint

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.330 
doughnut and then the actual doll joint
itself<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:39.440> is<00:01:39.590> how<00:01:39.710> they<00:01:39.860> go<00:01:39.979> on<00:01:40.009> you'll

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
itself and this is how they go on you'll

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.339 
itself and this is how they go on you'll
have<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.700> washer<00:01:41.179> and<00:01:41.410> lock<00:01:42.410> nut<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:44.810> the

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
have the washer and lock nut on the

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.999 
have the washer and lock nut on the
other<00:01:46.099> side<00:01:46.959> it'll<00:01:47.959> slip<00:01:48.170> over<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.709> doll

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
other side it'll slip over the doll

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.339 
other side it'll slip over the doll
joint<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.610> let's<00:01:50.209> say<00:01:50.360> my<00:01:50.509> thumb<00:01:50.869> is<00:01:51.140> the

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
joint and let's say my thumb is the

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.180 
joint and let's say my thumb is the
fabric<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:52.310> we'd<00:01:52.490> be<00:01:53.000> fabric<00:01:53.479> in<00:01:53.630> between<00:01:54.190> so

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
fabric that we'd be fabric in between so

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.550 
fabric that we'd be fabric in between so
my<00:01:55.520> thumb<00:01:55.789> is<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.030> fabric<00:01:56.569> and<00:01:56.750> basically<00:01:57.200> you

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
my thumb is the fabric and basically you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.109 
my thumb is the fabric and basically you
would<00:01:57.739> push<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:59.300> lock<00:01:59.810> nut<00:02:00.050> in<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.289> washer

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
would push the lock nut in the washer

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.570 
would push the lock nut in the washer
towards<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.690> base<00:02:03.050> of<00:02:03.319> the<00:02:03.649> dull<00:02:04.039> joint<00:02:04.340> and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
towards the base of the dull joint and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.150 
towards the base of the dull joint and
it<00:02:04.700> will<00:02:04.789> lock<00:02:05.000> into<00:02:05.270> place<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:06.619> this<00:02:06.800> is<00:02:06.979> my

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
it will lock into place so this is my

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.070 
it will lock into place so this is my
puppet<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.700> I've<00:02:07.880> made<00:02:08.509> for<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:08.840> tutorial

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
puppet that I've made for this tutorial

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.520 
puppet that I've made for this tutorial
and<00:02:10.030> this<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.330> arm<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.660> haven't<00:02:11.959> plucked

your arm when you're
for<00:02:47.599> me<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.620> could<00:02:48.860> hurt<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.670> it's

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
for me and it could hurt you and it's

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.180 
for me and it could hurt you and it's
just<00:02:50.000> awkward<00:02:50.599> so<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.500> do<00:02:51.739> sort<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.099> the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
just awkward so I like to do sort of the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.540 
just awkward so I like to do sort of the
opposite<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.450> what<00:02:53.599> I<00:02:53.629> do<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.170> get<00:02:54.769> the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
opposite so what I do is I get the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.589 
opposite so what I do is I get the
washer<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.300> lock<00:02:56.480> nut<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:58.450> yet<00:02:59.450> the

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
washer in the lock nut and yet the

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.770 
washer in the lock nut and yet the
washer<00:02:59.810> in<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.140> lock<00:03:00.260> nut<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.650> basically

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
washer in the lock nut and basically

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.960 
washer in the lock nut and basically
sand<00:03:02.780> both<00:03:03.080> of<00:03:03.319> them<00:03:03.440> down<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.730> they

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
sand both of them down so that they

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.280 
sand both of them down so that they
adhere<00:03:05.510> really<00:03:06.319> good<00:03:06.500> when<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.739> put<00:03:07.099> on<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:08.780> hot

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
adhere really good when I put on the hot

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.740 
adhere really good when I put on the hot
glue<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.950> some<00:03:10.730> people<00:03:11.000> like<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.269> use<00:03:11.330> hot

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
glue and some people like to use hot

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.080 
glue and some people like to use hot
glue<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:12.410> combination<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.130> hot<00:03:13.340> glue<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:13.970> and

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
glue a combination of hot glue and and

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.720 
glue a combination of hot glue and and
quick-setting<00:03:17.090> glue<00:03:17.569> like<00:03:17.870> crazy<00:03:18.530> glue<00:03:18.830> you

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
quick-setting glue like crazy glue you

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.089 
quick-setting glue like crazy glue you
can<00:03:19.760> do<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.150> but<00:03:20.599> I<00:03:20.959> find<00:03:21.440> hot<00:03:21.650> glue<00:03:21.860> works

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
can do that but I find hot glue works

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.550 
can do that but I find hot glue works
just<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.489> same<00:03:22.599> so<00:03:23.599> once<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:24.019> put<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.349> glue

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
just the same so once you put the glue

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.920 
just the same so once you put the glue
on<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.950> lock<00:03:25.340> nut<00:03:25.610> you're<00:03:26.480> going<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.660> put<00:03:26.840> the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
on the lock nut you're going to put the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.650 
on the lock nut you're going to put the
washer<00:03:27.200> on<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.980> make<00:03:28.160> sure<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.579> they<00:03:28.790> they

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
washer on and make sure that they they

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.210 
washer on and make sure that they they
set<00:03:29.930> properly<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.829> foal<00:03:31.040> is

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
set properly that the foal is

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.680 
set properly that the foal is
see-through<00:03:31.760> right<00:03:31.970> through<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.480> they're

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
see-through right through that they're

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.800 
see-through right through that they're
that<00:03:33.440> they're<00:03:33.620> parallel<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.250> each<00:03:34.340> other<00:03:34.519> and

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
that they're parallel to each other and

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.710 
that they're parallel to each other and
then<00:03:35.810> simply<00:03:36.530> dig<00:03:37.280> into<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:38.120> pace<00:03:38.329> of<00:03:38.540> your

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
then simply dig into the pace of your

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.089 
then simply dig into the pace of your
arm<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:40.239> pull<00:03:41.239> out<00:03:41.450> all<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:42.049> fabric<00:03:42.470> kind<00:03:43.010> of

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.039 
arm and pull out all the fabric kind of
turn<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.459> inside<00:03:43.819> out<00:03:43.849> and<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.450> want<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.810> set

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
turn it inside out and you want to set

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.860 
turn it inside out and you want to set

like<00:03:59.600> I<00:03:59.750> said<00:03:59.989> simply<00:04:00.920> try<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.489> find<00:04:01.790> where<00:04:02.000> the

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
like I said simply try to find where the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.530 
like I said simply try to find where the
hole<00:04:02.299> is<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:02.780> you're<00:04:03.260> going<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.470> go<00:04:03.680> around

hole is and you're going to go around

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.530 
hole is and you're going to go around
the<00:04:05.540> base<00:04:05.859> very<00:04:06.859> slowly<00:04:07.310> take<00:04:07.940> your<00:04:08.120> time<00:04:08.329> on

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
done you should have an exposed hole at

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.010 
done you should have an exposed hole at
the<00:04:48.080> end<00:04:48.200> of<00:04:48.349> the<00:04:48.440> base<00:04:48.789> of<00:04:49.789> your<00:04:50.240> puppet<00:04:50.750> arm

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
they're together so there's one arm like

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.730 
they're together so there's one arm like
that<00:06:44.860> really<00:06:45.370> fast<00:06:45.669> no<00:06:46.419> sewing<00:06:46.629> involved<00:06:47.169> and
