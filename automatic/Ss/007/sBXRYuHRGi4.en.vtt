00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
can play them all from those disks so

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.170 
can play them all from those disks so
you<00:04:25.570> can<00:04:25.750> save<00:04:25.930> about<00:04:25.960> seven<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:27.220> ten<00:04:27.250> games<00:04:27.850> on

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.320 
now just to have a collection on one
disk<00:04:33.220> so<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:33.520> don't<00:04:33.729> have<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:33.910> pull<00:04:34.090> out<00:04:34.180> an

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
disk so you don't have to pull out an

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.270 
disk so you don't have to pull out an
individual<00:04:34.780> game<00:04:34.990> every<00:04:35.290> time<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:36.010> can<00:04:36.130> just

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
pull out these disks and play games so

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.100 
pull out these disks and play games so
let's<00:04:38.740> turn<00:04:38.919> this<00:04:39.130> off<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.639> take<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.690> look<00:04:40.930> at

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
let's turn this off and take a look at

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.520 
let's turn this off and take a look at
the<00:04:41.530> name<00:04:41.860> which<00:04:42.340> was<00:04:42.520> on<00:04:42.729> here

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
the name which was on here

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.500 
the name which was on here
and<00:04:44.530> it's<00:04:45.010> just<00:04:45.250> saving<00:04:45.460> that<00:04:45.699> anything<00:04:46.389> that

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
and it's just saving that anything that

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.810 
and it's just saving that anything that
you<00:04:46.600> have<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.810> save<00:04:47.620> or<00:04:47.919> any<00:04:48.070> save<00:04:48.340> files<00:04:48.610> that

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
you have to save or any save files that

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.939 
you have to save or any save files that
you've<00:04:48.940> changed<00:04:49.419> so<00:04:50.289> let's<00:04:50.500> switch<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:52.949> MAME

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
you've changed so let's switch to MAME

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.270 
you've changed so let's switch to MAME
64<00:04:54.669> we'll<00:04:55.510> hit<00:04:55.660> enter<00:04:55.840> it'll<00:04:56.830> have<00:04:56.979> to<00:04:57.100> load

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
64 we'll hit enter it'll have to load

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.260 
64 we'll hit enter it'll have to load
this<00:04:57.460> up<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:57.850> 100<00:04:58.479> again<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:59.760> I'm<00:05:00.760> assuming

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
this up to 100 again and I'm assuming

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.580 
this up to 100 again and I'm assuming
that<00:05:01.300> you'd<00:05:01.510> be<00:05:01.630> able<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.870> put<00:05:02.050> homebrew<00:05:02.560> games

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
that you'd be able to put homebrew games

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.370 
that you'd be able to put homebrew games
onto<00:05:03.130> these<00:05:03.340> disks<00:05:03.760> any<00:05:03.970> type<00:05:04.600> of<00:05:04.630> rom<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.229> would

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
onto these disks any type of rom I would

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.379 
onto these disks any type of rom I would
assume<00:05:05.620> would<00:05:05.889> work<00:05:06.100> I<00:05:06.370> know<00:05:06.729> it<00:05:06.940> does<00:05:07.060> on<00:05:07.240> this

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
assume would work I know it does on this

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.010 
assume would work I know it does on this
CD<00:05:08.229> 64<00:05:09.039> so<00:05:09.669> I<00:05:09.729> haven't<00:05:10.120> tried<00:05:10.449> it<00:05:10.600> I<00:05:10.720> don't<00:05:10.930> have

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
CD 64 so I haven't tried it I don't have

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.750 
CD 64 so I haven't tried it I don't have
a<00:05:11.139> zip<00:05:11.710> drive<00:05:11.740> to<00:05:12.130> hook<00:05:12.310> up<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.490> my<00:05:12.700> computer

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
a zip drive to hook up to my computer

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.969 
a zip drive to hook up to my computer
but<00:05:13.690> if<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:13.870> can<00:05:14.020> find<00:05:14.169> one<00:05:14.380> of<00:05:14.410> this<00:05:14.560> for<00:05:14.770> cheap

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
but if I can find one of this for cheap

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.940 
but if I can find one of this for cheap
I'll<00:05:15.190> try<00:05:15.490> and<00:05:15.700> find<00:05:16.690> some<00:05:16.930> kind<00:05:17.139> of<00:05:17.260> homebrew

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
I'll try and find some kind of homebrew

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.460 
I'll try and find some kind of homebrew
game<00:05:18.220> and<00:05:18.430> see<00:05:18.580> if<00:05:18.669> it'll<00:05:18.820> work<00:05:18.880> on<00:05:19.210> here<00:05:19.510> all

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
game and see if it'll work on here all

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.560 
game and see if it'll work on here all
right<00:05:20.530> so<00:05:20.770> that<00:05:20.919> loaded<00:05:21.310> up<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.700> let's<00:05:22.330> turn

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
right so that loaded up and let's turn

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.719 
right so that loaded up and let's turn
the<00:05:22.750> power<00:05:23.080> back<00:05:23.200> on

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
the power back on

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.200 
the power back on
plays<00:05:24.729> the<00:05:24.910> file<00:05:25.210> and<00:05:25.450> on<00:05:26.229> the<00:05:26.380> screen<00:05:27.210> it

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
plays the file and on the screen it

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.379 
plays the file and on the screen it
brings<00:05:28.539> up<00:05:28.780> all<00:05:28.960> these<00:05:29.139> games<00:05:29.729> so<00:05:30.729> I<00:05:31.060> don't

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
brings up all these games so I don't

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.390 
brings up all these games so I don't
know<00:05:31.450> exactly<00:05:31.539> how<00:05:32.020> many<00:05:32.080> this<00:05:32.380> is<00:05:32.650> but<00:05:33.310> you

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
know exactly how many this is but you

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.740 
know exactly how many this is but you
got<00:05:33.570> 1942<00:05:35.760> and<00:05:36.760> see<00:05:37.000> here<00:05:37.180> we'll<00:05:37.330> check<00:05:37.570> out<00:05:37.720> a

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
got 1942 and see here we'll check out a

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.589 
got 1942 and see here we'll check out a
Donkey<00:05:38.530> Kong<00:05:41.880> so<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.000> can<00:05:43.150> load<00:05:43.330> that<00:05:43.360> up

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
Donkey Kong so you can load that up

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.500 
Donkey Kong so you can load that up
change<00:05:44.560> all<00:05:44.770> the<00:05:44.889> settings

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
change all the settings

you can play all these games all on one
disk<00:06:17.080> and<00:06:17.410> I<00:06:18.010> could<00:06:18.190> just<00:06:18.220> imagine<00:06:18.790> how

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
disk and I could just imagine how

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.980 
disk and I could just imagine how
awesome<00:06:19.180> this<00:06:19.570> would<00:06:19.750> have<00:06:19.840> been<00:06:19.990> back<00:06:20.740> in

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
awesome this would have been back in

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.870 
awesome this would have been back in
back<00:06:22.990> in<00:06:23.020> the<00:06:23.200> late<00:06:23.500> 90s<00:06:24.010> when<00:06:24.220> you<00:06:24.610> could<00:06:24.760> go

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
back in the late 90s when you could go

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.630 
back in the late 90s when you could go
out<00:06:25.060> rent<00:06:25.360> 20<00:06:26.350> games<00:06:26.590> put<00:06:27.250> them<00:06:27.400> all<00:06:27.520> onto

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
out rent 20 games put them all onto

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.640 
out rent 20 games put them all onto
these<00:06:27.790> zip<00:06:28.090> disks<00:06:28.300> and<00:06:28.660> then<00:06:29.320> you'd<00:06:29.470> be<00:06:29.590> able

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
these zip disks and then you'd be able

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.260 
these zip disks and then you'd be able
to<00:06:29.740> play<00:06:29.980> them<00:06:30.160> winning<00:06:30.310> any<00:06:30.640> time<00:06:30.910> you<00:06:31.030> want

to play them winning any time you want

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.930 
to play them winning any time you want
it<00:06:31.390> would<00:06:31.510> save<00:06:31.690> you<00:06:31.810> a<00:06:31.840> lot<00:06:32.020> of<00:06:32.050> money<00:06:32.230> and

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
it would save you a lot of money and

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.280 
it would save you a lot of money and
that<00:06:33.940> right<00:06:34.300> now<00:06:34.450> you<00:06:34.510> can't<00:06:34.900> really<00:06:35.050> find

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
that right now you can't really find

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
that right now you can't really find
these<00:06:35.530> on<00:06:35.650> eBay

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
these on eBay

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.040 
these on eBay
I<00:06:36.340> guess<00:06:36.820> because<00:06:37.120> they're<00:06:37.270> not<00:06:37.420> able<00:06:37.720> to<00:06:37.900> be

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
I guess because they're not able to be

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.030 
I guess because they're not able to be
sold<00:06:38.320> on<00:06:38.440> there<00:06:38.650> because<00:06:38.800> they're

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
sold on there because they're

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.250 
sold on there because they're
technically<00:06:39.570> emulating<00:06:40.570> the<00:06:40.660> games<00:06:40.930> and

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
technically emulating the games and

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.710 
technically emulating the games and
illegal<00:06:41.680> so<00:06:42.340> but<00:06:42.880> it<00:06:42.940> was<00:06:43.030> really<00:06:43.330> cool<00:06:43.450> fine

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
illegal so but it was really cool fine

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.930 
illegal so but it was really cool fine
picking<00:06:44.110> this<00:06:44.200> up<00:06:44.260> and<00:06:44.650> I'm<00:06:45.340> having<00:06:45.670> a<00:06:45.790> lot<00:06:45.910> of
