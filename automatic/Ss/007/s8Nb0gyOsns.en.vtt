00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.570
 two times this phrase and then the part 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:55.100

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.920
 Only final scale would be everywhere 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.410
 O 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.140
 O 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.220
 now sometimes 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.220
 then there would be some other part 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.950
 first it is more basic then it will not 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.460
 There is a chromatic sunrise over there and sun and 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.460
 under long 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:07.200
 web, if there, take the sun 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:11.659
 finally there now an option me in the sun 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.280
 flat repeats the same phrase 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.909
 Now change takes the sun. 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.909
 chromatic 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:31.700
 there then sun faccini were there is the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:43.430
 I will do the grammar there and kiss the sun. 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:43.430
 flat op and make the final scale would stay 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.020
 You can not make this part prettier. 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.840
 It has an answer that can enhance a 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.650
 the famous coach who gives a 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.050
 wonderful effect on the melodies when 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.880
 trained went there and remembering that 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.470
 always talking about training is fast 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:10.530
 then you already have this condition or 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:14.390
 You can search so you would be fast. 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.390
 will analyze how it takes effect 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.860
 here they should also do in the sun 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.210
 moreover there janitor next to bring 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:33.200
 pantene color of sunrise to sunset the flat 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.200
 aquino murder 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:53.969
 so it would only end up just the same 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.179
 end of before 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:58.860
 That way it's already changing is the quality 

00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:01.409
 more beautiful to hear 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.029
 So I see that there is not much secret to 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.899
 music is cool but what it does for you 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.329
 touch 

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:08.789
 remembering that this song is a mall 

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:17.389
 neighbor faster so she has 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:17.389
 this beauty shopping animal 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.670
 O 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.670
 the goal 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:41.100
 ae 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.100
 love 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.889
 he 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.990
 Then there's this beautiful song that I 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.180
 I think it's too pretty decorate when you 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.129
 liquor or she tries to touch the ball 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.740
 faster than it is very tasty and a 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:09.139
 Wonderful music to be played in 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.699
 anywhere, but mainly in the 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.949
 time you have a meeting with your 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:15.400
 family that I thought was really cool 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.400
 fine
