00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 sometimes indispensable for aquarius 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello everyone how are you welcome to 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.970
 a new video of an aquarium diary 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.250
 where we're going to talk about the family 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.929
 from the back in the world of fish 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.750
 there is a family especially 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.990
 recommended for aquariums and are the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.390
 tetra or acid cars are usually 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.760
 little ones and they are so varied that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.660
 there are for all types of hard water 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.740
 soft and stockings there are of difficulty 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.170
 easy medium and difficult all are from 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.770
 shoal and it is mandatory to have them in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.270
 group and 26 degrees temperature 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 they need varied food from 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.640
 Artemia to be sex and live food up 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.920
 flakes baby food and vegetable food 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.739
 the ideal is to have them in larger aquariums 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.079
 to 60 liters and also you have to have them in 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.449
 aquariums very planted because they need 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.910
 shadow most of them have 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.940
 iridescences that they use to see themselves in 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.500
 the darkness let's see what they are and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.970
 we will organize them by their parameters 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.190
 ideals 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.420
 we have the blue tetra that needs a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.250
 water of 7 ° ph and up to 15 degrees that h 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.410
 They measure 5 centimeters and live up to 5 years 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.040
 in second place we have the tetra cola 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.090
 bleeding that has a ph of 7 degrees and

 a gh of 10 degrees measure around 5 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.900
 centimeters and live up to 6 years 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.220
 in third place the tetra I put 7 degrees 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.520
 of ph and gh 8 degrees measure 8 centimeters 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.710
 and they live up to 5 years to be a tetra 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.410
 it's quite big in fourth place

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.790
 and gh up to 15 degrees its size is 6 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.450
 centimeters and live up to 12 years much 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.729

 centimeters and live up to 5 years that 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.620

 those of soft medium waters this wants 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.799
 say that they are fish that tend to 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.680
 favor the soft waters but 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.620

 they live four years in fourth place the 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.710
 bleeding heart tetra not to be confused with 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.190
 others you back of similar name your 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.670

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.130
 degrees are 7 centimeters and they live up to 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.100
 10 years this tetra is also quite 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.370
 big in fifth place we have the tetra 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.180
 emperor a pretty awesome fish water 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.930
 of ph 6 degrees and gh 7 degrees its size 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.150

 in seventh place we have a tetra 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.979
 pretty hard to find that 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:22.840
 called tetra loreto with some parameters 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:26.409
 of ph 6 degrees and gh 4 degrees measure 4 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.959
 centimeters and live up to 3 years

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.949
 degrees its size 4 centimeters and live 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.010
 up to 5 years in the ninth place we have 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:47.250
 to the already known and very famous tetra neon 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.560
 with a ph of 5 degrees and a gh of 4 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.430
 degrees its size is 4 centimeters 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.650
 As you already know and live up to 10 years in 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.810
 the tenth place we have the silver tetra 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.889
 rod white not to be confused with tetra 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.550
 silver with a ph of 6.5 degrees and a gh of 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.669
 8 degrees 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.520
 its size 6 centimeters and live up to 4 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:11.010
 years in the eleventh place we have the already 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.680
 also known that after being for very 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:17.070
 famous among the backs with a ph of 6 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.900
 degrees and a gh of 8 degrees its size is 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.169
 about 5 centimeters and live 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.960
 approximately three years finally 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.120
 we have some special cases of 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.370
 let's talk a little first 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:34.540
 place we have the red eye tetra 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:36.699
 it's a low ph fish but high gh a 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.600
 quite peculiar case its parameters 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:43.240
 ideal are the ph of 6 degrees and its gh of 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.180
 15 degrees although as we say it is 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.650
 quite complicated to get this ph and 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:53.320
 Ideal ghs reach 7 centimeters and 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.530
 they live up to 5 years in second place 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.830
 we have the tetra blood fin live 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:02.410
 in water from stockings to hard something 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.680
 also quite weird to be a tetra 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:09.070
 and your water should be around 7 degrees 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.550
 ph ideally and can live well in 20 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.120
 degrees 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:16.030
 gh reach up to 6 centimeters and arrive 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.940
 at 10 years old enough also to be 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.979
 a tetra in third place we have the 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.199
 tetra calls a very nice fish 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.720
 aesthetically but also has the 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.330
 peculiarity that lives in both waters 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.120
 soft as in hard water their 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:34.810
 ideal parameters would be in 6 degrees 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.270
 ph and 10 degrees gh but as we say 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:41.050
 may vary its size ie 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.850
 centimeters and live up to five years and 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.820
 with this we analyze the video of the 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:48.190
 tetra remember that the whole family of 

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.170
 those in the back, whether they are of the water type 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.540
 that you have to have the water of the 

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.730
 aquarium cleaner than usual because 

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.550
 they are something of the livers and some in 

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.650
 special with the quality of the water I hope 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.300
 that will serve you as much as you like 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.520
 I like what you share in the 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:06.990
 social networks and see you in the next 

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.990
 video do not miss goodbye
