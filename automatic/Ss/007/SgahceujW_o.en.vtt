00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.900 

multiplying<00:00:08.990> complex<00:00:09.380> numbers<00:00:09.800> let's<00:00:10.429> first

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
multiplying complex numbers let's first

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.820 
multiplying complex numbers let's first
start<00:00:11.240> with<00:00:11.360> their<00:00:11.660> peer<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:12.140> imaginary

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
start with their peer the imaginary

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.150 
start with their peer the imaginary
times<00:00:13.160> the<00:00:13.490> other<00:00:14.110> complex<00:00:15.110> number<00:00:15.470> what<00:00:16.010> am<00:00:16.099> I

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
times the other complex number what am I

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.859 
times the other complex number what am I
talking<00:00:16.219> about<00:00:16.550> I'm<00:00:17.210> talking<00:00:17.359> about<00:00:17.539> this<00:00:17.810> one

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
talking about I'm talking about this one

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.429 
talking about I'm talking about this one
yeah<00:00:18.710> sure<00:00:19.429> I<00:00:19.789> have<00:00:20.119> that<00:00:20.150> purely<00:00:20.900> imaginary

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
yeah sure I have that purely imaginary

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.249 
yeah sure I have that purely imaginary
number<00:00:22.099> times<00:00:22.550> that<00:00:23.060> complex<00:00:23.570> number<00:00:23.720> that

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
number times that complex number that

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.050 
number times that complex number that
complex<00:00:25.039> number<00:00:25.339> has<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.519> real<00:00:25.759> part<00:00:25.970> and

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
complex number has a real part and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.669 
complex number has a real part and
imaginary<00:00:26.179> part<00:00:26.689> this<00:00:27.109> one<00:00:27.289> doesn't<00:00:27.439> have<00:00:27.560> a

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
imaginary part this one doesn't have a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.919 
imaginary part this one doesn't have a
real<00:00:27.890> part<00:00:28.130> it's<00:00:28.310> just<00:00:28.339> imaginary<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:29.689> then<00:00:29.839> I

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
real part it's just imaginary so then I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.170 
real part it's just imaginary so then I
go<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:30.259> I<00:00:30.349> do<00:00:30.409> distribute<00:00:31.369> just<00:00:31.609> as<00:00:31.730> normal

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
go and I do distribute just as normal

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.349 
go and I do distribute just as normal
there's<00:00:32.810> only<00:00:32.989> one<00:00:33.230> caveat<00:00:33.920> one<00:00:34.579> change<00:00:34.970> in

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:35.359 
there's only one caveat one change in

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.450 
there's only one caveat one change in
this<00:00:35.510> situation<00:00:36.170> I'm<00:00:36.769> gonna<00:00:36.949> go<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.340> I'm

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
this situation I'm gonna go and I'm

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.920 
this situation I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna<00:00:37.579> take<00:00:37.789> that<00:00:37.940> three<00:00:38.210> times<00:00:38.390> that<00:00:38.660> five

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
gonna take that three times that five

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.660 
gonna take that three times that five
that's<00:00:39.260> gonna<00:00:39.559> give<00:00:39.829> me<00:00:40.510> 15<00:00:41.510> I<00:00:41.809> then<00:00:42.559> I<00:00:42.829> go<00:00:43.519> and

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
that's gonna give me 15 I then I go and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.110 
that's gonna give me 15 I then I go and
I<00:00:43.789> multiply<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:44.840> three<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.590> times<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:46.609> 30<00:00:46.879> I

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
I multiply that three I times that 30 I

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.349 
I multiply that three I times that 30 I
and<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:47.780> get<00:00:47.989> plus<00:00:49.000> 9i<00:00:50.000> squared<00:00:52.179> that's<00:00:53.179> the

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
and I get plus 9i squared that's the

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.110 
and I get plus 9i squared that's the
only<00:00:53.690> new<00:00:53.839> part<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:55.070> says<00:00:55.309> I<00:00:55.550> squared<00:00:55.940> is

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
only new part that says I squared is

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.560 
only new part that says I squared is
equal<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.510> minus<00:00:56.600> one

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.000 

finish<00:01:00.320> him<00:01:00.589> that's<00:01:01.339> 15<00:01:01.999> my<00:01:02.539> plus<00:01:03.010> ninety

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
finish him that's 15 my plus ninety

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.180 
finish him that's 15 my plus ninety
times<00:01:04.400> I<00:01:04.730> squared

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
times I squared

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.640 
times I squared
but<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.850> evaluates<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.870> my<00:01:09.050> this<00:01:09.320> one

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
but that evaluates to my this one

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.040 
but that evaluates to my this one
doesn't<00:01:10.490> look<00:01:10.580> like<00:01:10.760> I<00:01:10.880> took<00:01:10.940> two<00:01:11.240> Smurfs<00:01:11.510> well

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
doesn't look like I took two Smurfs well

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.890 
doesn't look like I took two Smurfs well
I'm<00:01:12.470> gonna<00:01:12.620> go<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.160> I'm<00:01:13.310> gonna<00:01:13.370> put<00:01:13.670> this

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna put this

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.390 
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna put this
whoa-whoa-whoa<00:01:14.900> in<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.410> plus<00:01:15.620> bi<00:01:15.800> form<00:01:15.950> cuz

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
whoa-whoa-whoa in a plus bi form cuz

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.750 
whoa-whoa-whoa in a plus bi form cuz
that's<00:01:16.610> complex<00:01:17.350> you're<00:01:18.350> complex<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:19.160> is<00:01:19.430> on

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
that's complex you're complex this is on

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:30.609 
that's complex you're complex this is on
minus<00:01:20.240> 90<00:01:20.990> plus<00:01:21.710> 15<00:01:22.550> I<00:01:26.440> grow<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.470> pair<00:01:27.860> of

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.609 

where's<00:01:31.450> what<00:01:32.450> if<00:01:32.539> we<00:01:32.630> look<00:01:32.810> at<00:01:32.929> complex<00:01:33.320> on

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
where's what if we look at complex on

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.859 
where's what if we look at complex on
complex<00:01:34.159> yeah<00:01:34.490> sure<00:01:35.000> what<00:01:35.390> are<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.539> gonna<00:01:35.630> do

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
complex yeah sure what are you gonna do

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.270 
complex yeah sure what are you gonna do
you're<00:01:36.409> gonna<00:01:36.560> you're<00:01:36.829> gonna<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.159> gonna

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
you're gonna you're gonna you gonna

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.700 
you're gonna you're gonna you gonna
first<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:38.000> out<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.420> last<00:01:38.570> you're<00:01:39.079> gonna<00:01:39.200> foil

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
first it out it last you're gonna foil

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.639 
first it out it last you're gonna foil
haha<00:01:40.280> boiled<00:01:40.789> again<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.659> go<00:01:41.899> first<00:01:42.200> boom

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
haha boiled again so I go first boom

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.069 
haha boiled again so I go first boom
that's<00:01:42.950> nine<00:01:43.219> and<00:01:43.909> then<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.270> go<00:01:44.450> outer<00:01:44.659> that's

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
that's nine and then I go outer that's

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.510 
that's nine and then I go outer that's
whoa<00:01:45.369> minus<00:01:46.369> 3<00:01:46.880> root<00:01:47.240> 2<00:01:47.509> hi<00:01:48.350> alright<00:01:49.100> alright

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
whoa minus 3 root 2 hi alright alright

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.959 
whoa minus 3 root 2 hi alright alright
in<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.539> boom<00:01:50.959> plus<00:01:52.060> no<00:01:54.069> flip<00:01:55.069> it<00:01:55.280> reversed<00:01:55.759> it

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
in a boom plus no flip it reversed it

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.660 
in a boom plus no flip it reversed it
back<00:01:56.479> that<00:01:56.719> math<00:01:56.990> up<00:01:57.259> 2<00:01:57.649> times<00:01:57.890> 3<00:01:58.159> is<00:01:58.219> 6

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
back that math up 2 times 3 is 6

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.809 
back that math up 2 times 3 is 6
I<00:01:58.759> then<00:01:59.479> on<00:01:59.689> I'd<00:01:59.840> say<00:02:00.380> that's<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.709> minus<00:02:01.069> 2<00:02:01.369> root

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
I then on I'd say that's a minus 2 root

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:08.949 
I then on I'd say that's a minus 2 root
2<00:02:02.179> I<00:02:02.689> squared<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:05.810> evaluates<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:07.099> -1<00:02:07.959> so

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
2 I squared that evaluates to -1 so

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.949 
2 I squared that evaluates to -1 so
that's<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.380> that's<00:02:09.709> that's<00:02:09.979> that's<00:02:10.690> minus<00:02:11.690> 1

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
that's that that's that's that's minus 1

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.630 
that's that that's that's that's minus 1
then<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.890> plus<00:02:13.579> 2<00:02:14.180> root<00:02:14.780> 2<00:02:15.019> Oh<00:02:15.470> cuz<00:02:16.160> -<00:02:16.489> that

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
then this is plus 2 root 2 Oh cuz - that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.050 
then this is plus 2 root 2 Oh cuz - that
-<00:02:16.849> is<00:02:17.090> mass<00:02:17.360> then<00:02:17.989> that's<00:02:18.500> 9<00:02:18.769> all<00:02:19.160> right<00:02:19.579> and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
- is mass then that's 9 all right and

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.630 
- is mass then that's 9 all right and
then<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.540> combine<00:02:21.049> these<00:02:21.410> two<00:02:21.769> don't<00:02:22.250> mind<00:02:22.489> me

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
then I combine these two don't mind me

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.869 
then I combine these two don't mind me
if<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.910> can<00:02:23.090> be<00:02:23.209> with<00:02:23.239> it<00:02:23.510> -<00:02:23.690> that's<00:02:24.230> 6<00:02:24.739> minus<00:02:25.220> 3

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
if I can be with it - that's 6 minus 3

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.900 
if I can be with it - that's 6 minus 3
root<00:02:26.420> 2<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:27.410> all<00:02:28.129> right<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.720> don't<00:02:30.610> need<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.760> put

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.430 
root 2 I all right I don't need to put
the<00:02:32.030> real<00:02:32.180> part<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.629> imaginary<00:02:32.690> part

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
the real part and the imaginary part

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.809 
the real part and the imaginary part
together<00:02:33.609> so<00:02:34.609> then<00:02:34.850> that's<00:02:35.510> 9<00:02:35.840> plus<00:02:36.139> 2<00:02:36.980> root<00:02:37.519> 2

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
together so then that's 9 plus 2 root 2

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.640 
together so then that's 9 plus 2 root 2
that's<00:02:38.420> real<00:02:39.340> trill<00:02:40.370> it's<00:02:41.090> true<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.840> real<00:02:42.230> and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
that's real trill it's true and real and

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.129 
that's real trill it's true and real and
then<00:02:43.190> I'm<00:02:43.670> gonna<00:02:43.819> add<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.359> it<00:02:44.389> the<00:02:44.600> imaginary

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:45.139 
then I'm gonna add to it the imaginary

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:50.770 
then I'm gonna add to it the imaginary
part<00:02:45.440> that's<00:02:45.680> 6<00:02:45.980> minus<00:02:46.430> 3<00:02:46.579> root<00:02:47.470> 2<00:02:48.940> pi<00:02:49.940> now

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
part that's 6 minus 3 root 2 pi now

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.289 
part that's 6 minus 3 root 2 pi now
start<00:02:51.620> all<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:51.950> negative<00:02:52.430> comments<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.090> the

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
start all that negative comments in the

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:01.720 
start all that negative comments in the
post<00:02:53.510> below

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.949 

we're<00:03:02.730> sorry<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.300> number<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.599> have<00:03:03.660> dialed

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
we're sorry the number you have dialed

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.400 
we're sorry the number you have dialed
is<00:03:04.290> not<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.530> service<00:03:04.709> at<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.340> time
