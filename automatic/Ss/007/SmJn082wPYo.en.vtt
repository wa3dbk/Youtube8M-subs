00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you're zoomed in but it certainly looks

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.120 
you're zoomed in but it certainly looks
as<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.869> off<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> first<00:01:10.799> kind<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
as if it's off in the first kind of

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.760 
as if it's off in the first kind of
second<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.640> scoping<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.560> kind<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
second of scoping in and this is kind of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.130 
second of scoping in and this is kind of
to<00:01:13.920> combat<00:01:14.340> quickscoping<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> make<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.780> lot

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
to combat quickscoping to make it a lot

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.100 
to combat quickscoping to make it a lot
harder<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.420> tip<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.869> guys

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
harder and so this is my tip you guys

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.960 
harder and so this is my tip you guys
should<00:01:19.500> go<00:01:19.710> into<00:01:19.890> black<00:01:20.159> ops<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> combat

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
should go into black ops going to combat

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.370 
should go into black ops going to combat
training<00:01:21.210> that's<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> recommend<00:01:22.049> then

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
training that's what I recommend then

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.620 
training that's what I recommend then
you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.650> take<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> into<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.130> real<00:01:23.340> game

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
you can take it into a real game

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.820 
you can take it into a real game
situation<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.810> mean<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> can't<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.650> on

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
situation I mean you can't do this on

doesn't stick to them so you have to
really<00:02:39.760> um<00:02:40.060> maybe<00:02:40.690> take<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> little<00:02:41.079> bit<00:02:41.319> more

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
timely shots I would definitely

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.850 
timely shots I would definitely
recommend<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.510> don't<00:02:43.810> quickscope<00:02:44.769> a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
recommend that you don't quickscope a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.660 
recommend that you don't quickscope a
long-range<00:02:45.160> because<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.549> is<00:02:45.610> very

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
long-range because it is very

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.490 
long-range because it is very
challenging<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.540> mean<00:02:46.660> at<00:02:46.780> some<00:02:47.019> point<00:02:47.079> maybe

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
challenging I mean at some point maybe

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.780 
challenging I mean at some point maybe
you're<00:02:47.769> going<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.950> be<00:02:48.010> able<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.190> do<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.489> quite

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
you're going to be able to do that quite

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.190 
you're going to be able to do that quite
effectively<00:02:49.269> but<00:02:49.510> for<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.750> most<00:02:49.870> part<00:02:50.019> just

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
effectively but for the most part just

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.990 
effectively but for the most part just
make<00:02:50.470> sure<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:51.099> hit<00:02:51.220> your<00:02:51.370> shops<00:02:51.640> that's<00:02:51.879> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
often as you can I know this isn't the

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.740 
often as you can I know this isn't the
best<00:03:08.920> example<00:03:09.579> because<00:03:09.790> I'm<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.180> little<00:03:10.629> bit

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
best example because I'm a little bit

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.089 
best example because I'm a little bit
rusty<00:03:11.109> on<00:03:11.140> this<00:03:11.379> because<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.739> haven't<00:03:11.920> played

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
rusty on this because I haven't played

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.250 
rusty on this because I haven't played
with<00:03:12.190> aim<00:03:12.400> assist<00:03:12.609> off<00:03:12.819> but<00:03:13.060> I'm<00:03:14.019> definitely

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
with aim assist off but I'm definitely

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.449 
with aim assist off but I'm definitely
going<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.620> keep<00:03:14.739> doing<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.160> when<00:03:15.340> I'm

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
going to keep doing this when I'm

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.699 
going to keep doing this when I'm
playing<00:03:16.180> black<00:03:16.599> ops<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.109> hopefully<00:03:17.620> you'll
