00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
sorrow and I think that scene was just

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.210 
sorrow and I think that scene was just
put<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.629> we<00:02:12.780> know

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
put in there just so we know

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.760 
put in there just so we know
that<00:02:13.580> zaro<00:02:14.060> can<00:02:14.510> use<00:02:14.780> observation<00:02:15.560> haki

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
that zaro can use observation haki

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.070 
that zaro can use observation haki
