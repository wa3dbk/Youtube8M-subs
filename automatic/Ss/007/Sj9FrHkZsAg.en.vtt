 I know that if I do not print those photos 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.710
 in 100 years nobody will see 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.199
 nobody will find him but I know that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
 If I have one of the house and it's 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.800
 well guarded I'm sure that the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.800
 children of my grandchildren will be able to see my 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.130
 photos and 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.419

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.920
 machine that does everything automatically ok 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.199

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.360

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.360
 there is the usb 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:56.730
 Yesterday 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:00.230
 all up because this is very nice 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.230
 but these are like a background 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.149
 4 x 6 here the photos appear 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.250

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.810

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.810

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.180
 cents through this machine the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.030

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.989
 to print

 practically all the memories of your 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:20.159
 life can cost you only 35 dollars 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.269
 for me it is quite little because it is 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:26.069
 35 dollars is not much and good to me 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.069

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.500

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.170
