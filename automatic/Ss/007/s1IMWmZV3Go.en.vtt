00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.282
 Emblem3 - Perfomance My Girl - (The Temptations) Katy Perry - (California Girls) What Makes You Beautiful - (One Direction) 

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:13.028
 I have the sunshine, 

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:15.515
 on a cloudy day. 

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:20.523
 When it's cold outside, 

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:23.203
 to me, it's like spring. 

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:29.762
 Well, you're going to ask me: 

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.506
 What makes me feel this way? 

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:37.717
 The California girls are unforgettable. 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.283
 Short shorts and tucked bikini, 

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:43.728
 Tanned skin, so hot ... 

00:00:43.983 --> 00:00:45.437
 will melt my popsicle. 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.187
 I do not need money, 

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:53.818
 fortune or fame. 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.453
 I have all the riches, Girl, 

00:00:59.837 --> 00:01:01.936
 that a man could wish for. 

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:06.579
 All tan, corpÃ£o in day. 

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:08.463
 Turn up the sound, it's getting heavy. 

00:01:08.643 --> 00:01:20.185
 .............................. 

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:23.645
 California girls are unforgettable. 

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:27.231
 Short shorts and tucked bikini, 

00:01:27.763 --> 00:01:29.773
 Tanned skin, so hot ... 

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:31.521
 will melt your popsicle. 

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:39.319
 California girls are unforgettable. 

00:01:39.503 --> 00:01:42.527
 Beautiful, young, brave, we master 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.973
 The west coast represents, throw your hands up ... 

00:02:14.357 --> 00:02:17.244
 -Emblem3. -OVER THERE 

00:02:18.178 --> 00:02:19.898
 Do you want to know? 

00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:24.408
 I'm trying to find ... I want to be critical, really. 

00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:32.171
 For if I do not go, I do not know if anyone else will be. Because you were perfect, and I do not like that. 

00:02:32.603 --> 00:02:33.488
 Thank you. 

00:02:33.638 --> 00:02:38.608
 What you said was incredible, it felt so good. Oh my God. 

00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:43.612
 I do not know what to say. I want to say something, but I can not think of anything. 

00:02:44.508 --> 00:02:46.962
 You know how it is, I hate perfection. Go there. 

00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:54.624
 I was surprised by the way the music was made to be yours. 

00:02:54.928 --> 00:02:57.964
 It seemed to be yours. It was very, very good. 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:00.004
 You were confident ... "" What music? " 

00:03:00.178 --> 00:03:01.674
 They sang about eight. 

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.224
 -It looked great. "Thank you, Britney. 

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:08.215
 -Demi. -Demi. 

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:12.999
 "I thought you two were great. If ... 

00:03:15.577 --> 00:03:21.347
 If I were your mentor, I would not let you copy one of my other artists, 

00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:24.263
 -who would be compared to you. What? 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.704
 I felt that you copied another artifact, another group, that would be easily compared to them. 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.679
 -With who? -The music of One Direction. 

00:03:32.714 --> 00:03:35.611
 It was an anthem from One Direction. 

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.239
 - I came up with a wrong tactic. -That's called "tribute." 

00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:39.513
 I think you made a mistake. 

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:42.037
 "They deserve more than that. "That's smart. 

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:48.572
 Guys, what I like about you is that every time you sing a song, 

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:55.258
 is lively, fun, and is all that a group like yours needs to be. 

00:03:55.496 --> 00:04:00.748
 And you do not know, but we've changed the music. They only had one day to rehearse. 

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:02.399
 -Yes one day! We took the music yesterday. -Without complaining. 

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:06.895
 They just moved on. And I think, just like last week, 

00:04:07.072 --> 00:04:10.171
 You guys did a great job. Congratulations. 

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:12.270
 -You could already tour! -I love you guys! 

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:15.733
 I think America loves you, and you could tour it right now.
