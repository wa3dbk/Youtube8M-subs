a decade ago we are talking about ten

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
years of technology which it looks like

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.690 
years of technology which it looks like
well<00:03:09.100> under<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:11.410> most<00:03:11.560> important<00:03:12.190> control<00:03:12.519> of

well under the most important control of

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.490 
well under the most important control of
all<00:03:12.820> is<00:03:13.060> still<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.480> throttle<00:03:13.840> though<00:03:13.959> and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
all is still the throttle though and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.250 
all is still the throttle though and
naturally<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.550> isn't<00:03:15.850> straightforward<00:03:16.260> if

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
naturally it isn't straightforward if

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.960 
naturally it isn't straightforward if
you<00:03:17.320> look<00:03:17.440> down<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.800> pedals<00:03:18.190> Schumaker

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
you look down of the pedals Schumaker

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.180 
you look down of the pedals Schumaker
runs<00:03:19.269> what<00:03:19.750> they've<00:03:19.870> got<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.019> long<00:03:20.350> accelerator

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
pedal reason why he does that is he can

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.960 
pedal reason why he does that is he can

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
balance the car better so the power

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.060 
balance the car better so the power
comes<00:03:25.300> in<00:03:25.450> gradually<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.380> on<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> long<00:03:26.860> block

because<00:03:46.480> I<00:03:46.630> think<00:03:46.690> that's<00:03:47.049> going<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.560> sweep<00:03:47.769> my
