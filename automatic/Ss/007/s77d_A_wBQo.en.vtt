based<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.530> the<00:00:28.620> vacuum<00:00:28.980> mount<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.520> what<00:00:30.000> we

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
based on the vacuum mount so what we

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.119 
based on the vacuum mount so what we
have<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.450> vacuum<00:00:30.990> mounts<00:00:31.350> is<00:00:31.530> an<00:00:31.740> incredibly

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
have the vacuum mounts is an incredibly

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.549 
have the vacuum mounts is an incredibly
strong<00:00:32.340> pump-action<00:00:33.120> vacuum<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.260> mean<00:00:34.440> by

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
strong pump-action vacuum what I mean by

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.619 
strong pump-action vacuum what I mean by
pump-action<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.430> when<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> want<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> attach

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
pump-action is when you want to attach

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.209 
pump-action is when you want to attach
it<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:36.989> use<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> built-in<00:00:37.680> finger<00:00:38.010> pump

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it you can use that built-in finger pump

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.310 
it you can use that built-in finger pump
to<00:00:38.399> remove<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.850> air<00:00:39.030> from<00:00:39.179> behind<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> cup<00:00:39.780> so

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to remove the air from behind the cup so

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.779 
to remove the air from behind the cup so
as<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.559> walked<00:00:40.769> that<00:00:40.859> pump<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.280> taking<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> air

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
as I walked that pump I'm taking the air

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.430 
as I walked that pump I'm taking the air
out<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:41.969> that's<00:00:42.179> locking<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.780> into<00:00:42.899> place<00:00:43.140> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
out and that's locking it into place so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.200 
out and that's locking it into place so
that<00:00:43.859> means<00:00:44.010> you've<00:00:44.159> played<00:00:44.370> putting<00:00:44.999> a<00:00:45.059> bike

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that means you've played putting a bike

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.520 
that means you've played putting a bike

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
210-pound rated vacuum mountain which

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
210-pound rated vacuum mountain which
means<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.199> incredibly<00:00:52.649> strong<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.219> when

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
means it's incredibly strong and when

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.919

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
you put multiple vacuum enough together

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.110 
you put multiple vacuum enough together

this is in vacuum and really what
happens<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.330> this<00:01:33.600> vacuum<00:01:33.780> pump<00:01:34.230> you<00:01:34.410> saw<00:01:34.560> me

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
happens is this vacuum pump you saw me

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.230 
happens is this vacuum pump you saw me
pump<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.040> down<00:01:35.160> earlier<00:01:35.490> when<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.150> loses

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
pump it down earlier when it loses

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
pump it down earlier when it loses
vacuum<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.990> pump<00:01:37.260> is<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.620> reverse

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
vacuum this pump is going to reverse

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.130 
vacuum this pump is going to reverse
itself<00:01:38.280> very<00:01:38.580> slowly<00:01:38.910> and<00:01:39.480> there's<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.810> colored

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
itself very slowly and there's a colored

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
itself very slowly and there's a colored
band<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.560> there<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.190> you<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.820> color

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
band in there and you see that color

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
band in there and you see that color
that<00:01:42.330> means<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.900> time<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.140> give<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.250> couple

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that means it's time to give it a couple

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.740 
that means it's time to give it a couple
of<00:01:44.550> pumps<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.910> don't<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.330> take<00:01:45.480> it<00:01:45.540> off
