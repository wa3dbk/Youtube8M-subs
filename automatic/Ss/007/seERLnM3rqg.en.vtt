00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
sized it there is a very expensive

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.740 
sized it there is a very expensive
rooftop<00:02:01.280> network<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.970> series<00:02:02.210> of<00:02:02.270> towers

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
rooftop network in a series of towers

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.870 
rooftop network in a series of towers
and<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.470> can<00:02:03.619> have<00:02:03.740> very<00:02:04.039> involved<00:02:04.610> sniper

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
and you can have very involved sniper

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.600 
and you can have very involved sniper
gameplay<00:02:05.240> in<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.320> top<00:02:06.710> layer<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.340> map

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
gameplay in that top layer of the map

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.639 
gameplay in that top layer of the map
but<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.360> narrow<00:02:08.630> alleyways<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.170> streets<00:02:09.560> are

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
but the narrow alleyways and streets are

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.530 
but the narrow alleyways and streets are
actually<00:02:10.009> fairly<00:02:10.340> well<00:02:10.670> covered<00:02:11.060> from<00:02:11.330> that

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
actually fairly well covered from that

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.750 
actually fairly well covered from that
so<00:02:11.990> usually<00:02:12.290> there's<00:02:12.650> two<00:02:12.950> distinct<00:02:13.430> battles

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
so usually there's two distinct battles

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.120 
so usually there's two distinct battles
raging<00:02:13.970> on
