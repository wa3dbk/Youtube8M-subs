product from high saver this is an

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.900 
product from high saver this is an
energy-saving<00:00:06.540> surge<00:00:07.170> protector<00:00:07.859> every<00:00:08.730> year

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
energy-saving surge protector every year

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.690 
energy-saving surge protector every year
ten<00:00:09.240> billion<00:00:09.599> dollars<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.200> wasted<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.190> standby

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
ten billion dollars is wasted on standby

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.150 
ten billion dollars is wasted on standby
power<00:00:12.030> which<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.660> basically<00:00:13.110> any<00:00:13.440> electronic

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
power which is basically any electronic

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.310 
power which is basically any electronic
device<00:00:14.429> that's<00:00:14.700> plugged<00:00:14.969> into<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.330> wall<00:00:15.420> turn

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
device that's plugged into a wall turn

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.750 
device that's plugged into a wall turn
to<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> off<00:00:16.710> position<00:00:16.740> but<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.580> still

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
to the off position but it's still

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.660 
to the off position but it's still
wasting<00:00:18.180> energy<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:19.740> eliminates<00:00:20.460> that

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
wasting energy this eliminates that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.109 
wasting energy this eliminates that
wastage<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.480> standby<00:00:21.840> power<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> how<00:00:23.910> this

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
wastage of standby power so how this

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.179 
wastage of standby power so how this
works<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.039> our

while<00:01:36.900> you're<00:01:37.140> gone<00:01:37.670> most<00:01:38.670> units<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.240> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
while you're gone most units like this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.050 
while you're gone most units like this
use<00:01:39.900> about<00:01:40.170> 200<00:01:40.710> watts<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.070> energy<00:01:41.250> while<00:01:41.759> this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
use about 200 watts of energy while this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.859 
use about 200 watts of energy while this
one<00:01:42.240> uses<00:01:42.570> only<00:01:43.020> 80<00:01:43.439> watts<00:01:43.829> which<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:45.090> 60

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
one uses only 80 watts which is a 60

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
one uses only 80 watts which is a 60
percent<00:01:46.049> energy<00:01:46.770> saving<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.820> pretty

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
percent energy saving that's a pretty

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.359 
percent energy saving that's a pretty
big<00:01:48.329> deal<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.920> financially<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.100> very

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
big deal and financially it's very

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.120 
big deal and financially it's very
viable<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:51.420> unit<00:01:51.899> pays<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.439> itself<00:01:52.680> within
