00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.880
 so here is a guitar effect pedal 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.799
 in the series does a little disjointed for sale 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.230
 it allows to treat an option we can add elected officials already a small 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.119
 ground 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.230
 don wildman pedals like his grenade from all sides 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.249
 the distortion pedals 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.649
 delhaize 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.939
 so must we present configuration for you can use only one 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.039
 pedal 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.740
 we will attack 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.710
 our 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.880
 according to fact no recipe actually there a drop 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.930
 with this djak package here 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.470
 so we'll go back 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.650
 the head of state here 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.570
 recently near the effect 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.030
 and then we'll go out signal 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.180
 talking about knife 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.670
 by this lake ambages 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.810
 we already learn that compensated another guitar amp 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.500
 here is a montage 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.730
 very simple with a wound 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.840
 a pedal 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.560
 three dimensions uses since the pedal 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.910
 we will do what we call a month 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.650
 a series connection 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.700
 by the way we will return 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.730
 in the first to do it 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.730
 the guitar signal on the book costs 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.150
 we get same jack type 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.360
 we get the south exit the first business pole 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 I'm going to be in a garbage can of the second try 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.550
 and after 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.550
 of the second is that of the output of the second set 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.320
 we will attack with the aja against a guitar which place of this fact 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.370
 available 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.440
 to the point that nesta these 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.890
 for this brand the romantic the margin rate it's just a simple man 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.390
 simple metal switch for example 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.490
 and others 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.790
 in general there is always a little seer who told us that if necessary 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
 in service at the port goes out here 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.000
 then a pedal a need for power 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.429
 and so in general gala of 4 6 me 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:16.759
 so either we do not use 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.889
 pilots 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.719
 so for this brand has seduced 9 volts 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.249
 so 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.249
 think of the afp he had counted so far 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.929
 the switch is not aware therrien shot surrender 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:32.969
 we find 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.969
 what to plug pilate 9 volts 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.589
 so we have a brain we are in its camp and we close 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.389
 that's the first possibility 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:49.959
 there is a second possibility is not to exhaust the use of pilots 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.829
 the first son rather than in France why 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.999
 this is your new time 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:02:59.229
 with them 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.439
 each transfer too many faults capable of the 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.509
 data m 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:05.159
 more or less 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.089
 in 2 milliamperes 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.259
 in the sentence for 200 million perriot that a problem to feed 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:11.979
 this kind of pedal 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.309
 you have to be careful 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:18.939
 if we do not use a big jump to feed full of step pedal 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.409
 exceed the capacity of the 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.049
 of the transformer 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.389
 tremblay loses 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.879
 and yet yet this brand reminded you need nine volts 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.459
 orange everywhere the output of the transformer 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.979
 and then what you need to know 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.999
 these used the 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:46.049
 she transposes since her arrival with the blues 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.239
 the effects of really paying attention to the polarity 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:51.699
 according to brands 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.699
 the more he will meet at night 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.899
 so sometimes it may be necessary to reverse the polarity for them 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.279
 to avoid a short circuit the ps3 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.279
 according to her to damage it 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.479
 work also precautions to take 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:17.750
 when your used 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.449
 pedal with her 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.789
 with a battery 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.939
 if you do not feel for a moment of the pedal it is advisable to 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:26.539
 unplug 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.740
 the deacon 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.710
 at the entrance 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.479
 to save the crisis that if we let plugged the pill all 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.509
 they are gradually being dumped in for the economist in what way 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.020
 when it is necessary to know also that it is when the effect is not engaged 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.939
 so that the aircraft manufacturer is not bound 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.889
 disabled to go down the passage 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.710
 that is, the signal on entering 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.710
 exactly the same at the entrance as at the exit 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.449
 then according to the pedal lamal 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:07.490
 ireland good passes different 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.530
 we were going to say a real ballet by the website say that really physically 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.610
 the signal 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.759
 by making the pedal directly moved the two jabbering are connected 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.800
 we say it's a real past 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.970
 the course in a lot of pedal 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.589
 likewise in 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.509
 for the rest of the pedal 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.069
 often involved 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.069
 the apparent signal that exceeds a little bit of electronics 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.919
 to come out 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.919
 so report it to 1 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.050
 a little different 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.900
 compared to a work happening 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.289
 he was not reporting exactly the same 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.289
 that's the debate 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:50.169
 then there will be a multitude of help 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.620
 for guitar 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.659
 as to the criminal complaint 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.979
 in the doctorate distortion pedals at the very venerable chorus school 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.409
 the costs or sword ladies want 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.739
 the volume pedals of 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:09.059
 because it is very important once we have the gift that like all our 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.879
 effects 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.669
 unleashed properly 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.669
 that is, we are talking about habitat 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.869
 and in attack at first fr being indexed a good a serial branch 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:20.770
 in the corner the cut of the tarn to any attack the first 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.400
 then the 2nd 3rd 4th 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.889
 see what is said 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.819
 in the order of 1% sell it effects 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:32.199
 the center totally different 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.919
 sarah pressing stories from 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.659
 of choice 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.659
 for example a volume pedal we can admit it first 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.860
 nicolas batum a little operation if everything is possible everything is workable 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.539
 to pass the oral who will decide 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:48.669
 so 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:51.930
 but there are things that may be perfect for example if we come a 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.599
 time limit 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:56.669
 first and then a distortion 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:59.749
 the result will be completely different 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:01.300
 versoix 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.300
 in general I put my distortion and the delay 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:08.379
 good after that you have to try to listen 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.460
 but still things to perfect 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:21.009
 then in the second video of this article you have to go to 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:23.199
 point my guitar pedals 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:24.800
 everyone 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.800
 pedagogue 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:34.099
 so you have to have a way of plugging him up 

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:37.629
 the small penal that I bought 

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:41.520
 and I also introduce you to 1% a device that is nice enough 

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:45.969
 who in the end became the nerve center of 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:49.729
 criminal data 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:53.500
 it's called the gps and two young men
