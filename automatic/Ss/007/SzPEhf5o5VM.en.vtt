when I was a little kid my dad built a

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.249 
when I was a little kid my dad built a
crystal<00:00:02.700> set<00:00:02.879> for<00:00:03.330> me<00:00:03.480> that<00:00:03.959> got<00:00:04.140> me

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
crystal set for me that got me

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.019 
crystal set for me that got me
interested<00:00:04.410> in<00:00:04.710> electronics<00:00:05.220> as<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.370> hobby<00:00:05.759> if

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
interested in electronics as a hobby if

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
technology around the portal yes

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.490 
technology around the portal yes
and<00:00:43.449> don't<00:00:43.809> let<00:00:43.870> printing<00:00:44.140> everything's<00:00:44.379> as

and don't let printing everything's as

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.950 
and don't let printing everything's as
well<00:00:44.649> so<00:00:44.980> in<00:00:45.640> Skylanders<00:00:46.239> Giants<00:00:46.269> I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
well so in Skylanders Giants I

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.450 
well so in Skylanders Giants I
understand<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.620> portals<00:00:47.920> are<00:00:47.980> wired

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
understand the portals are wired

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.149 
understand the portals are wired
yes<00:00:49.269> how's<00:00:50.079> that<00:00:50.320> change<00:00:50.649> come<00:00:50.890> about

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
yes how's that change come about

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.020 
yes how's that change come about
apparently<00:00:52.059> be<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.540> pelion<00:00:52.899> response<00:00:53.229> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
apparently be a pelion response to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.270 
apparently be a pelion response to
consumers<00:00:55.649> running<00:00:56.649> out<00:00:56.739> of<00:00:56.769> batteries<00:00:57.250> and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
consumers running out of batteries and

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.950 
consumers running out of batteries and
changing<00:00:58.089> batteries<00:00:58.269> and<00:00:58.600> things<00:00:58.719> like<00:00:58.870> that

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
changing batteries and things like that

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.310 
changing batteries and things like that
but<00:00:59.530> it<00:01:00.100> so<00:01:01.089> we<00:01:01.210> we<00:01:01.570> removed<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.199> battery

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
but it so we we removed the battery

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.469 
but it so we we removed the battery
compartment<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.159> added<00:01:03.640> you<00:01:03.940> know<00:01:03.969> added<00:01:04.390> the

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
compartment and added you know added the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.620 
compartment and added you know added the
USB<00:01:04.899> cable<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.950> wire<00:01:06.160> the<00:01:06.340> poles<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:07.479> this

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
USB cable to wire the poles and this

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.029 
USB cable to wire the poles and this
gave<00:01:07.840> us<00:01:07.869> a<00:01:08.110> couple<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.560> couple<00:01:08.890> of<00:01:08.950> things

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
gave us a couple of a couple of things

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.100 
gave us a couple of a couple of things
we<00:01:09.250> could<00:01:09.399> do<00:01:09.550> one<00:01:10.179> of<00:01:10.270> them<00:01:10.360> is<00:01:10.479> that<00:01:10.690> we<00:01:10.869> could

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
we could do one of them is that we could

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.230 
we could do one of them is that we could
run<00:01:11.380> with<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.710> portal<00:01:12.070> continuously<00:01:12.670> on<00:01:12.940> and

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
run with the portal continuously on and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.779 
run with the portal continuously on and
we<00:01:13.660> could<00:01:13.810> use<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.289> LED<00:01:14.770> illumination<00:01:15.460> and

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
we could use the LED illumination and

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.370 
we could use the LED illumination and
make<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.030> brighter<00:01:16.330> which<00:01:16.990> was<00:01:17.140> something

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
make it brighter which was something

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.749 
make it brighter which was something
we'd<00:01:17.560> wanted<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.950> do<00:01:18.070> on<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.250> first<00:01:18.460> one<00:01:18.610> but

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
we'd wanted to do on the first one but

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.820 
we'd wanted to do on the first one but
had<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.090> scale<00:01:19.479> back<00:01:19.509> because<00:01:20.289> otherwise<00:01:20.530> it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
had to scale back because otherwise it

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.880 
had to scale back because otherwise it
flattened<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.610> batteries<00:01:21.970> too<00:01:22.179> fast<00:01:22.479> and<00:01:22.890> if

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
flattened the batteries too fast and if

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.749 
flattened the batteries too fast and if
having<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:25.710> wired<00:01:26.710> allows<00:01:27.159> us<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:27.520> have

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
having the the wired allows us to have

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.600 
having the the wired allows us to have
the<00:01:28.179> magic<00:01:28.869> field<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.350> RF<00:01:29.710> field<00:01:29.950> on<00:01:30.220> all<00:01:30.460> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
the magic field the RF field on all the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.880 
the magic field the RF field on all the
time<00:01:30.850> so<00:01:31.119> that<00:01:31.569> we<00:01:31.690> can<00:01:31.840> have<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.440> characters

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
time so that we can have the characters

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.919 
time so that we can have the characters
that<00:01:33.039> a<00:01:33.100> light<00:01:33.310> core<00:01:33.640> glow<00:01:34.030> even<00:01:34.450> when<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
that a light core glow even when the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.839 
that a light core glow even when the
game<00:01:35.110> isn't<00:01:35.470> running<00:01:35.800> other<00:01:36.130> Giants<00:01:36.670> will

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:36.849 
game isn't running other Giants will

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:38.969 
game isn't running other Giants will
still<00:01:37.060> glow<00:01:37.330> on<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.500> portal<00:01:38.860> when

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
still glow on the on the portal when

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.529 
still glow on the on the portal when
it's<00:01:39.099> not<00:01:39.250> running<00:01:39.459> yeah<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.000> was<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.300> gave<00:01:40.420> us

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
it's not running yeah it was it gave us

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.050 
it's not running yeah it was it gave us
a<00:01:40.599> couple<00:01:40.750> of<00:01:40.899> win-win<00:01:41.470> win-win<00:01:42.060> situations

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
a couple of win-win win-win situations

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.020 
a couple of win-win win-win situations
and<00:01:43.360> so<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:44.200> Wii<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.830> ps3<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:45.340> 360<00:01:45.459> would<00:01:45.910> all

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
and so the Wii the ps3 and 360 would all

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.229 
and so the Wii the ps3 and 360 would all
be<00:01:46.179> wired<00:01:46.420> yes<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.399> previous<00:01:48.580> version

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.239 
be wired yes but the previous version

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:50.910 
be wired yes but the previous version
that<00:01:49.390> still<00:01:49.599> is<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:50.020> battery<00:01:50.349> steps<00:01:50.560> radius

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
that still is that battery steps radius

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.710 
that still is that battery steps radius
is<00:01:51.190> still<00:01:51.489> battery<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.209> the<00:01:52.300> three<00:01:52.479> year<00:01:52.599> so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
is still battery and the three year so

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.419 
is still battery and the three year so
she<00:01:52.780> does<00:01:53.050> have<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.259> USB<00:01:53.560> connector<00:01:54.009> on<00:01:54.129> it<00:01:54.310> so

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
she does have a USB connector on it so

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.790 
she does have a USB connector on it so
it<00:01:54.550> can<00:01:54.789> be<00:01:54.940> wired<00:01:55.209> but<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.289> I<00:01:56.319> don't<00:01:56.590> believe

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
it can be wired but the I don't believe

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.710 
it can be wired but the I don't believe
there<00:01:56.920> was<00:01:56.979> any<00:01:57.160> change<00:01:57.399> to<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.729> 3ds<00:01:58.149> portal

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
there was any change to the 3ds portal

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.219 
there was any change to the 3ds portal
it<00:01:58.929> was<00:01:59.379> the<00:01:59.530> same<00:02:00.569> it<00:02:01.569> was<00:02:01.750> really<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.200> the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
it was the same it was really the the

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.350 
it was the same it was really the the
core<00:02:03.360> console<00:02:05.250> portals<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.429> changed<00:02:06.910> yeah

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
core console portals that changed yeah

college computers with a big thing and I

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.210 
college computers with a big thing and I
switched<00:03:54.210> to<00:03:54.390> computers<00:03:54.900> fully<00:03:55.140> yeah<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:55.890> it

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
switched to computers fully yeah but it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.250 
switched to computers fully yeah but it
was<00:03:56.700> more<00:03:57.150> about<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:59.820> was<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.840> electronics

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
was more about it was so electronics

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.320 
was more about it was so electronics
became<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.530> was<00:04:01.800> a<00:04:01.830> hobby<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.340> over<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.180> years

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
became I was a hobby and over the years

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.350 
became I was a hobby and over the years
I<00:04:03.510> occasionally<00:04:04.700> accumulated<00:04:05.700> electronic

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
I occasionally accumulated electronic

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.940 
I occasionally accumulated electronic
pieces<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.780> my<00:04:06.870> basement<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.530> played<00:04:07.740> around

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
pieces in my basement and played around

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.010 
pieces in my basement and played around
with<00:04:08.100> them<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.340> little<00:04:08.430> bit<00:04:08.700> but<00:04:09.270> I'd<00:04:09.750> might

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
with them a little bit but I'd might

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.380 
with them a little bit but I'd might
focus<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.440> course<00:04:10.560> on<00:04:10.890> programming<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.090> video

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
focus of course on programming and video

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.690

game<00:04:12.630> development<00:04:13.110> when<00:04:13.890> Skylanders<00:04:14.490> came

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
game development when Skylanders came

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.570 
game development when Skylanders came
around<00:04:14.960> we<00:04:15.960> we<00:04:16.290> had<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:16.500> sort<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:17.100> challenge

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
around we we had this sort of challenge

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.479 
around we we had this sort of challenge
which<00:04:18.090> was<00:04:18.299> how<00:04:18.690> do<00:04:18.750> we<00:04:18.960> make<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.350> toy<00:04:19.620> come<00:04:20.370> to

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
which was how do we make the toy come to

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.520 
which was how do we make the toy come to
life<00:04:20.640> in<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:20.940> game

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
life in the game

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.670 
life in the game
and<00:04:21.820> there<00:04:22.820> were<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.030> number<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:23.600> people<00:04:24.380> doing

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
and there were a number of people doing

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.780 
and there were a number of people doing
some<00:04:24.920> real<00:04:25.040> interesting<00:04:25.220> things<00:04:25.580> with

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
some real interesting things with

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.240 
some real interesting things with
wiimotes<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.690> connecting<00:04:27.620> wiimotes<00:04:28.010> to

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
wiimotes and connecting wiimotes to

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.700 
wiimotes and connecting wiimotes to
microcontrollers<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.720> we<00:04:30.230> use<00:04:30.440> these

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
microcontrollers and and we use these

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.790 
microcontrollers and and we use these
little<00:04:30.950> Arduino<00:04:31.930> devices<00:04:32.930> yes<00:04:33.170> is<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.380> an

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
little Arduino devices yes is a an

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.460 
little Arduino devices yes is a an
open-source<00:04:34.400> platform<00:04:35.210> that's<00:04:35.900> made<00:04:36.290> in

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
open-source platform that's made in

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.800 
open-source platform that's made in
Italy<00:04:37.000> yeah<00:04:38.290> that<00:04:39.290> are<00:04:39.410> extremely<00:04:40.100> popular

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
Italy yeah that are extremely popular

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.960 
Italy yeah that are extremely popular
little<00:04:41.810> bit<00:04:41.900> similar<00:04:42.140> to<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.350> world<00:04:42.500> sweep<00:04:42.710> I

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
little bit similar to the world sweep I

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.940 
little bit similar to the world sweep I
know<00:04:43.970> this<00:04:44.420> is<00:04:44.540> an<00:04:44.690> earlier<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.200> earlier<00:04:45.470> than

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
know this is an earlier to earlier than

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.590 
know this is an earlier to earlier than
my<00:04:46.040> Raspberry<00:04:46.430> Pi<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.610> much<00:04:46.910> more<00:04:47.060> recently

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
my Raspberry Pi is much more recently

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.300 
my Raspberry Pi is much more recently
we're<00:04:48.170> looking<00:04:48.440> at<00:04:48.560> that<00:04:48.680> too<00:04:48.860> but<00:04:49.100> for

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
we're looking at that too but for

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.930 
we're looking at that too but for
something<00:04:49.490> else

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
something else

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.410 
something else
yeah<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:51.820> Arduino<00:04:52.820> we<00:04:53.060> built<00:04:53.270> an

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
yeah the the the Arduino we built an

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.560 
yeah the the the Arduino we built an
Arduino<00:04:53.960> controller<00:04:54.410> with<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.250> with<00:04:56.030> an<00:04:56.150> RFID

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
Arduino controller with a with an RFID

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.530 
Arduino controller with a with an RFID
of<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:56.930> face<00:04:57.140> and<00:04:57.610> had<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.760> toys<00:04:59.030> coming<00:04:59.360> into

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
of a face and had the toys coming into

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.510 
of a face and had the toys coming into
the<00:04:59.690> game<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.320> said<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.710> know<00:05:00.800> they<00:05:01.370> said

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
the game and I I said you know they said

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.590 
the game and I I said you know they said
well<00:05:01.640> how<00:05:01.730> we<00:05:01.790> gonna<00:05:01.910> do<00:05:02.150> this<00:05:02.270> and<00:05:02.390> I<00:05:02.450> said

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
well how we gonna do this and I said

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.110 
well how we gonna do this and I said
well<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:02.780> can<00:05:02.990> do<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.650> wired<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.550> up<00:05:04.669> on<00:05:04.910> my

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
well I can do that and wired it up on my

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.110 
well I can do that and wired it up on my
Heathkit<00:05:05.960> training<00:05:06.650> board<00:05:06.890> and<00:05:07.250> yes<00:05:07.790> I'm<00:05:08.000> live

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
Heathkit training board and yes I'm live

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.580 
Heathkit training board and yes I'm live
in<00:05:08.210> my<00:05:08.330> basement<00:05:08.510> at<00:05:08.870> home<00:05:09.050> and<00:05:09.290> then<00:05:09.380> brought

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
in my basement at home and then brought

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.440 
in my basement at home and then brought
it<00:05:09.740> all<00:05:09.800> into<00:05:09.860> work<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.490> gradually<00:05:11.330> have

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
it all into work and gradually have

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.330 
it all into work and gradually have
become<00:05:11.750> more<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.020> more<00:05:12.169> Hardware<00:05:12.830> oriented

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
become more and more Hardware oriented

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.950 
become more and more Hardware oriented
and<00:05:13.520> electronics<00:05:14.000> oriented<00:05:14.450> and<00:05:14.630> less<00:05:14.750> and

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
and electronics oriented and less and

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.050 
and electronics oriented and less and
less<00:05:15.080> on<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.800> programming<00:05:16.310> side<00:05:16.490> I<00:05:16.820> still<00:05:17.030> a

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
less on the programming side I still a

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.220 
less on the programming side I still a
little<00:05:17.090> bit<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.390> keep<00:05:17.510> my<00:05:17.660> hand<00:05:17.840> down<00:05:17.990> because

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
little bit to keep my hand down because

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.390 
little bit to keep my hand down because
you've<00:05:18.350> got<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.590> keep<00:05:18.620> you<00:05:18.830> got<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.160> keep<00:05:19.250> your

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
you've got to keep you got to keep your

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.510 
you've got to keep you got to keep your
skills<00:05:19.610> up<00:05:19.820> yeah<00:05:20.360> um<00:05:20.660> but<00:05:21.070> you<00:05:22.070> know<00:05:22.130> I<00:05:22.220> would

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
skills up yeah um but you know I would

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.010 
skills up yeah um but you know I would
say<00:05:22.669> I<00:05:22.880> would<00:05:22.940> created<00:05:23.270> a<00:05:23.330> big<00:05:23.510> part<00:05:23.750> of<00:05:23.840> this

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
say I would created a big part of this

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.650 
say I would created a big part of this
to<00:05:24.380> having<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.370> as<00:05:25.490> a<00:05:25.520> hobby<00:05:25.729> as<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.000> kid<00:05:26.270> and<00:05:26.570> a

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
to having it as a hobby as a kid and a

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.719 
to having it as a hobby as a kid and a
large<00:05:26.870> part<00:05:27.110> of<00:05:27.169> that<00:05:27.229> I've<00:05:27.440> got<00:05:27.590> to<00:05:27.680> say<00:05:27.800> to<00:05:27.860> my

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
large part of that I've got to say to my

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.400 
large part of that I've got to say to my
parents<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.270> staff<00:05:29.419> who<00:05:29.570> would<00:05:29.690> encourage<00:05:30.110> me

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
parents and staff who would encourage me

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.180 
parents and staff who would encourage me
to<00:05:30.440> pull<00:05:31.160> things<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.610> bits<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:32.180> to<00:05:33.160> enjoy<00:05:34.160> the

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
to pull things to bits and to enjoy the

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.040 
to pull things to bits and to enjoy the
process<00:05:34.729> of<00:05:34.910> understanding<00:05:35.120> how<00:05:35.660> something

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
process of understanding how something

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.580 
process of understanding how something
worked

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
worked

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
you could take some of these Skylanders

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.350 
you could take some of these Skylanders
like<00:05:51.140> core<00:05:51.410> figures<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:52.130> you<00:05:52.700> can<00:05:52.850> work<00:05:53.150> out

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
like core figures and you can work out

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.270 
like core figures and you can work out
where<00:05:53.630> RFID<00:05:54.260> phones<00:05:54.530> I<00:05:54.680> hunt<00:05:54.890> you<00:05:54.950> just<00:05:55.160> by

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
where RFID phones I hunt you just by

where RFID phones I hunt you just by
checking<00:05:55.729> them<00:05:55.940> anywhere<00:05:56.180> cuz<00:05:56.479> these<00:05:56.630> things

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
checking them anywhere cuz these things

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.659 
checking them anywhere cuz these things
I<00:05:57.020> think<00:05:57.290> if<00:05:57.590> and<00:05:57.860> when<00:05:58.160> I<00:05:58.220> get<00:05:58.370> one<00:05:58.520> we're
