00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
feel like on the whole the result was it

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.420 
feel like on the whole the result was it
was<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.510> good<00:00:26.720> one<00:00:26.840> for<00:00:27.080> you<00:00:27.230> was<00:00:27.380> strong<00:00:27.440> yeah<00:00:28.400> I

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
was a good one for you was strong yeah I

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.300 
was a good one for you was strong yeah I
mean<00:00:28.820> I<00:00:29.210> okay<00:00:30.020> when<00:00:30.560> I<00:00:30.619> say<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.830> played<00:00:31.070> well<00:00:31.250> in

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
mean I okay when I say I played well in

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.470 
mean I okay when I say I played well in
the<00:00:31.369> middle<00:00:31.580> I<00:00:31.640> don't<00:00:31.699> think<00:00:32.029> I<00:00:32.090> made<00:00:32.239> many

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
the middle I don't think I made many

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.450 
the middle I don't think I made many
mistakes<00:00:32.599> especially<00:00:33.079> if<00:00:33.710> in<00:00:33.860> round<00:00:34.100> 2

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
mistakes especially if in round 2

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.850 
mistakes especially if in round 2
through<00:00:34.700> 8<00:00:34.760> but<00:00:35.300> that<00:00:35.960> being<00:00:36.200> said<00:00:36.290> I<00:00:36.530> didn't

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
through 8 but that being said I didn't

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.430 
through 8 but that being said I didn't
exactly<00:00:37.120> generate<00:00:38.120> many<00:00:38.360> winning<00:00:38.690> chances<00:00:38.899> so

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
exactly generate many winning chances so

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.040 
exactly generate many winning chances so
I<00:00:39.470> think<00:00:39.560> in<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:39.920> end<00:00:40.040> considering<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:41.870> was<00:00:41.930> a

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
I think in the end considering it was a

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.389 
I think in the end considering it was a
bit<00:00:42.200> of<00:00:42.290> luck<00:00:42.500> that<00:00:42.530> I<00:00:42.710> had<00:00:42.890> in<00:00:43.010> winning<00:00:43.280> a

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
bit of luck that I had in winning a

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.830 
bit of luck that I had in winning a
winning<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.030> games<00:00:44.210> against<00:00:44.540> Eve<00:00:44.720> on

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
winning the games against Eve on

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.680 
winning the games against Eve on
tricking<00:00:45.170> Cara<00:00:45.380> Juana<00:00:45.670> it's<00:00:46.670> certainly<00:00:47.210> by

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
tricking Cara Juana it's certainly by

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.610 
tricking Cara Juana it's certainly by
any<00:00:47.870> standard<00:00:48.320> a<00:00:48.530> good<00:00:48.920> result<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.340> go<00:00:49.430> +2<00:00:50.170> so<00:00:51.170> I

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
any standard a good result to go +2 so I

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.530 
any standard a good result to go +2 so I
guess<00:00:52.430> what<00:00:52.610> I<00:00:52.640> really<00:00:52.940> fill<00:00:53.120> those<00:00:53.270> in<00:00:53.450> the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
guess what I really fill those in the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.030 
guess what I really fill those in the
last<00:00:53.719> couple<00:00:54.079> of<00:00:54.110> rounds<00:00:54.500> maybe<00:00:54.649> not<00:00:54.890> today

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
last couple of rounds maybe not today

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.889 
last couple of rounds maybe not today
today<00:00:55.520> I<00:00:55.550> felt<00:00:56.329> I<00:00:56.480> played<00:00:56.690> well<00:00:56.870> but

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
today I felt I played well but

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.100 
today I felt I played well but
especially<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.920> games<00:00:58.100> guns<00:00:58.340> Ruslan<00:00:59.110> Boris

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
especially the games guns Ruslan Boris

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.130 
especially the games guns Ruslan Boris
and<00:01:01.120> who<00:01:02.120> was<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.360> other<00:01:02.450> one<00:01:02.629> against<00:01:02.930> I

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
and who was the other one against I

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.279 
and who was the other one against I
can't<00:01:03.530> remember<00:01:04.719> against<00:01:05.719> Rukia<00:01:06.049> actually

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
can't remember against Rukia actually

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:07.899 
can't remember against Rukia actually
the<00:01:06.350> one<00:01:06.469> that<00:01:06.619> I<00:01:06.649> won<00:01:06.889> what<00:01:07.340> am<00:01:07.429> I<00:01:07.490> thinking<00:01:07.520> of

travel further I mean it's very close

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.870 
travel further I mean it's very close

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.449 
it's probably weighing how from China
but<00:01:35.240> in<00:01:35.840> general<00:01:36.349> yeah<00:01:36.679> I<00:01:36.709> mean<00:01:36.979> it's<00:01:37.219> always

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
but in general yeah I mean it's always

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.480 
but in general yeah I mean it's always
across<00:01:38.029> the<00:01:38.240> pond<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:39.619> know<00:01:39.709> from<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.009> US<00:01:40.279> so

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
across the pond you know from the US so

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.550 
across the pond you know from the US so
it's<00:01:40.789> always<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.420> know<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.840> I'm<00:01:41.990> pleasant<00:01:42.499> I

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
it's always you know that I'm pleasant I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.199 
it's always you know that I'm pleasant I
mean<00:01:42.709> for<00:01:42.859> example<00:01:42.889> I'll<00:01:43.669> be<00:01:43.700> going<00:01:43.999> back<00:01:44.179> to

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
mean for example I'll be going back to

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.739 
mean for example I'll be going back to
the<00:01:44.419> US<00:01:44.749> and<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:45.649> then<00:01:46.219> I<00:01:46.249> think<00:01:46.609> to<00:01:46.789> get<00:01:46.969> the

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
the US and and then I think to get the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.269 
the US and and then I think to get the
next<00:01:47.929> time<00:01:48.049> I'm<00:01:48.139> playing<00:01:48.319> is<00:01:48.529> the<00:01:48.709> European

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:49.279 
next time I'm playing is the European

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:51.550 
next time I'm playing is the European
Club<00:01:49.520> Championship<00:01:50.359> which<00:01:50.509> is<00:01:50.630> in<00:01:50.810> Rhodes

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
Club Championship which is in Rhodes

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.039 
Club Championship which is in Rhodes
Greece<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.359> okay<00:01:53.359> I<00:01:53.389> think<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.719> get<00:01:53.899> there

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
Greece and okay I think to get there

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.089 
Greece and okay I think to get there
it's<00:01:54.169> gonna<00:01:54.229> take<00:01:54.439> me<00:01:54.560> something<00:01:54.770> like<00:01:54.919> nine

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099 
it's gonna take me something like nine

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.739 
it's gonna take me something like nine
hours<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:55.549> mean<00:01:55.669> I<00:01:55.729> have<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:55.880> fly<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.090> Athens<00:01:56.630> and

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
hours I mean I have to fly to Athens and

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.559 
hours I mean I have to fly to Athens and
then<00:01:57.049> Athens<00:01:57.529> to<00:01:57.739> Rhodes<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.479> certainly<00:01:59.479> I

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
then Athens to Rhodes so certainly I

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.779 
then Athens to Rhodes so certainly I
travel<00:02:00.079> more<00:02:00.229> than<00:02:00.289> than<00:02:00.770> most<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.130> other<00:02:01.159> top

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
travel more than than most the other top

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.849 
travel more than than most the other top
players<00:02:01.999> for<00:02:02.389> sure<00:02:02.569> it's<00:02:03.139> I<00:02:03.409> mean<00:02:03.560> it's<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.739> bit

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
players for sure it's I mean it's a bit

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.440 
players for sure it's I mean it's a bit
unfortunate<00:02:04.159> but<00:02:04.489> still<00:02:04.729> that's<00:02:04.939> just<00:02:05.239> how<00:02:05.359> it

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
unfortunate but still that's just how it

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.849 
unfortunate but still that's just how it
goes<00:02:05.509> I<00:02:05.779> think<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:06.139> know<00:02:06.229> there's<00:02:06.679> just<00:02:06.829> a

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
goes I think you know there's just a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.380 
goes I think you know there's just a
little<00:02:07.069> bit<00:02:07.189> more<00:02:07.310> culture<00:02:07.789> and<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:07.969> little<00:02:08.240> bit

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
little bit more culture and a little bit

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.590 
little bit more culture and a little bit
more<00:02:09.340> more<00:02:10.340> acceptance<00:02:10.940> or<00:02:11.060> understanding<00:02:11.510> of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
more more acceptance or understanding of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.970 
more more acceptance or understanding of
shots<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:11.930> Europe<00:02:12.200> than<00:02:12.350> there<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.650> seems<00:02:12.860> to

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
shots in Europe than there it seems to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.100 
shots in Europe than there it seems to
be<00:02:13.100> in<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.220> u.s.<00:02:13.460> we<00:02:14.210> spoke<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> few<00:02:14.930> players

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
be in the u.s. we spoke to a few players

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.600 
be in the u.s. we spoke to a few players
who<00:02:15.230> said<00:02:15.500> they'd<00:02:15.650> like<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.920> play<00:02:16.100> in<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> US

but<00:02:16.850> it's<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.240> matter<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.540> there<00:02:17.930> isn't

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
but it's just a matter of there isn't

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.840 
but it's just a matter of there isn't

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
that the culture is a reason for that

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.180

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
just in general there there just isn't

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.940 
just in general there there just isn't
much<00:03:10.400> interest<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.000> that's<00:03:11.240> just<00:03:11.450> how<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.780> is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
much interest but that's just how it is

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.410 
much interest but that's just how it is
but<00:03:12.950> nevertheless<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.670> think<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:14.300> know

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.340 
marching towards talk I mean hopefully
there<00:03:20.270> will<00:03:20.330> so<00:03:20.570> there<00:03:20.900> will<00:03:20.990> be<00:03:21.050> more

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
there will so there will be more

especially now that I am

especially now that I am
st.<00:04:16.729> Louis<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:17.209> since<00:04:17.780> there<00:04:17.989> is<00:04:18.139> a<00:04:18.190> bit<00:04:19.190> of

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
st. Louis and since there is a bit of

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.330 
st. Louis and since there is a bit of
testing<00:04:20.090> going<00:04:20.239> on<00:04:20.509> now<00:04:20.720> as<00:04:21.049> well<00:04:21.289> and<00:04:21.680> do<00:04:22.250> you

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
testing going on now as well and do you

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.400 
testing going on now as well and do you
have<00:04:22.490> any<00:04:22.669> ideas<00:04:23.150> for<00:04:23.180> what<00:04:23.449> we<00:04:23.599> can<00:04:23.900> do<00:04:24.080> in<00:04:24.289> the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
have any ideas for what we can do in the

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.170 
have any ideas for what we can do in the
states<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:24.919> increase<00:04:25.280> interest<00:04:25.610> in<00:04:25.819> chess<00:04:26.000> or

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
states to increase interest in chess or

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.570 
states to increase interest in chess or
to<00:04:26.270> increase<00:04:26.569> the<00:04:26.960> funding<00:04:27.289> opportunities<00:04:27.919> um

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
to increase the funding opportunities um

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.279 
to increase the funding opportunities um
I<00:04:28.940> think<00:04:29.000> in<00:04:29.210> general<00:04:29.569> is<00:04:29.750> just<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:30.199> know

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
I think in general is just you know

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.230 
I think in general is just you know
there<00:04:30.470> has<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.590> be<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.800> certain<00:04:31.220> perspective<00:04:32.030> or

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
there has to be a certain perspective or

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.839 
there has to be a certain perspective or
awareness<00:04:32.720> in<00:04:33.080> terms<00:04:33.259> of<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.919> personalities

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
awareness in terms of the personalities

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.240 
awareness in terms of the personalities
that<00:04:35.150> are<00:04:35.449> in<00:04:35.569> chess<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.800> it's<00:04:36.919> you<00:04:37.130> know

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
that are in chess and that it's you know

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.830 
that are in chess and that it's you know
it<00:04:37.370> is<00:04:37.460> quite<00:04:37.699> cool<00:04:37.910> and<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.330> quite

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
it is quite cool and it is quite

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.659 
it is quite cool and it is quite
difficult<00:04:39.080> as<00:04:39.470> well<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.800> get<00:04:39.919> good<00:04:40.160> I<00:04:40.190> mean<00:04:40.400> I

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
difficult as well to get good I mean I

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.249 
difficult as well to get good I mean I
think<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.090> lot<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.330> people<00:04:41.599> look<00:04:41.720> at<00:04:41.810> trust<00:04:42.080> and

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
think a lot of people look at trust and

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.960 
think a lot of people look at trust and
it's<00:04:42.410> like<00:04:42.560> they<00:04:42.710> say<00:04:42.889> oh<00:04:42.919> cool<00:04:43.370> but<00:04:43.729> you<00:04:43.849> know

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
it's like they say oh cool but you know

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.290 
it's like they say oh cool but you know
obviously<00:04:44.780> you're<00:04:44.990> a<00:04:45.020> nerd<00:04:45.319> and<00:04:45.800> you<00:04:46.699> know<00:04:46.849> on

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
obviously you're a nerd and you know on

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.149 
obviously you're a nerd and you know on
top<00:04:47.780> of<00:04:47.960> that<00:04:48.080> it's<00:04:48.380> it's<00:04:48.650> hard<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:49.009> make<00:04:49.130> a

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
top of that it's it's hard to make a

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.649 
top of that it's it's hard to make a
living<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.580> don't<00:04:49.849> think<00:04:50.090> people<00:04:50.210> realize<00:04:50.539> that

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
living I don't think people realize that

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.540 
living I don't think people realize that
you<00:04:50.990> know<00:04:51.080> if<00:04:51.199> you<00:04:51.319> get<00:04:51.470> to<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.710> top<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:52.220> can

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
you know if you get to the top you can

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.890 
you know if you get to the top you can
you<00:04:52.639> can<00:04:52.789> make<00:04:52.940> quite<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.180> good<00:04:53.270> living<00:04:53.569> but<00:04:53.810> at

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
you can make quite a good living but at

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.240 
you can make quite a good living but at
the<00:04:53.990> same<00:04:54.199> time<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.500> think<00:04:54.770> there<00:04:54.889> also<00:04:55.039> needs

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
the same time I think there also needs

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.920 
the same time I think there also needs
to<00:04:55.370> be<00:04:55.599> support<00:04:56.599> because<00:04:56.870> frankly<00:04:57.470> you<00:04:57.650> know

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
to be support because frankly you know

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.120 
to be support because frankly you know
there<00:04:59.930> are<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.020> lot<00:05:00.080> of<00:05:00.349> strong<00:05:00.680> players<00:05:00.979> in<00:05:01.069> the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
there are a lot of strong players in the

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.550 
there are a lot of strong players in the
US<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:01.550> in<00:05:01.669> their<00:05:02.090> mid<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.720> late<00:05:02.900> teens<00:05:03.139> but

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
US and in their mid to late teens but

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.170 
US and in their mid to late teens but
then<00:05:03.680> you<00:05:03.830> know<00:05:03.949> then<00:05:04.130> college<00:05:04.789> rolls<00:05:05.000> around

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
then you know then college rolls around

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.399 
then you know then college rolls around
then<00:05:05.599> they're<00:05:05.780> more<00:05:06.199> lucrative

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
then they're more lucrative

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.439 
then they're more lucrative
opportunities<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.729> know<00:05:07.849> if<00:05:08.000> you're

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
opportunities and you know if you're

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.270 
opportunities and you know if you're
trying<00:05:09.199> to<00:05:09.289> get<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.560> top<00:05:09.740> you<00:05:09.889> need<00:05:10.009> a<00:05:10.069> lot

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
trying to get to the top you need a lot

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.300 
trying to get to the top you need a lot
of<00:05:10.430> help<00:05:10.610> along<00:05:10.759> the<00:05:10.909> way<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.539> I<00:05:11.810> think<00:05:12.310> really

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
of help along the way and I think really

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.899 
of help along the way and I think really
that<00:05:13.490> that's<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.150> main<00:05:14.389> weight<00:05:15.099> to<00:05:16.099> further

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
that that's the main weight to further

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:17.740 
that that's the main weight to further
grow<00:05:17.150> their<00:05:17.360> trust

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
grow their trust

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.080 
grow their trust
population<00:05:18.500> in<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.620> u.s.<00:05:18.800> people<00:05:19.759> talk<00:05:19.970> about

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
population in the u.s. people talk about

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.209 
population in the u.s. people talk about
the<00:05:20.330> Fisher<00:05:20.690> boom<00:05:20.900> when<00:05:21.440> he<00:05:21.530> won<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.770> the

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
the Fisher boom when he won the the

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:23.830 
the Fisher boom when he won the the
World<00:05:22.400> Championship<00:05:22.909> during<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.360> Cold<00:05:23.570> War

World Championship during the Cold War
do<00:05:24.050> you<00:05:24.139> think<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.650> conditions<00:05:25.219> still<00:05:25.400> exist

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699 
do you think the conditions still exist

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.370 
do you think the conditions still exist
for<00:05:25.849> that<00:05:25.969> kind<00:05:26.150> of<00:05:26.180> excitement<00:05:26.479> if<00:05:26.750> if<00:05:27.080> you

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
for that kind of excitement if if you

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.689 
for that kind of excitement if if you
make<00:05:27.560> it<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:27.800> number<00:05:28.009> one<00:05:28.190> are<00:05:28.310> we<00:05:28.370> gonna<00:05:28.490> see

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
make it to number one are we gonna see

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.550 
make it to number one are we gonna see
the<00:05:28.729> hikaru<00:05:29.240> boom<00:05:29.539> in<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.750> United<00:05:30.080> States<00:05:30.349> I

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
the hikaru boom in the United States I

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.459 
the hikaru boom in the United States I
mean<00:05:31.430> I<00:05:31.880> think<00:05:32.000> I<00:05:32.330> think<00:05:32.360> if<00:05:32.599> I<00:05:32.719> have<00:05:33.199> a<00:05:33.229> chance

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:33.469 
mean I think I think if I have a chance

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:35.529 
mean I think I think if I have a chance
play<00:05:33.770> world<00:05:34.250> champion<00:05:34.699> match<00:05:34.849> with<00:05:35.060> Carlsen

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
play world champion match with Carlsen

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.540 
play world champion match with Carlsen
it's<00:05:35.690> certainly<00:05:35.990> quite<00:05:36.710> possible<00:05:37.280> but<00:05:37.340> I

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
it's certainly quite possible but I

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.399 
it's certainly quite possible but I
think<00:05:37.820> it's<00:05:37.969> also<00:05:38.330> quite<00:05:38.840> different<00:05:39.110> in<00:05:39.380> that

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
think it's also quite different in that

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.339 
think it's also quite different in that
I<00:05:39.919> mean<00:05:40.490> it's<00:05:41.090> it's<00:05:41.449> a<00:05:41.539> whole<00:05:41.719> different<00:05:41.870> angle

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
I mean it's it's a whole different angle

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.050 
I mean it's it's a whole different angle
the<00:05:42.469> reason<00:05:42.949> it<00:05:43.039> was<00:05:43.159> so<00:05:43.280> popular<00:05:43.490> done<00:05:43.909> was

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
the reason it was so popular done was

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.730 
the reason it was so popular done was
because<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.449> Cold<00:05:44.659> War<00:05:44.870> was<00:05:45.020> going<00:05:45.050> on<00:05:45.469> it<00:05:45.650> was

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
because the Cold War was going on it was

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.040 
because the Cold War was going on it was
the<00:05:45.830> u.s.<00:05:46.069> against<00:05:46.460> Russia<00:05:46.669> and<00:05:47.090> it's<00:05:47.840> just<00:05:47.990> a

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
the u.s. against Russia and it's just a

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.659 
the u.s. against Russia and it's just a
different<00:05:48.169> time<00:05:48.560> now<00:05:48.590> but<00:05:48.979> still<00:05:49.190> you<00:05:49.580> know

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
different time now but still you know

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.120 
different time now but still you know
everyone<00:05:50.449> actually<00:05:50.810> this<00:05:51.229> includes<00:05:51.740> us<00:05:51.949> you

I mean okay Magnus Carlsen is from the
West<00:06:04.400> he's<00:06:04.580> from<00:06:04.759> Norway<00:06:05.180> I'm<00:06:05.780> from<00:06:05.990> the<00:06:06.080> US

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:07.959 
West he's from Norway I'm from the US
which<00:06:06.469> also<00:06:06.680> is<00:06:06.919> not<00:06:07.099> is<00:06:07.280> not<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.460> Eastern

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969 
which also is not is not the Eastern

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.749 
which also is not is not the Eastern
Bloc<00:06:08.210> so<00:06:08.650> in<00:06:09.650> general<00:06:10.009> I<00:06:10.069> think<00:06:10.099> you<00:06:10.639> know

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
Bloc so in general I think you know

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.249 
Bloc so in general I think you know
there<00:06:10.969> there<00:06:11.210> is<00:06:11.300> potential<00:06:11.840> for<00:06:11.990> there<00:06:12.110> to<00:06:12.139> be

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
there there is potential for there to be

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.409 
there there is potential for there to be
a<00:06:12.380> boom<00:06:12.650> but<00:06:13.039> still<00:06:13.340> in<00:06:13.849> order<00:06:14.120> for<00:06:14.270> that<00:06:14.360> to

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
a boom but still in order for that to

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.080 
a boom but still in order for that to
happen

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
happen

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.390 
happen
you<00:06:16.750> need<00:06:17.350> you<00:06:17.620> need<00:06:17.770> a<00:06:17.800> lot<00:06:18.010> of<00:06:18.040> media

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
you need you need a lot of media

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.760 
you need you need a lot of media
coverage<00:06:18.610> that's<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.270> main<00:06:19.449> thing<00:06:19.660> and<00:06:19.870> so

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
coverage that's the main thing and so

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.830 
coverage that's the main thing and so
hopefully<00:06:20.980> but<00:06:21.490> I<00:06:21.699> mean<00:06:21.880> that's<00:06:21.970> that's<00:06:22.419> not

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
hopefully but I mean that's that's not

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.150 
hopefully but I mean that's that's not
really<00:06:23.199> what<00:06:23.320> I'm<00:06:23.410> worrying<00:06:23.740> about<00:06:23.770> at<00:06:24.070> the

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
really what I'm worrying about at the

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.100 
really what I'm worrying about at the
moment<00:06:24.310> you<00:06:25.120> talked<00:06:25.360> about<00:06:25.449> hoping<00:06:25.900> you<00:06:25.990> get

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
moment you talked about hoping you get

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.240 
moment you talked about hoping you get
to<00:06:26.229> play<00:06:26.350> for<00:06:26.530> the<00:06:26.590> World<00:06:26.740> Championship

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
to play for the World Championship

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.860 
to play for the World Championship
against<00:06:27.520> Carl<00:06:27.850> Center<00:06:28.240> are<00:06:28.479> you<00:06:28.630> pretty

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
against Carl Center are you pretty

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.330 
against Carl Center are you pretty
confident<00:06:29.320> that<00:06:29.380> he's<00:06:29.470> gonna<00:06:29.680> defeat<00:06:30.040> an<00:06:30.190> on

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
confident that he's gonna defeat an on

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.240 
confident that he's gonna defeat an on
to<00:06:30.490> this<00:06:30.610> November<00:06:31.080> um<00:06:32.080> well<00:06:32.500> I<00:06:32.530> don't<00:06:32.860> know<00:06:33.220> I

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
to this November um well I don't know I

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.010 
to this November um well I don't know I
mean<00:06:33.610> on<00:06:33.790> paper<00:06:34.090> he's<00:06:34.330> certainly<00:06:34.690> the<00:06:34.780> big

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
mean on paper he's certainly the big

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.870 
mean on paper he's certainly the big
favorite<00:06:35.290> I<00:06:35.710> think<00:06:35.740> a<00:06:35.949> lot<00:06:36.100> depends<00:06:36.460> on<00:06:36.699> how

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
favorite I think a lot depends on how

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.110 
favorite I think a lot depends on how
Anan<00:06:37.360> plays<00:06:37.889> and<00:06:38.889> I<00:06:39.130> have<00:06:39.370> a<00:06:39.430> feeling<00:06:39.639> after

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
Anan plays and I have a feeling after

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.629 
Anan plays and I have a feeling after
after<00:06:40.540> the<00:06:40.630> first<00:06:40.870> game<00:06:41.050> game<00:06:41.680> or<00:06:41.860> two<00:06:42.040> it<00:06:42.310> I

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
after the first game game or two it I

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.939 
after the first game game or two it I
have<00:06:43.150> a<00:06:43.210> pretty<00:06:43.419> good<00:06:43.570> idea<00:06:43.690> I<00:06:44.260> mean<00:06:44.620> whether

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949 
have a pretty good idea I mean whether

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:46.469 
have a pretty good idea I mean whether
it's<00:06:45.070> gonna<00:06:45.280> be<00:06:45.490> a<00:06:45.520> close<00:06:45.790> match<00:06:45.850> or<00:06:46.330> whether

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 
it's gonna be a close match or whether

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.090 
it's gonna be a close match or whether
Carlson<00:06:46.960> is<00:06:47.020> just<00:06:47.169> gonna<00:06:47.320> run<00:06:47.500> away<00:06:47.620> with<00:06:47.740> it

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
Carlson is just gonna run away with it

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.490 
Carlson is just gonna run away with it
so<00:06:48.729> you<00:06:48.790> you<00:06:49.270> think<00:06:49.510> those<00:06:49.900> are<00:06:50.050> the<00:06:50.200> there's

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
so you you think those are the there's

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.969 
so you you think those are the there's
the<00:06:50.650> two<00:06:50.800> likely<00:06:51.190> outcomes<00:06:51.580> I<00:06:52.110> mean<00:06:53.110> the<00:06:53.320> two<00:06:53.500> I

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979 
the two likely outcomes I mean the two I

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.250 
the two likely outcomes I mean the two I
mean<00:06:54.490> it's<00:06:54.790> very<00:06:54.880> hard<00:06:55.330> to<00:06:55.389> see<00:06:55.600> Carlson<00:06:56.139> not

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
mean it's very hard to see Carlson not

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.570 
mean it's very hard to see Carlson not
winning<00:06:56.560> considering<00:06:56.950> the<00:06:57.040> way<00:06:57.130> he<00:06:57.250> seems<00:06:57.430> to

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
winning considering the way he seems to

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.659 
winning considering the way he seems to
win<00:06:57.700> everything<00:06:58.180> lately<00:06:58.840> and<00:06:59.470> how<00:07:00.130> consistent

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
win everything lately and how consistent

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.670 
win everything lately and how consistent
he<00:07:00.700> is<00:07:00.850> but<00:07:01.090> still<00:07:01.360> you<00:07:01.570> know<00:07:01.690> Anand<00:07:02.290> has

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
he is but still you know Anand has

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.440 
he is but still you know Anand has
something<00:07:03.070> to<00:07:03.100> prove<00:07:03.220> I<00:07:03.580> mean<00:07:03.760> he's<00:07:03.970> he's<00:07:04.240> won

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
something to prove I mean he's he's won

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.860 
something to prove I mean he's he's won
I<00:07:04.840> guess<00:07:04.930> three<00:07:05.320> matches<00:07:05.710> now<00:07:05.830> in<00:07:05.950> a<00:07:06.010> row<00:07:06.190> so

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
I guess three matches now in a row so

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.300 
I guess three matches now in a row so
we'll<00:07:07.870> see<00:07:08.110> but<00:07:08.289> I<00:07:08.350> mean<00:07:08.590> I<00:07:08.650> think<00:07:08.889> I<00:07:08.979> think<00:07:09.190> it

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
we'll see but I mean I think I think it

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.980 
we'll see but I mean I think I think it
depends<00:07:09.639> more<00:07:09.850> on<00:07:09.910> and<00:07:10.180> on<00:07:10.270> than<00:07:10.479> Carlson<00:07:10.900> it

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
depends more on and on than Carlson it

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.480 
depends more on and on than Carlson it
depends<00:07:11.260> if<00:07:11.350> an<00:07:11.440> on<00:07:11.560> can<00:07:11.800> play<00:07:11.950> a<00:07:11.979> very<00:07:12.310> high

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
depends if an on can play a very high

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.189 
depends if an on can play a very high
level<00:07:12.669> or<00:07:12.940> not<00:07:13.090> that's<00:07:13.389> that's<00:07:14.050> the

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 
level or not that's that's the

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.570 
level or not that's that's the
overriding<00:07:14.590> factor<00:07:14.710> because<00:07:15.250> if<00:07:15.310> you<00:07:15.400> can't

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
overriding factor because if you can't

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.060 
overriding factor because if you can't
play<00:07:15.789> at<00:07:15.850> a<00:07:15.880> high<00:07:16.000> level<00:07:16.030> I<00:07:16.660> just<00:07:17.650> have<00:07:18.039> a

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070 
play at a high level I just have a

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.040 
play at a high level I just have a
feeling<00:07:18.190> it's<00:07:18.400> gonna<00:07:18.460> be<00:07:18.580> a<00:07:18.669> very<00:07:18.699> very<00:07:19.479> uneven

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
feeling it's gonna be a very very uneven

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.200 
feeling it's gonna be a very very uneven
