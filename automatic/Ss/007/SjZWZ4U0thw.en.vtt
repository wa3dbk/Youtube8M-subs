00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 Hello everyone, today we will prepare a dessert 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.920
 luscious the pie falli stars that 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.220
 puts together the smaller and more 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.320
 large and to prepare it you will need 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.769
 600 grams of pan of half-liter stars 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.500
 of milk and half a liter of cream 400 g of 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.270
 nutella and powdered cocoa powder for 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.579
 start we have to whip cream that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.260
 must be very very cold for me 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.420
 safety I put both the cream of the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.420
 container in the fridge overnight 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.049
 now you have to put the ball in one 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.170
 pusha bag with a nice piece at the end 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.240
 wide enough this operation is not 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.490
 so simple to do it yourself then 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.440
 you can use a trick that me 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.299
 I saw it on television some time ago 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.250
 put the next bag in the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.920
 narrow container is tall and then has it 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.000
 filled with a small spatula this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.000
 it will make everything much easier 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.280
 keep the cream aside and place the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.110
 milk in a container so you can 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.470
 easily insult the pan biscuits 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.470
 of stars 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 make a first layer of mou cookies 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.140
 hinged lance with a diameter of 22 24 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.140
 about cm 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.840
 now you can request the cream and make 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.840
 a nice abundant layer on cookies 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.750
 I usually make a nice spiral and 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:57.300
 then with a spatula of the level the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:59.640
 surface when I read a fork 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.260
 put the nutella on the cream and 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.450
 got the note was a few minutes to 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.220
 microwave to make it more fluid 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.220
 and make it slide more easily 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.960
 finished with the nutella do another 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.250
 layer of pan of stars always 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.250
 bathing them before milk 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.610
 EBIT and again approach the bag with 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.620
 the system we showed 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.240
 first and make another layer of 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.780
 cream always to level it with one 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.780
 spatula 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.010
 now you want to add nutella 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.010
 remaining 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.700
 put the last one was some cookies 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.230
 always wetting them in milk and turn 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.230
 the smooth part upwards 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.900
 at this point you can add the 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.900
 remaining cream 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.099
 to level the cream well you can 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:32.149
 use a spatula a little more 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.149
 great like this 

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:41.509
 and once finished 

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:45.459
 put the cake with stars well 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.459
 locked in the fridge for at least a couple of hours 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.810
 to decorate the cake I chose the 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.240
 very simple system designed 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.520
 cut out stars on paper 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.400
 from below 9 8 and resting on the cake 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.920
 before sprinkling them with cocoa in 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.410
 so then going to remove them will remain 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.410
 some white stars you can use 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.880
 this system or if you want to do 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.910
 little stars maybe with some pasta from 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.910
 sugar 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.350
 place the stars on the cream 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.350
 making her live well 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:07:01.950
 work dusting complain once 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.080
 covered the whole coast raised 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.530
 gently the paper stars from 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.740
 oven 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.870
 if you can't get the baby 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.900
 you can help yourself or with a knife with 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.530
 one explains that to raise them slightly 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.530
 from the cream 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.630
 to finish you can or level the sides 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.120
 of the cake with a knife or 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.850
 you can rest on viscounts pan 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.410
 stars without to remove them from the non milk 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.470
 we need to add more because 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:44.250
 just the cream keep them firmly you will see 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.250
 that won't crack 

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.990
 I hope you enjoyed this cake
