00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
I'm using this twin USB adapter which

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.260 
I'm using this twin USB adapter which
allows<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.049> connect<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:08.130> PlayStation<00:01:08.670> 1

or PlayStation 2 controller to your

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.350 
or PlayStation 2 controller to your
computer<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.729> that's<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:12.000> I'm<00:01:12.090> using<00:01:12.240> for

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
computer so that's what I'm using for

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.140 
computer so that's what I'm using for
this<00:01:12.570> tutorial<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.290> you're<00:01:13.409> using<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.740> USB

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
this tutorial but if you're using a USB

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.789 
this tutorial but if you're using a USB
controller<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.420> some<00:01:15.720> other<00:01:15.900> type<00:01:16.200> by<00:01:16.650> all

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
controller of some other type by all

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.990 
controller of some other type by all
means<00:01:17.040> go<00:01:17.220> ahead<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:17.939> work

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
means go ahead and do it it will work

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940 
means go ahead and do it it will work
and<00:01:18.450> basically<00:01:18.900> what<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.229> doing<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.619> I'm<00:01:19.770> just

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and basically what I'm doing is I'm just

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.469 
and basically what I'm doing is I'm just
searching<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.549> settings<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.090> my<00:01:21.210> particular

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
searching for settings for my particular

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.840 
searching for settings for my particular
adapter<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.290> may<00:01:22.830> or<00:01:22.950> may<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.580> your

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
adapter it may or may not do it for your

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.850 
adapter it may or may not do it for your
adapter<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.659> do<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.619> ahead

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
adapter so if you do have it go ahead

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
adapter so if you do have it go ahead
try<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> let<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.610> search<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.030> settings<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
try to let it search for settings and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
try to let it search for settings and
click<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.049> finish<00:01:28.229> you're<00:01:28.560> good<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.799> go

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
click on finish you're good to go

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.980 
click on finish you're good to go
so<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.640> controller<00:01:30.000> 1<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
so I go to controller 1 and we see that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
so I go to controller 1 and we see that
everything<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.350> working<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.310> let<00:01:32.939> me

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
everything is working so I have let me

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.700 
everything is working so I have let me
turn<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.210> my<00:01:33.270> analog<00:01:33.780> stick<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.350> here's<00:01:34.560> my

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
turn on my analog stick so here's my

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.190 
turn on my analog stick so here's my
analog<00:01:35.810> ABXY<00:01:36.810> l1<00:01:37.470> r1<00:01:38.070> l2<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.479> push<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
analog ABXY l1 r1 l2 are to push the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.899 
analog ABXY l1 r1 l2 are to push the
button<00:01:40.530> select<00:01:40.979> start<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.490> we're<00:01:41.579> good<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.880> go

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
button select start and we're good to go

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.870 
button select start and we're good to go
so<00:01:42.090> now<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.960> click<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.409> save<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:44.729> can

is run the NZXT ii and my ps2 controller

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.920 
is run the NZXT ii and my ps2 controller
will<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.640> instantly<00:01:51.000> recognized<00:01:51.540> within<00:01:51.810> the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
actually swear so this is my analog

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.160 
actually swear so this is my analog
stick<00:03:01.630> moving<00:03:02.080> with<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.530> controller<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:04.170> if

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
stick moving with the controller and if

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.930 
stick moving with the controller and if
you<00:03:05.260> want<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.500> see<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.860> comparison<00:03:06.160> versus

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
you want to see the comparison versus

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.660 
you want to see the comparison versus
say<00:03:07.330> a<00:03:07.800> keyboard<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:08.890> mouse<00:03:08.950> here's<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.550> key

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
say a keyboard and mouse here's the key

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.740 
say a keyboard and mouse here's the key
part<00:03:09.790> Mouse

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
part Mouse

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.450 
part Mouse
so<00:03:12.290> we<00:03:12.350> can<00:03:12.470> see<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.710> it's<00:03:12.980> better<00:03:13.130> accuracy

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
so we can see that it's better accuracy

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.340 
so we can see that it's better accuracy
but<00:03:14.330> hey<00:03:14.510> some<00:03:14.720> guys<00:03:14.900> want<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.200> use<00:03:15.320> a

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
but hey some guys want to use a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.830 
but hey some guys want to use a
controller<00:03:15.740> which<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.280> perfectly<00:03:16.760> fine<00:03:17.390> and

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
controller which is perfectly fine and

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.820 
controller which is perfectly fine and
we<00:03:17.930> know<00:03:18.050> it's<00:03:18.200> working<00:03:18.440> because<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.680> says

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
we know it's working because it says

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.940 
we know it's working because it says
press<00:03:19.190> X<00:03:19.460> to<00:03:19.940> hold<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:21.020> search<00:03:21.230> dead<00:03:21.530> bodies

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
press X to hold to search dead bodies

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.530 
press X to hold to search dead bodies
for<00:03:22.370> searching<00:03:22.730> for<00:03:22.880> loops<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.240> that<00:03:23.270> is

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
for searching for loops so that is

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.630 
for searching for loops so that is
