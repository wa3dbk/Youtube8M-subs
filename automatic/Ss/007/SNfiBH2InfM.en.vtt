video for those of you guys who decide
to<00:00:05.819> ride<00:00:06.060> all<00:00:06.299> through<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.660> winter<00:00:06.779> there<00:00:07.710> a

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
to ride all through the winter there a

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.290 
to ride all through the winter there a
couple<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.040> things<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.610> your<00:00:08.790> bikes<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.210> you

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
couple of things on your bikes that you

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.930 
couple of things on your bikes that you
should<00:00:09.480> probably<00:00:10.160> take<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> look<00:00:11.280> at<00:00:11.550> before

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
should probably take a look at before

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.320 
should probably take a look at before
the<00:00:12.120> cold<00:00:12.599> weather<00:00:12.780> comes<00:00:13.610> this<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.790> gonna<00:00:15.210> be

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
the cold weather comes this is gonna be

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.430 
the cold weather comes this is gonna be
a<00:00:15.360> real<00:00:15.509> short<00:00:15.540> one<00:00:15.900> because<00:00:16.080> there's<00:00:16.230> really

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
a real short one because there's really

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.990 
a real short one because there's really
only<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.800> couple<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.310> differences<00:00:17.670> between

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
only a couple of differences between

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.080 
only a couple of differences between
regular<00:00:18.779> riding<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.199> cold<00:00:19.380> weather<00:00:19.619> riding

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
regular riding and cold weather riding

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.460 
regular riding and cold weather riding
first<00:00:21.090> your<00:00:21.390> battery<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:21.960> gonna<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.260> less

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
first your battery it's gonna be less

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.769 
first your battery it's gonna be less
effective<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.550> had<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.820> buy<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.300> new

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
effective I just had to buy a new

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.710 
effective I just had to buy a new
battery<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:26.000> Honda<00:00:27.000> Matic<00:00:27.480> here

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
battery for this Honda Matic here

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.720 
battery for this Honda Matic here
because<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.289> recent<00:00:28.619> cold<00:00:28.800> snaps<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.519> about

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
because the recent cold snaps just about

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.930 
because the recent cold snaps just about
killed<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.359> five-year<00:00:31.109> old<00:00:31.380> battery<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
killed like five-year old battery it's a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.590 
killed like five-year old battery it's a
long<00:00:33.090> time<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> battery<00:00:35.180> yeah<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.450> gonna

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
long time for a battery yeah it's gonna

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.479 
long time for a battery yeah it's gonna
be<00:00:36.780> less<00:00:36.960> effective<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.070> might<00:00:38.219> want<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
be less effective you might want to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.280 
be less effective you might want to
think<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.790> topping<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.480> off<00:00:39.600> with<00:00:39.629> fluids

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
think about topping it off with fluids

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.069 
think about topping it off with fluids
if<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.520> getting<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.820> little<00:00:41.910> weak<00:00:42.180> or<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.899> not

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
if it's getting a little weak or if not

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.080 
if it's getting a little weak or if not
and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.860> replacing<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.850> I'm<00:00:47.969> gonna

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and then just replacing it so I'm gonna

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.540 
and then just replacing it so I'm gonna
do<00:00:48.360> once<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.690> charge<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.620> another

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
do once I charge this one up another

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.119 
do once I charge this one up another
thing<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.809> battery<00:00:52.020> connections<00:00:52.860> are

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
thing is the battery connections are

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.470 
thing is the battery connections are
gonna<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> little<00:00:53.670> bit<00:00:53.789> more<00:00:53.969> corroded

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
gonna get a little bit more corroded

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.479 
gonna get a little bit more corroded
because<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.070> guys<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.250> at

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
because I know about you guys but at

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.799 
because I know about you guys but at
least<00:00:56.550> down<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.090> winter<00:00:57.300> time<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
least down here in winter time we get a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.779 
least down here in winter time we get a
lot<00:00:57.989> more<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.770> subsequently<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.489> lot<00:00:59.609> more

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
lot more do and subsequently a lot more

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.420 
lot more do and subsequently a lot more
frost<00:01:00.149> each<00:01:01.050> morning<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.129> just

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
frost each morning and so that's just

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.219 
frost each morning and so that's just
moisture<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.329> sticks<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.049> bike

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
moisture that just sticks to the bike

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.350 
moisture that just sticks to the bike
you<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.890> ways<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.430> didn't<00:01:06.270> really

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
you know in ways that didn't really

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.000 
you know in ways that didn't really
happen<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.900> summertime<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.740> least<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
happen in the summertime or at least the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.820 
happen in the summertime or at least the
summers<00:01:08.310> heat<00:01:08.490> burned<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.909> off<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.680> get

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
summers heat burned it off so you get

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.750 
summers heat burned it off so you get
corrosion<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:12.590> in<00:01:13.590> your<00:01:13.830> starter<00:01:14.250> solenoids

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
corrosion like in your starter solenoids

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.060 
corrosion like in your starter solenoids
you<00:01:15.150> look<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.659> junk<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
you look at all that junk you know and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.749 
you look at all that junk you know and
these<00:01:17.250> battery<00:01:17.729> leads<00:01:17.909> big-time<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.080> then

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
these battery leads big-time and then

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.770 
these battery leads big-time and then
grounds<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.939> lead<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.150> grounds<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.659> your

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
grounds that lead to grounds on your

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870 
grounds that lead to grounds on your
bike<00:01:21.960> other<00:01:22.650> places<00:01:22.950> too<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.460> those<00:01:23.580> are<00:01:23.729> big

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
bike other places too but those are big

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
bike other places too but those are big
ones<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.299> me<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> usually<00:01:24.869> check<00:01:25.320> around

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
ones for me that I usually check around

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.469 
ones for me that I usually check around
this<00:01:25.740> time<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> year<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.490> I'll<00:01:26.610> clean<00:01:27.390> them

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this time of year and I'll clean them

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.649 
this time of year and I'll clean them
off<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> file<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.390> nice<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
off with a file you know and nice and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.260 
off with a file you know and nice and
nice<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.740> pretty

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
nice and pretty

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.810 
nice and pretty
um<00:01:33.409> another<00:01:34.409> thing<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.799> look<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.189> your<00:01:35.430> tires

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
um another thing to look for your tires

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.120 
um another thing to look for your tires
your<00:01:36.720> tires<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.170> gonna<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.530> colder<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
your tires are gonna get colder and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.679 
your tires are gonna get colder and
stiffer<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.650> they're<00:01:40.650> gonna<00:01:40.740> start<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.220> crack

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
stiffer and they're gonna start to crack

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.960 
stiffer and they're gonna start to crack
this<00:01:42.689> means<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.399> know<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.729> gotta

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
this means that you know you just gotta

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.149 
this means that you know you just gotta
inspect<00:01:45.450> them<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.259> probably<00:01:46.470> will<00:01:46.799> need<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
inspect them you probably will need to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.880 
inspect them you probably will need to
overinflate<00:01:47.700> them<00:01:48.210> by<00:01:48.390> maybe<00:01:48.630> 5<00:01:48.990> psi<00:01:49.470> or<00:01:49.680> so

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
overinflate them by maybe 5 psi or so

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
overinflate them by maybe 5 psi or so
I'm<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.030> air<00:01:51.180> inside<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.720> going

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
I'm just because the air inside is going

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.170 
I'm just because the air inside is going
to<00:01:51.960> condense<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.350> take<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> reading

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
to condense so you know take a reading

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.999 
to condense so you know take a reading
take<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> reading<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.590> know<00:01:58.619> at

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
take a reading at like you know at

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.440 
take a reading at like you know at
daytime<00:01:59.460> temperatures<00:02:00.030> are<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
daytime temperatures are like the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.999 
daytime temperatures are like the
warmest<00:02:00.719> part<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.170> your<00:02:01.290> average<00:02:01.530> day<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
warmest part of your average day and

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.800 
warmest part of your average day and
then<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.490> nighttime<00:02:02.729> temperatures<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.630> just

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
then at nighttime temperatures and just

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.539 
then at nighttime temperatures and just
see<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> difference<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.680> determine<00:02:05.399> whether

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
see the difference and determine whether

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.869 
see the difference and determine whether
or<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.939> need<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:07.489> whether<00:02:08.489> or<00:02:08.610> not<00:02:08.670> you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
or not you need to whether or not you

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.530 
or not you need to whether or not you
need<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:11.450> inflate<00:02:12.450> them<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.629> little<00:02:12.840> bit

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
need to inflate them a little bit

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.119 
need to inflate them a little bit
also<00:02:13.989> if<00:02:14.080> you're<00:02:14.200> gonna<00:02:14.290> go<00:02:14.470> out<00:02:14.650> for<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.890> ride

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
also if you're gonna go out for a ride

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.830 
also if you're gonna go out for a ride
it's<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.580> really<00:02:15.790> good<00:02:15.939> idea<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.239> warm<00:02:16.510> up<00:02:16.689> your

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
it's a really good idea to warm up your

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.350 
it's a really good idea to warm up your
tires<00:02:17.049> first<00:02:17.409> that<00:02:17.890> doesn't<00:02:18.280> involve<00:02:19.000> doing

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
tires first that doesn't involve doing

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.030 
tires first that doesn't involve doing
burnouts<00:02:19.810> or<00:02:20.079> whatever<00:02:20.349> just<00:02:20.590> do<00:02:20.799> some

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
burnouts or whatever just do some

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.679 
burnouts or whatever just do some
controlled<00:02:21.549> figure<00:02:21.970> eights<00:02:22.180> around<00:02:22.569> the

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
controlled figure eights around the

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.479 
controlled figure eights around the
parking<00:02:22.989> lot<00:02:23.079> just<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.890> warm<00:02:24.069> up<00:02:24.159> the<00:02:24.280> tires

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
parking lot just to warm up the tires

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.710 
parking lot just to warm up the tires
before<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.939> put<00:02:25.090> them<00:02:25.180> out<00:02:25.269> on<00:02:25.329> the<00:02:25.450> street

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
before you put them out on the street

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.899 
before you put them out on the street
because<00:02:25.900> they're<00:02:26.230> gonna<00:02:26.379> grip<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.769> lot<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.370> lot

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
because they're gonna grip a lot a lot

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.380 
because they're gonna grip a lot a lot
less<00:02:28.180> because<00:02:28.569> they're<00:02:28.720> cold<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:30.390> naturally

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
less because they're cold and naturally

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.940 
less because they're cold and naturally
now<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.780> time<00:02:31.930> if<00:02:32.140> you've<00:02:32.290> got<00:02:32.500> wore<00:02:32.739> out

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
now is the time if you've got wore out

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.800 
now is the time if you've got wore out
tires<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.519> I<00:02:33.640> do<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:33.970> my<00:02:34.000> Madera<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.720> that

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
tires like I do in my Madera and that

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.930 
tires like I do in my Madera and that
was<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.959> really<00:02:35.110> good<00:02:35.349> time<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.769> uh<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:36.640> get<00:02:36.760> some

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
was a really good time to uh to get some

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.319 
was a really good time to uh to get some
new<00:02:37.090> ones<00:02:37.209> in<00:02:37.450> there<00:02:38.700> if<00:02:39.700> you've<00:02:39.879> got<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.120> bike

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
new ones in there if you've got a bike

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.080 
new ones in there if you've got a bike
which<00:02:40.540> has<00:02:40.750> been<00:02:40.900> traditionally<00:02:42.090> cold

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
which has been traditionally cold

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.930 
which has been traditionally cold
natured<00:02:43.590> throughout<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.739> summer<00:02:44.980> in<00:02:45.879> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
natured throughout the summer in the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.180 
natured throughout the summer in the
winter<00:02:46.120> time<00:02:46.510> it's<00:02:46.569> gonna<00:02:46.900> get<00:02:47.109> worse<00:02:47.319> that<00:02:48.069> is

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
winter time it's gonna get worse that is

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.770 
winter time it's gonna get worse that is
to<00:02:48.310> say<00:02:48.489> if<00:02:48.549> you've<00:02:48.760> got<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> tiny<00:02:49.299> little<00:02:49.540> air

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
to say if you've got a tiny little air

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.599 
to say if you've got a tiny little air
leak<00:02:50.019> like<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.470> your<00:02:50.590> boots<00:02:50.829> down<00:02:51.129> here<00:02:51.489> or

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
leak like in your boots down here or

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.589 
leak like in your boots down here or
whatever<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.700> can<00:02:54.849> deal<00:02:55.060> with<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
whatever that you can deal with in the

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.869 
whatever that you can deal with in the
summertime<00:02:56.109> in<00:02:56.409> the<00:02:56.440> winter<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:57.430> air<00:02:57.609> is<00:02:57.849> a

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
summertime in the winter the air is a

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.649 
summertime in the winter the air is a
lot<00:02:58.150> denser<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:59.019> so<00:02:59.819> there's<00:03:00.819> more<00:03:00.940> oxygen<00:03:01.150> in

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
lot denser and so there's more oxygen in

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.509 
lot denser and so there's more oxygen in
it<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.019> it's<00:03:02.230> going<00:03:02.409> to<00:03:02.530> get<00:03:02.680> worse<00:03:02.859> and<00:03:03.220> so

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
it and it's going to get worse and so

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.920 
it and it's going to get worse and so
now<00:03:03.730> it's<00:03:03.879> a<00:03:03.940> good<00:03:04.090> time<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.329> fix<00:03:04.720> those

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
now it's a good time to fix those

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.140 
now it's a good time to fix those
underlying<00:03:05.349> problems<00:03:05.889> you<00:03:06.670> know<00:03:06.760> buy<00:03:06.970> new

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
underlying problems you know buy new

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.059 
underlying problems you know buy new

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
stuff that you got to do or else you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.039 
stuff that you got to do or else you
might<00:03:12.040> have<00:03:12.250> some<00:03:12.549> problems<00:03:12.940> cold<00:03:13.659> starting

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
might have some problems cold starting

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.949 
might have some problems cold starting
in<00:03:14.139> the<00:03:14.230> mornings<00:03:15.359> so<00:03:16.359> your<00:03:16.510> liquid-cooled

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
in the mornings so your liquid-cooled

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.409 
in the mornings so your liquid-cooled
bikes<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.430> definitely<00:03:18.699> a<00:03:18.849> good<00:03:18.970> time<00:03:19.209> to

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
bikes this is definitely a good time to

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.900 
bikes this is definitely a good time to
change<00:03:19.629> your<00:03:19.720> coolant<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.799> maybe<00:03:21.519> thicken

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
change your coolant and maybe thicken

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.550 
change your coolant and maybe thicken
your<00:03:21.940> cooling<00:03:22.299> up<00:03:22.419> a<00:03:22.540> little<00:03:22.690> bit<00:03:22.900> according

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
your cooling up a little bit according

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.270 
your cooling up a little bit according
to<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.889> manufacturers<00:03:24.669> specs<00:03:24.819> for<00:03:26.250> for<00:03:27.250> a

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
to the manufacturers specs for for a

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.250 
to the manufacturers specs for for a
cold<00:03:27.730> weather<00:03:27.940> riding<00:03:28.180> typically<00:03:28.959> it's<00:03:29.169> not

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
cold weather riding typically it's not

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.710 
cold weather riding typically it's not
much<00:03:29.560> different<00:03:29.849> like<00:03:30.849> I<00:03:30.940> know<00:03:31.000> some<00:03:31.359> cool<00:03:31.510> and

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
much different like I know some cool and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.750 
much different like I know some cool and
say<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.049> know<00:03:32.319> use<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> 50/50<00:03:33.280> mix<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.699> that's

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
say you know use a 50/50 mix and that's

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.309 
say you know use a 50/50 mix and that's
good<00:03:34.060> for<00:03:34.090> temperature<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.109> all<00:03:35.199> the<00:03:35.260> way

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
good for temperature it's all the way

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.270 
good for temperature it's all the way
down<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.620> 250<00:03:36.370> degrees<00:03:36.639> -<00:03:37.090> or<00:03:37.239> whatever<00:03:38.190> but<00:03:39.190> if

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
down to 250 degrees - or whatever but if

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.439 
down to 250 degrees - or whatever but if
you<00:03:39.370> don't<00:03:39.549> know<00:03:39.669> what<00:03:39.879> mixture<00:03:40.299> you're

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
you don't know what mixture you're

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.110 
you don't know what mixture you're
riding<00:03:40.840> in<00:03:41.049> there<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:42.400> you've<00:03:42.639> never<00:03:42.849> changed

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
riding in there and you've never changed

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.210 
riding in there and you've never changed
your<00:03:43.359> cooling<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.810> might<00:03:43.959> as<00:03:44.079> well<00:03:44.230> just<00:03:45.069> have

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
your cooling you might as well just have

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.069 
your cooling you might as well just have
water<00:03:45.459> like<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.299> know<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.480> lot<00:03:46.569> of<00:03:46.780> guys<00:03:46.900> down

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
water like I know a lot of guys down

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.629 
water like I know a lot of guys down
here<00:03:47.139> just<00:03:47.440> put<00:03:47.560> water<00:03:47.709> in<00:03:47.980> there<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.370> their

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
here just put water in there in their

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.400 
here just put water in there in their
bikes<00:03:48.790> because<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.209> rarely<00:03:49.419> ever<00:03:49.629> freezes<00:03:50.139> and

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
bikes because it rarely ever freezes and

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.470 
bikes because it rarely ever freezes and
so<00:03:51.250> if<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.519> just<00:03:51.730> bought<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:51.970> bike<00:03:52.239> from

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
so if you just bought a bike from

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.520 
so if you just bought a bike from
Florida<00:03:52.840> or<00:03:52.930> whatever<00:03:53.139> and<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.349> haven't

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
changed the coolant you bring it all the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.490 
changed the coolant you bring it all the
way<00:03:55.060> up<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.239> Minnesota<00:03:55.389> well<00:03:56.139> you're<00:03:56.319> gonna<00:03:56.409> be

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
pretty unhappy if that coolant freezes

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.479 
pretty unhappy if that coolant freezes
and<00:03:58.329> it<00:03:58.560> splits<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.709> bunch<00:03:59.889> of<00:04:00.010> stuff<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.400> your

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.449 
and it splits a bunch of stuff in your
cooling<00:04:00.790> system<00:04:00.819> yeah<00:04:01.540> we<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:02.230> know<00:04:02.459> that's

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
cooling system yeah we you know that's

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.140 
cooling system yeah we you know that's
gonna<00:04:03.609> really<00:04:03.879> suck<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.989> just<00:04:05.290> uh<00:04:06.030> just<00:04:07.030> be

I'm not going to spend too much time on

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.440 
I'm not going to spend too much time on
what<00:04:21.190> gear<00:04:21.430> you<00:04:21.549> should<00:04:21.729> use<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.060> everything

what gear you should use and everything

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.370 
what gear you should use and everything
because<00:04:22.750> people<00:04:23.050> live<00:04:23.169> in<00:04:23.229> different

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
because people live in different

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.040 
because people live in different
climates<00:04:24.870> how

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
climates how

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.290 
climates how
a<00:04:26.080> good<00:04:26.800> rule<00:04:27.039> of<00:04:27.069> thumb<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.580> found<00:04:28.030> is

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
a good rule of thumb that I found is

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.119 
a good rule of thumb that I found is
that<00:04:28.330> if<00:04:28.599> I<00:04:28.720> get<00:04:28.930> all<00:04:29.080> dressed<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.740> put<00:04:29.830> all<00:04:29.979> my

gear on my leathers and my really thick

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.210 
gear on my leathers and my really thick
wool<00:04:33.759> line<00:04:34.060> gloves<00:04:34.479> and<00:04:34.930> my<00:04:35.110> facemask<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.099> my

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220
