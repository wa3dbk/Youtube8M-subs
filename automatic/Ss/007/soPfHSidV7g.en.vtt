 It's, and I really liked it. 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.780
 various types of music type of singers 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.210
 so it varies a lot 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.420
 I like from alan del rey to 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.290
 hemingway projota understanding this type 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.660
 of thing 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.460
 and so is winning it is the king she 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.300
 it was super romantic without super 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.370
 melancholy and also have the rep also 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.040
 so I like all kinds of 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.770
 music and listen to all kinds of music and 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.180
 likes many singers in the del rey and 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.310
 mini pro j 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.240
 beyonce is the blood or blood people 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.750
 would be 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.440
 I also really like having many 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.550
 changes I like so it was enough 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.980
 something you miss 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.480
 Well I'll miss the people who 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.170
 I loved very much and have died. 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.860
 What is your sign? I'm Cancerian. 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.310
 significant according to amorim the emotion is 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:10.340
 so I'm a people who seek and the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:12.709
 boyfriend change the phrase in my girlfriend 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.000
 I already have so many people but I think 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.390
 It's worth what a person I'm looking for 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.130
 I think the main thing is a person is 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.420
 It's funny to be honest. 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.940
 I think the first thing has to be 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.709
 honestly I think the entity is everything 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.070
 person can not lie to do anything 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.840
 friendship and love, too. 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.420
 I find superimportant funny people 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.610
 know the reality of the type of thing 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.610
 so all things that are very 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.430
 important 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.170
 likes fights does not like bugs 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.040
 I hate glitters I'm totally against 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.010
 fights 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.750
 I think it's ridiculous, it's a man and 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.500
 mainly woman who likes to 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.820
 shack I think super tacky super ugly 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.520
 super tacky and I hate this type 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.290
 kind of a fight and never 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.960
 I've never never liked that kind of 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.920
 thing and then they hate 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.680
 I think it's very ugly, it's ugly 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.950
 does not tolerate what I can not tolerate. 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:21.200
 I want to tolerate people who are lying 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.940
 I can not lie and that kind of 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.810
 things we did not take, I think it's the 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.370
 worse 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.560
 The worst thing about the things I still do 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.000
 when you find the lie and stay 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.050
 ugly person to person lying 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.940
 It's very ugly, it ends with confidence. 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.090
 ends with everything then the worst thing that 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.300
 there is one thing that does not tolerate the phrase 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:45.980
 favorite to my favorite phrase 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.010
 I have several but you think I think it's 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.540
 beautiful is that phrase ever since 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.700
