00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
like the fly sheet itself it has a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
like the fly sheet itself it has a
hexagon<00:00:58.289> material<00:00:58.859> shape<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> outside

hexagon material shape on the outside
now<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.329> means<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.690> no<00:01:01.140> matter<00:01:01.170> how<00:01:01.410> you

picture or how you know how windy it is
it<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.589> take<00:01:04.619> pressure<00:01:05.159> from<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.580> sorts<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it can take pressure from all sorts of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.580 
it can take pressure from all sorts of
angles<00:01:06.060> which<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.780> really<00:01:07.140> good<00:01:07.290> technology

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
angles which is really good technology

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.070 
angles which is really good technology
because<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.100> help<00:01:08.340> reduce<00:01:08.490> splitting<00:01:09.330> or

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
because that help reduce splitting or

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.109 
because that help reduce splitting or
any<00:01:10.260> phrase<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> actual<00:01:11.189> tent<00:01:11.460> itself<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
prolonging the actual the tent life

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.609 
prolonging the actual the tent life
itself<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.930> nice<00:01:16.080> feature<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
itself it's a really nice feature to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
itself it's a really nice feature to
have<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.400> works<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.939> well<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.630> the

power light alloy t6 poles now these are

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
power light alloy t6 poles now these are
really<00:01:22.020> lightweight<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.280> take<00:01:23.460> an

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
really lightweight but they can take an

as<00:01:26.040> hell<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.210> poles<00:01:27.479> themselves<00:01:27.720> will

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
as hell but the poles themselves will

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.260 
as hell but the poles themselves will
stay<00:01:28.590> nice<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.829> rigid<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.490> keep<00:01:29.880> your<00:01:30.030> tent

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the front of the part of the tent zips

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.190 
the front of the part of the tent zips
up<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.430> well<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.750> living

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
up as well so you can have the living

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.920 
up as well so you can have the living
space<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> lot<00:01:55.920> more<00:01:55.950> open<00:01:56.369> that's<00:01:57.360> also<00:01:57.750> why

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
space a lot more open that's also why

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.859 
space a lot more open that's also why
the<00:01:58.170> tent<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.560> DAV<00:01:58.890> recommended<00:01:59.820> stay

the tent is DAV recommended stay

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.039 
the tent is DAV recommended stay
on<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> inside<00:02:01.380> shall<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:02.240> what<00:02:03.240> I'm<00:02:03.540> inside

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
on the inside shall we what I'm inside

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.289 
on the inside shall we what I'm inside
so<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:05.250> take<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> look<00:02:05.610> at<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.880> sleeping

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
so we take a look at the sleeping

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.520 
so we take a look at the sleeping
quarters<00:02:06.540> first

quarters first

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
quarters first

in<00:02:12.060> width<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.510> does<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.930> depth<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:13.530> it's<00:02:13.650> we

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
in width it does it in depth so it's we

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
system now this works with the poles as

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.080 
system now this works with the poles as
well<00:03:22.380> as<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.920> actual<00:03:23.040> shape<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.610> tent<00:03:23.940> and

the guide ropes so if it's a bit of a
windy<00:03:25.950> night<00:03:26.100> just<00:03:26.370> connect<00:03:26.700> these<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.150> here

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
windy night just connect these in here

what<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:29.880> does<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.299> solidifies<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:31.079> tents

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
what this does this solidifies the tents

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.560 
what this does this solidifies the tents
rather<00:03:31.590> than<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:31.860> wobbling<00:03:32.820> around<00:03:32.940> just

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
rather than it wobbling around just

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.390 
rather than it wobbling around just
makes<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.019> tent<00:03:34.260> unit<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> lot<00:03:34.860> more<00:03:35.160> solid

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
makes the tent unit a lot more solid

tent has has a LinkedIn ground system so
rather<00:03:41.790> than<00:03:42.030> traditional<00:03:42.239> tents<00:03:42.840> having<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
rather than traditional tents having the

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.229 
rather than traditional tents having the
ground<00:03:43.650> system<00:03:43.890> hooked<00:03:44.250> into<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.790> sleeping

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
ground system hooked into the sleeping

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:45.680 
ground system hooked into the sleeping
area

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
area

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.259 
area
it<00:03:46.320> now<00:03:46.560> has<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:46.829> separate<00:03:47.370> entity<00:03:47.610> so<00:03:47.940> all

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
it now has a separate entity so all

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.460 
it now has a separate entity so all
you've<00:03:48.510> got<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.720> do<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:48.959> these<00:03:49.140> little

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
you've got to do just these little

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.890 
you've got to do just these little
toggles<00:03:49.799> here<00:03:49.829> keeps<00:03:50.549> all<00:03:50.850> linked<00:03:51.269> in<00:03:51.420> now<00:03:51.840> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
toggles here keeps all linked in now the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.229 
toggles here keeps all linked in now the
reason<00:03:52.290> for<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:52.769> two<00:03:53.100> obvious<00:03:53.850> reasons

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
reason for that is two obvious reasons

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.990 
reason for that is two obvious reasons
