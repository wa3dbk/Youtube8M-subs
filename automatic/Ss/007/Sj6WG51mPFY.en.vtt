00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
g1 s and g2 phase yes this one is

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.380 
g1 s and g2 phase yes this one is
representing<00:03:25.049> interface<00:03:26.010> I'm<00:03:26.400> writing<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.180> as

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
representing interface I'm writing it as

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.190 
representing interface I'm writing it as
AI<00:03:27.720> phase<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.859> this<00:03:29.730> phase<00:03:29.790> where<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.900> cell

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
AI phase and this phase where the cell

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.050 
AI phase and this phase where the cell
division<00:03:31.950> will<00:03:32.159> occur<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.389> M<00:03:33.659> phase<00:03:35.060> so

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
division will occur this is M phase so

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.800 
division will occur this is M phase so
in<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.689> question<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:38.099> initial<00:03:38.970> amount<00:03:39.420> of

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
in this question the initial amount of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.679 
in this question the initial amount of
DNA<00:03:40.230> which<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.040> present<00:03:41.639> in<00:03:41.819> these<00:03:42.000> cells<00:03:42.329> that

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
DNA which is present in these cells that

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:47.539 
DNA which is present in these cells that
is<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.379> C<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.609> means<00:03:44.819> in<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.299> g1<00:03:45.810> phase<00:03:46.549> the

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
is to C so it means in the g1 phase the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.420 
is to C so it means in the g1 phase the
content<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.750> DNA<00:03:49.319> which<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.560> present<00:03:50.159> in<00:03:50.310> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
content the DNA which is present in the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.020 
content the DNA which is present in the
cell<00:03:50.669> that<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.599> C<00:03:51.900> right<00:03:52.459> then<00:03:53.459> after<00:03:53.879> the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
cell that is to C right then after the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.020 
cell that is to C right then after the
g1<00:03:54.419> phase<00:03:54.450> comes<00:03:55.200> as<00:03:55.470> face<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.430> know<00:03:56.609> that<00:03:56.879> an

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
g1 phase comes as face you know that an

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.949 
g1 phase comes as face you know that an
S<00:03:57.389> phase<00:03:57.750> DNA<00:03:58.560> duplication<00:03:59.010> occurs<00:03:59.909> so<00:04:00.689> the

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
S phase DNA duplication occurs so the

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.159 
S phase DNA duplication occurs so the
contents<00:04:01.769> get<00:04:02.129> double<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.090> concentration<00:04:03.780> is

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
contents get double so concentration is

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.809 
contents get double so concentration is
for<00:04:04.590> C<00:04:04.950> here<00:04:05.840> after<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.049> S<00:04:07.319> phase<00:04:07.829> comes<00:04:08.250> g2

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
for C here after the S phase comes g2

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.420 
for C here after the S phase comes g2
phase<00:04:09.120> again<00:04:09.810> in<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.470> g2<00:04:10.799> phase<00:04:11.069> the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
phase again in the g2 phase the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.080 
phase again in the g2 phase the
concentration<00:04:12.359> remains<00:04:12.540> for<00:04:13.199> C<00:04:13.560> now<00:04:14.519> whilst

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
concentration remains for C now whilst

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.259 
concentration remains for C now whilst
the<00:04:15.449> interface<00:04:16.109> is<00:04:16.470> over<00:04:17.070> now<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.489> cell<00:04:17.970> is

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
the interface is over now the cell is

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.680 
the interface is over now the cell is
ready<00:04:18.750> for<00:04:19.650> division<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.880> will<00:04:21.060> enter<00:04:21.269> M

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
ready for division so it will enter M

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.550 
ready for division so it will enter M
phase<00:04:22.289> in<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:23.159> M<00:04:23.370> phase<00:04:23.849> one<00:04:24.840> daughter<00:04:25.320> cell

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
phase in the M phase one daughter cell

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.719 
phase in the M phase one daughter cell
it<00:04:26.340> is<00:04:26.580> do<00:04:27.090> one<00:04:27.510> parent<00:04:28.169> cell<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:28.889> divided

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
it is do one parent cell it is divided

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.129 
it is do one parent cell it is divided
into<00:04:29.880> two<00:04:30.380> daughters<00:04:31.380> sin<00:04:31.740> if<00:04:32.780> mitosis<00:04:33.780> occur

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
into two daughters sin if mitosis occur

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.219 
into two daughters sin if mitosis occur
one<00:04:34.979> parent<00:04:35.550> cell<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:36.000> divided<00:04:36.599> into<00:04:36.750> two

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
one parent cell is divided into two

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.000 
one parent cell is divided into two
daughter<00:04:37.740> cells<00:04:38.060> so<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.240> amount<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:40.020> DNA<00:04:40.409> in

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
daughter cells so the amount of DNA in

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.120 
daughter cells so the amount of DNA in
do<00:04:41.370> daughter<00:04:41.760> cells<00:04:42.330> that<00:04:43.110> is<00:04:43.320> reduced<00:04:43.830> to

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
do daughter cells that is reduced to

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.490 
do daughter cells that is reduced to
half<00:04:45.320> yes<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:47.039> instead<00:04:47.639> of<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:48.000> 4c<00:04:48.690> now<00:04:49.440> the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
half yes so instead of the 4c now the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.860 
half yes so instead of the 4c now the
DNA<00:04:49.889> content<00:04:50.729> which<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:51.060> present<00:04:51.479> in<00:04:51.659> each

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
DNA content which is present in each

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.879 
DNA content which is present in each
daughter<00:04:52.470> cell<00:04:52.650> that<00:04:53.190> is<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.789> C<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.650> means

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
daughter cell that is to C so it means

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.680 
daughter cell that is to C so it means
the<00:04:56.280> 4c<00:04:57.090> condition<00:04:57.930> is<00:04:58.260> seen<00:04:59.190> in<00:04:59.669> which<00:05:00.240> phase

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
the 4c condition is seen in which phase

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.680 
the 4c condition is seen in which phase
one<00:05:01.020> is<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.199> S<00:05:01.500> phase<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.220> another<00:05:02.340> one<00:05:02.729> is<00:05:02.970> g2

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
one is the S phase and another one is g2

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.350 
one is the S phase and another one is g2
phase<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.650> after<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.370> duplication<00:05:05.909> it<00:05:06.240> is

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
phase so after the duplication it is

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.399 
phase so after the duplication it is
seen<00:05:06.599> only<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:07.020> which<00:05:07.349> phase<00:05:07.770> g2<00:05:08.580> phase<00:05:08.940> so<00:05:09.870> it

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
seen only in which phase g2 phase so it

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.820 
seen only in which phase g2 phase so it
is<00:05:10.710> seen<00:05:11.009> only<00:05:11.340> in<00:05:11.849> g2<00:05:12.510> phase<00:05:12.870> so<00:05:13.200> this<00:05:13.469> is<00:05:13.650> the

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
is seen only in g2 phase so this is the

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.740 
is seen only in g2 phase so this is the
right<00:05:14.219> answer<00:05:15.090> for<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.539> question<00:05:16.080> number

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
right answer for the question number

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.900 
right answer for the question number
six<00:05:18.570> so<00:05:19.570> after<00:05:19.900> this<00:05:20.050> now<00:05:20.290> let's<00:05:20.500> discuss<00:05:20.910> 107

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
six so after this now let's discuss 107

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.900 
six so after this now let's discuss 107
here<00:05:26.910> so<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.030> question<00:05:28.450> of<00:05:28.540> Mahon

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
here so the question of Mahon

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.230 
here so the question of Mahon
in<00:05:29.090> seven<00:05:29.540> we<00:05:29.750> have<00:05:29.960> to<00:05:30.110> match<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:30.680> following

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240

nucleic<00:06:08.150> acid-based<00:06:08.630> enzyme<00:06:09.730> right<00:06:10.730> so<00:06:11.390> what

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
nucleic acid-based enzyme right so what

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.270 
nucleic acid-based enzyme right so what
is<00:06:11.870> the<00:06:12.050> right<00:06:12.260> option<00:06:12.950> for<00:06:12.980> a<00:06:13.640> it<00:06:14.210> is<00:06:14.390> full<00:06:15.280> for

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
is the right option for a it is full for

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.000 
is the right option for a it is full for
B<00:06:16.580> it<00:06:16.640> is<00:06:16.970> 2<00:06:17.420> for<00:06:18.080> C<00:06:18.410> it<00:06:18.650> is<00:06:18.830> 1<00:06:19.330> D<00:06:20.330> it<00:06:20.540> is<00:06:20.720> 3<00:06:21.170> so<00:06:21.890> the

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
B it is 2 for C it is 1 D it is 3 so the

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.120 
B it is 2 for C it is 1 D it is 3 so the
right<00:06:22.190> option<00:06:23.000> for<00:06:23.300> the<00:06:23.420> question<00:06:23.810> of<00:06:23.930> 107<00:06:24.920> is

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
right option for the question of 107 is

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.060 
right option for the question of 107 is
1<00:06:25.930> so<00:06:26.930> now<00:06:27.050> coming<00:06:27.320> to<00:06:27.500> the<00:06:27.620> next<00:06:27.740> question

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
1 so now coming to the next question

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.910 
1 so now coming to the next question
under<00:06:28.520> and<00:06:28.730> 8
