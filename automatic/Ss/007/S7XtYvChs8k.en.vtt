earth to give light upon the earth the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.650 
earth to give light upon the earth the
greater<00:00:37.160> light<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.520> rule<00:00:37.699> the<00:00:37.910> day<00:00:38.180> and<00:00:38.570> the

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
divide the light from the darkness even

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.470 
divide the light from the darkness even
more<00:00:48.470> so<00:00:48.769> when<00:00:49.040> he<00:00:49.190> read<00:00:49.430> this<00:00:49.670> Septuagint

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
more so when he read this Septuagint

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.200 
more so when he read this Septuagint
version<00:00:50.540> which<00:00:51.440> suggests<00:00:52.190> there<00:00:52.910> were

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
version which suggests there were

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.389 
version which suggests there were
different<00:00:53.899> versions<00:00:54.410> of<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.710> original<00:00:55.130> text

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
different versions of the original text

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.900 
different versions of the original text
at<00:00:55.640> one<00:00:55.790> time<00:00:56.059> now<00:00:57.020> verse<00:00:57.260> 14<00:00:57.770> is<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.010> creation

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
at one time now verse 14 is the creation

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.479 
at one time now verse 14 is the creation
by<00:00:59.090> divine<00:00:59.450> Fiat<00:00:59.809> where<00:01:00.500> God<00:01:00.710> speaks<00:01:01.250> the

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
by divine Fiat where God speaks the

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.459 
by divine Fiat where God speaks the
lights<00:01:01.730> into<00:01:02.210> their<00:01:02.660> positions<00:01:03.140> in<00:01:03.320> the

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
lights into their positions in the

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.389 
lights into their positions in the
firmament<00:01:03.910> so<00:01:04.910> why<00:01:05.119> then<00:01:05.390> in<00:01:05.750> verse<00:01:06.080> 17<00:01:06.710> is<00:01:07.040> God

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
firmament so why then in verse 17 is God

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.450 
firmament so why then in verse 17 is God
setting<00:01:08.210> them<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.660> place<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.440> why<00:01:10.070> does<00:01:10.310> he

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
setting them in place and why does he

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.810 
setting them in place and why does he
have<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.820> go<00:01:11.000> on<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:11.750> on<00:01:12.229> about<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:13.399> purpose

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
have to go on and on about the purpose

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.270 
have to go on and on about the purpose
of<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.090> lights<00:01:14.390> one<00:01:15.170> verse<00:01:15.440> would<00:01:15.979> have<00:01:16.130> been

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
of the lights one verse would have been

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.029 
of the lights one verse would have been
sufficient<00:01:16.520> here<00:01:17.000> this<00:01:17.869> I<00:01:18.050> hope<00:01:18.289> you<00:01:18.649> will<00:01:18.830> see

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
sufficient here this I hope you will see

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.109 
sufficient here this I hope you will see
is<00:01:19.160> clearly<00:01:19.610> another<00:01:19.940> Sabbath<00:01:20.950> modification

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
is clearly another Sabbath modification

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.790 
is clearly another Sabbath modification
unnecessary<00:01:23.119> for<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.420> divine<00:01:23.780> Fiat<00:01:24.170> but

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
unnecessary for the divine Fiat but

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.309 
unnecessary for the divine Fiat but
necessary<00:01:25.399> if<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:25.729> want<00:01:25.940> your<00:01:26.360> God<00:01:26.660> doing

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
necessary if you want your God doing

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.980 
necessary if you want your God doing
some<00:01:27.590> work<00:01:27.830> checking<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.330> work<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.690> good

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
some work checking that the work is good

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.559 
some work checking that the work is good
and<00:01:30.200> then<00:01:30.649> resting<00:01:31.160> once<00:01:31.429> it<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:31.970> complete

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:32.569 
and then resting once it is complete

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.809 
and then resting once it is complete
there<00:01:33.319> are<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.500> couple<00:01:33.709> of<00:01:33.890> suggestions<00:01:34.310> for

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
there are a couple of suggestions for

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.029 
there are a couple of suggestions for
why<00:01:34.970> these<00:01:35.240> verses<00:01:35.899> appear<00:01:36.319> to<00:01:36.679> be<00:01:36.800> so

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
why these verses appear to be so

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.910 
why these verses appear to be so
tortured<00:01:37.610> I<00:01:37.759> hope<00:01:38.330> I<00:01:38.450> don't<00:01:38.569> need<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.929> say<00:01:39.110> but

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
tortured I hope I don't need to say but

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.710 
tortured I hope I don't need to say but
I'm<00:01:40.039> about<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.429> anyway<00:01:40.759> that<00:01:41.420> primitive

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
I'm about to anyway that primitive

I'm about to anyway that primitive
people<00:01:42.349> was<00:01:42.470> venerated<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.280> Sun<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.789> Moon

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
people was venerated the Sun and Moon

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.529 
people was venerated the Sun and Moon
the<00:01:44.660> sun<00:01:44.929> provided<00:01:45.590> obvious<00:01:46.190> heat<00:01:46.459> its<00:01:47.000> yearly

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
the sun provided obvious heat its yearly

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.630 
the sun provided obvious heat its yearly
cycle<00:01:48.080> could<00:01:48.319> be<00:01:48.500> measured<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.069> the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
moon cycle provided a way of measuring

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.710 
moon cycle provided a way of measuring
shorter<00:01:55.039> periods<00:01:55.399> of<00:01:55.520> time<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:56.270> word<00:01:56.420> month

light created on day one was simply a

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.550 
light created on day one was simply a

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.570 
begs the question if these lights are
simply<00:04:43.050> providing<00:04:43.169> exactly<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:44.130> same

function with respect to the earth as

the light created on day one did why not

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.629 
the light created on day one did why not

light was figurative suggesting that

light was figurative suggesting that

separating light from darkness was

separating light from darkness was
actually<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.110> act<00:04:58.259> of<00:04:58.439> separating<00:04:59.069> order

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
actually the act of separating order

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.850

what<00:06:01.469> signs<00:06:01.949> the<00:06:02.879> apologist<00:06:03.449> will<00:06:03.629> tell<00:06:03.960> you

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
what signs the apologist will tell you

now for what sign did God place all
those<00:07:05.809> lights<00:07:06.169> in<00:07:06.439> the<00:07:06.529> firmament<00:07:06.979> the<00:07:07.519> ones

we knew nothing about until science put

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:12.339 
we knew nothing about until science put
a<00:07:09.679> telescope<00:07:10.249> into<00:07:10.459> space<00:07:10.779> perhaps<00:07:11.779> then<00:07:12.110> the

a telescope into space perhaps then the

a telescope into space perhaps then the
