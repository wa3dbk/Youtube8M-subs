then<00:01:35.190> yes<00:01:35.610> third<00:01:36.480> bar<00:01:36.920> now<00:01:37.920> we'll<00:01:38.190> be<00:01:38.280> back<00:01:38.430> in

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
then yes third bar now we'll be back in

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.070 
then yes third bar now we'll be back in
a<00:01:38.640> few<00:01:38.760> minutes<00:01:41.450> alright<00:01:42.450> we're<00:01:42.630> seeing<00:01:42.960> if

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
a few minutes alright we're seeing if

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.900 
a few minutes alright we're seeing if
the<00:01:43.200> site<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.410> updated<00:01:43.680> yet<00:01:45.020> yeah<00:01:46.700> Jesus<00:01:47.700> yes

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
the site is updated yet yeah Jesus yes

00:01:47.910 --> 00:02:10.070 
the site is updated yet yeah Jesus yes
it<00:01:48.090> has<00:01:48.380> scary<00:02:05.240> that's<00:02:06.240> scary<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.840> hell<00:02:09.080> entry

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080

12 engine capacity increases and the
process<00:02:13.140> continues<00:02:14.090> 1157<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.450> installations

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
process continues 1157 so installations

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.860
