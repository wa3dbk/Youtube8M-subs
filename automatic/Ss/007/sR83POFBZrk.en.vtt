00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.839
 I decided I to finish the stove in oil 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.470
 here I will cut to make her 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:22.560
 revealed so will sink here in 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:26.099
 and always said no u cooked over here 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.590
 There should be a jumper idea, but 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.050
 because i didn't say here too 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.610
 I will cut and since there drives can be seen with 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.200
 drive he licked the median on 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.239
 interferes remove the middle from the disks and here 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:49.469
 say jumper how to gas 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.780
 who came from the bottom would be from the bottom tank 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.140
 here they lingered and burned here 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:03.000
 something must be warm let's see now 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:06.060
 I'll open it up the back 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.710
 what is the middle here is not 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.590
 cut discs now I will try 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.340
 cut out 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.950
 because of this , too, burned badly 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.950
 will it be already separate so that it would be 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.359
 to clean 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.630
 I'll cut the upper part now and see 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.630
 what is there 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:36.890
 whether it cut out a menu which is not cut out 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.350
 this is so much working out it turns out but 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.299
 just did not burn out and was going there 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:48.920
 on top of 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:56.840
 that the top was burned out so that de la 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:02:01.640
 chasse top cut I'll show well 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.929
 there has not yet cut the cut tactics that 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:11.930
 she doesn't connect arrange water and 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:14.620
 easy then i will do carpenters 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.620
 getting so scary 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:25.370
 so we cut the other half 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:29.750
 it turns out there is no partition there 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:42.239

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:47.660

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.810
 in the picture, well, therefore 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.610
 we personally have height 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:13.110
 heat exchanger 100 width 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:18.570
 352 and the height of this slat is the width of this 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:22.670
 strips 70 until we get 33 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:28.280
 cm by 3 centimeters should be between 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.280
 the strap and bottom of the heat exchanger 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:36.080
 but I am now 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:39.480

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.970
 width to be three centimeters so as 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:47.150
