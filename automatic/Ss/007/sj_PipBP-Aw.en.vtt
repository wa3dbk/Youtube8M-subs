00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.960
 well in this case we are going to make a 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.140
 difference of two equal powers 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.419
 odd what is at 5 minus 1 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.119
 a power difference corresponds 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.750
 equal and odd in this expression by the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.230
 residue theorem can be divided 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.230
 between 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.750
 at least one 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.590
 and its result is exact 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:53.280
 that is to say at 5 you can go by train 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.650
 at five minus one you can go between 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.430
 at least one 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:06.159
 in general the case that tells us that 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:08.370
 to the n - ba the n 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.910
 cp divides 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.910
 x 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.040
 - come 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.420
 being n 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.420
 odd number 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.960
 so 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.530
 at 5 minus 1 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:38.500
 it divides 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.500
 for at least 1 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.430
 then as a result you have 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:59.400
 to 4 more to three more to two more 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.400
 + 1 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.210
 we have the factorization 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.010
 in this result 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.010
 that multiplied by the divisor 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.530
 is obtained 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:23.100
 the factorization of a to the five minus 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.210
 one 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.210
 what follows you 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.019
 at least one 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:42.440
 x 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:44.840
 to four more to three more to 2 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.270
 plus 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.230
 + 1 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.230
 It does not matter 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:59.800
 at five minus one 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.800
 this would be the factorization 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.110
 and you
