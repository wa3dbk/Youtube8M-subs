somebody back to a really high quality
of<00:01:17.909> life<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.720> activity<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.640> problem

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
of life and and activity the the problem

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.850 
of life and and activity the the problem
is<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.240> put<00:01:21.420> these<00:01:21.600> devices<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.439> younger

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
is when you put these devices in younger

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.310 
is when you put these devices in younger
patients<00:01:23.420> sometimes<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.720> don't<00:01:24.840> stand<00:01:25.110> up

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
patients sometimes they don't stand up

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.899 
patients sometimes they don't stand up
to<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> test<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> time<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.580> similar<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
to the test of time it's it's similar to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.910 
to the test of time it's it's similar to
to<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> car<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:27.930> you're<00:01:28.020> gonna<00:01:28.140> put<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.590> lot<00:01:28.770> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
to a car if you're gonna put a lot of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560 
to a car if you're gonna put a lot of
miles<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.670> lot<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> hard<00:01:30.150> miles<00:01:30.329> on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
miles on it and a lot of hard miles on

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
miles on it and a lot of hard miles on
it<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.560> some<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> these<00:01:31.829> younger

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
it like you know some of these younger

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
exact so that that hip replacement is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.109 
exact so that that hip replacement is
not<00:01:42.630> gonna<00:01:42.780> last<00:01:43.079> her<00:01:43.290> until<00:01:43.619> she's<00:01:43.799> 75<00:01:44.340> it

not gonna last her until she's 75 it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.480 
not gonna last her until she's 75 it
possibly<00:01:45.840> not<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.200> bojack's<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.220> everybody

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
possibly not it's bojack's and everybody

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.830 
possibly not it's bojack's and everybody
knows<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> story<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.970> bo<00:01:48.149> Jackson<00:01:48.570> he<00:01:48.689> had<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
knows the story of bo Jackson he had a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.539 
knows the story of bo Jackson he had a
hip<00:01:49.079> replacement<00:01:49.619> at<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.740> very<00:01:49.920> young<00:01:50.070> age<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
hip replacement at a very young age and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.639 
hip replacement at a very young age and
has<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> think<00:01:51.630> he<00:01:51.720> may<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.930> now<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.320> his<00:01:52.470> third

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
has I think he may be now on his third

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.740 
has I think he may be now on his third
hip<00:01:52.770> replacement<00:01:53.340> Yeah<00:01:53.759> right<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
hip replacement Yeah right so the the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
hip replacement Yeah right so the the
idea<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.710> hip<00:01:55.920> resurfacing<00:01:56.070> which<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
idea of the hip resurfacing which is a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.530 
idea of the hip resurfacing which is a
newer<00:01:58.770> type<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.159> procedure<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.360> try<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
newer type of procedure is to try to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.450 
newer type of procedure is to try to
save<00:02:00.810> some<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.350> bone<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.890> proximal

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
save some of the bone of the proximal

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.510 
save some of the bone of the proximal
femur<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.990> thigh<00:02:04.140> bone<00:02:04.380> instead<00:02:05.369> of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
femur of the the thigh bone instead of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.570 
femur of the the thigh bone instead of
removing<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.210> femoral<00:02:06.869> head<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.580> putting

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
removing the femoral head and putting

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.210 
removing the femoral head and putting
the<00:02:08.700> stem<00:02:08.910> down<00:02:09.050> instead<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.229> place<00:02:10.470> you

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the stem down instead you place you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.190 
the stem down instead you place you
reshape<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.940> surface<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
reshape the surface of the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.770 
reshape the surface of the
surface<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.739> joint<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.209> place<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.239> new

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
surface of the joint and place a new

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.020 
surface of the joint and place a new
ball<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.230> top<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.190> then<00:02:17.340> also<00:02:17.670> put

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
ball on top of that and then also put

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.570 
ball on top of that and then also put
place<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.480> new<00:02:18.599> socket<00:02:18.930> into<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.800> pelvis<00:02:20.160> so

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
place the new socket into the pelvis so

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.339 
place the new socket into the pelvis so
there's<00:02:20.760> fewer<00:02:21.000> parts<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.599> as<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.170> see

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
there's fewer parts and as we can see

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.790 
there's fewer parts and as we can see
here<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.190> leave<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:24.030> lot<00:02:24.269> more<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.810> organic

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
here you leave a lot more of the organic

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.339 
here you leave a lot more of the organic
structure<00:02:26.090> precisely<00:02:27.090> okay

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
structure precisely okay

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.199 
structure precisely okay
they're<00:02:28.830> not<00:02:28.980> doing<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.430> though<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:29.970> over

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209

not exactly the the major benefit of the
resurfacing<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.650> save<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.920> bone<00:03:17.190> of

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
resurfacing is that you save the bone of

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
resurfacing is that you save the bone of
the<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.940> femur<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:20.670> bone<00:03:20.850> has<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.299> be

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
the of the femur the the bone has to be

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.569 
the of the femur the the bone has to be
a<00:03:21.450> good<00:03:21.810> quality<00:03:22.200> bone<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:23.069> bone<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.400> weak

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
a good quality bone if the bone is weak

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.090 
a good quality bone if the bone is weak
in<00:03:23.910> any<00:03:24.090> way<00:03:24.269> from<00:03:24.750> osteoporosis<00:03:25.590> for

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
in any way from osteoporosis for

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.000 
in any way from osteoporosis for
instance<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.870> weakened<00:03:28.350> bone<00:03:28.530> may<00:03:28.799> not

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
instance the weakened bone may not

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.520 
instance the weakened bone may not
support<00:03:29.459> this<00:03:29.639> prosthesis<00:03:29.910> very<00:03:30.540> well<00:03:30.720> in

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
support this prosthesis very well in

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.319 
support this prosthesis very well in
which<00:03:31.709> case<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.980> total<00:03:32.670> hip<00:03:32.760> replacement<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.239> I

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
which case a total hip replacement as I

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.590 
which case a total hip replacement as I
said<00:03:33.540> before<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:34.019> an<00:03:34.170> excellent<00:03:34.440> procedure

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
said before is an excellent procedure

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.030 
said before is an excellent procedure
that's<00:03:36.600> still<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> great<00:03:37.049> procedure<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.889> we

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
that's still a great procedure so we

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.650 
that's still a great procedure so we
don't<00:03:38.340> want<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.519> mislead<00:03:38.819> people<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.420> but

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
don't want to mislead people on that but

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.220 
don't want to mislead people on that but
now<00:03:40.109> so<00:03:40.739> this<00:03:40.920> one<00:03:41.100> would<00:03:41.579> last<00:03:41.850> longer<00:03:42.269> the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
now so this one would last longer the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.920 
now so this one would last longer the
the<00:03:43.739> longevity<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:44.549> how<00:03:45.150> long<00:03:45.359> each<00:03:45.569> one<00:03:45.840> of

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
the longevity of how long each one of

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.599 
the longevity of how long each one of
these<00:03:46.019> may<00:03:46.230> last<00:03:46.530> hasn't<00:03:47.370> been<00:03:47.459> established

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
these may last hasn't been established

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.789 
these may last hasn't been established
as<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.389> which<00:03:48.569> one<00:03:48.810> may<00:03:48.989> be<00:03:49.049> superior<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
as to which one may be superior to the

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.830 
as to which one may be superior to the
other<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.819> primary<00:03:51.180> benefit<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.750> you're

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
other the primary benefit is that you're

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.530 
other the primary benefit is that you're
saving<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.230> bone<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.680> if<00:03:52.950> if<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.940> total<00:03:54.299> hip

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
saving the bone so if if the total hip

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.259 
saving the bone so if if the total hip
replacement<00:03:55.049> fails<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:56.160> start<00:03:56.849> off<00:03:57.000> with

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
replacement fails you start off with

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.449 
replacement fails you start off with
this<00:03:57.870> stem<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.620> femur<00:03:58.829> if<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.160> fails

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
this stem and the femur if this fails

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.539 
this stem and the femur if this fails
then<00:04:00.650> frequently<00:04:01.650> you<00:04:01.829> cut<00:04:01.980> off<00:04:02.069> your<00:04:02.099> bone

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
then frequently you cut off your bone

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.729 
then frequently you cut off your bone
marrow<00:04:02.940> stem<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.690> have<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.959> go<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.139> really

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
marrow stem you have to go to really

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.979 
marrow stem you have to go to really
large<00:04:04.980> stones<00:04:05.280> such<00:04:05.549> as<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:05.880> which<00:04:06.329> is<00:04:06.630> what

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
large stones such as this which is what

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.379 
large stones such as this which is what
you<00:04:07.079> try<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.319> avoid<00:04:07.650> if<00:04:07.889> you<00:04:07.980> start<00:04:08.250> by<00:04:08.459> saving

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
you try to avoid if you start by saving

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.599 
you try to avoid if you start by saving
bone<00:04:09.709> starting<00:04:10.709> with<00:04:10.829> a<00:04:10.859> smaller<00:04:11.220> procedure

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
bone starting with a smaller procedure

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.089 
bone starting with a smaller procedure
with<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.819> smaller<00:04:12.269> prosthesis<00:04:12.690> if<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.829> fails

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
with a smaller prosthesis if that fails

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.009 
with a smaller prosthesis if that fails
you<00:04:14.250> can<00:04:14.370> go<00:04:14.519> to<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.730> just<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.150> primary<00:04:15.540> total<00:04:15.840> hip

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
you can go to a just a primary total hip

you can go to a just a primary total hip
okay<00:04:16.620> well<00:04:16.799> it's<00:04:16.979> absolutely<00:04:17.489> fascinating
