00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
second as I do on here place there I'm

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.560 
second as I do on here place there I'm
sure<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> lot<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.090> thinking<00:01:15.540> that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
sure a lot of you of you thinking that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.950 
sure a lot of you of you thinking that
20<00:01:16.439> frames<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.220> second<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.700> pretty<00:01:17.729> dire<00:01:19.610> but

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
20 frames a second is pretty dire but

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
20 frames a second is pretty dire but
overall<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.890> still<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.549> really

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
overall it's still really really

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.840 
overall it's still really really
playable<00:01:25.009> obviously<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.130> guess<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.490> bans<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
playable obviously I guess that bans the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.330 
playable obviously I guess that bans the
likes<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.240> 15<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:28.710> good<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:31.189> I've<00:01:32.189> been

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.820 
MacBook Air when you and could gave me a
laptop<00:02:22.320> not<00:02:23.320> why<00:02:23.500> put<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.800> video<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.160> there

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.070 

also<00:02:29.830> I'm<00:02:29.920> sure<00:02:30.160> people<00:02:30.430> with<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:31.269> know<00:02:31.870> much

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
also I'm sure people with you know much

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.979 
also I'm sure people with you know much
13-inch<00:02:32.830> MacBook<00:02:33.010> Pro<00:02:33.400> with<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.670> same

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
13-inch MacBook Pro with the same

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.080 
13-inch MacBook Pro with the same
graphics<00:02:34.989> card<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.700> going<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> perform

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
graphics card is going to perform

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.630 
graphics card is going to perform
similarly<00:02:38.220> obviously<00:02:39.220> it's<00:02:39.310> got<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> better

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
similarly obviously it's got a better

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.699 
similarly obviously it's got a better
processor<00:02:40.269> but<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.480> think<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> graphics<00:02:41.470> card

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
processor but I think the graphics card

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:54.380 
processor but I think the graphics card
and<00:02:41.800> stone<00:02:41.950> already<00:02:42.160> hold<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.670> up

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.540 

like<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.080> set<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.470> still<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.220> really

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
like the set it's still really really

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.520 
like the set it's still really really
playable<00:02:56.970> even<00:02:57.390> at<00:02:57.510> these<00:02:58.050> sort<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.320> frame

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
playable even at these sort of frame

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.480 
playable even at these sort of frame
rates<00:02:58.770> again<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.130> know<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.490> not<00:03:01.460> what<00:03:02.460> you

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
rates again I know it's not what you

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.010 
rates again I know it's not what you
already<00:03:02.790> want<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.150> want<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.390> hard<00:03:03.570> frames<00:03:03.840> per

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
already want you want a hard frames per

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.650 
already want you want a hard frames per
second<00:03:04.380> if<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.590> sort<00:03:05.070> of<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.250> I'll<00:03:05.910> call<00:03:06.270> game<00:03:06.480> a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
second if you sort of a I'll call game a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:31.610 
second if you sort of a I'll call game a
but<00:03:09.830> it's<00:03:10.830> still<00:03:11.160> it's<00:03:11.850> still<00:03:11.970> playable

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.000 

right<00:03:32.620> down<00:03:32.800> there<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:38.200> I<00:03:38.230> said<00:03:38.530> before<00:03:38.620> it's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
right down there so I said before it's

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.720 
right down there so I said before it's
the<00:03:39.210> 1.7<00:03:40.210> gigahertz<00:03:40.420> processor<00:03:41.520> Ivy<00:03:42.520> Bridge

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
the 1.7 gigahertz processor Ivy Bridge

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.190 
the 1.7 gigahertz processor Ivy Bridge
by<00:03:43.090> five<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:44.380> does<00:03:44.970> have<00:03:45.970> turbo<00:03:46.450> boost<00:03:46.900> on<00:03:47.080> I

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
by five it does have turbo boost on I

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.350 
by five it does have turbo boost on I
believe<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.770> boost<00:03:48.070> up<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.880> think<00:03:49.210> it's

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
believe that boost up to I think it's

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.750 
believe that boost up to I think it's
about<00:03:49.510> two<00:03:49.750> point<00:03:50.020> three<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:53.430> think<00:03:54.430> when<00:03:54.520> I<00:03:54.550> did

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
about two point three I think when I did

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.680 
about two point three I think when I did
benchmarking<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:55.510> runs<00:03:55.750> at<00:03:55.990> about<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.380> same

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
benchmarking it runs at about the same

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.660 
benchmarking it runs at about the same
speed<00:03:58.690> processor<00:03:59.410> wise<00:03:59.590> as<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:01.650> previous

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
speed processor wise as the previous

13-inch<00:04:03.670> MacBook<00:04:04.210> Pro<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:05.620> had<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.580> one<00:04:06.760> with

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
13-inch MacBook Pro I had the one with

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.930 
13-inch MacBook Pro I had the one with
2.3<00:04:08.530> gigahertz<00:04:08.560> processor<00:04:09.010> on<00:04:09.520> it<00:04:09.550> before<00:04:09.760> it

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
2.3 gigahertz processor on it before it

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.850 
2.3 gigahertz processor on it before it
runs<00:04:10.240> about<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.630> same<00:04:10.900> processor<00:04:11.440> wise<00:04:11.680> as

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
runs about the same processor wise as

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.860 
runs about the same processor wise as
that<00:04:12.040> obviously<00:04:12.910> it's<00:04:13.030> got<00:04:13.150> better<00:04:13.300> graphics

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
that obviously it's got better graphics

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.690 
that obviously it's got better graphics
and<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.320> SSD<00:04:14.770> I<00:04:14.800> think<00:04:15.100> really<00:04:15.310> helps<00:04:15.610> with

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
and the SSD I think really helps with

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.860 
and the SSD I think really helps with
gameplay<00:04:16.180> as<00:04:16.390> well<00:04:19.080> so<00:04:20.080> yeah<00:04:21.420> so<00:04:22.420> extra

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
gameplay as well so yeah so extra

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.260 
gameplay as well so yeah so extra
questions<00:04:23.410> or<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.650> fire<00:04:23.890> just<00:04:24.190> post<00:04:24.400> them<00:04:24.640> in

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
questions or a fire just post them in

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.630 
questions or a fire just post them in
the<00:04:25.600> comments<00:04:26.170> and<00:04:26.500> I'll<00:04:26.890> try<00:04:26.920> to<00:04:27.160> answer<00:04:27.250> if<00:04:27.520> I

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
the comments and I'll try to answer if I

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.300 
the comments and I'll try to answer if I
can<00:04:30.300> okay
