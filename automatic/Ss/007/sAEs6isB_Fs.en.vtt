00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
how you stir is to keep the cup of the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.550 
how you stir is to keep the cup of the
spoon<00:02:45.040> facing<00:02:46.040> into<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.700> interior<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.630> the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
spoon facing into the interior of the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.740 
spoon facing into the interior of the
mixing<00:02:48.980> glass<00:02:49.160> while<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.030> outside<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
mixing glass while the outside of the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.170 
mixing glass while the outside of the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
spoon is scraping the interior of the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.199 
spoon is scraping the interior of the
glass<00:02:53.390> here<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.410> want<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.739> stir<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.280> 30<00:02:55.700> to
