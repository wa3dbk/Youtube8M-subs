gosh Millennials have such a huge sense
of<00:00:37.469> entitlement<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.190> then<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.370> took<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.700> know

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
of entitlement but then I took you know

of entitlement but then I took you know
four<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> took<00:00:39.420> another<00:00:39.750> step<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> said

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
four then I took another step and I said

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.380 
four then I took another step and I said
wait<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> second<00:00:41.010> six<00:00:41.670> percent<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
wait a second six percent of the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.299 
wait a second six percent of the
students<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.899> class<00:00:42.960> got<00:00:43.410> an<00:00:43.559> A<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
students in this class got an A and the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.729 
students in this class got an A and the
historic<00:00:45.120> average<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.870> thirty<00:00:46.170> three<00:00:46.530> point

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
historic average is thirty three point

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
historic average is thirty three point
two<00:00:46.980> percent<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.120> calculated

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
two percent this is what they calculated

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
two percent this is what they calculated
based<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.170> 10<00:00:49.410> classes<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> previous

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
based on 10 classes for the previous

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.250 
based on 10 classes for the previous
year<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.270> look<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.960> start<00:00:52.199> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
year so if you look at that you start to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.290 
year so if you look at that you start to
think<00:00:52.410> hmm<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> students<00:00:54.180> aren't

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
think hmm is it that the students aren't

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.240 
think hmm is it that the students aren't
performing<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.899> well<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.530> or<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> it

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
performing as well or is this or is it

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.029 
performing as well or is this or is it
that<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.030> measure<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.289> some<00:00:58.500> way<00:00:58.649> flawed

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
that the measure is in some way flawed

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.549 
that the measure is in some way flawed
right<00:00:59.789> certain<00:01:00.420> professors<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.260> tough

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
right certain professors can be tough

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.039 
right certain professors can be tough
graders<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.120> real<00:01:03.390> real

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
graders like you know can be real real

graders like you know can be real real
hardcore<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:05.189> possible<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.090> one

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
hardcore it's possible that it's one

lowers at 6% with historically it's been
15%<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.640> expect<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> next<00:01:15.540> class

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
15% I expect that for the next class

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.899 
15% I expect that for the next class
it'll<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.259> 50%<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.159> arts<00:01:17.340> my<00:01:17.520> students

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it'll be 50% of the arts my students

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.330 
it'll be 50% of the arts my students
getting<00:01:18.180> a's<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.740> seems<00:01:20.009> pretty

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
getting a's and that that seems pretty

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.420 
getting a's and that that seems pretty
reasonable<00:01:20.610> until<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.720> consider<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.979> for

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
reasonable until you consider that for

insane<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.990> consider<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:02.189> is

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
insane when you consider that this is

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.100 
insane when you consider that this is
supposed<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.640> sort<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> measure<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.450> your

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110

supposed to sort of be a measure of your
performance<00:02:04.740> right<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.460> argue<00:02:05.670> well

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
performance right and you can argue well

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.880 
performance right and you can argue well
if<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.780> meet<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> certain<00:02:07.259> standard<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
if you meet a certain standard and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.490 
if you meet a certain standard and
you're<00:02:07.979> performing<00:02:08.459> excellently<00:02:09.209> then<00:02:09.599> you

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you're performing excellently then you

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.750 
you're performing excellently then you
should<00:02:10.709> get<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.430> doesn't<00:02:11.640> matter

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
should get the a and it doesn't matter

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.470 
should get the a and it doesn't matter
it<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.120> goal

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
it the goal

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.820 
it the goal
should<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.170> professors<00:02:13.650> are<00:02:13.770> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
should be that the professors are so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.010 
should be that the professors are so
amazing<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:15.030> every<00:02:15.360> single<00:02:15.660> person<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:15.959> the

amazing that every single person in the
class<00:02:16.200> gets<00:02:16.379> an<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> because<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:16.920> master<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
class gets an a because they master the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.309 
class gets an a because they master the
material<00:02:17.459> but<00:02:18.000> then<00:02:18.150> there's<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> other<00:02:18.480> food

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
material but then there's the other food

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.140 
material but then there's the other food
you<00:02:19.560> know<00:02:19.680> there's<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> other<00:02:20.280> side<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
you know there's the other side of the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.430 
you know there's the other side of the
coin<00:02:21.300> or<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.629> equation<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.050> says<00:02:22.110> no

coin or the equation that says no

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.800 
coin or the equation that says no
actually<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.209> meant<00:02:24.599> these

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
actually this is this is meant these

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.910 
actually this is this is meant these
grades<00:02:25.110> are<00:02:25.260> meant<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.440> give<00:02:25.620> us<00:02:25.739> some

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
grades are meant to give us some

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.420 
grades are meant to give us some
relative<00:02:26.690> performance<00:02:28.069> indication<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.250> how

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
relative performance indication so how

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.009 
relative performance indication so how
are<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.910> any<00:02:30.209> better<00:02:30.390> from<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.690> student

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
are you any better from the student

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.800 
are you any better from the student
there<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:32.250> didn't<00:02:32.670> do<00:02:32.849> all<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.420> reading<00:02:33.660> or

person did for that class ultimately the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.370 
person did for that class ultimately the
point<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.790> learn<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.019> know<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.230> some

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
point is to learn and you know and some

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.839 
point is to learn and you know and some
professors<00:02:40.709> feel<00:02:41.069> like<00:02:41.280> if<00:02:41.430> they<00:02:41.549> make<00:02:41.730> it

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
professors feel like if they make it

extremely hard give you a lot of work
you're<00:02:44.459> gonna<00:02:44.519> learn<00:02:44.849> more<00:02:44.880> even<00:02:45.450> though<00:02:45.569> your

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
you're gonna learn more even though your

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.170 
you're gonna learn more even though your
grade<00:02:45.989> might<00:02:46.260> suffer<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:47.489> know<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:48.090> is

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
grade might suffer you know this is

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.449 
grade might suffer you know this is
where<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.360> 4.0<00:02:48.930> comes<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.349> die<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.190> might

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
where the 4.0 comes to die but you might

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.100 
where the 4.0 comes to die but you might
learn<00:02:50.730> more<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.510> have<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.870> lot<00:02:52.079> more

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
learn more and have to do a lot more

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.890 
learn more and have to do a lot more
work<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:52.769> what<00:02:53.549> does<00:02:53.760> having<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.299> lesser<00:02:54.690> grade

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
work so what does having a lesser grade

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.740 
work so what does having a lesser grade
how<00:02:55.739> does<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:55.950> affect<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.579> student<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.329> I<00:02:57.569> mean

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
how does that affect a student it I mean

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.089 
how does that affect a student it I mean
it<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:57.989> affect<00:02:58.260> him<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.440> many<00:02:58.590> ways<00:02:58.769> so<00:02:58.920> some

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
it can affect him in many ways so some

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.770 
it can affect him in many ways so some
students<00:02:59.430> are<00:02:59.610> on<00:02:59.849> scholarships<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.690> they

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
students are on scholarships and if they

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.240 
students are on scholarships and if they
don't<00:03:00.930> keep<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.230> certain<00:03:01.530> grade<00:03:01.680> point<00:03:01.890> average

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
don't keep a certain grade point average

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.009 
don't keep a certain grade point average
then<00:03:02.489> they<00:03:02.640> lose<00:03:02.819> their<00:03:03.030> scholarship<00:03:03.599> that's

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
then they lose their scholarship that's

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.479 
then they lose their scholarship that's
only<00:03:04.319> can<00:03:04.440> affect<00:03:04.739> them<00:03:04.860> another<00:03:05.130> way<00:03:05.340> in

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
only can affect them another way in

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.770 
only can affect them another way in
which<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.180> affect<00:03:06.480> him<00:03:06.569> is<00:03:06.660> that

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
which I can it can affect him is that

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.059 
which I can it can affect him is that
