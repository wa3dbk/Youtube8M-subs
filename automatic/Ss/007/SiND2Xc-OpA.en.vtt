but<00:04:47.229> that<00:04:47.740> would<00:04:47.889> mean<00:04:48.070> if<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.580> started<00:04:48.940> it

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
but that would mean if I started it

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.330 
but that would mean if I started it
tomorrow<00:04:49.419> for<00:04:49.750> example<00:04:50.199> I<00:04:50.380> might<00:04:50.560> be<00:04:50.949> able<00:04:51.039> to

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
tomorrow for example I might be able to

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.310
