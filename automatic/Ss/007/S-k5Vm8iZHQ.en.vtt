00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
hair my hair does not feel crunchy or

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.380 
hair my hair does not feel crunchy or
dirty<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:19.290> my<00:03:19.620> hands<00:03:19.890> were<00:03:20.040> kind<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.000> sticky

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
dirty but my hands were kind of sticky

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.100 
dirty but my hands were kind of sticky
afterwards<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:21.960> I<00:03:21.990> had<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.230> wash<00:03:22.410> them<00:03:22.770> so<00:03:23.340> I

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
afterwards and I had to wash them so I

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.290 
afterwards and I had to wash them so I
this<00:03:25.110> product<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.710> think<00:03:25.950> was<00:03:26.160> like<00:03:26.340> nine

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
this product I think was like nine

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.100 
this product I think was like nine
dollars<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.110> that's<00:03:28.920> kind<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.370> offensive

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
dollars so that's kind of offensive

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.210 
dollars so that's kind of offensive
least<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.200> think<00:03:31.260> that's<00:03:31.560> not<00:03:31.650> much<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.890> cost

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
least I think that's not much it cost

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:43.350 
least I think that's not much it cost
mmm<00:03:33.140> would<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.170> repurchase<00:03:34.500> this<00:03:35.390> um<00:03:37.490> possibly
