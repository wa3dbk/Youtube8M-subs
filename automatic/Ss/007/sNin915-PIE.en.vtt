00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.710
 good morning friends of this 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.270
 our channel the comfort kitchen in 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.250
 youtube today we have three 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.650
 apples at home 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.920
 from apples and corn in the remember that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.230
 the cornstarch is a fine flour of corn and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.570
 for this and with it I will prepare a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 apple backpack mass remember that I said 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.190
 mend morra de quince because then 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.730
 I have the 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.980
 the apples are prepared in red dough 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.670
 for this I need clove here 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.310
 I have clove of milled smell I need 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.520
 cinnamon 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.520
 but I'll use a thick cinnamon stick 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.000
 ground cinnamon to enhance the flavor a 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.560
 little more than half a glass of sugar 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.840
 I'm going to boil the water with the 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.390
 cinnamon and in the ground clove is 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.730
 the first thing we're going to do is wash and 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.800
 cut the apple with shell and lathe 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.980
 with shell and everything 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.470
 sweeten the water when it is sweet and the 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.860
 apple is cooked a spoonful of 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.120
 cornstarch or two dissolved in water will give the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.320
 thickness that we want 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.320
 We have boiled the water 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.119
 I add ground cinnamon 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.000
 which will disappear the branch 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.250
 whole cinnamon 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.250
 and the ground clove 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.280
 to taste I add it generously 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.380
 because this gives it flavor 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.250
 to the desserts are adding a little 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.250
 more than chain 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.350
 clean wood 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.140
 I stir and while when I start 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.560
 boil I'm chopping the apple that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.560
 previously 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.569
 here I have the three washing machines 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.319
 made a cut here a cut here a 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.250
 cut here and a cut here 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.510
 to make it easier 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.850
 to take the center and stay with 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.850
 the pieces that I want from the mother 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.180
 this center 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.050
 while I keep peeling and cutting 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.490
 sorry, cutting the apple 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.490
 add the sugar to the water 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.110
 so that it goes sweetening 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.600
 water with cinnamon and cloves 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.340
 ground and the sugar already started to boil and 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.240
 I have the apples already peeled 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.110
 I cut them in this way 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.110
 like ears 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.480
 We're going over there 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.340
 I already have the apple 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.490
 of the cuts I made and the water and 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.260
 there is the wind 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.220
 I'm going to add the apple 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.220
 if in your heart 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.290
 that is 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.960
 three sliced ​​apples 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.100
 This style or Julian or language 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.100
 or ears like 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.850
 to touch all the apple that cook 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.210
 when cooked 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.210
 we are going to add the cornstarch diluted in 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.629
 this will be a matter of five minutes the 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.210
 water is already sweet the water is 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.640
 coloradita 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.930
 then with the cornstarch 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.930
 I'm going to take a teaspoon 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.970
 the teaspoons that was a spoon 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.970
 tureen 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.830
 to clear 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.990
 explaining 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.300
 this is what will give the consistency 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.720
 if we had not used cloves 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.030
 ground then it would be white 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.670
 the water where the apple is cooking 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.270
 and our sweet mazamorra would be 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.880
 White 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.650
 I have already diluted the equivalent 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.169
 will listen to cornstarch in cold water 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.580
 I checked in sweet I checked that 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.379
 the apple is cooked 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.930
 that does not burst because it has the 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.930
 shell super well it's important to say it 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.690
 that does not break better said because it has 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.690
 the edge in the shell 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.699
 just by letting him add the 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.239
 diluted cornstarch I'm starting to 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.239
 Express oneself 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.210
 but as it goes by 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.089
 and the cornstarch is even cooked with 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:22.089
 the diluted water 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.090
 on a slow fire you can see that I have lowered it 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.600
 the dust no no 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:33.210
 and the best 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.720
 let's do about 5 more minutes 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.540
 then we turned off and we told them that 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.750
 This color is the color of the nail 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.520
 of milled smell 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:50.689
 if I put the whole nail 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:54.339
 we would get transparent white 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:54.339
 how does this consider apple 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:03.669
 sweet or apple pudding 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:06.029
 for the channel the kitchen of joselo in the 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.029
 Youtube 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.920
 with the help of cornstarch 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.920
 how is it thinking more 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.920
 as they go boiling 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.330
 even les boards slower 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.220
 we'll see each other with the slurry here we have 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:34.480
 our most love apple or sweet of 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.340
 apple with cornstarch 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.350
 while it is cooling down here I am going to 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:42.260
 separate some portion 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:45.280
 in the gdp that will serve so that both 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.280
 go cool 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.900
 well here our portion of masa morro 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.650
 sweet apple to which I will add 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.650
 ground cinnamon 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:06.849
 and with that we would be finishing 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.849
 this video today 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.430

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.110

 of this sweet another of 11 more with apple 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.560
 and we're also going to add have the 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:27.419
 bite 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.419
 I said everything is having flavor 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.600
