00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.259
 ordinary cheerful 

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:03.550
 child 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.500
 but how comfortable he is here 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.029
 let's set up our first experiment 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.739
 replace the temperature at different levels 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:11.089
 premises 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.849
 how we see the beginning of our life our children 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.509
 spend in the cold 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.609
 which is not best reflected in their 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.519
 health 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.300
 This is especially true with us in 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.800
 Siberia because the winter temperature drops 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.569
 and periodically problems with heating 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.789
 lead to freezing of the population 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.259
 need to stoke better say you or 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.750
 put a heater 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.280
 check if this is true 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.260
 take another look at our results 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.640
 first experiment 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.980
 and all this only happens because 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.979
 central heating and prices 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.109
 any oil coolers arranged 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.939
 on one principle 

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.210
 convective exchange 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.020
 that is, the heated air circulates 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.490
 indoors zero ceiling and 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.400
 cool the shelves 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.100
 by and large in this case 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.470
 most comfortable we would be living in 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.690
 ceiling area 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.840
 either maintain the temperature of the ceiling 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.010
 at the level of 30 and 40 degrees Celsius 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.870
 and you will agree it would be unrealistic 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.520
 either very energy expensive 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.700
 other country convection this 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.620
 air circulation and therefore all the shelves 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.710
 together with the ascending air flow 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.210
 rises up 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.340
 and come across on the boat encroaches on 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.770
 furniture curtains and other items 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.380
 don't forget about the big one 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.940
 fire and burn hazard 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.980
 maternal heating and cost 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.240
 oil radiators 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.080
 it seems there is no way out 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.850
 it's time to go out on a warm street 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.469
 to the sun 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.080
 feel it warm 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.560
 stop what about the sun flu 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.990
 But everything is very simple 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.509
 infrared based on solar heat 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.130
 or just wave radiation which 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.609
 heats not the air but the surface of the earth 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.850
 objects on it 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.030
 and already the land and all that is now 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.980
 heats the ambient air 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.310
 let's do another experiment 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.080
 take a little iron 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.560
 got pregnant water temperature 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.940
 ambient temperature 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.030
 let's leave our cut for a while on 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.820
 the sun 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.209
 iron temperature is measured again 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.530
 as we see no air is heated sample 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.900
 especially personal rays or as they said 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.799
 before long nagoy radiation 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:16.889
 oddly enough 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.769
 exactly this way of heating people 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.869
 enjoyed from time immemorial 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:21.680
 bonfire 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.199
 Russian stove and the man himself 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.189
 all this is sources and 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.259
 infrared or longwave 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:29.229
 radiation 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.199
 that is, heating with rays and 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.979
 infrared spectrum the most 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.740
 natural to all of us 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.490
 And now about the main device 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.739
 longwave heating 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.209
 which are like the sun 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.529
 warms not air 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.029
 and furnishings 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:45.509
 as directed by the same Russia other radiation 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.549
 and already the objects themselves give up in the air so 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.319
 we need the warmth 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.639
 set up our third experiment 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.959
 using for room heating 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.049
 teplofon 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.659
 over time the temperature at different levels 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.589
 premises and compare rates with normal 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.319
 collectible heating 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.869
 the difference is palpable 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:04.369
 now about the pros 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:05.939
 unique heatphone system 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.349
 provides uniform 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.009
 temperature distribution around 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:10.929
 the room carries 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.179
 directed gref 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:14.009
 naturally maintain 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:15.839
 human heat balance 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.449
 safe to use 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:18.919
 economical convection 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.649
 heaters by 15 20 percent 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:23.090
 and electric card 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.569
 by 30 percent 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:25.899
 and I will be on Wednesday 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.519
 except the heat sink is equipped 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.289
 peterman include m which excludes 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.399
 the possibility of overheating devices he 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.829
 Available in two types of wall and 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:34.889
 ceiling 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.889
 dimensions of devices allows not only 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.869
 place it in a convenient place for you 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.199
 but also important to save 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.349
 space 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.999
 ceiling heaters easy 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.949
 built into suspended ceilings 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.590
 and can work directed 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.140
 heating concrete for example workers 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.919
 places 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.880
 And the application area is warm background 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.379
 just endless 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.689
 besides standard apartments the ship 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.069
 ideal for heating garages and 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.299
 summer houses as the system is warm 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.849
 the foundation does not imply water heating it 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.819
 can be installed in the cottages 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.879
 given the ability to create bad 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.749
 comfortable working climate 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.679
 it is simply indispensable for production 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:13.599
 and public spaces 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.449
 for the same reasons, the heatphone may 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.719
 applied in the field of agriculture 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:19.109
 for trade pavilions and 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:19.859
 of stores 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.840
 heat foundation is a godsend 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.120
 because besides the obvious economic benefits 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.380
 ceiling ceiling options allows 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.010
 optimal use 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.939
 retail space 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:30.739
 summing up you can say 

00:04:30.739 --> 00:04:32.969
 longwave electrical appliances 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:34.229
 heater cover 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.499
 suitable for everyone who uses or 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:38.389
 used the services of central 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:39.460
 heating network 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.220
 compact reliable and economical heat 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.719
 fund 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.599
 allow you to take a gentle look at 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:45.810
 Siberian nature 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.810
 and protect the cold season 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.870
 the heat of the sun 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.800
 teplofon 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.659
 turn on 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:52.590
 own sun
