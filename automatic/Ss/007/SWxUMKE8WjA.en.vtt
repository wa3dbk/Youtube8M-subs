I would do it on a formal basis and it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.370 
I would do it on a formal basis and it
was<00:02:31.090> something<00:02:31.269> I<00:02:31.450> wanted<00:02:31.599> to<00:02:31.780> do<00:02:31.959> anyway<00:02:32.230> so

definition<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.989> mentoring<00:02:35.590> Vic<00:02:36.130> right<00:02:36.370> now

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
definition of mentoring Vic right now

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.000 
definition of mentoring Vic right now
how<00:02:36.700> much<00:02:36.820> do<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.060> see<00:02:37.390> him<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:38.109> how<00:02:38.829> much

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
how much do you see him and how much

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.340 
how much do you see him and how much
will<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.400> be<00:02:39.549> involved<00:02:40.209> in<00:02:40.359> this<00:02:40.570> process<00:02:40.900> in

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
will you be involved in this process in

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.740 
will you be involved in this process in
to<00:02:41.470> what<00:02:41.620> degree<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:42.220> for<00:02:42.579> how<00:02:42.670> long<00:02:42.700> well<00:02:43.630> I'm

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
to what degree and for how long well I'm

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.390 
to what degree and for how long well I'm
going<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.959> be<00:02:44.019> involved<00:02:44.470> for<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.680> while<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.280> I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
going to be involved for a while and I

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.130 
going to be involved for a while and I
think<00:02:45.609> a<00:02:45.670> lot<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:46.060> will<00:02:46.180> depend<00:02:46.359> on<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
think a lot of that will depend on the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.170 
think a lot of that will depend on the
team<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.530> he<00:02:47.650> goes<00:02:47.859> to<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.609> how<00:02:48.760> quick<00:02:49.060> he

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
team that he goes to and how quick he

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.240 
team that he goes to and how quick he
gets<00:02:49.390> hooked<00:02:49.540> up<00:02:49.810> but<00:02:49.989> we<00:02:50.170> talked<00:02:50.440> quite<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.160> bit

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
gets hooked up but we talked quite a bit

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.880 
gets hooked up but we talked quite a bit
we<00:02:51.670> text<00:02:52.030> back<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.239> forth<00:02:52.630> quite<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.900> bit<00:02:53.170> when

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
we text back and forth quite a bit when

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.740 
we text back and forth quite a bit when
he<00:02:54.069> has<00:02:54.190> a<00:02:54.220> question<00:02:54.549> about<00:02:54.850> what's<00:02:55.269> going<00:02:55.480> on

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
he has a question about what's going on

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.809 
he has a question about what's going on
decisions<00:02:56.709> he's<00:02:56.829> got<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.130> make<00:02:57.160> he<00:02:57.430> gives<00:02:57.640> me<00:02:57.790> a

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
decisions he's got to make he gives me a

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.690 
decisions he's got to make he gives me a
call<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.870> give<00:02:59.380> him<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.620> call<00:02:59.769> to<00:03:00.130> check<00:03:00.340> in<00:03:00.549> on

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
call I give him a call to check in on

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.670 
call I give him a call to check in on
and<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.090> it's<00:03:01.389> one<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.870> those<00:03:01.959> things<00:03:02.019> we<00:03:02.500> will

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
and so it's one of those things we will

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.559 
and so it's one of those things we will
meet<00:03:02.950> face<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.519> face<00:03:03.549> a<00:03:03.760> couple<00:03:04.030> times<00:03:04.389> during

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
meet face to face a couple times during

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.720 
meet face to face a couple times during
the<00:03:04.900> fall<00:03:05.109> but<00:03:05.350> I'm<00:03:05.829> really<00:03:06.069> hoping<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.519> he

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
the fall but I'm really hoping that he

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.550 
the fall but I'm really hoping that he
gets<00:03:06.760> with<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.239> team<00:03:07.480> pretty<00:03:07.810> quick<00:03:08.139> I<00:03:08.319> think

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
gets with the team pretty quick I think

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.530 
gets with the team pretty quick I think
that<00:03:08.709> may<00:03:08.889> happen<00:03:09.130> he's<00:03:09.430> talked<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.940> several

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
that may happen he's talked to several

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.050 
that may happen he's talked to several
teams<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.260> has<00:03:11.620> some<00:03:11.799> teams<00:03:12.010> interested<00:03:12.310> then

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
the team's call you to talk to him were

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.789

to<00:03:20.230> get<00:03:20.380> my<00:03:20.440> take<00:03:20.799> on<00:03:20.980> where<00:03:21.250> he<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.060> what

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
to get my take on where he is and what

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.020 
to get my take on where he is and what
his<00:03:23.170> thought<00:03:23.470> process<00:03:24.010> is<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.489> kind<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.819> my

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
his thought process is and kind of my

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.509 
his thought process is and kind of my
read<00:03:25.299> on<00:03:25.329> it<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.230> then<00:03:26.769> it's<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.100> matter<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
read on it and then it's a matter of the

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.340 
read on it and then it's a matter of the
coach<00:03:27.760> talking<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.540> ownership<00:03:28.900> and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
coach talking to the ownership and

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.750 
coach talking to the ownership and
everybody's<00:03:29.920> gonna<00:03:30.040> have<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.250> be<00:03:30.340> on<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.549> same

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
everybody's gonna have to be on the same

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.280 
everybody's gonna have to be on the same
page<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.299> think<00:03:31.600> something<00:03:31.930> may<00:03:32.049> happen

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
page but I think something may happen

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.670 
page but I think something may happen
here

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
here

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.949 
here
pretty<00:03:33.159> shortly<00:03:33.579> why<00:03:34.269> do<00:03:34.329> you<00:03:34.540> think<00:03:34.840> that

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
pretty shortly why do you think that

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.920 
pretty shortly why do you think that
teams<00:03:35.379> are<00:03:35.799> so<00:03:36.519> hesitant<00:03:36.969> obviously

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
teams are so hesitant obviously

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.619 
teams are so hesitant obviously
everything<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:39.219> he's<00:03:39.340> been<00:03:39.549> through<00:03:39.909> but

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
everything that he's been through but

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.809 
everything that he's been through but
does<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:40.900> also<00:03:41.260> create<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.069> tough<00:03:42.489> situation

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
does it also create a tough situation

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.509 
does it also create a tough situation
for<00:03:43.329> whoever<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.230> starting<00:03:44.650> quarterback<00:03:44.859> is

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
for whoever the starting quarterback is

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.089 
for whoever the starting quarterback is
on<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.120> particular<00:03:46.629> franchise<00:03:47.469> because<00:03:47.709> let's

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
on a particular franchise because let's

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.619 
on a particular franchise because let's
face<00:03:48.159> it<00:03:48.519> if<00:03:48.609> you<00:03:48.700> see<00:03:48.909> mike<00:03:49.120> vick<00:03:49.359> in<00:03:49.540> an

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
face it if you see mike vick in an

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.039 
face it if you see mike vick in an
exhibition<00:03:49.959> game<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:51.280> go<00:03:51.430> wow<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.629> the

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
exhibition game and you go wow and the

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.140 
exhibition game and you go wow and the
fans<00:03:53.349> want<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.829> see<00:03:53.859> more<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.519> does<00:03:54.790> put

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
fans want to see more it does put

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.059 
fans want to see more it does put
pressure<00:03:55.450> on<00:03:55.659> that<00:03:55.689> quarterback<00:03:56.349> I<00:03:56.620> don't

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
pressure on that quarterback I don't

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.890 
pressure on that quarterback I don't
think<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:57.489> much<00:03:57.730> it's<00:03:58.239> going<00:03:58.359> to<00:03:58.450> put<00:03:58.629> pressure

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
think so much it's going to put pressure

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.869 
think so much it's going to put pressure
on<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.260> starting<00:03:59.889> quarterback<00:04:00.099> but<00:04:00.639> what's

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
on the starting quarterback but what's

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.640 
on the starting quarterback but what's
going<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.180> happen<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.750> organization<00:04:02.500> it's

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
going to happen the organization it's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.990 
going to happen the organization it's
going<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:02.829> be<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:02.980> distraction<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.730> know<00:04:03.849> and

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
going to be a distraction you know and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.179 
going to be a distraction you know and
as<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.090> head<00:04:04.359> coach<00:04:04.389> as<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.959> owner<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:06.010> don't

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
as a head coach as a owner you don't

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:07.860 
as a head coach as a owner you don't
want<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.400> distraction<00:04:07.000> coming<00:04:07.299> into<00:04:07.510> your<00:04:07.599> team

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
want a distraction coming into your team

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.110 
want a distraction coming into your team
so<00:04:08.560> it's<00:04:08.799> got<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.159> be<00:04:09.250> an<00:04:09.370> organizational

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
so it's got to be an organizational

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.970 
so it's got to be an organizational
decision<00:04:10.659> that<00:04:10.900> here's<00:04:11.169> a<00:04:11.260> guy<00:04:11.439> that<00:04:11.650> can<00:04:11.769> help

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
decision that here's a guy that can help

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.309 
decision that here's a guy that can help
us<00:04:12.189> and<00:04:12.549> he's<00:04:12.700> going<00:04:12.879> to<00:04:12.939> come<00:04:13.599> along<00:04:13.870> slowly<00:04:14.169> I

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
us and he's going to come along slowly I

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.720 
us and he's going to come along slowly I
think<00:04:14.590> that<00:04:14.739> was<00:04:14.829> part<00:04:15.099> of<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.340> whole<00:04:15.549> process

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
think that was part of the whole process

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.029 
think that was part of the whole process
of<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.299> Commissioner<00:04:16.810> wanting<00:04:17.289> that<00:04:17.440> time

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
of the Commissioner wanting that time

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.740 
of the Commissioner wanting that time
frame<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.459> give<00:04:18.820> him<00:04:18.940> some<00:04:19.120> adjustment<00:04:19.660> that

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
frame to give him some adjustment that

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.120 
frame to give him some adjustment that
he's<00:04:19.870> not<00:04:20.049> coming<00:04:20.410> in<00:04:20.500> playing<00:04:20.799> right<00:04:21.009> away

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
he's not coming in playing right away

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.980 
he's not coming in playing right away
but<00:04:21.310> he's<00:04:21.639> going<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.940> ease<00:04:22.389> into<00:04:22.419> the

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
but he's going to ease into the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.290 
but he's going to ease into the
situation<00:04:23.620> here's<00:04:24.070> being<00:04:24.340> in<00:04:24.550> shape<00:04:24.789> and<00:04:25.090> he's

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
situation here's being in shape and he's

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.360 
situation here's being in shape and he's
being<00:04:25.570> in<00:04:25.780> shape<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.320> play<00:04:26.500> football<00:04:26.740> where<00:04:27.250> is

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
being in shape to play football where is

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.339 
being in shape to play football where is
he<00:04:27.550> I'm<00:04:27.970> not<00:04:28.150> sure<00:04:28.210> about<00:04:28.509> that<00:04:28.840> part<00:04:29.139> of<00:04:29.229> it

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
he I'm not sure about that part of it

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:30.719 
he I'm not sure about that part of it
you<00:04:29.560> know<00:04:29.590> he's<00:04:29.830> been<00:04:29.979> two<00:04:30.190> years<00:04:30.400> away<00:04:30.699> from

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
you know he's been two years away from

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.820 
you know he's been two years away from
the<00:04:31.030> game<00:04:31.240> he<00:04:31.570> hadn't<00:04:31.900> really<00:04:32.349> been<00:04:32.470> able<00:04:32.650> to

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
the game he hadn't really been able to

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.170 
the game he hadn't really been able to
work<00:04:33.009> out<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:33.490> that's<00:04:33.699> part<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.090> the

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
work out and that that's part of the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.960 
work out and that that's part of the
process<00:04:34.419> too<00:04:34.900> but<00:04:35.199> he's<00:04:35.800> excited<00:04:36.789> about

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
process too but he's excited about

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.730 
process too but he's excited about
playing<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.720> he<00:04:37.930> just<00:04:38.169> wants<00:04:38.409> to<00:04:38.470> get<00:04:38.620> back

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
playing and he just wants to get back

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.950 
playing and he just wants to get back
with<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.039> team<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.550> be<00:04:39.909> part<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.389> scene

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
with the team and be part of the scene

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.140 
with the team and be part of the scene
again<00:04:41.289> you<00:04:41.740> know<00:04:41.860> two<00:04:41.919> years<00:04:42.130> in<00:04:42.610> Leavenworth

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
again you know two years in Leavenworth

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.920 
again you know two years in Leavenworth
and<00:04:43.449> I<00:04:43.570> think<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.159> most<00:04:45.159> people<00:04:45.580> would<00:04:45.729> say

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
and I think that most people would say

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.600 
and I think that most people would say
enough's<00:04:46.930> enough

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
enough's enough

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.429 
enough's enough
you've<00:04:49.000> got<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.360> flip<00:04:49.629> side<00:04:49.659> of<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:50.050> and

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:50.439 
you've got the flip side of that and

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:53.279 
you've got the flip side of that and
that<00:04:50.889> it's<00:04:51.250> not<00:04:51.719> necessarily<00:04:52.719> about<00:04:52.810> mike

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
that it's not necessarily about mike

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.080 
that it's not necessarily about mike
vick<00:04:53.590> right<00:04:53.860> now<00:04:54.069> I<00:04:54.099> mean<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.610> National

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
right spot and I think that's what the

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.830 
right spot and I think that's what the
the<00:05:33.340> country<00:05:33.669> is<00:05:33.759> all<00:05:33.879> about<00:05:33.939> second<00:05:34.810> chances

for people who really have paid the
penalty<00:05:37.029> in<00:05:37.330> our<00:05:37.479> remorseful<00:05:38.289> and<00:05:38.409> I<00:05:38.710> think<00:05:38.949> he

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:39.069 
penalty in our remorseful and I think he

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.670 
penalty in our remorseful and I think he

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
this point in some situations i think a

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.189

you might have an owner who says wait a
minute<00:07:15.949> I<00:07:16.009> got<00:07:16.280> a<00:07:16.490> lot<00:07:16.940> of<00:07:16.969> other<00:07:17.270> things<00:07:17.419> I've

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:18.259

rest and the franchise and the

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.980 
rest and the franchise and the
reputation<00:07:21.919> is<00:07:22.460> that<00:07:22.940> happening<00:07:23.389> I<00:07:23.569> think

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:23.990 
reputation is that happening I think

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.749 
reputation is that happening I think
that<00:07:24.139> is<00:07:24.289> the<00:07:24.319> case<00:07:24.620> then<00:07:24.680> I<00:07:25.009> know<00:07:25.069> when<00:07:25.460> I<00:07:25.490> was

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 
that is the case then I know when I was

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.839 
that is the case then I know when I was
coaching<00:07:26.599> and<00:07:27.139> you<00:07:27.529> talk<00:07:28.099> about<00:07:28.130> someone<00:07:28.639> who

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849 
coaching and you talk about someone who

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:31.029 
coaching and you talk about someone who
had<00:07:28.969> had<00:07:29.150> legal<00:07:29.719> problems<00:07:30.169> or<00:07:30.349> all<00:07:30.740> field

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 
had had legal problems or all field

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.010 
had had legal problems or all field
problems<00:07:31.340> I<00:07:31.699> was<00:07:32.240> going<00:07:32.389> to<00:07:32.479> look<00:07:32.659> that<00:07:32.810> guy

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.020 
problems I was going to look that guy

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.709 
problems I was going to look that guy
and<00:07:33.229> I<00:07:33.289> find<00:07:34.009> out<00:07:34.219> if<00:07:34.550> I<00:07:34.789> really<00:07:34.819> believed<00:07:35.509> in

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:35.719 
and I find out if I really believed in

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:38.110 
and I find out if I really believed in
him<00:07:35.960> and<00:07:36.199> he<00:07:37.159> was<00:07:37.250> going<00:07:37.430> to<00:07:37.490> fit<00:07:37.669> well<00:07:37.819> in<00:07:38.000> our

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120 
him and he was going to fit well in our

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.760 
him and he was going to fit well in our
locker<00:07:38.719> room<00:07:39.020> and<00:07:39.139> if<00:07:39.259> that<00:07:39.469> was<00:07:39.620> the<00:07:39.740> case

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.770 
locker room and if that was the case

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.559 
locker room and if that was the case
then<00:07:39.949> I<00:07:40.250> was<00:07:40.400> willing<00:07:40.550> to<00:07:40.729> take<00:07:40.909> a<00:07:40.969> chance<00:07:41.090> and

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:41.569 
then I was willing to take a chance and

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:43.029 
then I was willing to take a chance and
I<00:07:41.840> think<00:07:42.080> that's<00:07:42.229> where<00:07:42.349> a<00:07:42.409> lot<00:07:42.440> of<00:07:42.590> people<00:07:42.680> are

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 
I think that's where a lot of people are

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:44.780 
I think that's where a lot of people are
you<00:07:43.849> know<00:07:43.969> what<00:07:44.210> you

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:44.790 
you know what you

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.000 
you know what you
would<00:07:45.790> you<00:07:46.060> bring<00:07:46.390> them<00:07:46.600> in<00:07:46.780> and<00:07:47.080> be<00:07:47.770> the

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.010 
would you bring them in and be the

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.310 
would you bring them in and be the
Wildcat<00:07:48.940> guy<00:07:49.210> and<00:07:49.570> we've<00:07:49.750> heard<00:07:49.900> all<00:07:50.140> the

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:50.320 
Wildcat guy and we've heard all the

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.420 
Wildcat guy and we've heard all the
speculation<00:07:51.450> about<00:07:52.450> that<00:07:52.780> are<00:07:53.140> you<00:07:53.830> still<00:07:54.160> of

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:54.430 
speculation about that are you still of

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.310 
speculation about that are you still of
the<00:07:54.940> opinion<00:07:54.970> that<00:07:55.450> this<00:07:55.690> guy<00:07:55.930> could<00:07:55.960> be<00:07:56.170> a

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:56.320 
the opinion that this guy could be a

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.410 
the opinion that this guy could be a
starting<00:07:56.920> quarterback<00:07:57.160> and<00:07:57.820> an<00:07:57.910> effective

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:58.420 
starting quarterback and an effective

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.580

starting quarterback in the National
Football<00:07:59.950> I<00:08:00.520> think<00:08:00.820> you<00:08:00.940> do<00:08:01.060> that<00:08:01.090> I<00:08:01.270> think<00:08:01.510> you

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:01.570 
Football I think you do that I think you

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.910 
Football I think you do that I think you
bring<00:08:01.750> him<00:08:01.900> in<00:08:02.020> with<00:08:02.200> the<00:08:02.290> idea<00:08:02.650> that<00:08:02.680> he's

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:02.920 
bring him in with the idea that he's

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.590 
bring him in with the idea that he's
going<00:08:03.040> to<00:08:03.100> be<00:08:03.220> your<00:08:03.400> backup<00:08:03.640> quarterback<00:08:04.330> he's

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:04.600 
going to be your backup quarterback he's

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.210 
going to be your backup quarterback he's
going<00:08:04.780> to<00:08:04.870> learn<00:08:05.020> everything<00:08:05.500> that<00:08:05.830> you<00:08:05.980> do

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:06.220 
going to learn everything that you do

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.880 
going to learn everything that you do
but<00:08:06.640> the<00:08:06.910> advantage<00:08:07.630> to<00:08:07.660> having<00:08:07.990> him<00:08:08.320> is<00:08:08.620> that

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:08.890 
but the advantage to having him is that
