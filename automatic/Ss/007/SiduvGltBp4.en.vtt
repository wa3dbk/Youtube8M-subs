bit early then it's a Shawnee but she

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.699 
bit early then it's a Shawnee but she
tumbles<00:02:55.239> off<00:02:55.299> of<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.630> first<00:02:55.930> turn<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:56.470> we'll

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
tumbles off of that first turn so we'll

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.920 
tumbles off of that first turn so we'll
try<00:02:56.950> her<00:02:57.069> again<00:02:57.209> No<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.859> one<00:02:59.859> more<00:03:00.069> try<00:03:00.930> well

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
try her again No and one more try well

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.569 
try her again No and one more try well
it<00:03:02.170> looks<00:03:02.410> like<00:03:02.470> she<00:03:02.709> just<00:03:02.739> can't<00:03:03.160> do<00:03:03.370> it

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
it looks like she just can't do it

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.699 
it looks like she just can't do it
now<00:03:03.970> here's<00:03:04.209> Rochelle<00:03:04.630> also<00:03:05.170> known<00:03:05.350> as<00:03:05.470> Sakura

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
now here's Rochelle also known as Sakura

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.150 
now here's Rochelle also known as Sakura
and<00:03:06.040> Japan<00:03:06.370> as<00:03:06.579> you<00:03:06.760> can<00:03:06.940> see<00:03:07.120> she<00:03:07.389> falls<00:03:07.630> off<00:03:07.840> -

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
and Japan as you can see she falls off -

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.490 
and Japan as you can see she falls off -
we'll<00:03:09.160> try<00:03:09.310> her<00:03:09.430> again<00:03:09.670> though<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:11.260> same

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
we'll try her again though and the same

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.250 
we'll try her again though and the same
result<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.359> slide<00:03:13.600> actually<00:03:13.989> comes<00:03:14.170> with

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
result so the slide actually comes with

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.020 
result so the slide actually comes with
guardrails<00:03:14.829> although<00:03:15.310> they're<00:03:15.459> only<00:03:15.639> for<00:03:15.940> the

guardrails although they're only for the

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.849 
guardrails although they're only for the
second<00:03:16.420> turn<00:03:16.540> on<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.750> track<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.290> even<00:03:17.560> if<00:03:17.769> you

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
second turn on the track and even if you

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.500 
second turn on the track and even if you
wanted<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.280> use<00:03:18.549> them<00:03:18.760> they're<00:03:19.000> only<00:03:19.180> designed

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510

snapping<00:04:12.269> off<00:04:12.420> but<00:04:12.720> they<00:04:12.840> land<00:04:13.049> just<00:04:13.260> fine<00:04:13.470> and

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
snapping off but they land just fine and

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.210 
snapping off but they land just fine and
now<00:04:15.180> two<00:04:15.410> chupacabras<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.799> can<00:04:16.950> see<00:04:17.100> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
now two chupacabras and you can see the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.650 
now two chupacabras and you can see the
last<00:04:17.370> guy<00:04:17.549> jumping<00:04:18.090> out<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.299> back<00:04:18.829> and

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
last guy jumping out the back and

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.990 
last guy jumping out the back and
finally<00:04:21.660> two<00:04:22.109> echoes<00:04:22.650> showing<00:04:23.490> how<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.639> do<00:04:23.850> it

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
finally two echoes showing how to do it

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.790 
finally two echoes showing how to do it
correctly<00:04:25.880> so<00:04:26.880> what<00:04:27.090> about<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.539> Shawnee<00:04:27.870> well

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
correctly so what about a Shawnee well

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.740 
correctly so what about a Shawnee well
it<00:04:29.010> appears<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.490> that<00:04:29.760> first<00:04:29.970> turn<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.510> just

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
it appears that that first turn is just

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.500 
it appears that that first turn is just
too<00:04:30.990> sharp<00:04:31.289> for<00:04:31.500> her<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.710> manage<00:04:32.210> but<00:04:33.210> Sakura

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
too sharp for her to manage but Sakura

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.050 
too sharp for her to manage but Sakura
