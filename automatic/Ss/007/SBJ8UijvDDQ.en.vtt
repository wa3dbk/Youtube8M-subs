00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 look personal beauty what the adrian do 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:11.610
 a boxing for you here on the phone was 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.719
 in fact in this jdl of the weapon is the jota 88 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.940
 and ii are there is no research in the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.940
 internet seems like a good phone there 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:33.420
 take this plastic aside because 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.250
 As you can see here is jota 38 and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.059
 he is the true one is so the one of involves the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.070
 your ear and does not stay over your ear 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:52.399
 nifty here in front so here is a 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:57.410
 is a glove that fits good like a 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.410
 its an open and this is very good 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.320
 the clove 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.220
 with beautiful packing in a shelter here 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.220
 to eat 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:26.479
 Here's the ophone, man. Look, people here. 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.689
 then the phonebook documentation 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.689
 warranty 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.229
 some reforms here attention when the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.090
 total volume with personnel then this one here 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:47.509
 It's the phone of his stuff. It's really cool. 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:51.140
 the inec is the speaker it 50mm 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.310
 is it has the frequency range of 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:02:04.189
 $ 8 to 24 reais 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:07.690
 up there is a brushed steel 16 jbr 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:13.120
 in this detail that also on the side the 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.120
 that he turns 180 here the speaker 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:32.890
 so it was easy to carry the good is 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.890
 see that it was like this in the box here 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:51.690
 because the car was one meter and thirty 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:54.360
 and a flash cable it does not ball does not 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.880
 to embarrass anyone who has a headset and knows 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.740
 how is it that here is on one side only 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:08.150
 once and for all, select some works 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.150
 How does the studio work? 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:26.700
 whose space has a Chinese one a 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.940
 screen for you to save to get the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.490
 camera but will put the car and such is 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.030
 seemingly a space to put more 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.030
 it's something else 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.740
 the famous manoel 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.290
 so as I mentioned here with you 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.630
 as it is a big blow to the ear that 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.550
 This is very good because you have a 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.410
 better adaptation will not only stay very 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.709
 better the external noise good fumbling 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.500
 So much for a head stand here 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.620
 it also has a cushion which makes it 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.350
 the most comfortable prolonged use is 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.820
 this adjustment on the sides have a 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:18.260
 marking here do not know if the camera will 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:19.799
 pick up 18 on both sides obviously 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.100
 on here 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.229
 the cable it is a side is so it just goes 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.750
 on one side only me that is interesting 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.750
 also to start one here 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.730
 is that he has a lock then his phone 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.230
 he will not leave by accident or 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:44.400
 I fit you so far to see how 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:46.470
 whether you put here revolves around the ready 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.310
 Cable will not have danger of not leaving 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:54.540
 is you want to hit there in the car and out 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:58.620
 from there on the connector that phone he has here 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.570
 control and volume adjustment plus - and 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.490
 here back also has a baby microphone 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.520
 so if you're using your 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.850
 smartphone you can answer you can 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.510
 answering the call is also the connectors 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:19.980
 here is the default p2 does not come with a 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:27.330
 adapter to talk about is the importance of 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:29.250
 software online soares 32 good then it 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.490
 This is apparently material personnel. 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.830
 very good, this is a leather 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.310
 apparently quite comfortable also will 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.890
 test it this week and make a detour 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.300
 it's ahead 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.990
 so I guess that 's it, people stay by 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.530
 on here 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.130
 rodrigo is on camera and thanks to 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.130
