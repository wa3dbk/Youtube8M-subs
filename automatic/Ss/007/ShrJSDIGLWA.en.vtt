which<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:58.089> a<00:00:58.120> good<00:00:58.299> thing<00:00:58.359> but<00:00:58.959> three<00:00:59.769> days

00:00:59.879 --> 00:00:59.889 
which is a good thing but three days

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.489 
which is a good thing but three days
it's<00:01:00.190> not<00:01:00.339> enough<00:01:00.579> time<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:01.179> think<00:01:01.809> it<00:01:02.319> should

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
it's not enough time I think it should

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.250 
it's not enough time I think it should
be<00:01:02.559> monday<00:01:03.129> through<00:01:03.670> friday<00:01:03.940> but<00:01:04.690> a<00:01:04.930> whole

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
be monday through friday but a whole

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.490 
be monday through friday but a whole
week<00:01:05.530> of<00:01:05.740> just<00:01:06.490> games<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.570> coverage<00:01:08.140> and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
week of just games and coverage and

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.660 
week of just games and coverage and
press<00:01:08.740> events<00:01:08.890> i<00:01:09.130> think<00:01:09.310> that<00:01:09.400> would<00:01:09.520> be

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670

it's gotten a little better now since
they're<00:01:50.830> letting<00:01:51.340> less<00:01:52.020> vloggers<00:01:53.020> in<00:01:53.230> who

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
they're letting less vloggers in who

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:54.990 
they're letting less vloggers in who
don't<00:01:53.650> really<00:01:53.920> own<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.100> center<00:01:54.430> just<00:01:54.640> what<00:01:54.850> and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
don't really own a center just what and

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.730 
don't really own a center just what and
just<00:01:55.180> want<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.420> go<00:01:55.540> because<00:01:55.780> III<00:01:56.200> used<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.620> be

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
just want to go because III used to be

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.460 
just want to go because III used to be
open<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.100> public<00:01:57.220> years<00:01:57.850> ago<00:01:58.210> or<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:59.290> was

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
open to the public years ago or it was

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.260 
open to the public years ago or it was
really<00:01:59.830> really<00:02:00.010> really<00:02:00.310> easy<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.760> get<00:02:00.940> in<00:02:01.090> and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
really really really easy to get in and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.910 
really really really easy to get in and
now<00:02:01.840> they've<00:02:02.050> kind<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.409> streamline<00:02:02.800> that

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
now they've kind of streamline that

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.740 
now they've kind of streamline that
process<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:03.610> it's<00:02:03.760> not<00:02:03.940> as<00:02:04.150> easy<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.390> get<00:02:04.630> in

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
process so it's not as easy to get in

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.630 
process so it's not as easy to get in
which<00:02:04.900> is<00:02:04.930> good<00:02:05.260> because<00:02:05.440> perhaps<00:02:06.130> people<00:02:06.490> do

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
which is good because perhaps people do

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.890 
which is good because perhaps people do
need<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:06.820> get<00:02:06.970> there<00:02:07.120> to<00:02:07.210> work<00:02:07.390> maybe<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.750> need

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
need to get there to work maybe you need

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.240 
need to get there to work maybe you need
to<00:02:07.930> play<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.259> games<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.709> write<00:02:08.860> about<00:02:09.099> them

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.970 
guess the overall theme of the stuff
that<00:03:29.480> sucks<00:03:29.780> today<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:30.019> people<00:03:30.470> who<00:03:30.560> can't<00:03:30.769> go

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
that sucks today is people who can't go
