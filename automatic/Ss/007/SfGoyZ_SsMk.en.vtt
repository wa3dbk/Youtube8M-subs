00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello greetings to all that so welcome 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.080
 back to magic 2014 and welcome to 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.749
 first of the videos to show the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.379
 expansion challenges so that the 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:18.720
 last dlc has just launched may 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.410
 of 2014 the first of them is called 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.019
 mountain assault and it says the following 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.300
 may you as your opponent have a 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.420
 idea but you have brain finds 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.160
 a way to kill your enemy 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.160
 so let's start the challenge 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.530
 good what we said what we just 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.350
 to read 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.710
 the enemy has a hydra 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.750
 this hydra from here 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.580
 OK 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.950
 and has a simile on the battlefield 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.200
 x 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.010
 also here is 2 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:08.900
 in artifacts the ground treatments 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:13.360
 and he has us exiled but he has us 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.360
 exiled a 7 vale 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.140
 on our turn 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.480
 and in the hand we have a merchant 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.280
 weapons 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.430
 a moon of blood 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.450
 annual in vocation 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.200
 naturalize and I quote quito mold well 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.560
 the challenge to announce the hydra 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.469
 what it does is mislead us a little 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.659
 he tries to focus on the cider and there 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.460
 is the error the idea would be so simple 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.670
 how to return it to the owner's hand 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.860
 for example and then destroy a 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.030
 artifact enchantment to release 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.520
 our our exiled creature that what 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.909
 could we could clear the way 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.289
 but still it would not give us the colon 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.200
 the two points of attack that we need 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.200
 to kill the enemy like we do 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 well 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.009
 in the field we have a 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.950
 mountaineer swallow this mountaineer brought 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.190
 cross mountain as you know if you do not know 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.959
 I come to say it crosses mountains is a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.790
 creature that crosses mountains can not be 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.459
 blocked while attacking a player 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.650
 that has a mountain in play 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.460
 if the enemy had a mountain here 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.800
 which is not the case it has a plain 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.640
 Well, it could not block our 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.130
 creature worth 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.980
 here with the blood moon we make it 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.160
 that all the lands they have are 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.310
 mountains in this way will not be able to 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.310
 to block 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:52.540
 ok now we continue and we can attack 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.350
 without blocking us attacked and the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.350
 moment that we attack 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:10.150
 we stop the clock and we're going to quote 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.150
 mold we are going to copy a creature 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.290
 so that it has the two of damage that 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.290
 We need to kill the enemy 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.960
 and victory I hope it was clear 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 ok it's just to make it not 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.159
 can block us turning it 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.620
 using cross to cross mountains and 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.580
 after copying copied from the creature 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.310
 of the enemy to 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.110
 to do the points of the year see you 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.110
