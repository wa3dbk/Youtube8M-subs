Playstation the Manko great assist I've
noticed<00:01:13.859> that<00:01:13.979> that's<00:01:14.159> been<00:01:14.429> slightly

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
noticed that that's been slightly

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.630 
noticed that that's been slightly
different<00:01:15.270> too<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.810> yeah<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.070> weird<00:01:17.369> so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
different too so yeah just so weird so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.130 
different too so yeah just so weird so
hard<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.179> an<00:01:18.299> accurate<00:01:18.509> representation

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
hard to get an accurate representation

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.639 
hard to get an accurate representation
of<00:01:19.619> pac-man<00:01:20.210> without<00:01:21.210> actually<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
of pac-man without actually going to the

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.520 
of pac-man without actually going to the
arcade<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.520> playing<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.359> not<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:25.079> of<00:01:25.259> us<00:01:25.350> can

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530

arcade and playing it not all of us can
do<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.909> fact<00:01:27.119> there's<00:01:27.509> nobody<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.960> do

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
do that so in fact there's nobody can do

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.020 
do that so in fact there's nobody can do
that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.779 
that
yeah<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.749> the<00:01:30.899> next<00:01:31.020> best<00:01:31.259> thing

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
now I get it

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.450 
now I get it
I<00:04:30.430> don't<00:04:30.880> understand<00:04:31.330> it
