00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello people today, I put this to you 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.880
 trio or camp smart float 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.880
 tripod for dslr ago 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.520
 in the scope of delivery are included 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.670
 head and foot of steadycam six 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.460
 weights of it because of 1450 grams and 2 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.349
 500 grams and a carrying case for the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.669
 transport which, however, not from 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.669
 very high quality is 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.860
 to the review the steadycam is very 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.780
 easy to build because you only upper and 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.880
 bottom part must screw together and the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.770
 weights must also be adjusted 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.680
 the longitudinal axis of the head is a ruler 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.680
 imprinted which the consumption 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 facilitated 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.910
 You can also see the citycom height 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.010
 Adjust from 37 cm height which for 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.110
 Slow recording is thought to be up to 60 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.490
 cm height which for fast shots 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.050
 For example sprints 10 is suitable 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.760
 note on the edge if you have too many 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.080
 weights on a floating tripod drum 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.970
 it can happen that the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.729
 shaky and restless 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.860
 that's too tight here 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:26.410
 In addition, as always exercises 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.590
 the master now a few examples 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.590
 10 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.360
 Let's come to the conclusion the steadycam 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.970
 is very handy what they do 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.360
 should and it is easy to use or 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.460
 balance out 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.080
 the only flaws in the product are 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.760
 that the black color is already after 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.530
 short time uses and the handle at 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.270
 too loose hand held by the metal 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.840
 Above all, you can not slip with it 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.980
 glue is fixed 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.840
 Nevertheless, I have a clear one 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.520
 buy recommendation because you at this price 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.780
 for another steadycam in this one 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.780
 quality finds 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.340
 Thanks for watching if you can 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.410
 the helpful would like to walk 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.310
 give a thumbs up that would 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.500
 I am very happy 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.330
