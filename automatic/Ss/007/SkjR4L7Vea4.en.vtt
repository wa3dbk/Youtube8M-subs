00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
right now dia is its point-based all

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.410 
right now dia is its point-based all
right<00:03:16.390> okay<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.770> how<00:03:18.700> many<00:03:18.760> points<00:03:19.090> do<00:03:19.390> you

where the basic starter boxes are 150

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.460 
where the basic starter boxes are 150
point<00:03:24.100> okay<00:03:24.730> bands<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:25.630> they're<00:03:25.840> all<00:03:25.960> set<00:03:26.260> as<00:03:26.440> a

nice standard to start okay oftentimes

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.950 
nice standard to start okay oftentimes
game<00:03:29.260> may<00:03:29.560> be<00:03:29.590> at<00:03:29.890> 200<00:03:30.430> or<00:03:30.520> 250<00:03:31.030> points<00:03:31.570> okay

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
game may be at 200 or 250 points okay

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.750 
game may be at 200 or 250 points okay
we'll<00:03:32.230> go<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.440> out<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.950> 12<00:03:33.220> models<00:03:33.430> on<00:03:33.730> the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
we'll go to out to the 12 models on the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.610 
we'll go to out to the 12 models on the
table<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.480> still<00:03:34.660> fairly<00:03:34.870> small<00:03:35.350> as<00:03:35.410> far

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
table so it's still fairly small as far

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.140

as the differ motorcraft models you're
dealing<00:03:37.450> with<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.750> that<00:03:37.840> we<00:03:37.960> pay<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:39.340> being<00:03:40.270> a

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
dealing with and that we pay is being a

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.760 
dealing with and that we pay is being a
skirmish<00:03:40.690> level<00:03:40.960> game<00:03:41.140> you'll<00:03:41.350> never<00:03:41.560> get

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
skirmish level game you'll never get

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.380 
skirmish level game you'll never get
more<00:03:41.890> than<00:03:41.980> about<00:03:42.220> 18<00:03:42.610> models<00:03:42.940> on<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.090> table
