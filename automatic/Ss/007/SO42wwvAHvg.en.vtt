00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
want to do a quick walkthrough of some

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.629 
of the features of the device you guys
have<00:00:11.490> probably<00:00:11.610> seen<00:00:11.940> some<00:00:13.490> pricing<00:00:14.490> some

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
have probably seen some pricing some

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.849 
have probably seen some pricing some
demos<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.199> might<00:00:16.350> not<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.500> very

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
demos of this so it might not be very

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.890 
demos of this so it might not be very
new<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.520> give<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> quick<00:00:18.449> run<00:00:18.600> through<00:00:18.630> of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
new but give you a quick run through of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.340 
new but give you a quick run through of
how<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.160> thing<00:00:20.430> works<00:00:21.020> basically<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.199> is

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
how the thing works basically this is

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.740 
how the thing works basically this is
your<00:00:22.590> home<00:00:22.769> screen<00:00:23.160> you've<00:00:23.430> got<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:24.210> bunch<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
your home screen you've got a bunch of

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.509 
your home screen you've got a bunch of
different<00:00:25.019> panels<00:00:25.350> here<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.920> believe<00:00:26.400> it's

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
different panels here I believe it's

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.779 
different panels here I believe it's
five<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.820> total<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:28.519> you<00:00:29.519> scroll<00:00:29.760> through

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
five in total and you scroll through

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.769 
five in total and you scroll through
them<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.210> as<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.660> it's

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
them like this as you can see it's

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.569 
them like this as you can see it's
growing<00:00:31.050> super<00:00:31.410> smooth<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.949> animation<00:00:32.430> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
growing super smooth the animation is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.080 
growing super smooth the animation is
really<00:00:33.420> really<00:00:33.570> fast<00:00:33.870> extremely<00:00:34.620> smooth<00:00:35.090> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
really really fast extremely smooth and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.229 
really really fast extremely smooth and
looks<00:00:37.050> generally<00:00:37.590> very<00:00:38.340> good<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
looks generally very good it's got a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.690 
looks generally very good it's got a
very<00:00:39.450> Tron<00:00:40.440> ish<00:00:40.680> motif<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.610> can

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
very Tron ish motif here and you can

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.060 
very Tron ish motif here and you can
actually<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.410> if<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.559> look<00:00:43.710> at<00:00:43.829> some<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
actually see if you look at some of the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.790 
actually see if you look at some of the
wallpapers<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:44.820> offer<00:00:45.000> their<00:00:45.989> they<00:00:46.620> almost

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
wallpapers they offer their they almost

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.860 
wallpapers they offer their they almost
look<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.129> they<00:00:47.430> they're<00:00:47.910> taken<00:00:48.390> right<00:00:48.840> from

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
look like they they're taken right from

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.500 
look like they they're taken right from
Tron<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.640> kind<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> cool<00:00:51.059> thing<00:00:51.120> it's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
Tron which is kind of a cool thing it's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
Tron which is kind of a cool thing it's
it's<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> say<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> reviews<00:00:52.920> it's

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
it's like I say in the reviews it's

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.060 
it's like I say in the reviews it's
almost<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.030> combination<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.590> got<00:00:55.770> some<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
almost a combination of it's got some of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.040 
almost a combination of it's got some of
the<00:00:56.160> dimensionality<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.420> photo<00:00:57.629> realism

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the dimensionality of the photo realism

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
the dimensionality of the photo realism
of<00:00:58.320> something<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.620> webos<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:59.219> iOS<00:00:59.489> but<00:00:59.820> it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
of something like webos or iOS but it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.229 
of something like webos or iOS but it
has<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> lot<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.539> chromeless<00:01:01.280> behavior<00:01:02.280> or

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
has a lot of the chromeless behavior or

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.410 
has a lot of the chromeless behavior or
the<00:01:03.420> chromeless<00:01:04.080> look<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.710> something<00:01:05.519> like

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the chromeless look of something like

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.620 
the chromeless look of something like
Windows<00:01:06.780> Phone<00:01:06.990> 7<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.310> kind<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.760> works<00:01:09.000> here

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
Windows Phone 7 so it kind of works here

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.060 
Windows Phone 7 so it kind of works here
you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:09.869> some<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> widgets<00:01:10.470> there's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you can see some of the widgets there's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.100 
you can see some of the widgets there's
everything<00:01:11.400> has<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.760> dimensionality<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
everything has this dimensionality to it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.700 
everything has this dimensionality to it
you<00:01:13.260> see<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.689> market<00:01:15.689> widget<00:01:16.049> which

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you see this is a market widget which

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.670 
you see this is a market widget which
has<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.490> sort<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.759> 3d<00:01:18.030> flipping<00:01:18.479> action<00:01:19.470> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
has this sort of 3d flipping action you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.350 
has this sort of 3d flipping action you
get<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.860> same<00:01:20.040> thing<00:01:20.280> with<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.490> books<00:01:21.119> app

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
get the same thing with the books app

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.990 
get the same thing with the books app
which<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.350> pretty<00:01:22.560> nice<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.549> when<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.790> move

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
which is pretty nice and when you move

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.789 
which is pretty nice and when you move
around<00:01:24.150> widgets<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> gives<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.170> you

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
around widgets it gives you this you

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.749 
around widgets it gives you this you
can't<00:01:26.040> really<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.310> might<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.610> able<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
can't really you might not be able to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.249 
can't really you might not be able to
see<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.030> because<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.479> grid<00:01:27.810> pattern

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
see it here because of this grid pattern

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.249 
see it here because of this grid pattern
and<00:01:28.409> sort<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> ghost<00:01:29.040> image<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.610> where<00:01:29.790> your

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
and sort of a ghost image of where your

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.300 
and sort of a ghost image of where your
widget<00:01:31.259> will<00:01:31.380> show<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:31.799> where<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.040> icon

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
widget will show up or where your icon

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.490 
widget will show up or where your icon
will<00:01:32.430> show<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.700> which<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.000> kind<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.299> cool<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
will show up which is kind of cool it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.219 
will show up which is kind of cool it
also<00:01:34.650> does<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:36.030> also<00:01:36.270> does<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.479> same<00:01:36.630> sort<00:01:37.200> of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
also does it also does the same sort of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.170 
also does it also does the same sort of
ghosting<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.159> icons<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.060> see

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
ghosting on the icons here you can see

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.569 
ghosting on the icons here you can see
along<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> side<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.439> gives<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> ghost

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
along the side it gives you a ghost

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.460 
along the side it gives you a ghost
impression<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> before<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.840> actually<00:01:43.110> see

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
impression of it before you actually see

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
impression of it before you actually see
it<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.220> general<00:01:44.549> navigation<00:01:45.030> works<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.360> this

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
it so general navigation works like this

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.060 
it so general navigation works like this
there's<00:01:45.930> three<00:01:46.200> buttons<00:01:46.290> down<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.619> back

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
there's three buttons down here back

many apps at all made for this format
look<00:04:34.220> really<00:04:34.729> weird<00:04:35.349> to<00:04:36.349> give<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.590> an<00:04:36.680> example

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
look really weird to give you an example

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.779 
look really weird to give you an example
we<00:04:37.610> can<00:04:37.759> show<00:04:38.210> off<00:04:40.930> let's<00:04:41.930> try<00:04:42.139> radio<00:04:43.069> or<00:04:43.370> Rdio

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
we can show off let's try radio or Rdio

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.809 
we can show off let's try radio or Rdio
I<00:04:44.380> mean<00:04:45.380> this<00:04:45.470> doesn't<00:04:45.620> look<00:04:45.830> that<00:04:45.889> bad<00:04:46.280> but<00:04:46.699> it

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
I mean this doesn't look that bad but it

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.059 
I mean this doesn't look that bad but it
also<00:04:46.940> clearly<00:04:47.750> isn't<00:04:47.990> formatted<00:04:48.710> for<00:04:49.009> a

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
also clearly isn't formatted for a

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.010 
also clearly isn't formatted for a
tablet<00:04:49.750> it's<00:04:50.750> just<00:04:51.199> stretch<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.680> stretched<00:04:52.069> a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
tablet it's just stretch a stretched a

cell<00:04:54.020> phone<00:04:54.289> interface<00:04:54.800> basically<00:04:55.580> but<00:04:56.180> there

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
cell phone interface basically but there

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.480 
cell phone interface basically but there
are<00:04:57.020> some<00:04:57.259> apps<00:04:57.470> that<00:04:57.830> are<00:04:57.919> specific<00:04:58.550> to<00:05:00.490> to

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
are some apps that are specific to to

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.589 
are some apps that are specific to to
the<00:05:01.610> zoom<00:05:01.849> and<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:03.310> honeycomb<00:05:04.310> like<00:05:04.699> Google

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
the zoom and to honeycomb like Google

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.260 
the zoom and to honeycomb like Google
body<00:05:05.870> which<00:05:06.199> is<00:05:06.349> really<00:05:06.560> interesting<00:05:07.070> it<00:05:07.759> is<00:05:07.970> a

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
body which is really interesting it is a

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.520 
body which is really interesting it is a
3d<00:05:09.080> human<00:05:09.949> body<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:11.660> you<00:05:11.870> can<00:05:12.020> actually<00:05:12.380> take

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
3d human body and you can actually take

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.770 
3d human body and you can actually take
it<00:05:12.650> apart<00:05:12.889> and<00:05:12.979> look<00:05:13.160> at<00:05:13.280> different<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:14.240> don't

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
it apart and look at different I don't

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.879 
it apart and look at different I don't
know<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.139> know<00:05:15.169> I<00:05:15.259> suppose<00:05:15.560> this<00:05:15.710> would<00:05:15.800> be

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
know you know I suppose this would be

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.790 
know you know I suppose this would be
good<00:05:16.009> for<00:05:16.190> doctors<00:05:16.639> or<00:05:16.940> curious<00:05:17.630> humans<00:05:18.139> but

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
good for doctors or curious humans but

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.610 
good for doctors or curious humans but
it's<00:05:19.430> clearly<00:05:20.000> formatted<00:05:20.569> for<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.870> tablet<00:05:21.259> it

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
it's clearly formatted for a tablet it

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.950 
it's clearly formatted for a tablet it
looks<00:05:21.770> really<00:05:22.250> beautiful<00:05:22.400> it<00:05:23.240> shows<00:05:23.539> what<00:05:23.930> you

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
looks really beautiful it shows what you

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.100 
looks really beautiful it shows what you
can<00:05:24.110> do<00:05:24.590> with<00:05:25.159> with<00:05:26.090> a<00:05:26.120> tablet<00:05:26.479> and<00:05:26.900> what<00:05:27.020> you

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
can do with with a tablet and what you

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.960 
can do with with a tablet and what you
can<00:05:27.259> do<00:05:27.409> with<00:05:27.620> honeycomb<00:05:27.889> and<00:05:28.099> the<00:05:28.460> android<00:05:28.849> OS

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
can do with honeycomb and the android OS

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.450 
can do with honeycomb and the android OS
but<00:05:29.500> there<00:05:30.500> aren't<00:05:30.710> that<00:05:30.889> many<00:05:30.949> apps<00:05:31.250> like

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
but there aren't that many apps like

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.839 
can see all of them or you can pop them
up<00:05:51.469> individually<00:05:51.620> by<00:05:52.159> pressing<00:05:52.699> on<00:05:52.820> the

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849

up individually by pressing on the
individual<00:05:54.009> icon<00:05:55.009> here<00:05:55.430> what's<00:05:55.969> weird<00:05:56.180> about

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
individual icon here what's weird about

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.790 
individual icon here what's weird about
it<00:05:56.449> is<00:05:56.690> you<00:05:56.810> can't<00:05:57.080> jump<00:05:57.289> from<00:05:57.469> one<00:05:57.620> to<00:05:57.770> the

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
it is you can't jump from one to the

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.830 
it is you can't jump from one to the
other<00:05:57.889> you<00:05:58.190> have<00:05:58.219> to<00:05:58.430> tap<00:05:59.090> off<00:05:59.360> of<00:05:59.539> it<00:05:59.659> and<00:05:59.719> then

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
other you have to tap off of it and then

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.499 
other you have to tap off of it and then
tap<00:06:00.020> on<00:06:00.229> to<00:06:00.409> the<00:06:00.500> next<00:06:00.710> one<00:06:00.830> so<00:06:01.699> that<00:06:02.150> can<00:06:02.360> be<00:06:02.389> a

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
tap on to the next one so that can be a

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.649 
tap on to the next one so that can be a
little<00:06:03.080> bit<00:06:03.320> annoying<00:06:04.210> you<00:06:05.210> also<00:06:05.449> get<00:06:05.539> an

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
little bit annoying you also get an

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:07.870 
little bit annoying you also get an
option<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.110> change<00:06:06.710> some<00:06:06.919> settings<00:06:07.280> in<00:06:07.520> this

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
option to change some settings in this

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.790 
option to change some settings in this
this<00:06:08.360> little<00:06:08.449> pop-up<00:06:08.930> so<00:06:09.259> real<00:06:09.409> desktop

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
this little pop-up so real desktop

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.399 
this little pop-up so real desktop
paradigm<00:06:10.190> feels<00:06:10.430> very<00:06:10.610> much<00:06:10.729> like<00:06:10.789> a<00:06:10.940> windows

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
paradigm feels very much like a windows

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.469 
paradigm feels very much like a windows
interface<00:06:12.409> but<00:06:12.830> it<00:06:13.370> works<00:06:13.639> it<00:06:14.090> works<00:06:14.150> really

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
interface but it works it works really

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.029 
interface but it works it works really
well<00:06:16.090> basically<00:06:17.090> the<00:06:17.599> the<00:06:17.960> core<00:06:18.469> of<00:06:18.620> this<00:06:18.740> OS

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
well basically the the core of this OS

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.029 
well basically the the core of this OS
is<00:06:19.250> great<00:06:19.780> the<00:06:20.780> getting<00:06:21.139> around<00:06:21.349> the<00:06:21.500> OS<00:06:21.710> is

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
is great the getting around the OS is

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.709 
is great the getting around the OS is
great<00:06:22.639> though<00:06:22.849> sometimes<00:06:23.270> a<00:06:23.389> little<00:06:23.509> bit

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
great though sometimes a little bit

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:25.990 
great though sometimes a little bit
confusing<00:06:24.289> the<00:06:25.070> big<00:06:25.400> problem<00:06:25.729> here<00:06:25.880> is<00:06:25.969> that

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
confusing the big problem here is that

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.180 
confusing the big problem here is that
it<00:06:26.180> feels<00:06:26.750> a<00:06:26.870> little<00:06:27.050> unfinished<00:06:27.440> it's<00:06:28.009> been

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
it feels a little unfinished it's been

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.860 
it feels a little unfinished it's been
somewhat<00:06:28.669> buggy<00:06:28.880> for<00:06:29.150> us<00:06:29.270> and<00:06:29.509> it<00:06:29.570> doesn't

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
somewhat buggy for us and it doesn't

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.390 
somewhat buggy for us and it doesn't
really<00:06:30.020> have<00:06:30.229> any<00:06:30.409> applications<00:06:31.070> right<00:06:31.250> now

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
really have any applications right now

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.990 
really have any applications right now
so<00:06:31.669> there's<00:06:32.330> not<00:06:32.570> a<00:06:32.630> lot<00:06:33.080> to<00:06:33.740> play<00:06:34.520> around<00:06:34.639> with

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
so there's not a lot to play around with

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.220 
so there's not a lot to play around with
it's<00:06:35.510> feels

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
it's feels

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.600 
it's feels
little<00:06:36.380> bit<00:06:36.470> like<00:06:36.590> a<00:06:36.620> dead<00:06:36.890> end<00:06:36.920> at<00:06:37.220> this<00:06:37.340> point

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
little bit like a dead end at this point

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.240 
little bit like a dead end at this point
so<00:06:37.880> we're<00:06:38.360> hoping<00:06:38.510> that<00:06:38.750> that<00:06:39.290> Google<00:06:40.040> gets

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
so we're hoping that that Google gets

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.430 
so we're hoping that that Google gets
its<00:06:40.430> tablet<00:06:41.420> development<00:06:41.990> really

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
its tablet development really

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.350 
its tablet development really
kick-started<00:06:42.770> with<00:06:43.250> this<00:06:43.460> and<00:06:43.820> we<00:06:44.060> started<00:06:44.270> to

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
kick-started with this and we started to

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.630 
kick-started with this and we started to
see<00:06:44.420> some<00:06:44.630> interest<00:06:44.870> in<00:06:44.930> software<00:06:45.350> but<00:06:45.740> that

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
see some interest in software but that

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.800 
see some interest in software but that
is<00:06:46.790> a<00:06:46.820> basic<00:06:47.090> look<00:06:47.390> at<00:06:47.570> the<00:06:47.990> motorola<00:06:48.680> xoom
