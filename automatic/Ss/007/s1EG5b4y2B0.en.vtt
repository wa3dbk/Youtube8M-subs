00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.260 
well but I'm learning you know the only
way<00:01:38.280> you're<00:01:38.400> gonna<00:01:38.460> learn<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.820> by<00:01:38.850> doing<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
way you're gonna learn is by doing it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.670 
way you're gonna learn is by doing it
right<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.630> lot<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.930> people<00:01:40.079> only<00:01:40.350> really

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
right a lot of people only really

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.560 
right a lot of people only really
remember<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.280> use<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:42.060> back<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
remember to use it to get back in the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.810 
remember to use it to get back in the
lane<00:01:42.810> quicker<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:44.250> get<00:01:44.340> me<00:01:44.399> wrong<00:01:44.610> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
lane quicker and don't get me wrong that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.580 
lane quicker and don't get me wrong that
as<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> potential<00:01:45.270> advantage<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.170> go<00:01:46.380> back<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
as a potential advantage you go back and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.139 
as a potential advantage you go back and
shop<00:01:46.890> get<00:01:47.430> back<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.670> your<00:01:47.729> fucking<00:01:48.030> lane

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
shop get back to your fucking lane

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.670 
shop get back to your fucking lane
without<00:01:48.329> really<00:01:48.780> missing<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.470> guess

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
without really missing out to guess

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.469 
without really missing out to guess
another<00:01:50.220> advantage<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.670> find<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.060> teleport

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
another advantage I find with teleport

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.719 
another advantage I find with teleport
is<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.899> help<00:01:52.110> your<00:01:52.229> jungle<00:01:52.740> early

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
is that you can help your jungle early

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.940 
is that you can help your jungle early
game<00:01:53.939> maybe<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.509> an<00:01:54.600> invade<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.380> defend

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
game maybe with an invade or defend

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980

their<00:01:56.130> buffle<00:01:56.549> whatever<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:57.840> when

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
their buffle whatever and then when

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.840 
their buffle whatever and then when
that's<00:01:58.140> done<00:01:58.439> terrible<00:01:59.250> back<00:01:59.399> up<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> top

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that's done terrible back up the top

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.370 
that's done terrible back up the top
lane<00:02:00.060> pecially<00:02:00.450> after<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.780> got<00:02:00.930> first<00:02:01.200> blood

delicious<00:02:04.200> first<00:02:04.439> blood<00:02:04.710> money<00:02:04.920> mmm<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
delicious first blood money mmm but the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.210 
delicious first blood money mmm but the
biggest<00:02:06.270> thing<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.810> find<00:02:07.110> about<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
biggest thing I find about it is it it

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.089 
biggest thing I find about it is it it
gives<00:02:08.640> global<00:02:09.450> pressure<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.920> could

gives global pressure like you could

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.910 
gives global pressure like you could
potentially<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:12.090> any

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
pushed the top lane a little bit and you

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.210 
pushed the top lane a little bit and you
go<00:02:35.000> into<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.390> bush<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.900> then<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.739> teleport

shit up another great thing about having

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.720 
shit up another great thing about having
that<00:02:47.810> global<00:02:48.380> pressure<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:49.550> you're

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
that global pressure is that if you're

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.090 
that global pressure is that if you're
not<00:02:49.850> really<00:02:50.209> doing<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:51.019> well<00:02:51.319> in<00:02:51.620> your<00:02:51.830> lane

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
not really doing that well in your lane

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.009 
not really doing that well in your lane
but<00:02:52.640> bot<00:02:52.850> Lane<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.180> overextending<00:02:53.840> like<00:02:53.989> a

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
but bot Lane is overextending like a

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.410 
but bot Lane is overextending like a
bitch<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.980> they're<00:02:55.519> low<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.060> they're

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
bitch and they're low and they're

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.809 
bitch and they're low and they're
sticking<00:02:56.600> around<00:02:56.780> because<00:02:57.500> it's<00:02:58.040> bronze<00:02:58.370> or

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
sticking around because it's bronze or

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.880 
sticking around because it's bronze or
silver<00:02:59.209> or<00:02:59.780> whatever<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.230> fuck<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.650> can<00:03:00.769> get

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
silver or whatever the fuck you can get

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.500 
silver or whatever the fuck you can get
the<00:03:00.980> sneaky<00:03:01.310> double<00:03:01.610> kill<00:03:01.760> or<00:03:01.940> at<00:03:02.030> least<00:03:02.060> help

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the sneaky double kill or at least help

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.180 
the sneaky double kill or at least help
the<00:03:02.660> ad<00:03:02.810> carry<00:03:03.140> get<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.440> double<00:03:03.709> kill<00:03:03.890> that's

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
the ad carry get the double kill that's

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.890 
the ad carry get the double kill that's
probably<00:03:04.640> better<00:03:04.910> letting<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.480> carry<00:03:05.690> get

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
probably better letting the carry get

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.150 
probably better letting the carry get
the<00:03:05.989> double<00:03:06.230> kill<00:03:06.380> but<00:03:06.830> there's<00:03:06.980> basically

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
the double kill but there's basically

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.100 
the double kill but there's basically
the<00:03:07.400> two<00:03:07.549> arguments<00:03:07.819> between<00:03:08.150> teleport<00:03:08.959> and

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
the two arguments between teleport and

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.610 
the two arguments between teleport and
ignite<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.860> also<00:03:10.670> think<00:03:11.090> teleport<00:03:11.720> is<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:12.290> little

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
ignite I also think teleport is a little

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.410 
ignite I also think teleport is a little
bit<00:03:12.709> better<00:03:12.890> late<00:03:13.280> game<00:03:13.549> especially<00:03:13.970> when

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420
