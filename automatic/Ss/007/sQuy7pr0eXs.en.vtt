00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.740
 made on the bodies revealed nothing. Now instead of a tourist resort for Taiwan's wealthiest people, San Zhi is just a mini ghost town left to the elements of nature.

 Aokigahara or Sea of ​​Trees as it is known, is a 35km² forest at the northwest base of Mount Fuji, Japan. The forest contains a large number of rocks and ice caves, some of which are popular tourist spots. The density of the trees hinder the wind and cause the absence of wildlife, Aokigahara is known to be strangely and extremely silent.

 Legends about forest are told. Some relate it to demons and evil spirits characteristic of Japanese mythology and is known to be a common site of suicide. In 2010, 54 people completed the act in the forest, despite numerous messages in Japanese and English for people to reconsider their actions. 

00:03:13.394 --> 00:04:05.874
 The forest soil is mainly composed of volcanic rock, and it is difficult to penetrate it with hand tools such as shovels. There are several unofficial trails that are generally used to hunt the bodies, which happens with a certain regularity done by local volunteers. In recent years, hikers and tourists have started marking the paths by plastic tape in order to find the same trail again, there is also the possibility that this is done by undecided suicides, who advance to secondary tracks thinking about committing the act.
