00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.229
 hello girls hello everyone is a pleasure 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.629
 as always to greet you here in this your 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:10.270
 channel divinity and today I'm going to present 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:13.630
 a beautiful design from my point of 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.880
 very easy to see view is a 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.130
 little laborious however it is the most 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.919
 simple that you can imagine 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.380
 to begin with we are going to require our 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.619
 completely clean dry fingernails 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.960
 free of any acetone residue and 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.290
 preferably do not run out of 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.320
 wash that does not have moisture either 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.199
 that this is going to make it last longer 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.629
 enameled when the nail is wet 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.859
 tends to last very little the enameled by 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.300
 that's what I recommend you be 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.120
 completely dry the surface 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.760
 then we will choose the shades 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.879
 of our preference in this case I 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.019
 I chose colors from the blue blue range 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.750
 Turquoise green bluish colors by 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.019
 style and we're also going to require 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.380
 blue lilac brush type enamels 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.689
 purple those that we have 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.630
 and we are going to require pieces of 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.479
 sponge we will not need much and I 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.350
 I will use what is sponge 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.509
 a little porous is not as closed as 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.850
 the sponge to apply makeup is 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.070
 I like it a lot, it's going to favor me a lot 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.069
 for the effect that I want to give already 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.829
 then with this sponge we are going to 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:33.140
 Apply white enamel on the surface 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.780
 of all our nails can be in the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.610
 whole in half if you have 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.049
 Very short nails, I recommend you 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.720
 be totally legal 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.630
 the fluff can also also 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.599
 apply normal white enamel on the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.189
 surface even if it is not with sponge 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:52.490
 but this will make the colors 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.610
 let's put on free in more and see each other 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.619
 prettiest more colorful below 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.709
 let's take another piece of sponge 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.470
 we can make use of some pints already 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.649
 be professional or to pluck and 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.009
 let's occupy a part of this sponge 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.370
 we are going to apply a color and we are going to 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.079
 well the small surfaces of all 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.750
 our nails we are going to do a calculation 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.930
 If we use five colors, we will 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.810
 apply what they are 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.130
 and a fifth of each color in the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.690
 surface of our nails 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.480
 Later we can change sides 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.950
 this sponge to not waste so much 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.830
 and we apply another bit of color in 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.710
 each one of our nails so we're going to 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.220
 do with each of the colors of 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.610
 so that this effect is already in itself 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.400
 so it looks nice later we're going to 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.520
 take what are the type glazes 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:59.370
 brush and let's make lines about 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:01.050
 strokes when roasting about two or three lines in 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.390
 our favorite color preferably 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.980
 maybe a stronger color and 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.250
 later with our brush 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.280
 We can use a lighter color and 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.080
 let's make this effect of the lines 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.980
 even if they pass over the lines that already 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.240
 had done previously 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.690
 later we can make some 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:28.120
 applications with sets of colors 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.340
 flower applications 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.400
 in the center we can apply a color 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.650
 yellow so that it stands out more and in the end 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.319
 do not forget to apply the top coat 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.770
 It will be very beautiful 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.230
 something that I loved 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.570
 I really liked the realization of this 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.690
 design that I hope you will carry out 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.069
 if you carry it out you can send me the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.290
 video as video response 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.120
 I hope this design was your 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.000
 total liking I send you a kiss very 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:06.580
