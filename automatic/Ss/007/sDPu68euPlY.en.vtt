00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.940
 The riot has an eye on us 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.500
 the report is our tormentor 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.400
 I've rolled everybody and now I've been banned. 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.960
 Ah the boys are trash 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.780
 The riot has an eye on us 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.380
 the report is our tormentor 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.160
 I've rolled everybody and now I've been banned. 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.580
 Ah the boys are trash 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.735
 I started picking the Kassadin 

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:58.735
 My team thought it was good, but it's not like that. 

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:00.495
 I caught smite and found it bad. 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.740
 Kassadin jungle is feasible yes pirilin 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.213
 the team announced the report 

00:01:04.214 --> 00:01:06.214
 I ate your mother after feedei the bot. 

00:01:06.214 --> 00:01:07.955
 for gold with me you do not go up 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.260
 and I do not even care, trollo for sport 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.643
 I'm going to see a drawing on Sky 

00:01:11.643 --> 00:01:13.335
 or upar in WoW because the link only falls 

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:15.154
 Why do not we have the brass in our shoes? 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.540
 always blame the team and that Vi 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.795
 I will not use my TP 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.860
 If I won the lane, why would I go down? 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.554
 and if the dragon you want to do 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.520
 everybody died, flw base 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.500
 The riot has an eye on us 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.180
 the report is our tormentor 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.960
 I've rolled everybody and now I've been banned. 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.700
 Ah the boys are trash 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.420
 The riot has an eye on us 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.900
 the report is our tormentor 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.760
 I've rolled everybody and now I've been banned. 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.200
 Ah the boys are trash 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.960
 then I went from Hecarim 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.815
 My team thought it was good, but it's not like that. 

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:23.674
 I made rabadon and found it bad. 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.900
 Hecarim Ap is feasible yes pirilin 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.255
 already with more than 20 deaths 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.320
 I do not want to play my team, just fuck me. 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.094
 that my jungle that never comes top 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.320
 Why ward if my champion runs? 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.703
 I'm going to see a drawing on Sky 

00:02:34.703 --> 00:02:36.474
 or upar in WoW because the link only falls 

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:38.315
 Why do not we have the brass in our shoes? 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.600
 always blame the team and that Vi 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.015
 Now I'm going to jungle to see 

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:43.974
 My god, I'm dead without life, I'm going to die. 

00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:45.715
 I lost the dragon without realizing it 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.280
 I forgot to mention the smite ta on the CD 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.000
 I swear I do not understand what's going on in your head. 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.380
 You play without will and defeat is certain. 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.500
 My sadness is not to lose a match. 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.640
 is to see that you, by the way, feeda 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.720
 I do not even say you're noob, why noob is clever 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.240
 it tends to evolve with the instruction of others 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.200
 your carcass can not stand 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.620
 Then you will learn the lessons that life brings. 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.640
 What's the use of having it in your face? 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.800
 if your attitude is of a spoiled child 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.040
 to play outside the goal, even if you're wrong 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.720
 try to learn with the free 150 ml 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.480
 Before you look at the team, look at yourself. 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.900
 if you are well in your lane help the others do not be afraid 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.680
 Do not type anything, even if it irritates you. 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.000
 if you are good alone, imagine with your team 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.100
 and if someone has played badly, it happens that we are human 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.400
 At one time or another we always go by the barrel 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.620
 but it is no use highlighting what is worse 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.880
 after a rage nobody plays better 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.920
 So close with me and go forward. 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.360
 Let's evolve the skills and your mind 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.240
 even if defeat is eminent 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.780
 Let's lose with honor and not give a damn 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.840
 Riot already likes nois 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.380
 I'm just watching the pros stream. 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.140
 along with Yetz, I just rage at Arlindo 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.760
 Ah, the boys are myths 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.520
 Riot already likes nois 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.200
 I'm just watching the pros stream. 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.020
 along with Yetz, I just rage at Arlindo
