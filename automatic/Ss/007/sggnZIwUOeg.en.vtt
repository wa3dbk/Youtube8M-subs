mentioning that she was having issues
sometimes<00:00:32.189> she<00:00:32.489> would<00:00:32.610> go<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.730> start<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> car

all<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> instrument<00:00:34.469> lights<00:00:34.620> would<00:00:34.829> act<00:00:35.010> all

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
all the instrument lights would act all

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.299

weird<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.960> van<00:00:37.110> wouldn't<00:00:37.469> start<00:00:37.710> well<00:00:38.250> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
weird and the van wouldn't start well I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.549 
weird and the van wouldn't start well I
never<00:00:38.370> got<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.420> act<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> entire<00:00:40.290> time

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
never got that to act up the entire time

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.780 
never got that to act up the entire time
I<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.309> actually<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
I was here and was actually here a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.080 
I was here and was actually here a
couple<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> months<00:00:42.770> but<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.040> course<00:00:44.309> she<00:00:44.850> takes

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
couple of months but of course she takes

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.170 
couple of months but of course she takes
it<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> week<00:00:46.230> later<00:00:46.489> it<00:00:47.489> starts<00:00:47.879> acting

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
it and not a week later it starts acting

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.080 
it and not a week later it starts acting
up<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.230> problem<00:00:49.680> occurs<00:00:50.010> well<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
up and and that problem occurs well it

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
up and and that problem occurs well it
just<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.480> happened<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.320> day<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.829> was

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
just so happened that that day it was

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.189 
just so happened that that day it was
like<00:00:53.219> 90<00:00:53.460> degrees<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.390> 90%<00:00:54.750> humidity

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
like 90 degrees and like 90% humidity

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.790 
like 90 degrees and like 90% humidity
and<00:00:55.710> that's<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> acted<00:00:57.000> up<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.800> that's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and that's when it acted up and that's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.130 
and that's when it acted up and that's
not<00:00:59.070> uncommon<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.789> experience<00:01:00.329> either

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
not uncommon my experience either

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.860 
not uncommon my experience either
extreme<00:01:01.859> hot<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.550> extreme<00:01:03.000> cold<00:01:03.030> seem<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
extreme hot or extreme cold seem to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.980 
extreme hot or extreme cold seem to
coincide<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:05.220> lot<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> lot<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> breakdowns

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
coincide with a lot of lot of breakdowns

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.070 
coincide with a lot of lot of breakdowns
and<00:01:07.350> those<00:01:07.560> breakdowns<00:01:08.010> may<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.250> similar<00:01:08.700> like

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
and those breakdowns may be similar like

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.020 
and those breakdowns may be similar like
batteries<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.619> particular<00:01:10.950> tend<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> fail

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
batteries in particular tend to fail

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
batteries in particular tend to fail
when<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> gets<00:01:12.630> extremely<00:01:12.900> hot<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.409> extremely

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
when it gets extremely hot or extremely

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640 
when it gets extremely hot or extremely
cold<00:01:14.360> just<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.689> other<00:01:15.960> items<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.470> well

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
cold just and other items as well

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.560 
cold just and other items as well
because<00:01:17.070> there's<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> lot<00:01:17.610> more<00:01:17.790> stress<00:01:18.180> put<00:01:18.479> on

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
because there's a lot more stress put on

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.810 
because there's a lot more stress put on
the<00:01:18.720> system<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.290> time<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.369> wanted

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the system at that time so I just wanted

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.380 
the system at that time so I just wanted
to<00:01:20.970> throw<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.869> out<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.729> see<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.240> know

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
to throw this out there and see you know

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.929 
to throw this out there and see you know
what<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:24.810> experiences<00:01:25.439> were<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.759> just

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
what your experiences were but it just

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.910 
what your experiences were but it just
seemed<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.299> me<00:01:27.450> over<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> course<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.829> my

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
seemed to me over the course of my

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.460 
seemed to me over the course of my
career<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.540> extremely<00:01:31.229> cold

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
career that if it was extremely cold

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.880 
career that if it was extremely cold
outside<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:33.509> night<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.409> day<00:01:34.619> or

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
outside on a one night or one day or

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.390 
outside on a one night or one day or
whatever

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
whatever

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
whatever
all<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> sudden<00:01:36.390> we'd<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> run<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
all of a sudden we'd have a run on a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.870 
all of a sudden we'd have a run on a
bunch<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.860> different<00:01:38.189> types<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.490> breakdowns

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
bunch of different types of breakdowns

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.550 
bunch of different types of breakdowns
that<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.540> know<00:01:39.630> sort<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.930> coincided<00:01:40.439> with

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that you know sort of coincided with

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.899 
that you know sort of coincided with
that<00:01:41.180> electrical<00:01:42.180> problems<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.670> just<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.759> wide

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
that electrical problems and just a wide

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.510 
that electrical problems and just a wide
variety<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.450> things<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:46.470> stuff<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.070> general

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
variety of things just stuff in general

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.310 
variety of things just stuff in general
because<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.360> things<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.780> colder<00:01:49.170> they

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
because as things get colder they

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.980 
because as things get colder they
contract<00:01:50.000> they<00:01:51.000> may<00:01:51.270> become<00:01:51.600> more<00:01:51.780> brittle

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
contract they may become more brittle

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.700 
contract they may become more brittle
and<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.399> result<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.420> fluids<00:01:54.869> become<00:01:55.380> really

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and as a result of fluids become really

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.399
