00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.660 

recently<00:00:29.810> an<00:00:29.990> entirely<00:00:30.710> new<00:00:31.040> system<00:00:31.340> was

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
recently an entirely new system was

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.689 
recently an entirely new system was
added<00:00:31.940> to<00:00:32.090> all<00:00:32.210> this<00:00:32.769> it<00:00:33.769> is<00:00:33.829> a<00:00:34.010> system<00:00:34.579> of

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
added to all this it is a system of

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.950 
added to all this it is a system of
numbered<00:00:35.420> junctions<00:00:36.199> the<00:00:37.629> signs<00:00:38.629> with

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
numbered junctions the signs with

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.819 
numbered junctions the signs with
numbers<00:00:39.469> can<00:00:39.890> be<00:00:39.920> seen<00:00:40.339> everywhere

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.389 

not<00:00:45.790> only<00:00:46.149> in<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.390> center<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.870> large<00:00:47.110> cities

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.139 

but<00:00:51.399> also<00:00:51.640> in<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.329> countryside

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.959 

so<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:57.989> does<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.440> system<00:00:58.680> work<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.850> an

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
so how does this system work there is an

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
so how does this system work there is an
elaborate<00:01:00.390> network<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:01.050> cycle<00:01:01.469> routes<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
elaborate network of cycle routes and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.410 
elaborate network of cycle routes and
each<00:01:02.579> Junction<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.239> numbered<00:01:05.150> from<00:01:06.150> each

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
each Junction is numbered from each

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420 
each Junction is numbered from each
Junction<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.440> signs<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> nearest

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
Junction there are signs to the nearest

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.359 
Junction there are signs to the nearest
Junction<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.810> makes<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.560> easy<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.009> plot<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
Junction this makes it easy to plot a

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.850 
Junction this makes it easy to plot a
route<00:01:11.780> going<00:01:12.780> from<00:01:13.020> here

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
route going from here

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.200 
route going from here
to<00:01:15.130> here<00:01:15.430> would<00:01:16.330> be<00:01:16.540> possible<00:01:17.110> via<00:01:17.560> this<00:01:17.800> route

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
to here would be possible via this route

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.780 
to here would be possible via this route
it<00:01:19.210> can<00:01:19.480> be<00:01:19.630> planned<00:01:19.900> online<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:20.830> during<00:01:21.670> this
