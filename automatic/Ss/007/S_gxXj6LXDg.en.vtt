00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.559
 Hi, everyone, January, accompanying here. 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.440
 level for another video the top 10 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.350
 although it's not a top 10 it 's a video of ours 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.029
 It's favorite because we can not 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.580
 reach a consensus and in our 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.590
 regionally we are going to do a test of the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.230
 best rpgs our politicians to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.910
 still not spending - games and 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.859
 lost so greenpeace launched our 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.410
 have chosen one of the top ten 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.850
 example is a gender raises and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.950
 raise the discussion because we 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.809
 let's also discuss here what it is 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.790
 nerd rings 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.649
 not only those that we like the most 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.750
 that we think it best to put a genius of 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.370
 one way but what it is that makes a game of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.070
 rpg that now exist lament for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.710
 example your options 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.690
 so we decided to make a top 5 myself 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.920
 I chose a spot that did little to excite the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.949
 eyes and so on until 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.270
 We closed the first place is my fifth 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.640
 in fifth place 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.120
 I'm going to start a new year, it's my fifth. 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.909
 place is the final fantasy 7 is a game of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.490
 playstation that she inter helps to sign 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.580
 a rpg genre itself also stated 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.130
 definitely sony while brand 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.930
 video games to your playstation brand is the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.009
 highest point of the work eventually 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.689
 You're going to talk too, and surprising. 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.920
 for all its gameplay for being 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.560
 the first game of the final fantasy series 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.290
 from the primacy of the game itself to the detriment of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.280
 of the place's history 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.070
 lost dc is an exclusive xbox 360 that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.009
 I believe a car in oblivion 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.619
 I have already taken a modern daily bid but 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.990
 adopts a very structure class 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.119
 with great enemies budgetary rigor 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.570
 monster as timely 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.759
 I respect very much the only classics and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.380
 me of my articles is anxious 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.000
 the last years the cup 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.119
 the story for me was that the background 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.860
 national and the two left in a corner 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:05.790
 tears functional development in 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.060
 page explains number 4 for me tax 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.300
 the parish game priest kessy is in my 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.460
 opinion one of the best 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.500
 José Luis Alencar is best to ask for 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.950
 He went out to harvest the last of the consoles 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.540
 blind test and because it means the system 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.150
 of the house because he is 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.700
 addictive exactly how a rpg should be 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.550
 and then you have 17 in absolutely great 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.500
 of flying ships and ipi finishes first 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:35.460
 Now, you do not need anything more rigorous. 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:38.350
 real in its place plays nerds origins and 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.000
 I think any Bahian player can 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.910
 be implanted here but for 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.860
 me is this my favorite though many 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.220
 people who collect more spectrum to 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.750
 I am a wealth of this world and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.990
 strange moral characters for me 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.090
 I'm at the peak of the morning the organ does not 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.670
 agree with me but no this question does not 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.300
 I can be more than 126 easier for me 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.750
 but the fantasy avatar 2 but now the 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.730
 system is very similar without at least having 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.290
 place is one of the ones that generated more discussion 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.730
 here one of those responsible for this does not 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.800
 Are few 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.320
 not so much by the choice of title itself 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.600
 that's what I'll tell you is the ocarina of time 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.739
 the official agenda of a game in 1998 to 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.010
 nintendo 64 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.610
 until now yes, but the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.970
 discussion was more on fax zelda is or not 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.070
 is today is I think the games are 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.900
 that's the perspective that was powerful 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.030
 spain by the option I continue to see it 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.150
 I'll probably always see her as 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.160
 rpg and understand the current government is not 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.709
 hard to believe what the game was 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.810
 between your 3ds zelda series between your 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.000
 daily dynamic cycle the penalty kicks 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.670
 answer the video games use the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.070
 music as an integral part play and 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.070
 french thousand conspiracy banners 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.720
 train in the village scrolls v skyrim in 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.459
 any game was gradually reduced 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:06.340
 here but these once again is is not to 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.970
 entered by the combination is that 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.769
 indecency amaral series 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.730
 my career was the culmination of football 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.340
 the game 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.489
 and it is a debate and norm with 1 million 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.130
 school farm and have to meet with 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:26.800
 indices between hundreds of hours nor 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:29.830
 stay my hundredth your place is another 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.600
 player I was just what is the game was 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.970
 buy an xbox the first zone 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.250
 I bought the same console if it 's the star wars 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.690
 knights of the old republic explain 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.660
 because I think the model and panicat 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.669
 who was the game that defined the 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.410
 bioware rpg style later on 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.940
 brought the day to agnelli himself 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.130
 What did you say an an effect is the father of? 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.930
 back because although the topic combat 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.370
 deforestation and france which is a 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.270
 of shifts the singer 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.240
 then I'm a big fan of the star series 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.330
 wars and was dining the handy to enjoyable 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.240
 choose the dark side of the moon place 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.550
 persona 4 goldani a game that still 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.550
 I'm still addicted but confess that 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.350
 discover feeling with the family 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:19.450
 buying ps vita although it already had 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:22.720
 He had released the tie at 2-2 in 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:26.349
 Argentina very well built at 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.030
 in haste students did not have a 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.830
 while the next record at the time 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.080
 roberto budget there and has the calendar 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.669
 to school should be very 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.789
 funny and have to train a lot 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:40.419
 plays degree is not always more remarkable 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:43.450
 still the first place I want mine is 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:46.780
 easy to guess is the team that also 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.310
 encompasses crafts and jazz because it 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.560
 times money at other times we already 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.889
 we did a good game and I have 300 days of 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.599
 your home but if you had to defend 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.610
 it is also easy to sell small games 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.160
 most successful financial history 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.530
 even went through the hand millions of dollars 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.560
 in ten years it is the idea of gender 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.260
 I know it's not a game for everyone. 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.389
 people who have now with celso can not 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.849
 being now we have a boy born to have 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.889
 perfect group but not in 2010 and 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.410
 on duty since I spent most of my 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.680
 my time as the gamer of my life 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.199
 while baby would have to be always 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.680
 the premiere will be in this microwave and this 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:28.169
 Hand argument spending a lot of time at home 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.070
 without much time to play pokémon from 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.539
 the childhood so far influenced by the 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.240
 first place where the pokémon but which 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.580
 God is the lord to me, as always. 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.340
 keep on the beginning squad is that 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.990
 initial fancy santa clara to this 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.509
 exceeded expectations have a cycle 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:49.350
 First time in our area 15 in the evening 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:52.050
 who financed the Pokémon because the 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.240
 sections and a very serious error. 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.130
 sun use of some dices in the 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.530
 original investment 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.900
 after exploring the new area in the corner 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:04.259
 could not be together for the area of 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:09.030
 13 after a battle at the end with the 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:13.699
 ego but does not destroy its passage 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:16.560
 we have many fans of the fortinet is 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:18.660

 Problems we met there yes 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:24.270
 something is really funny or if we have 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:26.550
 some way too big 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.409
 suffered and do not tire of signing up and
