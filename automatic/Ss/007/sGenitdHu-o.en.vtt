00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
video that has to do with the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.440 
video that has to do with the
differences<00:00:07.649> between<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:08.069> jailbroken<00:00:08.670> ipod

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
differences between a jailbroken ipod

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.129 
differences between a jailbroken ipod
and<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:10.160> regular<00:00:11.160> ipod<00:00:11.490> i<00:00:12.030> don't<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:12.929> two

and a regular ipod i don't have two
ipods<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.769> me<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> can't<00:00:14.429> show<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.730> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
ipods on me so I can't show you the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.269 
ipods on me so I can't show you the
differences<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.780> i'll<00:00:15.900> demonstrate<00:00:16.650> through

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
differences but i'll demonstrate through

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.200 
differences but i'll demonstrate through
my<00:00:17.460> jailbroke<00:00:18.029> ipod<00:00:18.800> yes<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.070> jo-jo<00:00:20.760> broke<00:00:21.029> it

my jailbroke ipod yes I jo-jo broke it
at<00:00:21.740> 2.2<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.789> second<00:00:24.180> generation

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
at 2.2 this is the second generation

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.419 
at 2.2 this is the second generation
with<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.680> volume<00:00:26.039> rockers<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.890> let's

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
with the volume rockers so let's

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.080 
with the volume rockers so let's
demonstrate<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.060> differences<00:00:31.880> first<00:00:32.880> I'll

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
demonstrate the differences first I'll

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.010 
demonstrate the differences first I'll
start<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:34.010> you<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.280> also<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:36.210> add<00:00:36.960> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
start it up you can also just add a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.520 
start it up you can also just add a
custom<00:00:38.329> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.510> add<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> custom<00:00:39.899> startup

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
custom you can add a custom startup

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.910 
custom you can add a custom startup
image<00:00:41.149> through<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.239> quick<00:00:42.510> freedom<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.079> sure

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
image through a quick freedom I'm sure

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.600 
image through a quick freedom I'm sure
there's<00:00:44.160> more<00:00:45.950> applications<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.460> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
there's more applications that can do it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.540 
there's more applications that can do it
but<00:00:48.050> yeah<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.260> add<00:00:49.559> add<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.280> through

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
but yeah you can add add that through

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.610 
but yeah you can add add that through
quick<00:00:50.910> freedom<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.809> how<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> Joe<00:00:52.350> broke

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
quick freedom that's how I Joe broke

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.119 
quick freedom that's how I Joe broke
mine<00:00:53.780> that's<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.020> difference<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.920> don't

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
mine that's one difference so you don't

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.709 
mine that's one difference so you don't
have<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.579> stupid<00:00:57.000> little<00:00:57.149> silver

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
have to have that stupid little silver

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.560 
have to have that stupid little silver
Apple<00:00:58.379> showing<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.190> even<00:01:00.180> though<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.359> still

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
Apple showing up even though it still

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.310 
Apple showing up even though it still
does<00:01:00.780> kind<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.190> okay<00:01:02.239> all<00:01:03.239> right<00:01:03.390> another

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
does kind of okay all right another

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.469 
does kind of okay all right another
difference<00:01:04.939> you<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.570> app<00:01:06.900> called<00:01:07.320> cydia

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
difference you have an app called cydia

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.560 
difference you have an app called cydia
upon<00:01:09.799> startup<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.939> basically<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.510> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
upon startup this is basically so you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.800 
upon startup this is basically so you
can<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.170> packages<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:15.479> stuff

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
called toggle SSH it helps me with just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.240 
called toggle SSH it helps me with just
getting<00:01:30.090> files<00:01:30.450> off<00:01:30.720> my<00:01:30.900> computer<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.650> my<00:01:31.680> ipod

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
getting files off my computer to my ipod

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.360 
getting files off my computer to my ipod
then<00:01:32.909> i<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.180> mac<00:01:33.450> man

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
then i have mac man

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.280 
then i have mac man
that<00:01:35.370> one's<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:36.300> ver<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.530> clone<00:01:37.830> of<00:01:39.290> pac-man

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
that one's a ver it's a clone of pac-man

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.460 
that one's a ver it's a clone of pac-man
but<00:01:40.800> it's<00:01:41.190> just<00:01:41.990> tilt<00:01:42.990> sensor<00:01:43.380> instead<00:01:43.830> so<00:01:44.790> um

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
but it's just tilt sensor instead so um

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.560 
but it's just tilt sensor instead so um
yeah<00:01:46.490> that's<00:01:47.490> one<00:01:47.729> difference<00:01:47.910> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.270> get

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
yeah that's one difference you can get

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.840 
yeah that's one difference you can get
different<00:01:49.080> apps<00:01:49.530> from<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.950> cydia<00:01:50.369> store<00:01:50.460> for

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
different apps from the cydia store for

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.800 
different apps from the cydia store for
free<00:01:52.850> another<00:01:53.850> difference<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:54.450> probably

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
free another difference would probably

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.969 
free another difference would probably
be<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.259> fact<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:57.660> paid

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
be the fact that you can get the paid

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.080 
be the fact that you can get the paid
ipod<00:01:58.979> apps<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.640> free<00:02:00.560> from<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> App<00:02:01.830> Store

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
ipod apps for free from the App Store

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.370 
ipod apps for free from the App Store
not<00:02:03.090> through<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.630> app<00:02:03.690> store<00:02:03.720> but<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.290> have

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
not through the app store but you have

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.840 
not through the app store but you have
to<00:02:04.470> download<00:02:04.619> them<00:02:05.040> from<00:02:05.190> your<00:02:05.340> computer

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
to download them from your computer

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.120 
to download them from your computer
change<00:02:06.509> some<00:02:06.690> settings<00:02:07.080> on<00:02:07.259> your<00:02:07.289> ipod<00:02:07.890> touch

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
change some settings on your ipod touch

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.790 
change some settings on your ipod touch
then<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.390> get<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.600> transfer<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> motor<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
then you get to transfer the motor and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.010 
then you get to transfer the motor and
you<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.730> at<00:02:11.880> least<00:02:11.910> one<00:02:12.209> free<00:02:12.780> app

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you have to have at least one free app

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.949 
you have to have at least one free app
or<00:02:13.350> paid<00:02:13.620> half<00:02:13.920> before<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.459> do<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.720> um

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
or paid half before you do this so um

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.949 
or paid half before you do this so um
like<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.920> for<00:02:17.370> example<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.850> have<00:02:17.880> idea<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:20.780> have<00:02:21.780> I

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
like I for example I have idea I have I

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:30.800 
like I for example I have idea I have I
pines<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.940> milk<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.989> soda<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
pines I milk I soda and so on so the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.509 
pines I milk I soda and so on so the
third<00:02:31.170> difference<00:02:31.620> would<00:02:31.860> probably<00:02:32.250> be<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
third difference would probably be the

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.979 
third difference would probably be the
fact<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.350> yeah<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:36.300> go<00:02:36.480> into<00:02:36.690> your<00:02:36.720> settings

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
fact that yeah you go into your settings

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.250 
fact that yeah you go into your settings
and<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.530> go<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.709> general<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:39.420> if<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:40.019> really

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
and you go to general but if you really

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.460 
and you go to general but if you really
get<00:02:40.590> into<00:02:41.040> your<00:02:41.400> jailbroken<00:02:42.299> ipod<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.200> you

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
get into your jailbroken ipod and you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.449 
get into your jailbroken ipod and you
like<00:02:43.769> any<00:02:44.040> use<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> bunch<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.850> memory<00:02:45.530> yeah<00:02:46.530> you

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
like any use a bunch of memory yeah you

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.610 
like any use a bunch of memory yeah you
use<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> lot<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.120> memory<00:02:48.510> with<00:02:48.720> all<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.959> apps<00:02:49.170> or

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
use a lot of memory with all the apps or

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.199 
use a lot of memory with all the apps or
like<00:02:50.160> all<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:51.079> like<00:02:52.079> emulators<00:02:52.950> or<00:02:53.370> roms<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
like all the like emulators or roms and

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.620 
like all the like emulators or roms and
all<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:56.910> take<00:02:57.090> up<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.420> lot<00:02:57.570> of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
all that and you can take up a lot of

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.319 
all that and you can take up a lot of
your<00:02:57.780> space<00:02:58.079> so<00:02:58.410> upon<00:02:59.310> easing<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.790> jailbroken

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
your space so upon easing and jailbroken

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.350 
your space so upon easing and jailbroken
ipod<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:02.220> use<00:03:02.519> up<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.790> lot<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:03.120> space

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
ipod it can use up a lot of space

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.660 
ipod it can use up a lot of space
depending<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.019> like<00:03:04.350> how<00:03:04.890> into<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.489> are

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
depending on like how into it you are

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.230 
depending on like how into it you are
and<00:03:07.730> yeah

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
and yeah

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.820 
and yeah
um<00:03:10.710> so<00:03:11.820> therefore<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:14.170> probably<00:03:14.470> want<00:03:14.770> to

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
um so therefore you you probably want to

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.570 
um so therefore you you probably want to
watch<00:03:15.010> your<00:03:16.290> capacity<00:03:17.290> in<00:03:17.590> your<00:03:17.800> available

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
watch your capacity in your available

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.480 
watch your capacity in your available
space<00:03:18.820> because<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:20.620> might<00:03:20.800> run<00:03:20.950> out<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.340> try

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
space because you might run out and try

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.280 
space because you might run out and try
to<00:03:21.520> add<00:03:21.730> songs<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.570> then<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.900> might<00:03:22.990> stop

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
to add songs and then it might stop

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.470 
to add songs and then it might stop
working<00:03:23.770> and<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:24.010> need<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.340> pick<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.300> choose

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
working and you need to pick and choose

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.330 
working and you need to pick and choose
you<00:03:25.810> can't<00:03:26.050> if<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.470> go<00:03:26.590> too<00:03:26.650> far<00:03:27.070> with<00:03:27.130> your
