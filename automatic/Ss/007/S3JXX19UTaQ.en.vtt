Animaniacs<00:00:14.950> let's<00:00:15.950> start<00:00:16.369> off<00:00:16.550> with<00:00:17.119> a<00:00:17.360> very

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
Animaniacs let's start off with a very

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:25.220 
Animaniacs let's start off with a very
light<00:00:17.900> pencil<00:00:18.529> and<00:00:20.770> let's<00:00:21.770> draw<00:00:22.489> a<00:00:23.020> circle

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
light pencil and let's draw a circle

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.070 
light pencil and let's draw a circle
this<00:00:25.770> is<00:00:25.890> his<00:00:26.340> head<00:00:26.580> by<00:00:26.790> the<00:00:26.850> way<00:00:27.300> when<00:00:27.840> drying

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
this is his head by the way when drying

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.620 
this is his head by the way when drying
his<00:00:28.230> head<00:00:28.440> first

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
his head first

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.470 
his head first
and<00:00:31.020> then<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.260> would<00:00:31.350> draw<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.980> curve<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
and then we would draw a curve and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.170 
and then we would draw a curve and
another<00:00:34.410> curve<00:00:35.000> intersecting<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
another curve intersecting with the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.430 
another curve intersecting with the
middle<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:37.310> first<00:00:38.310> group

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
middle of first group

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.010 
middle of first group
we're<00:00:40.980> done<00:00:41.490> with<00:00:42.150> the<00:00:42.660> white<00:00:43.080> pencil<00:00:43.350> already

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.299 

Oren's<00:00:49.680> draw<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.640> nose<00:00:51.530> where<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.860> two<00:00:53.070> want

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
Oren's draw the nose where the two want

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.370 
Oren's draw the nose where the two want
curves<00:00:54.059> intersect<00:00:56.000> and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.940 

but<00:01:00.070> now<00:01:00.850> it's<00:01:01.590> draw

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
but now it's draw

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.580 
but now it's draw
two<00:01:04.640> ovals<00:01:05.330> they<00:01:06.050> must<00:01:07.040> be<00:01:07.160> Roy<00:01:07.340> skinny<00:01:07.730> and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
two ovals they must be Roy skinny and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.450 
two ovals they must be Roy skinny and
all<00:01:09.970> different<00:01:10.970> sizes

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.970 

make<00:01:15.000> them<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.440> facing<00:01:16.440> two<00:01:16.620> different

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
make them like facing two different

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.499 
make them like facing two different
sides<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:18.200> like<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.890> this

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
sides that's like like this

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.260 
sides that's like like this
anyways

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.510 

do<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.680> would<00:01:27.890> put<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:29.030> little<00:01:29.240> curve

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.640 

actually

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.170 

let's<00:01:38.390> make<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.420> more<00:01:40.230> like<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.880> first<00:01:41.880> looks

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
let's make it more like that first looks

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.630 
let's make it more like that first looks
like<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:42.720> you're<00:01:43.140> doing<00:01:44.130> pretty<00:01:44.370> good

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
like that then you're doing pretty good

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.899 
like that then you're doing pretty good
so<00:01:44.700> far

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.770 

now<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.210> would<00:01:48.570> draw<00:01:48.900> way

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
now you would draw way

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.560 
now you would draw way
they<00:01:51.290> just<00:01:51.470> draw<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:52.220> curve<00:01:52.520> pool<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.180> on

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
they just draw this curve pool and on

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.440 
they just draw this curve pool and on
Twitter<00:01:54.140> don't<00:01:54.800> erase<00:01:55.010> it<00:01:55.220> if<00:01:55.910> you<00:01:56.180> want<00:01:56.390> you

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
Twitter don't erase it if you want you

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.000 
Twitter don't erase it if you want you
can<00:01:56.600> just<00:01:56.840> do<00:01:57.110> this

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
can just do this

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.240 
can just do this
okay<00:01:59.870> now<00:02:00.870> you<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.140> draw<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.470> Hat<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.130> Hat

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
okay now you would draw the Hat the Hat

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.340 
okay now you would draw the Hat the Hat
covers<00:02:02.730> practically<00:02:03.740> most<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:05.040> his<00:02:05.190> head<00:02:05.430> so

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
covers practically most of his head so

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.490 
covers practically most of his head so
it's<00:02:07.350> very<00:02:07.620> important<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.210> you<00:02:09.660> can't<00:02:10.320> live

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it's very important and you can't live

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.339 
it's very important and you can't live
without<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:11.130> most<00:02:11.850> would<00:02:12.090> die

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.640 

and<00:02:14.590> so

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.680 

let's<00:02:19.250> put<00:02:20.120> his<00:02:20.450> ears

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.840 

these<00:02:24.200> doggie<00:02:24.530> years<00:02:24.890> or<00:02:25.040> his<00:02:25.130> 20<00:02:25.460> years<00:02:25.640> old

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
these doggie years or his 20 years old

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.940 
these doggie years or his 20 years old
you<00:02:26.450> never<00:02:26.660> stay<00:02:27.020> in<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.350> show

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.640 

um

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
um

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.610 
um
and<00:02:32.159> now<00:02:32.930> we<00:02:33.930> will<00:02:34.400> do<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.549> shape<00:02:35.819> of<00:02:36.000> his<00:02:36.150> hood

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
and now we will do the shape of his hood

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.660 
and now we will do the shape of his hood
by<00:02:37.620> adding<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.610> two

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
by adding the two

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.130 
by adding the two
there's

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.650 

a<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:43.550> right<00:02:43.730> there

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.550 

okay

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.290 

no<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:58.709> do<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.890> mouth<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.730> I'm<00:03:00.970> doing

in

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.230 

now<00:03:12.049> let's<00:03:12.230> do<00:03:12.439> the<00:03:12.560> cheeks<00:03:12.950> or<00:03:13.340> what<00:03:13.670> they<00:03:13.939> are
