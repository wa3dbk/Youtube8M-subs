I<00:03:53.180> went<00:03:53.360> back<00:03:53.420> on<00:03:53.629> to<00:03:53.780> my<00:03:53.870> server<00:03:54.110> I<00:03:56.140> was<00:03:57.140> doing

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
I went back on to my server I was doing

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.009 
I went back on to my server I was doing
this<00:03:57.379> source<00:03:57.829> code<00:03:58.069> here<00:03:58.430> was<00:03:58.579> where<00:03:58.760> I<00:03:58.790> was

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
this source code here was where I was

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.589 
this source code here was where I was
even<00:04:00.019> here<00:04:00.319> at<00:04:00.530> this<00:04:00.859> point<00:04:01.099> I<00:04:01.459> guess<00:04:02.329> he

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
even here at this point I guess he

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.699 
even here at this point I guess he
thought<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:02.989> was<00:04:03.079> stupid<00:04:03.349> enough<00:04:03.500> to

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
thought that I was stupid enough to

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.110 
thought that I was stupid enough to
actually<00:04:03.799> put<00:04:04.189> on<00:04:04.280> my<00:04:04.459> server<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.000> that's

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
actually put on my server and that's

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.610 
actually put on my server and that's
when<00:04:05.269> he<00:04:05.390> was<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.569> command<00:04:05.810> /<00:04:06.019> off<00:04:06.260> me<00:04:06.439> which

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
when he was the command / off me which

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.289 
when he was the command / off me which
is<00:04:06.650> what<00:04:06.890> gives<00:04:06.980> them<00:04:07.159> the<00:04:07.700> access<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.180> off

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
is what gives them the access to off

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.470 
is what gives them the access to off
himself<00:04:08.890> override<00:04:09.890> my<00:04:09.980> server<00:04:10.209> so<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.239> viewed

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
himself override my server so I viewed

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.670 
himself override my server so I viewed
the<00:04:11.510> source<00:04:11.750> code<00:04:11.930> do<00:04:12.079> you<00:04:12.139> think<00:04:12.290> I'm<00:04:12.409> dumb

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
the source code do you think I'm dumb

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.009 
the source code do you think I'm dumb
and<00:04:12.889> then<00:04:13.430> he<00:04:13.579> still<00:04:13.849> plays<00:04:14.209> it<00:04:14.389> off<00:04:14.540> he's<00:04:14.840> like

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
and then he still plays it off he's like

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.599 
and then he still plays it off he's like
and<00:04:15.349> it's<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.709> plug-in<00:04:15.950> where<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.340> can<00:04:16.459> keep

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
and it's a plug-in where you can keep

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:24.010 
and it's a plug-in where you can keep
your<00:04:16.789> items<00:04:17.120> no<00:04:17.650> no<00:04:20.289> so<00:04:21.669> this<00:04:22.669> point<00:04:23.030> I<00:04:23.360> decided

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
your items no no so this point I decided

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.100 
your items no no so this point I decided
I<00:04:24.410> would<00:04:24.470> ban<00:04:24.740> him<00:04:24.979> get<00:04:25.250> him<00:04:25.340> off<00:04:25.430> my<00:04:25.580> server

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
I would ban him get him off my server

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.409 
I would ban him get him off my server
that's<00:04:27.110> pretty<00:04:27.260> much<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:28.060> no<00:04:29.060> reason<00:04:29.389> I

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
that's pretty much it no reason I

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.700 
that's pretty much it no reason I
decided<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.780> make<00:04:29.870> this<00:04:29.990> video<00:04:30.139> is<00:04:30.350> because<00:04:30.530> I
