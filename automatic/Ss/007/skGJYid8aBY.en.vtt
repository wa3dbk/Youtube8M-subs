00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.670 
of the phone and there are these three
slits<00:03:20.320> in<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.800> turns<00:03:21.250> out<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:23.050> part<00:03:23.470> of

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
slits in it it turns out this is part of

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.580 
slits in it it turns out this is part of
some<00:03:24.610> brilliant<00:03:24.970> engineering<00:03:25.840> which

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
some brilliant engineering which

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.490 
some brilliant engineering which
actually<00:03:27.400> uses<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.420> stainless<00:03:28.960> steel<00:03:28.990> band

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
actually uses the stainless steel band

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:38.600 
actually uses the stainless steel band
as<00:03:29.860> part<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.460> antenna<00:03:30.940> system<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:37.110> yes

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
as part of the antenna system and so yes

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.240 
as part of the antenna system and so yes
and<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.820> other<00:03:39.970> is<00:03:40.210> UMTS<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:40.990> GSM<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:42.010> it's

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
and the other is UMTS and GSM so it's

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.540 
and the other is UMTS and GSM so it's
got<00:03:42.520> these<00:03:43.030> integrated<00:03:43.630> antennas<00:03:44.380> right<00:03:45.160> in

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
got these integrated antennas right in

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.790 
got these integrated antennas right in
the<00:03:45.970> structure<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.930> phone<00:03:47.170> it's<00:03:47.440> never

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
the structure of the phone it's never

IPS<00:04:15.400> technology<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.989> very<00:04:17.500> advanced

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
IPS technology this is a very advanced

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.910 
IPS technology this is a very advanced
LCD<00:04:18.640> technology<00:04:18.880> which<00:04:19.810> is<00:04:19.989> quite<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.470> bit<00:04:20.739> in

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
LCD technology which is quite a bit in

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.380 
LCD technology which is quite a bit in
our<00:04:21.070> opinion<00:04:21.430> quite<00:04:21.670> a<00:04:21.730> bit<00:04:21.940> better<00:04:22.090> than<00:04:22.330> the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
our opinion quite a bit better than the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.030 
our opinion quite a bit better than the
OLED<00:04:22.780> technology<00:04:22.990> for<00:04:23.560> these<00:04:23.620> types<00:04:23.890> of

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
OLED technology for these types of

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.390 
OLED technology for these types of
products<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:25.170> provides<00:04:26.170> much<00:04:26.710> more<00:04:26.740> accurate

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
products and provides much more accurate

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.380 
products and provides much more accurate
color<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:29.010> much<00:04:30.010> higher<00:04:30.220> resolution<00:04:30.460> you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
color and much higher resolution you

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.240 
color and much higher resolution you
can't<00:04:31.750> make<00:04:32.050> an<00:04:32.230> OLED<00:04:32.560> display<00:04:32.950> with<00:04:33.160> this

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
can't make an OLED display with this

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.850 
can't make an OLED display with this
type<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.520> resolution<00:04:33.910> right<00:04:34.300> now<00:04:34.510> and<00:04:34.780> so<00:04:35.680> we

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
type of resolution right now and so we

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.220 
type of resolution right now and so we
think<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.160> IPS<00:04:36.670> technology<00:04:36.850> is<00:04:37.390> really<00:04:37.810> quite

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
think the IPS technology is really quite

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.300 
think the IPS technology is really quite
superior<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.930> it<00:04:40.930> results<00:04:41.530> in<00:04:41.620> incredibly

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
superior and it results in incredibly

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.159 
superior and it results in incredibly
sharp<00:04:42.610> text<00:04:43.230> images<00:04:44.230> and<00:04:44.410> video

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
sharp text images and video

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.229 
sharp text images and video
