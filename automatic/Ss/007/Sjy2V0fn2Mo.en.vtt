00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.780
 from time immemorial marussia built 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.340
 wooden houses 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.110
 good vision strength we never had 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.950
 of problems 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.960
 but today in the era of ultramodern 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.330
 technology and materials interest behind 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.430
 ocean building is very 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.750
 high in construction market statistics 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.939
 more than 40 percent in private residential 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.609
 low-rise houses 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.759
 built of wood 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.129
 in the top three market lose that 

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:30.119
 built and that's such a crime 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.110
 profiled bar 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.190
 get on 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.440
 let time profiled timber 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.600
 this is the building material of the latter 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.320
 generations 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.860
 it is made on the basis of new technologies 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.330
 in woodworking 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.910
 ten years ago, glued laminated timber was delivered 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.520
 to russia from abroad mainly to 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.490
 Kiselevsk now do it and out of it 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.070
 construction projects and in the Far East sawed 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.460
 ronaldo growth I must say that you can 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.980
 build anything 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.320
 continues 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.520
 I would recommend residential more 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.040
 other premises for picket 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.590
 profiled bar four gold in 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.700
 professional builder 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.980
 the specialists 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.850
 on northern housing construction 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.210
 She has been working with wood for over 15 years and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.680
 counting down 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.550
 in its spirit this is in 3 d link already 7 tenth 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.310
 account 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 in all sorts I met she 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.860
 in construction, I just applied 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.280
 ordinary just us 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.520
 which required the time of his bet 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.570
 respectively 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.900
 bukovsky 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.100
 it's worthy yesterday 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.680
 but at the moment I think that 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.410
 exactly profiled timber 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.850
 he is the best option 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.170
 Mirian construction for spying timber 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.410
 used special 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.110
 water resistant and as claimed 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.020
 environmentally friendly manufacturers 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.010
 credit 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.280
 that does not interfere with wood usa 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.150
 and as elements of the future timber 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.950
 rejected stacked friend 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.090
 friend caesar on the opposite 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.590
 direction wood fiber behind 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.280
 an account of this is achieved 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.300
 increased strength of glued laminated timber 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.789
 versus whole 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.889
 number eight can be from three to 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:15.369
 six units and machined on the machines 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.439
 pass-by-pass connections 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.489
 so tightly binds each 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.709
 bursa above and below lying in 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.999
 in some cases during construction not 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.439
 need to condense 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.069
 they say I understand the tours 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.519
 Yes, I am essentially speaking of this all 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.349
 yet that knowledge and enthusiasm 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.739
 so here is literally 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.229
 one sad 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.199
 as a result of this century 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:42.719
 percent of the whole exhibition building 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.790
 as all the details of the future home from 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.409
 glued profiled 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.549
 Beams are made with 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.959
 high precision in the factory 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.000
 assembly on site 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.310
 and construction is made in the USA 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.630
 terms in particular here is this house percent 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.729
 volume 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:59.260
 on 100 cubic meters 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.260
 lumber immediately after each 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.709
 up to six people 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.609
 yes we disconnect the author 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.769
 do we have an answer using a crane in 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.189
 twenty two working days in 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.479
 an attempt is said in the document 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.339
 this weekend 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:17.649
 the phrase worked on it from eight in the morning 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:20.269
 dollars of the strongest that is by 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.519
 working day 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.760
 for special muftiyat telecommunications 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.049
 particular in the field of intelligence 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.469
 percentage held 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:29.979
 soft top 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.719
 trial per month as you see here drugs 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.749
 the third place was not known in advance 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.569
 that now everything was clean does not create 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:38.229
 of problems 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.209
 we do not require additional 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.279
 pressure 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:43.949
 several thousand males process on 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.579
 Russian language 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:46.579
 of protection 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.059
 these boilers here don't interfere with them 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:51.449
 Fridays Premieres 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.149
 if we are with him in a special shirt 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.739
 is protected 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:55.439
 this is the most 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.790
 Svyatopolk Votkinsk side of the isolation itself 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.639
 cable 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.719
 in fire was shown 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.719
 security is our country level 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:09.209
 in our time it is very much 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.589
 new development percent 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.699
 all in this case, the antipyrene is who 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.119
 handles have someone the same time 

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:21.189
 antiseptics is 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:24.599
 the percentage of anti-law does not give it would be 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.729
 spread fire and there is 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.990
 column so to speak arbitrary such 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.439
 opinion that is 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.610
 and here that let's say it will end soon 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.340
 this is literally a pair of locally council 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.220
 stop in one place and in 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.360
 concluding a few words on support 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.210
 surface of laminated veneer lumber 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.639
 compliance with all technological 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.340
 requirements smooth and smooth 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.760
 collected from such a position on will 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.810
 monolith exterior finish and practically 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.660
 no need by the way because of the lack of cost 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.669
 the finish is significantly reduced 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.199
 the value of the whole house built from 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.949
 profiled bar 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.259
 does not require anna come cold 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:05.659
 frame 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.469
 m some there 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.559
 warming so you need so much more 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:12.599
 some assets only later 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.599
 he himself is already 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.830
 design solution that is 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.319
 essentially katuni 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.780
 however he can be said 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.780
 people can live in it 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.159
 eat by themselves they 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.650
 flour and children and grandchildren of this action 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.999
 up to steel 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:35.699
 no limit 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.699
 good right 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.960
 son, the program is a master's 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.680
 be sure to tell a 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.510
 materials 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.770
 of which houses are being built Khabarovsk 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.750
 megastore company in particular its you 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.480
 know a monolithic foam concrete and opina 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.090
 concrete blocks as well as we will introduce 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.340
 you with combined 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.100
 houses that are being built from different 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.580
 building materials if you 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.260
 interesting topic of low-rise 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.810
 house building we recommend you 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.670
 visit the company website megastore in 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.270
 first point house 27 point rub good luck to you 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.250
 construction and households
