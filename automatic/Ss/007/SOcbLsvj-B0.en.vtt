00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:14.240
 so now test drive this car 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.240
 this is skoda octavia a7 13 years 14 turbo 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.240
 we check the young man how the suspension works 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 first impression 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.060
 Well, as if the wheel is so yes there right away 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.020
 It is taken like a comfortable but well, as all 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.829
 materials later is not very good to me 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.980
 seems like a thousand by 50 will already begin 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.149
 rub off the skin can I sure am wrong 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.940
 but the materials are kind 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.100
 substandard 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.800
 rather they can be quality but to the touch 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.399
 it is as if they are already 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.399
 rubbed by hand 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.730
 so the car on the highway keeps very well 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.949
 gaining speed as if not bad 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.970
 the only thing 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.900
 five thousand already dies motor 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.900
 more they eat 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.630
 This machine is mechanically mechanized. 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.630
 gear box 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.300
 honestly, I donâ€™t know why there are 6 6 programs here 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.700
 so sign up 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.410
 at a speed of one hundred kilometers per hour 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.590
 the tachometer needle is somewhere 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.530
 2,200 i.e. this is normal for long-distance 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.750
 you can ride very comfortably 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.380
 the sound of the engine is not annoying it is not 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.420
 audible fuel consumption on the highway will be 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.659
 about five and a half in the city seven 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.600
 half and again this if the city 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:58.759
 if you ride quietly if 880 is active 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.130
 half will be 140 a strong 14 round 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.020
 turbocharged engine 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.180
 not bad but 250 newton torque 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.440
 meters 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.150
 the baseman is quite normal he pulls 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.060
 no questions but yes of course 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.510
 turboyamy small felt but 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.489
 whole 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:23.000
 such a motor can be said elastic 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:26.590
 what else box box here 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.120
 six-speed honestly 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.190
 This box does not say that she 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.420
 just perfect like well 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.400
 inclusion in principle of normal moves 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.340
 mean such box moves don't say 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.850
 that straight short 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.800
 turning on 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:49.250
 It seems on Ford will be improved inclusion 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.920
 then the way she keeps rolls 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.950
 there is no such car straight shona whipped 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.820
 due to being behind 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:02.090
 set the usual stick for the sake of 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.790
 price reduction is generally not clear how so 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.330
 It turned out if a 5 was with a beam 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.120
 clear old car with 98 or someone 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.390
 before the entrance and released right up to 2007 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.840
 then came out to 6 as everyone knows and then 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.140
 restyling she was an independent suspension 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:27.580
 and there were no questions to management at all 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:30.850
 that is, well kept roads then they took 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.550
 left on the seventh beam again 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.470
 returned it turns out some old 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.360
 I donâ€™t understand the ancient performance 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.060
 why is it okay well, but the simplicity 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.810
 designs but shading the shadow and back 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.810
 beams can be heard so 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.500
 panel tidy we usually 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:01.750
 volkswagen's the night 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.530
 very nice like beautiful 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.380
 informative many features instant 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.970
 Probably how much is left to 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:18.200
 refueling travel time average speed 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:23.000
 repetitions of this speedometer are duplicated 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.710
 I'll show you where this one is. 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.040
 that is, we are getting to the mountain now 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.040
 we are going 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.900
 star small dip when switching 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.159
 but also as natural for 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.159
 turbocharged engines 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.330
 this is normal 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.720
 very dynamic rotax engine even 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:53.400
 would compare somewhere with 18 turbo 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.889
 the old engine which was 150 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.430
 this one is going not much worse at all 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.970
 a drop also goes great speaker 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.819
 eight and a half seconds for 14 good 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:10.150
 rate maximum speed of 215 and 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:14.530
 she rides them that is exactly to 200 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:19.200
 gaining steadily on engine issues 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:24.510
 There is no principle expense only Shawn 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.240
 such as to whom as to whom but for such 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.250
 car class consumption 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:34.560
 good hours are 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:38.690
 This is already more precise. This is not a base. 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:42.120
 asset grade active ie asset 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:45.150
 what are they ambiance ambience is ambience 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.110
 asset is in my opinion a common basis and that 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:52.050
 it is now as if such an average 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.300
 grade in it and generally goes regular 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.720
 tape usually is already host to 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:02.280
 set up equipped music changer 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:06.210
 here and what's the aux flash drive for iphone 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:11.850
 need to connect this and drives 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:14.570
 All this additional option cost the owner 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.570
 2000 dollars 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.510
 like this
