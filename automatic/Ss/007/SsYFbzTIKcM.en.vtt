gotten a short socket arm and then I've

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.540 
gotten a short socket arm and then I've
got<00:00:29.849> an<00:00:29.939> 11<00:00:30.240> mil<00:00:30.390> spanner<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> bolts<00:00:31.550> or

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
you can use an 11 mil socket which might

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.470 
you can use an 11 mil socket which might
be<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.730> easier<00:00:35.760> than<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> span<00:00:36.450> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480

be a little bit easier than the span of
a<00:00:36.719> little<00:00:36.899> bit<00:00:36.989> less<00:00:37.110> fiddly<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.710> then<00:00:38.190> the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.399 
the protector on first and then the top
of<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.649> u-boat<00:01:01.859> now

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.490 

with<00:01:09.340> its<00:01:10.270> two<00:01:10.600> bolts<00:01:12.509> now<00:01:13.509> I<00:01:13.570> was<00:01:13.840> wrong<00:01:14.049> it<00:01:14.320> is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
with its two bolts now I was wrong it is

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.719 
with its two bolts now I was wrong it is
actually<00:01:14.829> a<00:01:14.890> little<00:01:15.009> bit<00:01:15.130> easy<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.579> use<00:01:15.700> a

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
actually a little bit easy to use a

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:23.539 
actually a little bit easy to use a
spanner<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:17.259> it's<00:01:17.409> rather<00:01:17.649> than<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.039> socket

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.210 

these<00:01:24.549> bolts<00:01:24.970> are<00:01:25.090> surprisingly<00:01:25.899> tight<00:01:26.289> so<00:01:26.950> I

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
these bolts are surprisingly tight so I

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.919 
these bolts are surprisingly tight so I
might<00:01:27.490> just<00:01:27.520> make<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.789> cut<00:01:28.149> and<00:01:28.299> come<00:01:28.569> back<00:01:28.720> when

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
might just make a cut and come back when

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.929 
might just make a cut and come back when
the<00:01:29.020> bolts<00:01:29.259> are<00:01:29.409> tightened<00:01:29.590> down<00:01:32.280> okay<00:01:33.280> so<00:01:33.340> I

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
the bolts are tightened down okay so I

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.120 
the bolts are tightened down okay so I
did<00:01:34.509> have<00:01:34.899> to<00:01:34.960> move<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.500> whole<00:01:35.530> clutch

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
did have to move the whole clutch

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.010 
did have to move the whole clutch
assembly<00:01:36.280> just<00:01:36.909> a<00:01:37.090> little<00:01:37.479> bit<00:01:37.569> towards<00:01:37.899> the

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
assembly just a little bit towards the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.649 
assembly just a little bit towards the
end<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.319> handlebars<00:01:38.799> with<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.789> 10<00:01:40.000> 10<00:01:40.450> mil

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
end of the handlebars with the 10 10 mil

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.139 
end of the handlebars with the 10 10 mil
spanner<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:42.280> just<00:01:42.429> a<00:01:42.490> ball<00:01:42.670> here<00:01:42.909> that<00:01:43.090> you

just<00:01:43.330> loosen<00:01:43.689> off<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:43.990> then<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.170> whole<00:01:44.289> thing

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
just loosen off and then the whole thing

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.320 
just loosen off and then the whole thing
will<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:44.649> move<00:01:44.890> down<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.250> little<00:01:45.310> bit<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:46.179> was

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
will just move down a little bit it was

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.760 
will just move down a little bit it was
only<00:01:46.780> about<00:01:46.990> 2<00:01:47.860> 2<00:01:48.490> mils<00:01:48.819> or<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:50.110> movement<00:01:50.649> so

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
only about 2 2 mils or so of movement so

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.149 
only about 2 2 mils or so of movement so
not<00:01:50.920> much<00:01:51.099> at<00:01:51.280> all<00:01:51.689> now<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:54.009> I<00:01:54.039> would

or loosening over and over and over

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.569 
or loosening over and over and over
again<00:02:18.359> sort<00:02:19.359> of<00:02:19.390> just<00:02:19.569> double-check<00:02:20.370> got<00:02:21.370> both

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
again sort of just double-check got both

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:27.300 
again sort of just double-check got both
of<00:02:21.609> them<00:02:21.850> nice<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.359> tight<00:02:22.510> now<00:02:26.280> notice<00:02:27.280> that

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
of them nice and tight now notice that

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.090 
of them nice and tight now notice that
the<00:02:27.579> protector<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.780> evenly<00:02:29.290> spaced<00:02:29.769> and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
the protector is evenly spaced and

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.699 
the protector is evenly spaced and
parallel<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.600> top<00:02:31.930> plastic<00:02:32.380> bit<00:02:32.530> here

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
parallel to this top plastic bit here

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.140 
parallel to this top plastic bit here
you<00:02:32.859> don't<00:02:33.040> want<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.250> protector<00:02:33.670> move<00:02:33.910> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
you don't want the protector move to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.410 
you don't want the protector move to
either<00:02:34.359> side<00:02:34.690> of<00:02:35.079> that<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.489> bolt<00:02:36.760> you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
either side of that of that bolt you

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.259 
either side of that of that bolt you
want<00:02:37.569> it<00:02:37.660> nice<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.840> even<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.850> get<00:02:39.970> even

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
want it nice and even so you get even

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.020 
want it nice and even so you get even
pressure<00:02:40.510> across<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:41.079> whole<00:02:41.260> thing<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.910> now

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
pressure across the whole thing so now

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.289 
pressure across the whole thing so now
I'll<00:02:43.150> take<00:02:43.299> this<00:02:43.540> short<00:02:43.810> socket<00:02:44.260> on<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:46.060> set

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
I'll take this short socket on and set

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.180 
I'll take this short socket on and set
it<00:02:46.420> on<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.930> then<00:02:47.139> we<00:02:47.230> get<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:50.190> yeahsure

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
it on and then we get the yeahsure

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.289 
it on and then we get the yeahsure
excretory

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
excretory

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.270 
excretory
so<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.569> think<00:02:53.810> mines<00:02:54.230> gonna<00:02:54.439> end<00:02:54.739> up<00:02:54.890> being

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
so I think mines gonna end up being

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.940 
so I think mines gonna end up being
about<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:56.650> also

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.710 

I'm<00:03:03.370> going<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.610> talk<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.940> out<00:03:04.000> quartile

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
I'm going to talk that out quartile

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.240 
I'm going to talk that out quartile
enough<00:03:04.989> yet<00:03:05.260> I'll<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.590> say<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.739> little<00:03:06.160> bit

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
enough yet I'll just say a little bit

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.199 
enough yet I'll just say a little bit
later<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:06.610> we've<00:03:06.700> got<00:03:06.819> a<00:03:06.849> little<00:03:06.970> bit<00:03:07.150> of

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
later so we've got a little bit of

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:15.150 
later so we've got a little bit of
movement<00:03:07.560> get<00:03:08.560> fine

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.430 

see<00:03:16.160> now<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:17.180> perfect<00:03:17.540> example<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:18.260> why

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
see now that is a perfect example of why

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.710 
see now that is a perfect example of why
I<00:03:18.470> have<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.710> shirt<00:03:19.070> on<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.550> tank<00:03:25.180> not<00:03:26.180> just<00:03:26.420> zoom

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
I have a shirt on the tank not just zoom

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.540 
I have a shirt on the tank not just zoom
out<00:03:26.900> just<00:03:27.370> yeah<00:03:32.740> and<00:03:33.740> then<00:03:33.980> you're<00:03:34.160> basically

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
out just yeah and then you're basically

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.160 
out just yeah and then you're basically
done<00:03:34.760> now<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.270> adjust<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.960> however

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
done now you just adjust it to however

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.430 
done now you just adjust it to however
you<00:03:36.410> want<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:37.660> I'm<00:03:38.660> gonna<00:03:38.780> have<00:03:38.990> mine<00:03:39.170> about

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
you want it I'm gonna have mine about

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.870 
you want it I'm gonna have mine about
there<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:39.680> then<00:03:39.770> you<00:03:39.890> just<00:03:40.100> clamp<00:03:40.370> that<00:03:40.610> bolt

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
there and then you just clamp that bolt

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.120 
there and then you just clamp that bolt
down<00:03:41.060> from<00:03:41.360> underneath<00:03:41.690> now<00:03:42.650> what<00:03:42.830> I<00:03:42.860> would

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
down from underneath now what I would

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.070 
down from underneath now what I would
recommend<00:03:43.640> doing<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:44.060> actually<00:03:46.840> sitting<00:03:47.840> on

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
recommend doing is actually sitting on

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.420 
recommend doing is actually sitting on
the<00:03:48.260> bike<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:50.770> making<00:03:51.770> sure<00:03:51.980> that<00:03:52.100> your<00:03:52.250> whole

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
the bike and making sure that your whole

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.730 
the bike and making sure that your whole
handlebars<00:03:52.970> can<00:03:53.090> move<00:03:53.450> full<00:03:54.170> lock<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:57.500> full

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
handlebars can move full lock to full

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.980 
handlebars can move full lock to full
lock<00:03:58.010> without<00:03:58.490> any<00:03:58.940> problems<00:03:59.420> and<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.810> other

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
lock without any problems and the other

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.560 
lock without any problems and the other
thing<00:04:00.200> I'd<00:04:00.320> check<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.770> it<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.520> can<00:04:01.700> read<00:04:02.330> all

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
thing I'd check is it you can read all

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.320 
thing I'd check is it you can read all
your<00:04:02.720> dials<00:04:03.280> on<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.460> odometer<00:04:04.700> at<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.120> front

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
your dials on the odometer at the front

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.730 
your dials on the odometer at the front
so<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:05.480> don't<00:04:05.660> have<00:04:05.840> any<00:04:05.990> problems<00:04:06.290> like<00:04:06.500> that

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
so you don't have any problems like that

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.530 
so you don't have any problems like that
before<00:04:06.860> you<00:04:07.010> start<00:04:07.280> riding<00:04:07.490> but<00:04:08.150> definitely

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
before you start riding but definitely

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.990 
before you start riding but definitely
that<00:04:08.570> full<00:04:08.990> lock<00:04:09.260> check<00:04:09.560> is<00:04:10.280> pretty<00:04:10.640> important

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000
