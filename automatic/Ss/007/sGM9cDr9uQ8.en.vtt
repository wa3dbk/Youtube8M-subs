00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.269
 by a chemical process such as brush 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.099
 progressive 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.410

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.170

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.119
 result of these products is in the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.269

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:37.620

 totally economical the price of it is well 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.239
 It's handy and 450ml so it lasts 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.079
 Enough is an anti frizz action shampoo 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.620
 more unsalted thermal protection 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.469
 here it says that the intense book contains 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.049
 Omega 3 plus protein Wheat proteins 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.960
 with ph 5.0 to 5.5 so we found 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.549
 totally moisturizing is it acts 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.409
 even haircut it potentiates the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.490
 special silicones 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.659
 with anti-frizz thermal protection 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.369
 it's very good 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.670
 so like that in my hair like I like 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.250
 straight hair really low 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.680
 so I used it, right? 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.180
 there he twice got the hair 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.700
 totally show had a batch 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.509
 sticky it does not leave the hair root 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.400
 so it's worth it and also 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:43.400
 in it comes the snow line a conditioner 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.719

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.700
 half way to the ends only 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.460

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.549
 more resected help of boards 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.819
 dryer in my opinion so at the price 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.459
 cost it is not expensive to have the 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:10.039
 size is also a line is facing 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.379
