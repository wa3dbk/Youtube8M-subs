00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.430
 and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.489
 ayew people know and python 78 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.900
 I hope you are well 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.640
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.440
 really special video a 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.020
 video information ultra important 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.559
 ultra well hidden after the trailer that 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.330
 we had yesterday on black ops 3 I 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.000
 watched carefully and a details 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.680
 hidden information was concealed 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.910
 simply on the gun you 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.800
 see as if by chance there are 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.420
 very very clear numbers so I 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.890
 decided to name it all with my little one 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.979
 software and lamps by 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:08.260
 GPS coordinates so the 47 ° 3667 north and 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:12.130
 the 8 ° 5500 degrees is 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.680
 so I typed it on google maps in 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.420
 gps mode and guess what we 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.610
 find that gives us a coordinate in 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.880
 Swiss as you can see I do not 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.290
 you do not lie so I know how to tap on 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.270
 internet i put the coordinates in 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.600
 attitude is in longitude one finds well 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.740
 a definite point has zo reach in switzerland 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.900
 do not know if I pronounce it well in any 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.430
 case that's how it's pronounced and 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.750
 after that I made my little ones 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.300
 internet searches 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.020
 exactly wikipedia it's science 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.670
 so I typed zollitsch and I looked 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.440
 what happened a little bit there 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.100
 and do you figure that during the second 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.130
 world War 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.200
 so we talk about it for me it really 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.110
 chances are there is a report 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.780
 I put you this little passage on 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.310
 which we are talking about this event and we 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.680
 very clearly says the second half 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.990
 the 1930s, however, 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.150
 climate change with the accession of 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.400
 national parties national forgiveness to 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.440
 the common idea of national defense 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.899
 spiritual that culminates in the exhibition 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.860
 national of 1939 and guess where 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:18.040
 azo ridge so obviously that's 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.450
 call of duty will not happen like the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.950
 old one has known ie 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.540
 second world war first war 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.549
 World 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.709
 since we've seen source codes like 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.390
 whatever it was rather futuristic 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.980
 now it is possible that there is 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.180
 flashbacks in the past so a 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.730
 little bit like we had on black ops 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.880
 two a little more modern and of 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.350
 from time to time a little more 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.930
 better I think they may have 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.790
 kept this idea so it's shaving him 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.200
 definitely a relationship with the rich 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.330
 that's all for this little girl 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.830
 story I do not have much else 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.290
 moreover at least you add a 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.990
 do not hesitate to type it on wikipedia 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.390
 or on the internet if you want to see so 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.710
 this information that I disclose to you in 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.270
 anyway that's all for me 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.860
 I really hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.540
 as for us we find ourselves at very 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.650
 soon for more videos on Thursday at 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.650
 more people ciao bye
