00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.340 

it's<00:01:43.580> definitely<00:01:44.030> harder<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.840> play<00:01:45.080> with<00:01:45.320> a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
it's definitely harder to play with a

it's definitely harder to play with a
lower<00:01:45.620> frame<00:01:45.979> rate<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.460> can<00:01:47.060> attest<00:01:47.390> to
