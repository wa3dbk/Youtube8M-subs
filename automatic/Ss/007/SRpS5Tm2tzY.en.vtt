what makes these phones waterproof is is

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.330 
what makes these phones waterproof is is
really<00:02:59.940> as<00:03:00.090> much<00:03:00.330> as<00:03:00.480> anything<00:03:01.220> covering<00:03:02.220> up

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
really as much as anything covering up

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.300 
really as much as anything covering up
the<00:03:02.490> ports<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.060> way<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.770> seals<00:03:05.130> them

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
the ports in a way that that seals them

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.210 
the ports in a way that that seals them
and<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.760> truth<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:07.260> means<00:03:07.890> it's<00:03:08.100> on

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
and and the truth is that means it's on

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.830 
and and the truth is that means it's on
you<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.490> little<00:03:08.730> bit<00:03:08.850> because<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.540> forget

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
you a little bit because if you forget

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.100 
you a little bit because if you forget
to<00:03:09.900> close<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.290> USB<00:03:11.130> port<00:03:11.540> water<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.780> get<00:03:12.930> in

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
to close the USB port water can get in

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.650 
to close the USB port water can get in
there<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:14.130> would<00:03:14.550> say<00:03:14.730> both<00:03:14.940> these<00:03:15.180> phones<00:03:15.240> look

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
there I would say both these phones look

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.600 
there I would say both these phones look

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
rigorous testing they have to pass but

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.240 
rigorous testing they have to pass but
that<00:04:42.449> means<00:04:42.750> all<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.020> seals<00:04:43.410> are<00:04:43.530> intact<00:04:43.889> all

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
the portholes are closed and the truth

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.370 
the portholes are closed and the truth
is<00:04:47.610> in<00:04:47.760> real<00:04:47.970> life<00:04:48.240> especially<00:04:48.840> if<00:04:49.229> what

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
is in real life especially if what

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.800 
is in real life especially if what
you're<00:04:49.530> worried<00:04:49.710> about<00:04:49.740> is<00:04:50.010> accidental
