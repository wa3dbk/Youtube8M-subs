00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.550
 the earth on our beautiful planet the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.460
 Earth 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.770
 many sources of primary energy 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.980
 have allowed man to develop 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.390
 at first the man was a little lonely and 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.840
 did not have big needs 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.090
 energy 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.310
 and then more and more comfortable in his 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.030
 natural environment 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.600
 man has multiplied and his needs 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.140
 in energy became more and more 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.140
 greedy 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.500
 nowadays car the boats the 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.140
 had the machines the factories the 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.570
 televisions the computers and all the 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.240
 electrical appliances are part of 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.670
 our environment a little less natural 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.460
 so these are the power plants 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.619
 that provide the energy needed to 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.200
 all this overflowing consumption 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.800
 to make this energy 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.979
 electric 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.410
 other sources of energy are needed 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:34.479
 primary energies 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:43.679
 coal or oil long uranium 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:43.679
 the wind the sun the sea etc 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.220
 plus electricity consumption 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.490
 increases the number of plants 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.260
 electric increases and more it takes 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.840
 tap into energy sources 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.640
 primary 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.190
 certain sources of primary energy 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.570
 find in countries far and far and 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.050
 this has a price 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.220
 these fossil energy sources pollute 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.710
 our atmosphere 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.300
 when turned into electricity 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.300
 it leaves traces 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.280
 other sources of energy the energies 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.170
 renewable are 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.880
 available next to it 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.310
 so it's very convenient but often 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.680
 careless bed because they are new 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.040
 and it is very expensive, says we 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.490
 operated initially 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.280
 however fossil fuels 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.070
 will become a day so rare and so dear to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.040
 their turn as the thinking man 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.320
 intelligently will have to be interested in 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.810
 these renewable energies that are not 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:03:01.110
 not so new or so expensive and that does not 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:03.330
 not pollute the cities and 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.670
 villages can imagine a new 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.600
 way of life by building 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.800
 factories of vehicles and appliances 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:19.110
 who will consume 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:22.200
 less energy however the man in 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.400
 his quiet little life can also 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.400
 save the planet 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.220
 there are lots of gestures that we do not 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.950
 even think about turning off the light of 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.190
 plug in a microwave computer a 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.409
 iron a television in 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:46.060
 simply lowering his consumption 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:48.640
 of energy would lower their bill 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.920
 but more intelligently 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.920
 they are true the planet 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:01.510
 each and every one of us are already 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.560
 the people responsible for the consumption of 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.290
 all energies 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.890
 then you will know how to do the right things 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.950
 to preserve our beautiful planet the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.950
 Earth
