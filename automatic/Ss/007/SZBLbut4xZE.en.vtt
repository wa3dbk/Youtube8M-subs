ball this big for her and she can have
more<00:03:07.709> streets<00:03:08.129> like<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:09.299> same<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.720> everyone

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
more streets like the same as everyone

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.250

think<00:03:17.639> there<00:03:17.969> really<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.269> much<00:03:18.599> else<00:03:18.870> if<00:03:19.709> you

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
think there really is much else if you

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.990 
think there really is much else if you
watch<00:03:20.099> the<00:03:20.340> video<00:03:20.639> on<00:03:22.549> diabetic<00:03:23.549> hamster

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.860 
watch the video on diabetic hamster
diets<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.719> I<00:03:25.349> bet<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.650> comes<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:26.040> trees<00:03:26.870> that

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
diets and I bet it comes to trees that

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.250 
diets and I bet it comes to trees that
will<00:03:28.169> give<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.709> an<00:03:28.799> insight<00:03:29.099> into<00:03:29.159> how<00:03:29.579> to

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
will give you an insight into how to

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.080 
will give you an insight into how to
feed<00:03:31.260> them<00:03:31.500> in<00:03:31.620> things<00:03:31.919> but<00:03:32.250> it's<00:03:32.879> not

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
feed them in things but it's not

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.949

cannot<00:04:31.409> keep<00:04:31.740> them<00:04:31.919> together<00:04:32.099> you<00:04:32.430> just<00:04:32.669> can't

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
cannot keep them together you just can't

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.519 
cannot keep them together you just can't
it<00:04:33.180> doesn't<00:04:33.509> work<00:04:34.669> they<00:04:35.669> tend<00:04:35.909> to<00:04:36.000> fight

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:36.529 
it doesn't work they tend to fight

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:42.170 
it doesn't work they tend to fight
pretty<00:04:37.529> much<00:04:37.770> from<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.639> off<00:04:39.409> No

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
pretty much from the off No

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.390 
pretty much from the off No
males<00:04:43.180> can<00:04:43.900> be<00:04:43.930> kept<00:04:44.290> together<00:04:44.410> together<00:04:44.890> in

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
males can be kept together together in

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.370 
males can be kept together together in
rare<00:04:45.970> circumstances<00:04:46.240> but<00:04:47.050> I<00:04:47.110> wouldn't

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
rare circumstances but I wouldn't

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.400 
rare circumstances but I wouldn't
recommend<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:48.390> just<00:04:49.390> because<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.080> risk<00:04:50.260> of

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
recommend it just because the risk of

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.010 
recommend it just because the risk of
fighting<00:04:50.770> is<00:04:50.860> too<00:04:51.070> high<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:54.390> I<00:04:55.390> think<00:04:55.960> they

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
fighting is too high and I think they

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.390 
fighting is too high and I think they
just<00:04:56.200> prefer<00:04:56.350> to<00:04:56.500> be<00:04:56.680> on<00:04:56.830> their<00:04:56.980> own

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
just prefer to be on their own

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.880 
just prefer to be on their own
my<00:04:58.240> boys<00:04:58.450> are<00:04:58.690> together<00:04:58.840> because<00:04:59.350> I<00:04:59.440> rescued

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
my boys are together because I rescued

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.050 
my boys are together because I rescued
them<00:05:00.040> together<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.520> they'd<00:05:00.670> already<00:05:00.820> been

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
them together and they'd already been

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.570 
them together and they'd already been
together<00:05:01.270> for<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:01.630> year<00:05:01.980> and<00:05:02.980> they<00:05:03.340> didn't

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
together for a year and they didn't

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.940 
together for a year and they didn't
really<00:05:03.700> have<00:05:03.790> much<00:05:04.090> choice<00:05:04.680> for<00:05:05.680> all<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.770> know

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
really have much choice for all I know

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.410 
really have much choice for all I know
they<00:05:06.250> did<00:05:06.430> fight<00:05:06.750> but<00:05:07.750> obviously<00:05:08.740> I<00:05:09.420> don't

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
they did fight but obviously I don't

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.850 
they did fight but obviously I don't
know<00:05:10.720> that<00:05:10.960> now<00:05:12.330> I<00:05:13.330> don't<00:05:14.230> see<00:05:14.530> that<00:05:14.680> now

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
know that now I don't see that now

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.980 
know that now I don't see that now
because<00:05:15.280> they've<00:05:16.210> been<00:05:16.330> together<00:05:16.510> for<00:05:16.840> so

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
because they've been together for so

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.250 
because they've been together for so
long

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
long

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.070 
long
so<00:05:18.900> mmm<00:05:19.990> they<00:05:20.350> don't<00:05:20.590> really<00:05:21.330> fight<00:05:22.330> probably

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
so mmm they don't really fight probably

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.760 
so mmm they don't really fight probably
because<00:05:23.500> they've<00:05:23.680> got<00:05:23.800> no<00:05:23.920> other<00:05:23.950> choice<00:05:24.160> um

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
because they've got no other choice um

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.940 
because they've got no other choice um
so<00:05:26.770> that's<00:05:27.220> basically<00:05:27.990> everything<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.230> can

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
so that's basically everything I can

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.520 
so that's basically everything I can
