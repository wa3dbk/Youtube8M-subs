dihybrid<00:00:02.010> cross<00:00:02.460> practice<00:00:04.520> okay<00:00:05.520> let's<00:00:05.940> say

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
dihybrid cross practice okay let's say

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.770 
dihybrid cross practice okay let's say
for<00:00:06.420> example<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:07.049> have<00:00:07.080> plans<00:00:07.710> in<00:00:08.069> plans

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
for example you have plans in plans

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.049 
for example you have plans in plans
yellow<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.809> capital<00:00:10.590> d<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.280> purple<00:00:11.820> is

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
yellow is capital d and purple is

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.350 
yellow is capital d and purple is
recessive<00:00:12.719> small<00:00:13.230> d<00:00:13.650> smooth<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.730> capital<00:00:15.150> T

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
recessive small d smooth is capital T

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.230 
recessive small d smooth is capital T
and<00:00:15.389> Ringo<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.320> small<00:00:16.740> T<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.940> let's<00:00:18.090> make<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
and Ringo is small T so let's make a

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.349 
and Ringo is small T so let's make a
cross<00:00:18.830> let's<00:00:19.830> cross<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.310> homozygous<00:00:20.820> dominant

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
cross let's cross a homozygous dominant

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.140 
cross let's cross a homozygous dominant
for<00:00:21.960> color<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.439> heterozygous<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.670> texture

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
for color and heterozygous for texture

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.980 
for color and heterozygous for texture
with<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:24.960> purple<00:00:25.650> wrinkle<00:00:26.220> plant<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.330> let's

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
with a purple wrinkle plant so let's

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.650 
with a purple wrinkle plant so let's
take<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> look<00:00:28.730> homozygous<00:00:29.730> dominant<00:00:30.150> for

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
take a look homozygous dominant for

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.290 
take a look homozygous dominant for
color<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:32.219> would<00:00:32.340> color<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.149> is

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
color so what would color have to be is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.720 
color so what would color have to be is
homozygous<00:00:33.750> dominant<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.460> two

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
homozygous dominant it's going to be two

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.250 
homozygous dominant it's going to be two
capital<00:00:36.210> D<00:00:37.640> then<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.940> heterozygous<00:00:39.870> for

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
capital D then a heterozygous for

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.040 
capital D then a heterozygous for
texture<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.969> texture<00:00:42.480> where<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:42.930> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
texture this is texture where would you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.670 
texture this is texture where would you
get<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> heterozygous<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> would<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.620> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
get for a heterozygous you would get a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.790 
get for a heterozygous you would get a
capital<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> small<00:00:47.820> letter<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.620> you<00:00:49.620> want

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
capital and a small letter and you want

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920 
capital and a small letter and you want
to<00:00:49.860> cross<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> purple<00:00:51.120> wrinkle<00:00:51.570> plant

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to cross it with a purple wrinkle plant

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.080 
to cross it with a purple wrinkle plant
this<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.949> doesn't<00:00:53.250> say<00:00:53.340> homozygous<00:00:53.969> or

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this one doesn't say homozygous or

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.910 
this one doesn't say homozygous or
heterozygous<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:55.170> okay<00:00:55.530> don't<00:00:55.680> worry<00:00:55.770> about

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
heterozygous it's okay don't worry about

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
heterozygous it's okay don't worry about
it<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.460> purple<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.090> wrinkle<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.570> both

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it because purple and wrinkle or both

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.110 
it because purple and wrinkle or both
recessive<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:02.030> okay<00:01:03.030> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
recessive so there you have it okay so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.109 
recessive so there you have it okay so
the<00:01:03.329> first<00:01:03.359> parent<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:05.339> purple<00:01:05.729> wrinkle

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the first parent is the purple wrinkle

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.130 
the first parent is the purple wrinkle
and<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:07.080> cross<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.570> what

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and you cross it with this one so what

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.109 
and you cross it with this one so what
is<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.439> allele<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.909> pretty

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
is the allele for this one it's pretty

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.550 
is the allele for this one it's pretty
easy<00:01:12.270> because<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.869> only<00:01:13.049> choice<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
easy because the only choice you have is

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.840 
easy because the only choice you have is
small<00:01:14.040> D<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.460> small<00:01:14.610> T<00:01:15.290> so<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.350> fill<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.770> up

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
small D and small T so you fill that up

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.340 
small D and small T so you fill that up
over<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> big<00:01:19.530> d<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.100> big<00:01:20.340> t

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
over here you have a big d and big t

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.520 
over here you have a big d and big t
followed<00:01:22.350> by<00:01:22.500> Big<00:01:22.890> D<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.310> small<00:01:23.460> T<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.530> then

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
followed by Big D and small T and then

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.690 
followed by Big D and small T and then
Big<00:01:25.979> D<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.509> big<00:01:27.840> t<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.700> finally

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
Big D here with this big t and finally

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.649 
Big D here with this big t and finally
this<00:01:29.850> big<00:01:30.180> d<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.930> small<00:01:31.259> t<00:01:32.299> tell<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.420> cross

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
this big d and a small t tell you cross

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.170 
this big d and a small t tell you cross
it<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.100> easy<00:01:35.280> part<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.880> make<00:01:36.060> sure

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it this is the easy part just make sure

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.880 
it this is the easy part just make sure
you<00:01:36.299> follow<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:36.960> ruler<00:01:37.350> don't<00:01:37.710> mess<00:01:37.860> up

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
you follow with your ruler don't mess up

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.889 
you follow with your ruler don't mess up
which<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.490> big<00:01:41.880> d<00:01:42.150> small<00:01:42.570> D

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
which one so here you have big d small D

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.039 
which one so here you have big d small D
Big<00:01:43.259> T<00:01:43.470> small<00:01:43.710> T<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.630> then<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> looks<00:01:45.930> like

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
Big T small T and then it looks like

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
Big T small T and then it looks like
they<00:01:46.200> all<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> same<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.460> repeat

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
they all the same and you just repeat

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.010 
they all the same and you just repeat
that<00:01:48.560> over<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.920> Big<00:01:50.280> D<00:01:50.610> small<00:01:51.000> D<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.750> two

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that over here is Big D small D and two

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.249 
that over here is Big D small D and two
small<00:01:52.320> T<00:01:53.689> ok<00:01:54.689> let's<00:01:54.930> finish<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.170> up<00:01:56.750> ok<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.200> you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
small T ok let's finish it up ok so you

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.969 
small T ok let's finish it up ok so you
notice<00:01:58.729> this<00:01:59.729> row<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.420> same<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.680> row

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
notice this row is the same as this row

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.120 
notice this row is the same as this row
and<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.369> rose<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> same<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.840> row<00:02:04.170> so

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and this rose the same as this row so

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.040 
and this rose the same as this row so
there<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.640> eight<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.829> of<00:02:07.829> 16<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.750> eight<00:02:09.750> out

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
there is eight out of 16 and eight out

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.910 
there is eight out of 16 and eight out
of<00:02:10.229> 16<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.489> genotyped<00:02:12.090> are<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:13.170> half

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
of 16 so the genotyped are one half

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.610 
of 16 so the genotyped are one half
of<00:02:13.980> or<00:02:14.910> eight<00:02:15.240> out<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.480> 16<00:02:15.900> reduced<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.410> one

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
of or eight out of 16 reduced to one

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.960 
of or eight out of 16 reduced to one
half<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:17.130> Big<00:02:17.670> D<00:02:17.849> small<00:02:18.180> D<00:02:18.420> Big<00:02:18.750> T<00:02:18.989> small<00:02:19.260> T<00:02:19.410> or

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
half is Big D small D Big T small T or

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.030 
half is Big D small D Big T small T or
heterozygous<00:02:20.970> for<00:02:21.360> both<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.530> other<00:02:22.739> half

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
heterozygous for both and the other half

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.380 
heterozygous for both and the other half
is<00:02:23.340> Big<00:02:23.790> D<00:02:23.940> small<00:02:24.270> D<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.930> two<00:02:25.110> small<00:02:25.380> T<00:02:26.390> which

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
is Big D small D and two small T which

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.570 
is Big D small D and two small T which
is<00:02:27.540> also<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.989> top<00:02:28.170> 16<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.160> reduce<00:02:29.489> it

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
is also a top 16 so you can reduce it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.820 
is also a top 16 so you can reduce it
down<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.760> one<00:02:30.120> F<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:30.959> that's<00:02:31.319> equivalent<00:02:31.620> to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
down to one F so that's equivalent to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.699 
down to one F so that's equivalent to
5050<00:02:32.840> alright<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:33.989> then<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.410> also<00:02:34.560> a

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
5050 alright and then it is also a

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.280 
5050 alright and then it is also a
genotypic<00:02:35.370> ratio<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.150> genotypic<00:02:36.540> ratio<00:02:36.810> is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
genotypic ratio the genotypic ratio is

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.070 
genotypic ratio the genotypic ratio is
one<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:40.400> for<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.489> phenotype<00:02:42.090> one

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
one to one and for the phenotype one

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.960 
one to one and for the phenotype one
half<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.410> them<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.739> going<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.040> be<00:02:44.340> yellow

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
half of them is going to be yellow

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.330 
half of them is going to be yellow
smooth<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.840> other<00:02:46.620> half<00:02:46.860> are<00:02:47.040> going<00:02:47.250> to

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
smooth and the other half are going to

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.820 
smooth and the other half are going to
be<00:02:47.459> yellow<00:02:47.880> wrinkle<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.830> phenotype

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
be yellow wrinkle and the phenotype

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.670 
be yellow wrinkle and the phenotype
ratio<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:51.030> one<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.780> one<00:02:54.200> okay<00:02:55.200> let's<00:02:55.380> do<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
ratio is one to one okay let's do the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.110 
ratio is one to one okay let's do the
same<00:02:55.860> thing<00:02:56.100> again<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.670> time<00:02:56.880> with<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
same thing again this time with a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.180 
same thing again this time with a
different<00:02:57.510> cross<00:02:57.720> we<00:02:58.470> want<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.709> cross<00:02:58.890> two

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
different cross we want to cross two

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.009 
different cross we want to cross two
plants<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.790> are<00:02:59.819> heterozygous<00:03:00.480> for<00:03:00.780> both

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
plants that are heterozygous for both

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.479 
plants that are heterozygous for both
trade<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:02.670> heterozygous<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:04.049> go<00:03:05.010> across<00:03:05.190> with

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
trade so heterozygous and go across with

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.199 
trade so heterozygous and go across with
the<00:03:05.519> same<00:03:05.760> one<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:08.340> first<00:03:08.760> we're<00:03:09.030> going<00:03:09.120> to

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
the same one so first we're going to

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.140 
the same one so first we're going to
figure<00:03:09.390> out<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.660> allele<00:03:10.170> for<00:03:10.500> each<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.890> these

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
figure out the allele for each of these

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.199 
figure out the allele for each of these
big<00:03:12.150> d<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.549> big<00:03:14.549> t<00:03:14.870> Big<00:03:15.870> D<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.290> small<00:03:16.410> T<00:03:17.209> and

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
big d and big t Big D and small T and

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.360 
big d and big t Big D and small T and
then<00:03:18.720> small<00:03:19.200> d<00:03:19.470> big<00:03:19.829> t<00:03:20.100> smaller<00:03:21.030> DS<00:03:21.239> multi<00:03:21.690> and

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
then small d big t smaller DS multi and

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.729 
then small d big t smaller DS multi and
since<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.489> other<00:03:23.579> parents<00:03:24.090> are<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.329> same<00:03:24.739> so

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
since the other parents are the same so

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.640 
since the other parents are the same so
we<00:03:25.890> can<00:03:26.040> put<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> same<00:03:26.430> allele<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.470> then<00:03:28.470> we

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
we can put the same allele and then we

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.030 
we can put the same allele and then we
solve<00:03:28.980> for<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.370> working<00:03:29.820> one<00:03:30.030> at<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.239> time<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.890> is

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
solve for it working one at a time it is

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.330 
solve for it working one at a time it is
what<00:03:32.250> we<00:03:32.370> get<00:03:34.459> okay<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.959> one<00:03:37.160> sixteen<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.190> them

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
what we get okay so one sixteen of them

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.660 
what we get okay so one sixteen of them
are<00:03:38.730> Big<00:03:39.510> D<00:03:39.720> Big<00:03:39.750> D<00:03:39.959> Big<00:03:40.109> D<00:03:40.350> Big<00:03:40.500> D<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:41.310> one<00:03:41.549> out

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
are Big D Big D Big D Big D so one out

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.180 
are Big D Big D Big D Big D so one out
of<00:03:41.790> 16<00:03:42.150> you'll<00:03:42.359> get<00:03:42.540> this<00:03:42.750> genotype<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.500> then

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
of 16 you'll get this genotype and then

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.670 
of 16 you'll get this genotype and then
two<00:03:44.519> out<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.730> 16<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.630> will<00:03:45.780> get<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.290> genotype

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
two out of 16 you will get this genotype

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.759 
two out of 16 you will get this genotype
so<00:03:47.070> this<00:03:47.280> one<00:03:47.459> here<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.820> here<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:49.500> on<00:03:49.680> and

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
so this one here and here and so on and

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.530 
so this one here and here and so on and
so<00:03:49.859> forth<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:51.200> notice<00:03:52.220> Big<00:03:53.220> D<00:03:53.430> small<00:03:53.820> D<00:03:54.060> Big<00:03:54.329> T

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
so forth I notice Big D small D Big T

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.309 
so forth I notice Big D small D Big T
small<00:03:54.720> T<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:55.230> one-fourth<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:58.049> Big<00:03:58.739> D<00:03:58.950> small<00:03:59.370> D

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
small T is one-fourth so Big D small D

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.900 
small T is one-fourth so Big D small D
Big<00:04:01.319> T<00:04:01.530> small<00:04:01.590> T<00:04:03.530> ok<00:04:04.530> there<00:04:05.069> is<00:04:05.250> four<00:04:05.700> of<00:04:05.790> them

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
Big T small T ok there is four of them

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.140 
Big T small T ok there is four of them
here's<00:04:06.120> one<00:04:06.450> there's<00:04:07.350> two<00:04:09.620> there's<00:04:10.620> three

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
here's one there's two there's three

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.789 
here's one there's two there's three
that's<00:04:12.150> four<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.230> four<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.500> them<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.739> all

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
that's four so the four of them is all

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.340 
that's four so the four of them is all
right<00:04:13.920> here<00:04:14.190> four<00:04:14.730> out<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:14.880> 16<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.959> can<00:04:15.989> reduce

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
right here four out of 16 you can reduce

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.199 
right here four out of 16 you can reduce
it<00:04:16.560> down<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.739> one<00:04:17.250> fourth<00:04:19.250> okay<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.760> same<00:04:21.060> one

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
it down to one fourth okay so same one

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.860 
it down to one fourth okay so same one
again<00:04:21.740> genotypic<00:04:22.740> ratio<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.870> phenotypic

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
again genotypic ratio and phenotypic

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.780 
again genotypic ratio and phenotypic
ratio

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
ratio

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:33.380 
ratio
okay<00:04:27.570> so<00:04:29.390> one<00:04:30.390> two<00:04:31.200> three<00:04:31.560> four<00:04:32.040> five<00:04:32.390> plus

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
okay so one two three four five plus

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.750 
okay so one two three four five plus
another<00:04:33.600> four<00:04:34.080> because<00:04:34.620> this<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.890> actually<00:04:35.040> if

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
another four because this is actually if

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.670 
another four because this is actually if
you<00:04:36.150> reduce<00:04:36.540> it<00:04:36.690> would<00:04:36.840> be<00:04:36.900> one-fourth<00:04:37.380> but

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
you reduce it would be one-fourth but

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.730 
you reduce it would be one-fourth but
naturally<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.280> original<00:04:38.730> is<00:04:38.820> for<00:04:39.270> over<00:04:39.660> 16<00:04:40.080> so

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
naturally the original is for over 16 so

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.310 
naturally the original is for over 16 so
nine<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.460> them<00:04:41.640> if<00:04:42.420> you<00:04:42.540> know<00:04:42.660> typically<00:04:43.080> are

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
nine of them if you know typically are

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.730 
nine of them if you know typically are
yellow<00:04:44.040> smooth<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.870> these<00:04:45.870> are<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.200> genotype

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
yellow smooth and these are the genotype

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.090 
yellow smooth and these are the genotype
and<00:04:49.760> then<00:04:50.760> there's<00:04:51.120> three<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.690> them<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:52.320> are

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
and then there's three of them that are

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.570 
and then there's three of them that are
yellow<00:04:53.670> wrinkle<00:04:54.410> so<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:55.500> have<00:04:55.740> this<00:04:55.950> one<00:04:56.220> and

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
yellow wrinkle so you have this one and

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.330 
yellow wrinkle so you have this one and
this<00:04:56.700> one<00:04:56.760> so<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.360> here<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.200> one<00:04:58.380> here<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.860> total

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
this one so to here and one here a total

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.170 
this one so to here and one here a total
of<00:04:59.640> three<00:05:01.220> then<00:05:02.220> you<00:05:02.340> have<00:05:02.460> three<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.150> are

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
of three then you have three that are

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.170 
of three then you have three that are
purple<00:05:03.720> smooth<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.380> one<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.580> is<00:05:05.610> purple

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
purple smooth and one that is purple

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.980 
purple smooth and one that is purple
wrinkle<00:05:07.820> so<00:05:08.820> this<00:05:09.030> one<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.450> same<00:05:09.660> as<00:05:09.960> the

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
wrinkle so this one is the same as the

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.550 
wrinkle so this one is the same as the
Mendel<00:05:10.590> one<00:05:10.830> that<00:05:10.980> we<00:05:11.100> just<00:05:11.190> did<00:05:11.370> before<00:05:12.560> these

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
Mendel one that we just did before these

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.870 
Mendel one that we just did before these
are<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:14.040> genotype<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:16.400> these<00:05:17.400> are<00:05:17.730> the

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
are the genotype and these are the

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.250 
are the genotype and these are the
phenotype<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:19.470> phenotype<00:05:19.950> is<00:05:20.330> 933<00:05:21.330> one<00:05:21.660> which

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
phenotype the phenotype is 933 one which

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.080 
phenotype the phenotype is 933 one which
is<00:05:22.440> most<00:05:22.710> common<00:05:23.130> when<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.400> crossed<00:05:23.670> two

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
is most common when you crossed two

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.750 
is most common when you crossed two
heterozygous<00:05:24.780> for<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.590> dihybrid<00:05:26.040> cross<00:05:26.400> keep

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
heterozygous for a dihybrid cross keep

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.850 
heterozygous for a dihybrid cross keep
that<00:05:26.880> in<00:05:27.030> mind<00:05:27.210> because<00:05:27.390> you<00:05:28.080> see<00:05:28.410> this<00:05:28.560> very

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
that in mind because you see this very

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.220 
that in mind because you see this very
often<00:05:29.100> and<00:05:29.460> it's<00:05:29.910> most<00:05:30.120> likely<00:05:30.210> is<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.930> most

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
often and it's most likely is the most

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.380 
often and it's most likely is the most
common<00:05:31.620> word<00:05:32.400> problem<00:05:32.850> that<00:05:33.060> your<00:05:33.210> teacher

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
common word problem that your teacher

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:46.980 
common word problem that your teacher
will<00:05:33.510> give<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:36.620> alligator<00:05:40.760> poor<00:05:41.760> alligator

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.090 

so<00:05:47.680> what<00:05:47.830> kind<00:05:48.010> of<00:05:48.070> brands<00:05:48.550> do<00:05:48.700> you<00:05:48.850> wear
