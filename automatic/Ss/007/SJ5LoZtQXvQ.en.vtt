this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.890 

if<00:01:40.230> you<00:01:40.350> need<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.710> make<00:01:41.430> any<00:01:41.870> adjustments<00:01:42.870> to

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.610 
if you need to make any adjustments to
that<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.860> always<00:01:44.520> prefer<00:01:45.230> ripping<00:01:46.230> it<00:01:46.350> as

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
that then I always prefer ripping it as

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.350 
that then I always prefer ripping it as
opposed<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> cutting<00:01:47.400> it<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.060> gives<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
opposed to cutting it so it gives it

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.590 
opposed to cutting it so it gives it
some<00:01:48.600> unevenness<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.740> tips<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.910> body<00:01:51.240> for

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
some unevenness to the tips the body for

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.790

angle<00:02:39.660> when<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.020> wrap<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.400> I'm<00:02:41.460> just<00:02:41.610> gonna

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
angle when I wrap this so I'm just gonna

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:51.410 
angle when I wrap this so I'm just gonna

out any sections of your threads a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.140 
out any sections of your threads a
little<00:02:54.990> heavy<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.260> one<00:02:55.560> area<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:56.100> other<00:02:56.150> if

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
little heavy in one area the other if

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.180 
little heavy in one area the other if
you<00:02:57.240> loosen<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.050> will<00:02:58.230> add<00:02:58.320> more<00:02:58.590> volume<00:02:58.830> a

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
you loosen it it will add more volume a

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.760 
you loosen it it will add more volume a
tight-knit<00:02:59.670> it'll<00:03:00.180> it'll<00:03:01.050> decrease<00:03:01.350> the

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
tight-knit it'll it'll decrease the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.490 
tight-knit it'll it'll decrease the
volume<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.310> some<00:03:02.580> sections<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:04.170> can<00:03:04.320> kind

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
volume in some sections so you can kind

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.120 
volume in some sections so you can kind
of<00:03:04.530> adjust<00:03:04.680> on<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.130> fly<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.980> I'm

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
of adjust on the fly here so I'm

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.730 
of adjust on the fly here so I'm
bringing<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.760> up<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.240> top<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:13.440> then<00:03:13.590> I'll

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
bringing it up to the top and then I'll

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:21.640 
bringing it up to the top and then I'll
just<00:03:13.980> tie<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.340> off<00:03:19.520> couple<00:03:20.520> wraps<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:21.030> top

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
just tie this off couple wraps on top

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.350 
just tie this off couple wraps on top
put<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> couple<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.160> laps<00:03:23.430> underneath<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.270> then

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
put a couple of laps underneath and then

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:37.629 
put a couple of laps underneath and then
I<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.600> just<00:03:24.720> whip<00:03:24.960> finish<00:03:25.290> this

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.330 

trim<00:03:38.639> off<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:39.060> excess<00:03:39.510> thread<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:41.040> I'm<00:03:41.189> gonna

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
trim off the excess thread and I'm gonna

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.879 
trim off the excess thread and I'm gonna
pull<00:03:41.670> this<00:03:41.909> tight<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.139> when<00:03:43.319> I<00:03:43.349> cut<00:03:43.739> it

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
pull this tight so that when I cut it

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.220 
pull this tight so that when I cut it
hopefully<00:03:44.129> that<00:03:44.519> links<00:03:45.510> back<00:03:45.569> underneath

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
hopefully that links back underneath

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.110 
hopefully that links back underneath
where<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.040> could<00:03:47.189> cut<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.430> in<00:03:47.549> advance<00:03:47.670> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
where you could cut it in advance and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.910 
where you could cut it in advance and
then<00:03:48.299> do<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.540> what<00:03:48.689> finishes<00:03:49.079> at<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.230> top<00:03:49.469> I'm

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
then do you what finishes at the top I'm

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.020 
then do you what finishes at the top I'm
just<00:03:49.980> gonna<00:03:50.340> put<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.849> drop<00:03:51.299> of<00:03:51.599> Sally<00:03:52.349> Hansen's

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.229 
just gonna put a drop of Sally Hansen's
hard<00:03:54.030> as<00:03:54.209> nails<00:03:54.260> or<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.290> can<00:03:55.590> use<00:03:55.849> head<00:03:56.849> cement

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
hard as nails or you can use head cement

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.429 
hard as nails or you can use head cement
whatever<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.750> prefer

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
whatever you prefer

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:06.800 
whatever you prefer
just<00:03:58.859> here<00:03:59.099> on<00:03:59.219> the<00:03:59.400> top<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:05.540> I'll<00:04:06.540> just

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
just here on the top and I'll just

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:25.440 
just here on the top and I'll just
smooth<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.379> out

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.990 

and<00:04:25.990> there<00:04:26.170> it<00:04:26.260> is<00:04:26.350> a<00:04:26.410> real<00:04:26.830> easy<00:04:27.070> pattern<00:04:27.700> and

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
and there it is a real easy pattern and

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.380 
and there it is a real easy pattern and
that<00:04:28.360> is<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.870> blood<00:04:29.170> worm
