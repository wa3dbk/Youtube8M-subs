00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
pretty similar and that's fine with me

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.670

because I'm old and I don't like change
there<00:01:07.680> were<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:07.950> fun<00:01:08.340> adventures<00:01:08.909> like

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
there were all fun adventures like

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.679 
there were all fun adventures like
Indiana<00:01:09.689> Jones<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.500> James<00:01:10.799> Bond<00:01:11.130> movies<00:01:11.689> but

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
Indiana Jones and James Bond movies but

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.960 
Indiana Jones and James Bond movies but
I<00:01:12.720> suppose<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.530> some<00:01:13.740> people<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> series<00:01:14.790> was

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
I suppose to some people the series was

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.330 
I suppose to some people the series was
getting<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.570> stale<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.860> since<00:01:17.220> this

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
getting a little stale and since this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.399 
getting a little stale and since this
was<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.610> first<00:01:18.000> game<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.630> PlayStation<00:01:19.380> 2

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
was the first game on the PlayStation 2

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.130 
was the first game on the PlayStation 2
I'm<00:01:20.340> guessing<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.880> core<00:01:21.210> design<00:01:21.600> want<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
I'm guessing that core design want to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.310 
I'm guessing that core design want to
make<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> big<00:01:22.740> splash<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:24.810> decide<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
make a big splash so they decide to

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.100 
make a big splash so they decide to
change<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.040> lot<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.250> things<00:01:27.829> which<00:01:28.829> was<00:01:29.009> stupid

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
change a lot of things which was stupid

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.569 
change a lot of things which was stupid
which<00:01:31.110> leads<00:01:31.350> me<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.829> next<00:01:31.860> item<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.520> my

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
which leads me to the next item on my

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.289 
which leads me to the next item on my
list<00:01:35.000> number<00:01:36.000> two

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299

but<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.290> guess<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.769> kind<00:02:21.069> of<00:02:21.220> understandable

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
but I guess it's kind of understandable

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.259 
but I guess it's kind of understandable
why<00:02:22.330> she's<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:22.810> different<00:02:23.350> now<00:02:24.269> especially

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
why she's so different now especially

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
face at the end of last revelation so I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.750 
face at the end of last revelation so I

my<00:06:52.990> head<00:06:53.610> the<00:06:54.610> thing<00:06:54.790> about<00:06:55.000> these<00:06:55.210> quest

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
my head the thing about these quest

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.260 
my head the thing about these quest
games<00:06:55.930> that<00:06:56.320> sometimes<00:06:56.890> and<00:06:57.610> get<00:06:57.820> a<00:06:57.850> little

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
games that sometimes and get a little

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.580 
games that sometimes and get a little
too<00:06:58.420> complicated

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
too complicated

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.610 
too complicated
bad<00:07:00.520> guys<00:07:00.820> want<00:07:01.210> to<00:07:01.300> do<00:07:01.450> this<00:07:01.750> so<00:07:02.200> they<00:07:02.380> need<00:07:02.590> to

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
bad guys want to do this so they need to

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.190 
bad guys want to do this so they need to
get<00:07:02.860> this<00:07:03.190> so<00:07:03.700> you<00:07:03.760> have<00:07:04.060> to<00:07:04.240> do<00:07:04.360> this<00:07:04.630> before

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.200 
get this so you have to do this before

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.500 
get this so you have to do this before
you<00:07:05.350> can<00:07:05.530> do<00:07:05.680> this<00:07:06.040> so<00:07:06.400> you<00:07:06.460> can<00:07:06.820> do<00:07:06.940> this<00:07:07.210> so

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 
you can do this so you can do this so

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.380 
you can do this so you can do this so
you<00:07:07.570> can<00:07:07.870> achieve<00:07:07.990> this<00:07:08.440> I<00:07:09.210> guess<00:07:10.210> it<00:07:10.360> just

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390 
you can achieve this I guess it just

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.800 
you can achieve this I guess it just
goes<00:07:10.690> with<00:07:10.750> the<00:07:10.990> territory<00:07:11.110> but<00:07:12.300> with<00:07:13.300> so<00:07:13.540> much

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.810 
goes with the territory but with so much

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.190 
goes with the territory but with so much
of<00:07:13.990> the<00:07:14.020> game<00:07:14.230> cut<00:07:14.620> out<00:07:14.830> to<00:07:15.130> me<00:07:15.280> a<00:07:15.310> deadline
