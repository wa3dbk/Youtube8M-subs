00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.790
 So it's like the last chance for the men to be player-coaches 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.689
 Milan Sedivec CES to the league not already out of sight 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:08.869
 to lose 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:12.789
 Accordingly, the hosts started the game and left 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.379
 quickly in the lead 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.039
 Although they could not settle decisively at first as the guests left 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.039
 Mittelfranken with their fast attacking game again and again the connection 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.739
 manufactured 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.449
 Nevertheless, the Mettener showed in the initial phase Helbach and use the 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.329
 Negligence of the angle Haider mercilessly out as here the strong one 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.329
 Philipp Fleischmann einnetzte to 8 to 6 leadership 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.140
 in the meantime, the home side could even pull to 15 to accomplish 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.580
 thanks also to player-trainer she freezes the world of his seven-meter 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.420
 turned 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.650
 and even if the guests at half-time could shorten to 15 to 12 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.870
 Metten was not impressed at the beginning of the second section of it and 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.230
 built the lead again on five goals but suddenly she saw the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.260
 World a break in the game of his team forward this time in a row 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 Great chances 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.310
 and behind you collected unnecessary goals 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.310
 so playful the comfortable leadership and Winkelheide managed 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.310
 actually the 20 to 20 compensation 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.190
 now a highly exciting final phase in the Alexander Bach Meier developed 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.570
 his team took the lead just over a minute from time with 28-27 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.080
 directly in return then but seven meters for the guests keeper Gerd Ã¶zkan 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.720
 Careers but the second attempt is again the compensation for the 28 to 28 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.760
 Andrea Mertens brought Walter Steininger off his feet and here as well 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.500
 seven meters now so the great opportunity for See the Welsh 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.740
 Decide first sand screech and then the ball is in it half a minute 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.770
 before the end that 29 to 28 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.079
 And it remained until the end of huge cheers at the
