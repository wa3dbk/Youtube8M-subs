00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.170
 so that's where all of us are today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.180
 found for a new short video 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.660
 and this time it's sure clash of clan 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.450
 so I will introduce you to my village 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.630
 if it is 1:19 but I have not 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.220
 all access because it's not very 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.609
 very very very long time that I have 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.619
 will say that like that but I managed to 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.170
 see all the buildings to be able to 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.519
 you make this video so the little 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.070
 eat more than read the most east to 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.480
 to see it was the queen 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.860
 because I won to see but 15000 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.510
 dexia north actually at every fire that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.110
 I was like 30 made me sting 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.100
 but a delicate thing is boring but 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.190
 good force by force to attack I 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.800
 managed to see but 48 hours so too 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.210
 little dedication to the uqac that we wanted 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.670
 a way there must not I forget 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.120
 so that's it it's over for the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.219
 signings 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.219
 we will immediately go to the video 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.420
 more so that it ends loads and 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.380
 so that's going to move a little bit these 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:17.430
 standards so a little youtube coucou 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.799
 as usual a little ritual where the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.220
 sand a little as usual to write I 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.229
 Sorry it is true it takes 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.070
 time 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.610
 Norman know to his daughter if all of a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.310
 it's true it's really 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.110
 time I'm really sorry it's 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.950
 when I record when I record 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:43.259
 when I finish it's still doing that 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.340
 why use so here's the room of 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.909
 oyats can normally when the message 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:54.119
 of the game center will appear that should 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.030
 more too much bugged normally to 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.009
 notes takes time to appear 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.549
 yeah so first of all you prove that 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.240
 this village is really a good already I 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.799
 offers you to watch my defenses 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.970
 so at the beginning it's normal I'll have 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.380
 defenses of lost is because I have 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.870
 wanted to change training I indeed 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.260
 one that does not work at all absolutely 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.849
 crack so here it was 3 the bresse 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.590
 with a little bit more I'm still 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.959
 sorry so here are the first three 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.959
 the lost three actually traded it from 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.760
 village and we know how to see them I won 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.380
 all the defenses 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.769
 so some swimmers a barbarous king 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.920
 trip 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.459
 he just wanted and his trophy him 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.430
 appeared there I won all my 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:40.100
 defenses so that's got to get off a 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.780
 little bit here I had to win little 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:49.190
 close I would say 10-15 defense I have not 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.510
 sorry here we are now I tell you 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.430
 introduce him to my village so yeah 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.299
 as I told you I do not have max 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.610
 and great defense neither anything I have anything max 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:01.190
 and apart mine mine but it's a little 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.380
 little since the age of 8 is q max 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.700
 and my reservations obviously apart 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.170
 the reserve and will hold everything 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.780
 first my hdd as I told you 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.799
 at the beginning of the video and level nine names 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.250
 castle of that I found a 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.079
 pretty important element on May 24 from 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.650
 zarko x throw a throw at these galÃ©riens the 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:24.680
 have them too but all my 9 years 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.880
 support all the whole level4 i'm not going 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.920
 delay on the rise elsewhere but who 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.380
 that the vel of which I climbed it spreads 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.700
 howl at two to three days but mortar 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.069
 I am in the process of passing the last 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.060
 level 6 but otherwise all this beautiful May 6 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.609
 exit tour at overpass 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.870
 level-5 for now just in the process of 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.040
 do the first level 5 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.690
 but when I have no both 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.650
 first level 5 but when I will have the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.650
 time that I will do the other two 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:54.410
 then the wizard too the v8 the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.829
 guns on the 29 the military camps of 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.590
 level 7 2 level 6 g not delay I think 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.359
 to climb all 27 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.209
 a level 3 drill a force that train 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.160
 to spend the 24th 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.310
 otherwise they only have what is 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.310
 see 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.299
 the queen level 1 and my king the vsn for 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.359
 the capacity so I had to roughly 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.169
 go around so the kent and leye the 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.910
 anne's case it's not very important 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.310
 it is that she finds that one develops 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.300
 otherwise it has no interest 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.460
 so here we are not you like it is 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.229
 why is it a beautiful village and 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.240
 why I have night all 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.820
 defenses 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:39.590
 so I answer is everything 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.360
 we're just going to say a village 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.020
 already this hyper important I already said 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.120
 in a video 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.340
 but to make a symmetrical village 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.320
 really hyper important you see them 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.650
 two arcs the x that have a long enough 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.310
 scope protects your part and consciously 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.310
 all everything village and the castle of clos 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.850
 with this big wore also protects 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:03.139
 kelly world entirely the village 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.639
 Then the mortars that have cros me 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.180
 wear are put very close to the air 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.330
 central and also protect all 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.330
 town 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.389
 then the old defense canvases 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:21.610
 defend v age and age of lives 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:24.050
 and reserves 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.740
 so I forgot to specify but if a 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.630
 cottage a village neither farming nor really 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.400
 rush is a hybrid village that is to say 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.740
 rock farming frankly this is the mode 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:40.610
 that I prefer her so that's after 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:44.870
 to avoid that level 2 which protects the 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.460
 grapes and but unfortunately the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.720
 tesla in a little door and that makes 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.460
 really bad it's the little flaw 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.800
 and tesla and if not they are really 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.120
 well she attacks relatively quickly and 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.430
 they go the wizard who have a small 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.789
 door and I put them on the sides for 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.500
 protect archers towers in paris 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:04.370
 if you know more place promises to 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:08.599
 journey so the darchy towers submitted to 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.550
 immediate surroundings in first rank to 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.900
 surroundings we see and who protects the 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.020
 small buildings outside 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.020
 battlements 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:22.810
 and they too had up to no turns 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:28.720
 markets center protects this is 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:30.520
 important so so so yeah 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.620
 I think I'm going around a whip 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.980
 these villages entirely just so that 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.800
 if someone wants he wants them 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:42.190
 there is really no problem so 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.690
 so here's the point this break has so 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.340
 here is the video is already over 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.630
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.940
 it's been a long time since I've done 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.560
 earlier I started again so here we go 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.680
 tell me if you liked it 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.580
 and all do not hesitate to like how he 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.210
 was really pleased 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.210
 bye
